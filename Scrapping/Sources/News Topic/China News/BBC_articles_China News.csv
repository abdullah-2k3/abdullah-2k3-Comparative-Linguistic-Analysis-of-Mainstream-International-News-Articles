Christopher Berry, 32, and Christopher Cash, a 29-year-old former parliamentary researcher, have been charged under the Official Secrets Act. Mr Cash, from Whitechapel, east London, and Mr Berry, of Witney, Oxfordshire, are alleged to have ""for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state, obtained, collected, recorded, published or communicated to any other person articles, notes, documents or information which were calculated to be, might be, or were intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy"". Beijing has previously called the allegations ""malicious slander"". The prosecution says the alleged spying took place between between 28 December 2021 and 3 February 2023. The Sunday Times previously reported that Mr Cash had access to Conservative leadership candidate Tom Tugendhat and the former foreign affairs committee chairwoman Alicia Kearns, among others. A further case management hearing will be scheduled in January or February next year.  That will come ahead of a trial, which is expected to last between five and seven weeks, at Woolwich Crown Court.  A provisional date of 6 October next year has been set for the trial. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8jz39xl19o,China hits back at EU with brandy tax,The tax on brandy imports is being seen by critics as a retaliatory move for recent EU tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars.,7 days ago,2024-10-15 10:31:11.226971,China News,BBC,China,"China has imposed taxes on imports of European brandy in a move that France has said is retaliation for recent big tariffs the EU announced on Chinese electric vehicles. The European Commission said it would challenge China's tax at the World Trade Organization (WTO), calling it an ""abuse"" of trade defence measures. But China said the move was an ""anti-dumping"" measure that would protect its domestic producers.  French brandy producers said the duties, which will hit big brands including Hennessy and Remy Martin, would be ""catastrophic"" for the industry. Shares in brandy companies dropped after the announcement. China announced new restrictions on European brandy just days after EU countries approved steep tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. China's commerce ministry said brandy imports threaten ""substantial damage"" to its own producers. Importers will have to pay ""security deposits"" on European brandy. China is also considering new tariffs on other EU imports including cars, pork, and dairy. It has said EU tariffs on its electric vehicles are a breach of global trade rules. French Trade Minister Sophie Primas said the brandy tax ""seems to be a retaliatory measure"" after the European Union decision to raise tariffs on Chinese electric cars. She said that kind of retaliation would be ""unacceptable"", and a ""total contradiction"" of international trade rules, adding that France would work with the European Union to take action at the WTO. France accounts for 99% of brandy exported to China, and French cognac lobby group BNIC said the move would be ""catastrophic"" for the industry. ""The French authorities cannot abandon us and leave us alone to deal with Chinese retaliation that has nothing to do with us,"" BNIC said, adding that the taxes ""must be suspended before it's too late"". Shares in companies that sell spirits took a battering after the Chinese announcement. Luxury firm LVMH, which produces Hennessy, fell more than 3%, while Remy Cointreau, which makes Remy Martin, fell more than 8%. Analysts at Jefferies estimate that the tariffs could translate into a 20% price increase for consumers, which would probably lead to volumes and supplier sales falling by a fifth. Shares in German carmakers, which could also be hit by tariff moves from China, also slid. Volkswagen, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz and BMW were all down after the announcement."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjrplrvpvpo,China detains iPhone maker workers in 'strange' case,"The Taiwanese government suggested the detentions may be a case of ""abuse of power"" by Chinese police.",4 days ago,2024-10-15 10:31:11.309471,China News,BBC,China,"Chinese police have detained four workers of the Taiwanese iPhone maker, Foxconn, in circumstances Taipei has described as ""strange"". The employees were arrested in Zhengzhou in Henan province on ""breach of trust"" charges, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement. The BBC has contacted Foxconn for comment. The company is the biggest maker of iPhones for US technology giant Apple and is one of the largest employers in the world, with major manufacturing facilities in China. Taiwanese authorities suggested the detentions may be a case of ""abuse of power"" by Chinese police officers and said the case undermines the confidence of businesses operating in China. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said they were not aware of the matter. In October last year, China's tax and land authorities launched an investigation into the company. At that time, Foxconn's founder Terry Gou was running as an independent candidate in Taiwan's presidential election. Taiwan has urged its citizens to ""avoid non-essential travel"" to the mainland as well as Hong Kong and Macau after China unveiled guidelines in June detailing criminal punishments for what Beijing described as diehard ""Taiwan independence"" separatists. Foxconn's facility in Zhengzhou is the world's largest iPhone factory which is widely known as ""iPhone City"". Despite a long-standing geopolitical rift between Beijing and Taipei, Foxconn is among many Taiwanese businesses that have built factories in China. Beijing sees the island as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgd4yn45qlo,China 'punishes' Taiwan president remarks with new drills,Beijing says the exercise involved all parts of the military and simulates a full-scale attack on its neighbour.,19 hrs ago,2024-10-15 10:31:11.413047,China News,BBC,China,"China on Monday launched new military drills off the coast of Taiwan in what it described as ""punishment"" for a speech given by its president William Lai, when he vowed to ""resist annexation"" or ""encroachment upon our sovereignty"". China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and its president Xi Jinping has vowed to retake it by force if necessary.  Taiwan said it detected 34 naval vessels and 125 aircraft in formation around the island on Monday. Maps published by Chinese state media indicated its forces were positioned around the whole island. It said later that the drills had been successfully concluded.  The Chinese military, known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) said the drills involved all wings of the army and were designed to simulate attacking Taiwan by land, sea and air. Senior Captain Li Xi, spokesperson of the PLA Eastern Theater Command said the drills ""fully tested the integrated joint operation capabilities"" of its troops. Taiwan's airports and ports continued functioning as normal. An earlier statement from the Taiwanese defence ministry condemned the Chinese move and said its priority was to avoid direct clashes which could escalate the stand-off further. Outlying islands were put on high alert, it added.  China's foreign ministry confirmed it had simulated military assaults and port blockades, and described Taiwanese independence as being ""incompatible"" with peace in the region. A post by the Chinese coast guard on its Weibo account later depicted the route of the patrol in the shape of a heart.  China has held several major military drills off the coast of Taiwan since 2022 and its fighter jets regularly enter Taiwanese airspace.  The latest exercise has been dubbed Joint Sword 2024-B by Beijing and had been widely expected since May, when drills bearing the same name and officially labelled as part A were staged. That exercise, which China described as its largest yet, were timed to coincide with the inauguration of President Lai, who Beijing has long seen as a ""troublemaker"" advocating for Taiwan's independence.  His latest comments, made on Taiwan's national day, were condemned by China, which said he was escalating tensions with ""sinister intentions"".  But while these drills were widely expected, the deployment and how close Chinese ships and aircraft were to Taiwan - as well as the fiery rhetoric - could be seen as very aggressive behaviour. In any other context, it would have been seen as a dramatic escalation - but it came against the backdrop of tensions that were already very high. The US reacted by saying that there was no justification for the drills after Lai's ""routine"" speech, and that China should avoid further actions which may jeopardise peace and stability in the region. The recent history of China’s military intimidation of Taiwan goes back to 1996, after Taiwan held its first direct presidential elections. China declared several areas around Taiwan off limits, and fired short-range ballistic missiles into those areas off the north and south coasts.  US President Bill Clinton quietly moved US Navy forces into the Taiwan strait to demonstrate to Beijing that the US would prevent an attack on the island. Tensions eased considerably between 2008 and 2016 - until the leader of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen was elected as president. China considers the DPP to be a hard line pro-independence party, and responded by cutting off all direct contacts with the government in Taipei. That situation has remained ever since. In August 2022 US house speaker Nancy Pelosi flew into Taipei – the first time a sitting house speaker had visited the island since 1997. Pelosi’s visit and her open support for Taiwan was seen by Beijing as a huge provocation – coming close to a formal recognition of the government here by a very senior US politician. It reacted with fury – holding two days of exercises and for the first time ever flying ballistic missiles over the island and in to the Pacific Ocean."

Shares had jumped by over 10% as trading restarted after the Golden Week holiday but fell back after a news conference by the country's economic planners. After a volatile day of trading, the Shanghai Composite Index in mainland China closed 4.6% higher, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slumped by 9.4%. Investors had been hoping for more information about how the government plans to support economic growth but the announcement gave little in the way of details. The chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission Zheng Shanjie said he is ""fully confident"" the country will achieve its full-year economic and social goals. But he added: ""The downward pressures on China's economy is also increasing"". Mr Zheng's comments came as he announced that China will issue 200 billion yuan ($28bn; £21.5bn) for spending and investment projects by the end of this year. ""The market really expected more. The correction will be even stronger if the data on the Golden Week in terms of consumption is weak,"" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis. ""The market is reacting to the lack of a real fiscal stimulus. I would not have organised a press conference not to announce anything new.""  The Chinese government has been trying to boost confidence in the world's second largest economy as concerns increase that it may miss its own 5% annual growth target. Investors have been pouring into Chinese stocks since officials began rolling out a raft of measures aimed at boosting the economy. The plans included help for the country's crisis-hit property industry, support for the stock market, cash handouts for the poor and more government spending. But some economists have questioned whether the policies will be enough to fix China's economic problems. They say deep reforms might be needed in order to set the country on a more sustainable growth path. Growth has been slowing in the world's second largest economy as it continues to face a property market slump, falling prices and other challenges."

The 20-year-old American dug deep to come through 4-6 6-4 6-2. Spaniard Badosa, ranked 19th in the world but a former world number two, had looked in a good position when she served at 4-3 up in the second set. But Gauff broke and rattled off the next four games to set up a decider, eventually wrapping up victory in two hours and 21 minutes. She will face Karolina Muchova in Sunday's decider after the Czech player defeated home favourite and fifth seed Qinwen Zheng 6-3 6-4. Zheng, the Olympic champion, needed medical treatment for a hand injury after taking a tumble during the opening set. Although both players had their opportunities, it was Muchova, who reached last year's French Open final but is now ranked 49 in the world after wrist surgery, who took advantage. The win saw her avenge defeat by Zheng in the final in Palermo in July and reach a second career WTA 1000 final after Cincinnati last year, where she lost to Gauff. Badosa, who was as low as 140th in the rankings in May, was on a good run of form in Beijing which included victory over second seed and US Open finalist Jessica Pegula in the last 16. And she took advantage of Gauff's inconsistencies, particularly on her serve which produced 11 double faults, to win the opening set and break in the first game of the second. Gauff is working with new coach Matt Daly after ending her partnership with Brad Gilbert last month following her fourth-round exit at the US Open, where she was defending her title. She saved four break points to avoid going 4-1 down in the second set and from then the momentum was with the American, who regained her composure as Badosa dropped her first set of the week. Gauff broke three times in the decider to seal the win to reach her first final since she triumphed in Auckland in January. ""I tried to stay focused, it was tough but mentally I just tried to reset,"" she said. Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone"

Fourth seed Gauff lost the first set of the quarter-final on Thursday but fought back to beat the Ukrainian qualifier 2-6 6-2 6-2. The American - ranked sixth in the world - has had a difficult year having failed to reach a Grand Slam final and losing in the third round of the Paris Olympics. Gauff, 20, will face 15th seed Paula Badosa in Saturday's semi-final for a spot in her first final since winning in Auckland in January. Badosa reached the last four by defeating China's Zhang Shuai in straight sets. The Spaniard saw off the wildcard 6-1 7-6 (7-4) in one hour 23 minutes, although she had to fight back from 1-3 down in the second set. Badosa was ranked 140 in the world earlier this year, but has risen to 19th after 28 wins in 35 matches since May. The remaining quarter-finals will take place on Friday with top seed Aryna Sabalenka facing Karolina Muchova, and Mirra Andreeva taking on fifth seed Qinwen Zheng.

Alcaraz, 21, continued his fine run of form against the Italian and has now won each of their last three encounters after coming through 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 7-6 (7-3). It is the Spaniard's fourth ATP Tour title this year and 16th of his career. ""Jannik once again showed he's the best player in the world, he's unbelievable and plays such a high level of tennis,"" Alcaraz said. ""I had my chances in the first set and didn't take it. In general, I'm proud of the way I dealt with the match and managed everything. ""I never lose hope but I know he has great stats. I knew I had to give everything I had to give myself the opportunity."" Elsewhere, Great Britain's Dan Evans was knocked out in the first round at the Shanghai Masters, having come through qualifying. Evans, 34, forced a deciding set, which he led 4-2, but eventually lost out in a tie-break against Brazil's Thiago Seyboth Wild, who won 6-2 4-6 7-6 (7-3) to set up a meeting with Russian world number five Daniil Medvedev. Since suffering a shock second-round exit at the US Open, Alcaraz has bounced back to win nine matches in a row, including helping Team Europe win the Laver Cup last month. Alcaraz appeared to be on track for the perfect start when he moved into a 5-2 lead in the opening set, however, Sinner saved two set points to force a tie-break, which he went on to win. The pivotal moment in the second arrived in the ninth game, when Alcaraz seized his opportunity to secure a break before serving out for the set to take it to a decider. There has been little to separate the pair in the early stages of their careers, with their head-to-head record now 6-4 in Alcaraz's favour, and it was another fine example of what the future of tennis has to offer in Beijing. Sinner has made a habit of winning big games over the course of 2024, prevailing in all six of his previous finals - including the Australian Open and US Open - and he found an extra gear to mount another fightback in the final set. Trailing 4-2 in the third, Sinner won three successive games to wrestle back momentum and send the encounter to a match-deciding tie-break. Sinner looked firmly in control after opening up a 3-0 advantage, but Alcaraz would not be denied. He rattled off seven successive points to claim victory and make it three wins on the bounce against the two-time Grand Slam champion. ""During the whole week I've been playing great tennis, some luck went to my side but I felt great on the court too,"" Alcaraz said.

The 23-year-old returned positive for low levels of a metabolite of clostebol - a steroid that can be used to build muscle mass - during Indian Wells. Wada said last month's ruling by an independent tribunal to find Sinner had no fault or negligence was ""not correct under the applicable rules"". It has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) and said the player should be banned for ""between one and two years"". Sinner's defence said he was inadvertently contaminated by the banned substance by his physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi, and when Wada's decision was announced, Sinner said he was ""surprised"" by the decision to appeal.

The match was level at one set all when Osaka, who appeared to be struggling throughout, had to withdraw because of a lower back injury. ""It was a good match up to this point,"" Gauff said. ""I wish Naomi a speedy recovery. Nobody wants to win a match like this, especially at one set all."" Four-time Grand Slam champion Osaka had to call for the physio during the first set but battled through, breaking Gauff for a third time before serving out to take it 6-3. But American Gauff, who won her first major at last year's US Open, hit back and broke at the first opportunity in the second. Osaka responded immediately and even earned a break advantage, only for Gauff to come storming back and break twice in winning three straight games to secure a fiercely contested set 6-4. There was to be no deciding set as Osaka had to retire but there was a moment of great sportsmanship at the end as Gauff carried her ailing opponent's bag off court for her. Gauff will face Ukraine's Yulia Starodubtsewa in the last eight. Paula Badosa is seeded 15th at the China Open US Open finalist Jessica Pegula is out after a last-16 defeat by Spain's Paula Badosa. The American world number three, seeded second in Beijing, lost 6-4 6-0 in just over an hour. An early break saw Badosa go 3-1 down in the opening set, but the Spaniard won 11 of the next 12 games - including eight in a row - to secure her first win over a top-five player since 2022. ""She's one the of the players I never want to face,"" said world number 19 Badosa.  ""She's very solid, hits very flat, changes direction very well, so I knew it was going to be tough.

She will meet Zhang Shuai in the quarter-finals after the world number 595 continued her remarkable run at the tournament with a 6-4 6-2 win over Poland's Magdalena Frech. Zhang went into her home event on the back of 24 successive defeats spanning more than 600 days, the second-longest run on the WTA Tour in the open era, which began in 1968 when professionals were finally allowed to play in Grand Slam tournaments. The two-time Grand Slam quarter-finalist, whose career has been plagued by injuries, is also the lowest-ranked player to ever compete in the main draw of the China Open - a WTA 1000 event.

The American fourth seed had struggled with her serve earlier in the week and was forced to battle back from a set down in her three previous matches en route to her first final since winning in Auckland at the start of the year. But the 2023 US Open champion showed little sign of that fragility as she claimed a 6-1 6-3 win in one hour and 17 minutes. Gauff jokingly put her improved form down to a visit to Beijing's Forbidden City with men's winner Carlos Alcaraz. ""I guess the Imperial Palace brought us luck, so maybe I will pay a visit next year to get the same luck,"" she told an appreciative Chinese audience. There was nothing lucky about the way the 20-year-old star rattled through the opening set in just 30 minutes, harrying her opponent into a series of unforced errors to claim two breaks of serve. World number 49 Muchova, who was ranked as high as eighth before a lengthy lay-off with a wrist injury picked up at the 2023 US Open, had beaten top seed Aryna Sabalenka and Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen in previous rounds but was unable to match Gauff's power and athleticism. The 28-year-old had lost her two previous matches against the young American, including the final of last year's Cincinnati Open, and suffered defeats in four of her previous five WTA finals.  However, Muchova started the second set more positively, opening a 2-0 lead after Gauff's problems with her serve briefly resurfaced as she sent down two double faults to hand her opponent the early break.  But Gauff broke back immediately to start a run of four consecutive games.  Muchova eventually gifted her opponent victory by firing a backhand long with her 24th unforced error which, when compared to Gauff's 24 winners, told the story of the match. ""I want to say congratulations to you, Karolina, it's great to see you back on tour,"" said Gauff in her post-match interview. ""I think you're such an amazing player - you deserve everything and hopefully you play many more finals."" Gauff also thanked her new coach Matt Daly, adding that ""obviously things are going well"", after winning her first tournament under his guidance. She ended her partnership with Brad Gilbert last month following her fourth-round exit at the US Open, where she failed to defend her crown.  Victory in the WTA 1,000 event in Beijing moved Gauff up to fourth place in the Race to the Finals, with the top seven qualifying for the season-ending tournament in Riyadh in November.

Muchova will face China's Qinwen Zheng in the last four after she came from a set down to beat Russia's Mirra Andreeva 5-7 6-0 6-4. The Czech has won her past three matches against world number two Sabalenka, who was attempting to make it 16 wins on the bounce. ""Tennis is really a rollercoaster,"" Muchova said.  ""I had to fight for every ball and, in the end, it was worth it. ""I'll try to recover as best as possible, I don't have a day off [before the semi-final], and I'll wait to see who my opponent is."" Swiatek splits with coach Wiktorowski Muchova had to defend five break points to come through the first set but was overpowered in the second. Sabalenka then broke in the opening game of the third set, but world number 49 Muchova refused to allow the three-time Grand Slam champion out of sight. Belarusian Sabalenka had not been beaten since 10 August, winning the Cincinnati Open and US Open, external during that period, but it was Muchova who found an extra gear to win four games in a row and take a step closer to her first WTA title of the year. In Friday's other quarter-final, Zheng executed a remarkable turnaround to defeat Russia's Andreeva. World number 22 Andreeva won the first four games of the opener, but lost the following five and had to wrap up the set via a tie-break. Zheng, who won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics, had a renewed energy when the second set began - recording a bagel to level the match.

The organisation posted messages on its social media accounts in Mandarin, Farsi and Korean on Wednesday, instructing users how to contact it securely. This latest effort follows a campaign to enlist Russians in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, which the CIA says was a success. ""We want to make sure individuals in other authoritarian regimes know that we're open for business,"" a CIA spokesman said in a statement. The recruitment messages - which were placed on platforms such as X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram and LinkedIn, as well as on the dark web - asked for individuals' names, locations and contact details. Detailed instructions advised users to contact the CIA via its official website using trusted encrypted Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or an anonymous web browser known as the Tor network, which is often used to access the dark web. ""I can't remember any sort of recruitment effort like this, using YouTube or social media in this way, at least in Korean,"" said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. ""It seems like they're basing this off the success they had in Russia - but I would question how effective this will be considering most North Koreans don't have access to the internet,"" he told the BBC. Professor Richey suggested that the United States may be targeting North Korean traders who informally cross the border with China and might be able to access VPN networks. US intelligence considers North Korea, Iran and China ""hard targets"" when it comes to intelligence gathering, given the harsh level of surveillance all countries employ to stamp out dissent. ""This effort represents just one way in which CIA is adapting to a new global environment of increased state repression and global surveillance,"" the spy agency's statement continued. But Professor Richey questioned the value of any intelligence that the campaign might be able to gather. ""I suppose you have to assume the CIA knows what it's doing, but you do wonder how many of these discontented people are close enough to power and close enough to the places where important decisions are made,"" he said. ""It does, at the very least though, throw some sand in the gears of these counter-intelligence operations,"" he added. American intelligence chiefs, encouraged by efforts in Russia, are nonetheless confident they will reach enough dissatisfied citizens who are willing to contact them with potentially useful information. ""There are plenty of people who have access to information and who are disaffected from the Xi regime in China,"" CIA Deputy Director David Cohen told Bloomberg. ""You’ve got people inside who... for lots of different motivations fundamentally do not like the direction that Xi is taking the country and understand that there’s a path to helping their own country by working with us,"" he added. Liu Pengyu, a Chinese embassy spokesman, said the US was waging ""an organised and systematic"" disinformation campaign against China. ""Any attempts to drive a wedge between the Chinese people and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or to weaken their close bond will inevitably fail,"" Mr Liu said in a statement. In rolling out a campaign of this scale across different countries, Dr Richey said the United States was giving a good indication of how it sees its national security challenges.  ""The US is now convinced that it's in not just a series of bilateral confrontations with China and Russia and Iran and North Korea - but rather, it's in a confrontation with an emerging bloc,"" said Professor Richey.  ""Which obviously recalls a sense of the Cold War."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20pxwwqqzwo,China probes Calvin Klein over Xinjiang cotton,Beijing says it suspects US brands are discriminating against Chinese cotton after allegations of forced labour.,25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:17.300081,China News,BBC,China,"China has announced it is investigating the company that owns US fashion brands Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein for suspected ""discriminatory measures"" against Xinjiang cotton companies. The move marks a new effort by Beijing to fight back against allegations from western officials and human rights activists that cotton and other goods in the region have been produced using forced labour from the Uyghur ethnic group.  The US banned imports from the area in 2021, citing those concerns.   China's Ministry of Commerce accused the firm of ""boycotting Xinjiang cotton and other products without any factual basis"". PVH, which owns the two brands and has a significant presence in China as well as the US, said it was in contact with Chinese authorities. It has 30 days to respond to officials, at which point it could be added to the country's ""unreliable entities"" list, raising the prospect of further punishment. ""As a matter of company policy, PVH maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in all countries and regions in which we operate,"" the company said. ""We are in communication with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and will respond in accordance with the relevant regulations."" On Wednesday, a Chinese Ministry of Commerce official denied that the probe was linked to US plans to ban certain Chinese electric vehicle technology. ""China has always handled the issue of the unreliable entity list prudently, targeting only a very small number of foreign entities that undermine market rules and violate Chinese laws,"" they said.  ""Honest and law-abiding foreign entities have nothing to worry about."" Cullen Hendrix, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said it was not clear exactly what prompted the investigation into PVH now.  But he said the announcement was likely to hurt the firm's reputation among Chinese shoppers - and send a wider warning to global firms of the risks of simply bowing to western concerns.  ""China is, to a certain extent, flexing its muscle and reminding, not necessarily western governments, but western firms... that actions have consequences,"" he said.  ""This same kind of naming-and-shaming tactic, that human rights organisations in the west have used, can be weaponised here."" The investigation of PVH comes as tensions between China and the west have been growing on a range of issues, including electric cars and manufacturing.  On Monday, the US proposed rules to ban the use of certain technology in Chinese and Russian cars, citing security threats. China has previously put US firms on its unreliable entities list, which it created as trade tensions heated up between Beijing and Washington.  Those firms were major defence contractors, such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, over their business in Taiwan.  Mr Hendrix said the decision to target PVH - a consumer-facing firm with a clearly recognisable US brand -  showed the two countries' disputes were widening beyond areas such as defence and advanced technologies. ""These things have a way of spilling over,"" he said. ""It's affecting a growing number of supply chains across different sectors of the economy."" In its annual report, PVH warned investors of revenue and reputational risks stemming from the fight over Xinjiang. It noted that the issue had been ""subject to significant scrutiny and contention in China, the United States and elsewhere, resulting in criticism against multinational companies, including us"". The company was named in a 2020 report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute that identified dozens of firms that were allegedly benefiting from labour abuses in Xinjiang.  At the time PVH said it took the reports seriously and would continue to work to address the matter.  PVH employs more than 29,000 people globally and does more than 65% of its sales outside of the US.  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2k42n54kvo,Does China now have a permanent military base in Cambodia?,Satellite images show the steady expansion of naval facilities that have international onlookers worried.,7 days ago,2024-10-15 10:31:17.391505,China News,BBC,China,"Two grey shapes, visible from satellites for most of this year at Cambodia’s Ream naval base, seem to confirm growing fears in Washington: that China is expanding its military footprint, beyond the three disputed islands in the South China Sea which it has already seized and fortified. The shapes are type 056A corvettes of the Chinese navy - 1,500-tonne warships - and they have been berthed alongside a new, Chinese-built pier that is big enough to accommodate much larger vessels. Onshore there are other facilities, also built by China, which are presumed to be for the use of the Chinese navy. The Cambodian government has repeatedly denied such a possibility, citing its constitution which bans any permanent foreign military presence, and stating that Ream is open to use by all friendly navies. ""Please understand this is a Cambodian, not a Chinese base,"" said Seun Sam, a Policy Analyst at the Royal Academy of Cambodia. ""Cambodia is very small, and our military capacities are limited.  ""We need more training from outside friends, especially from China."" Others, however, are watching with suspicion. For all the talk about the rapid rise of Chinese sea power - the country now has more ships in its navy than the US - China currently has only one overseas military base, in the African state of Djibouti, which it built in 2016. The United States, by contrast, has around 750 - one also in Djibouti, and many others in countries close to China like Japan and South Korea. The US believes the imbalance is changing, however, because of China’s stated ambition to be a global military power. That, and the scale of its investments in overseas infrastructure through the Belt and Road Initiative, which under Chinese law must be built to military standards.  Some in Washington predict that China will eventually have a global network of bases, or civilian ports that it can use as bases. And one of the first of these is Ream. Until a few years ago, Ream - which sits on Cambodia's southern tip - was being upgraded with US assistance; part of the tens of millions of dollars' worth of yearly military aid provided to Cambodia. But the US cut back this aid after 2017, when Cambodia's main opposition party was banned and its leaders exiled or jailed. Already increasingly dependent on Chinese aid and investment, the Cambodian government abruptly switched partners. It cancelled the regular joint military exercises held with the US, and switched to the so-called Golden Dragon exercises it now holds with China. By 2020, two US-funded buildings in Ream had been torn down and an extensive, Chinese-funded expansion of the facilities there had begun. By the end of last year the new pier had been built. It was almost identical to the 363 metre-long pier at the base in Djibouti, and long enough to accommodate China’s largest aircraft carrier. Soon the two corvettes were docked at Ream - and either they, or identical replacements, have stayed there for most of this year. Cambodia claims the ships are for training, and to prepare for this year’s Golden Dragon exercises. It also says China is constructing two new 056A corvettes for its own navy, and insists that the Chinese presence in Ream is not permanent, so does not count as a base. That has not stopped US officials from expressing their concern over the expansion of the site, though, which satellite photographs show has, in addition to the new pier, a new dry dock, warehouses, and what look like administrative offices and living quarters with four basketball courts. In 2019 the Wall Street Journal reported on what it said was a leaked agreement between Cambodia and China to lease 77 hectares of the base for 30 years. This allegedly included the stationing of military personnel and weapons. The Cambodian government dismissed the report as fake news - but it is noteworthy that only Chinese warships have so far been allowed to dock at the new pier. Two Japanese destroyers visiting in February were instead told to dock at the nearby town of Sihanoukville. Even if the Chinese presence does start to become more permanent and exclusive, however, some analysts doubt it would violate Cambodia’s constitution. It is technically true that Ream is not a permanent base. And while its expansion is Chinese-funded, the base itself is not leased to China, said Kirsten Gunness, a Senior Policy Researcher at the California-based Rand Corporation. “We are seeing a pattern of Chinese ships being continuously docked [at Ream],"" she said. ""One way to get around the constitutional prohibition is not to call it a foreign base, but allow foreign forces continuous access on a rotational basis."" The US and the Philippines operate under similar agreements, Gunness added. Most analysts believe a long-term Chinese presence at Ream would offer very few real advantages to China. They point to the three bases it has already built on Mischief, Fiery Cross and Subi Reefs in the South China Sea, and the formidable naval forces it maintains on its south coast. But a Chinese base in Ream, at the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand, does worry Cambodia’s neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam. Together with other bases further north, it could be seen as an attempt by China to encircle the long Vietnamese coast. Like the Philippines, Vietnam disputes China’s claim to almost all the islands in the South China Sea, and its forces have clashed with China’s in the past. Thai national security officials have also privately expressed alarm at the thought of a Chinese base just south of the Thai navy’s main port in Sattahip, covering their exit from the Gulf of Thailand. Thailand and Cambodia still have unresolved territorial disputes, after all. Neither country is likely to voice these complaints publicly, though. Thailand will want to avoid causing ripples in its economically vital relationship with China, while Vietnam will want to avoid stirring up anti-Vietnamese sentiment in Cambodia. Public resentment of China in Vietnam, where such feelings are never far from the surface, is also something the Vietnamese government will want to steer clear of. US and Indian strategists, meanwhile, are more concerned about the future possibility of a Chinese base in the Indian Ocean – like the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota, which a Chinese state-owned company acquired a 99-year lease for in 2017, or the port of Gwadar in Pakistan, which has also been redeveloped with Chinese funding. But these are still very distant prospects. Few analysts believe China will be able to rival the global military reach of the US for many more years. ""The Ream base does not add much in the way of power projection - it doesn’t get the Chinese navy any closer to places it wants to go,"" said Greg Poling, director of the CSIS Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. What it could do is make a big difference in gathering intelligence, tracking satellites and detecting or monitoring long-range targets. ""These are not necessarily the best options for China,"" Mr Poling added. ""But they are the only ones on offer."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dvrxg8mllo,"As communist China turns 75, can Xi fix its economy?",Plans announced by officials sparked a stock market rally but economists are unsure it is enough.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:17.572932,China News,BBC,China,"As China prepared to celebrate its Golden Week holiday and mark the 75th anniversary of the People’s Republic, the ruling Communist Party rolled out a raft of measures aimed at boosting its ailing economy. The plans included help for the country's crisis-hit property industry, support for the stock market, cash handouts for the poor and more government spending. Shares in mainland China and Hong Kong chalked up record gains after the announcements. But economists warn the policies may not be enough to fix China's economic problems. Some of the measures announced by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on 24 September took direct aim at the country's beaten-down stock market. The new tools included funding worth 800bn yuan ($114bn; £85.6bn) that can be borrowed by insurers, brokers and asset managers to buy shares. PBOC governor, Pan Gongsheng, also said the central bank would offer support to listed companies that want to buy back their own shares and announced plans to lower borrowing costs, and allow banks to increase their lending. Just two days after the PBOC's announcement, President Xi Jinping chaired a surprise economy-focused meeting of the country's top leaders, known as the Politburo. Officials promised to intensify government spending aimed to support the economy. On Monday, the day before China headed off for a weeklong holiday, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index jumped by more than 8%, in its best day since the 2008 global financial crisis. The move capped off a five-day rally that saw the index jump by 20%. The following day, with financial markets closed on the mainland, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose by over 6%. ""Investors loved the announcements"", China analyst, Bill Bishop said. While investors may have been popping champagne corks, Xi has deeper issues to tackle. The People's Republic marking its 75th anniversary means it has been in existence longer than the only other major communist state, the Soviet Union, which collapsed 74 years after it was founded. ""Avoiding the fate of the Soviet Union has long been a key concern for China's leaders,"" said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. At the forefront of officials' minds will be boosting confidence in the broader economy amid growing concerns that it may miss its own 5% annual growth target. ""In China targets must be met, by any means necessary,"" said Yuen Yuen Ang, professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University. ""The leadership worries that failing to meet them in 2024 will worsen a downward spiral of slow growth and low confidence."" One of the main drags on the world's second-largest economy has been the downturn in the country's property market, which began three years ago.  Aside from policies aimed at boosting stocks, the recently unveiled stimulus package also targeted the real estate industry. It includes measures to increase bank lending, mortgage rate cuts and lower minimum down payments for second-home buyers. But there is scepticism that such moves are enough to shore up the housing market. ""Those measures are welcome but unlikely to shift the needle much in isolation,"" said Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's Analytics. ""China’s weakness stems from a crisis of confidence, not one of credit; firms and families don’t want to borrow, regardless of how cheap it is to do so."" At the Politburo session, China’s top leaders vowed to go beyond interest rate cuts and tap government funds to boost economic growth.  However, other than setting priorities like stabilising the property market, supporting consumption and boosting employment, the officials offered little in the way of details about the size and scope of government spending. ""Should the fiscal stimulus fall short of market expectations, investors could be disappointed,"" warned Qian Wang, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at Vanguard. ""In addition, cyclical policy stimulus does not fix the structural problems,"" Ms Wang noted, suggesting that without deeper reforms the challenges China's economy faces will not go away. Economists see tackling entrenched issues in the real estate market as key to fixing the broader economy. Property is the biggest investment most families will make and falling house prices have helped to undermine consumer confidence. ""Ensuring the delivery of pre-sold but unfinished homes would be key,"" said a note from Sophie Altermatt, an economist with Julius Baer. ""In order to increase domestic consumption on a sustainable basis, fiscal support for household incomes needs to go beyond one-off transfers and rather come through improved pension and social security systems."" On the day of the 75th anniversary, an editorial in the state-controlled newspaper, People's Daily, struck an optimistic tone, recognising that ""while the journey ahead remains challenging, the future is promising"". According to the article, concepts created by President Xi such as ""high-quality development"" and ""new productive forces"" are key to unlocking that path to a better future.  The emphasis on those ideas reflects Xi's push to switch from the fast drivers of growth in the past, such as property and infrastructure investment, while trying to develop a more balanced economy based on high-end industries. The challenge China faces, according to Ms Ang, is that the ""old and the new economies are deeply intertwined; if the old economy falters too quickly, it will inevitably hinder the rise of the new"". ""This is what the leadership has come to realise and is responding to."""

People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng announced plans to lower borrowing costs and allow banks to increase their lending. The move comes after a series of disappointing data has increased expectations in recent months that the world's second largest economy will miss its own 5% growth target this year. Stock markets in Asia jumped after Mr Pan's announcement. Speaking at a rare news conference alongside officials from two other financial regulators, Mr Pan said the central bank would cut the amount of cash banks have to hold in reserve - known as reserve requirement ratios (RRR). The RRR will initially be cut by half a percentage point, in a move expected to free up about 1 trillion yuan ($142bn; £106bn). Mr Pan added that another cut may be made later in the year. Further measures aimed to boost China's crisis-hit property market include cutting interest rates for existing mortgages and lowering minimum down payments on all types of homes to 15%. The country's real estate industry has been struggling with a sharp downturn since 2021. Several developers have collapsed, leaving large numbers of unsold homes and unfinished building projects. The PBOC's new economic stimulus measures come just days after the US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the first time in more than four years with a bigger than usual cut. The plans also included measures to help support the stock market. The news pushed up share prices, with the leading stock indexes in Shanghai and Hong Kong ending the day more than 4% higher."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly20n4d0g9o,EU hits China with big taxes in electric car sales battle,The vote risks sparking a trade war as the EU looks to protect its own car makers.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:26.231314,China News,BBC,China,"Big taxes will be imposed on imports of electric vehicles from China to the EU after the majority of member states backed the plans. The move to introduce tariffs aims to protect the European car industry from being undermined by what EU politicians believe are unfair Chinese-state subsidies on its own cars. Tariffs on electric cars made in China are set to rise from 10% to up to 45% for the next five years, but there have been concerns such a move could raise electric vehicle (EV) prices for buyers. The decision, which split EU member states such as France and Germany, risks sparking a trade war between Brussels and Beijing, which has condemned the tariffs as protectionist. China has been counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy and the EU is the largest overseas market for the country's electric car industry. Its domestic car industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades and its brands, such as BYD, have begun moving into international markets, prompting fears from the likes of the EU that its own companies will be unable to compete with the cheaper prices. The EU imposed import tariffs of varying levels on different Chinese manufacturers in the summer, but Friday's vote was to decide if they were implemented for the next five years. The charges were calculated based on estimates of how much Chinese state aid each manufacturer has received following an EU investigation. The European Commission set individual duties on three major Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. EU members were divided on tariffs. Germany, whose car manufacturing industry is heavily dependent on exports to China, was against them. Many EU members abstained in the vote. German carmakers have been vocal in opposition. Volkswagen says tariffs are ""the wrong approach"". However, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland were reported to have backed the import taxes. The tariffs proposal could only have been blocked if a qualified majority of 15 members voted against it. Germany's top industry association, BDI, called on the European Union and China to continue trade talks over tariffs to avoid an ""escalating trade conflict"". The European Commission, which held the vote, said the EU and China would ""work hard to explore an alternative solution"" to the import taxes to address what it called ""injurious subsidisation"" of Chinese electric vehicles. China's Commerce Ministry called the decision to impose tariffs ""unfair"" and ""unreasonable"", but added the issue could be resolved through negotiations. The dispute has raised fears among industry groups outside the car sector that they could face retaliatory tariffs from China. A trade body for the French cognac industry said the French authorities ""have abandoned us"". ""We do not understand why our sector is being sacrificed in this way."" It said a negotiated solution needed to be found that would ""prevent our products from facing a surtax that could exclude them from the Chinese market"".  Figures show that in August this year, EU registrations of battery-electric cars fell by 43.9% from a year earlier. In the UK, demand for new electric vehicles hit a new record in September, but orders were mostly driven by commercial deals and by big manufacturer discounts, according to the industry trade body. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said firms had ""serious concerns as the market is not growing quickly enough to meet mandated targets"". The industry has warned that drivers need better incentives to buy electric to help manufacturers ahead of the planned ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles. Under the Conservative government the deadline for this ban was pushed back to 2035 from 2030, but Labour has pledged to bring it back to 2030. Car makers are required to meet electric vehicle sales targets. Under the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, at least 22% of vehicles sold this year must be zero-emission, with the target expected to hit 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Manufacturers that fail to hit quotas could be fined £15,000 per car. The bosses of several car companies, including BMW, Ford and Nissan, wrote to Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Friday saying the industry was likely to miss these targets. They said economic factors such as higher energy and material costs and interest rates had meant electric cars remained ""stubbornly more expensive and consumers are wary of investing"". The average cost to buy an electric car in the UK is around £48,000. They said a ""lack of confidence"" in the UK’s charging infrastructure was another barrier to encourage people to switch to electric."

Toshiba and Toyota have told their staff to take precautions against any possible violence, while Panasonic is offering its employees free flights home. Japanese authorities have repeated their condemnation of the killing while urging the Chinese government to ensure the safety of their citizens. The stabbing of the 10-year-old boy on Wednesday was the third high-profile attack on foreigners in China in recent months. In a statement issued to the BBC, electronics giant Panasonic said it would ""prioritise the safety and health of employees"" in mainland China in the wake of the latest attack. Panasonic is allowing employees and their families to temporarily return to Japan at company expense, and is offering a counselling service as well. Toshiba, which has around 100 expatriate employees in China, has urged its workers ""to be cautious of their safety"". The world's biggest car manufacturer Toyota, meanwhile, told the BBC it was ""supporting Japanese expatriates"" by providing them with any information they might need on the situation. Japan's ambassador to Beijing has also urged the Chinese government to ""do its utmost"" to ensure the safety of its citizens. Meanwhile on Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the attack ""extremely despicable"" and said Tokyo had ""strongly urged"" Beijing for an explanation ""as soon as possible"". Some Japanese schools in China have contacted parents, putting them on high alert in the wake of the stabbing. The Guangzhou Japanese School cancelled some activities and warned against speaking Japanese loudly in public. Some members of the Japanese expatriate community in China have told the BBC they are worried about their children's safety. One man, a 53-year-old businessman who has lived in Shenzhen for nearly a decade, said he would be sending his daughter back overseas to university earlier than usual. ""We always considered Shenzhen a safe place to live as it's relatively open to foreigners, but now we are all more cautious about our safety,"" he said. ""Many Japanese people are deeply concerned, and numerous relatives and friends have reached out to check on my safety."" Chinese officials in Shenzhen said they were ""deeply saddened"" by the incident and had started installing security cameras near the school by Thursday morning. ""We will continue to take effective measures to protect the life, property, safety and legal rights of everyone in Shenzhen, including foreigners,” they were quoted as saying in the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily on Friday. An editorial in the state-affiliated newspaper lambasted the suspected killer, saying ""this violent behaviour does not represent the quality of ordinary Chinese people"". On Friday, locals began laying flowers at the gate of the Japanese school in Shenzhen. “It is really sad. It shouldn’t be like that,” a Shenzhen local told Singaporean news outlet The Straits Times. Another, a retired teacher, said: “This child, no matter which country he is from, is the hope of a family, and of a nation."" As Shenzhen reels from the killing, more details have emerged from various news reports and official sources. The incident happened at around 08:00 local time (00:00 GMT)  on Wednesday outside the boy's school, the Shenzhen Japanese School. The boy - who Chinese police named only as Shen - was stabbed in the abdomen. He later died from his injuries in the early hours of Thursday morning. The assailant, a 44-year-old man surnamed Zhong, was arrested on the spot. He had a criminal record, having been arrested for ""damaging public infrastructure"" in 2015 and ""interfering with public order"" in 2019,  according to state-controlled media in Shenzhen.  An eyewitness said the suspect did not attempt to conceal his face when carrying out the attack. ""He didn't run away, but just stood there and was apprehended by the local police guarding the school,” the witness told Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Chinese authorities have not revealed the exact motive, but have repeatedly called the stabbing an ""isolated incident"", as they did for two previous incidents this year. In June, a man targeted a Japanese mother and her child in the eastern city of Suzhou. That attack was also near a Japanese school and led to the death of a Chinese national who had tried to protect the mother and son. It prompted the Japanese government to request about $2.5m (£1.9m) to hire security guards for school buses in China. Earlier in June, four American teachers were stabbed in the northern city of Jilin. Eyes are now on the Chinese authorities and how they will assure Japanese communities that they are safe in China, while ensuring this does not turn into a major diplomatic crisis. Ties between the two countries have long been acrimonious. For decades the two sides have clashed on a number of issues, ranging from historical grievances to territorial disputes. Some have pointed out that the stabbing happened on the anniversary of the notorious Mukden Incident, when Japan faked an explosion to justify its invasion of Manchuria in 1931, triggering a 14-year war with China. A former Japanese diplomat said Wednesday's attack in Shenzhen was the ""result of long years of anti-Japan education"" in Chinese schools. While diplomatic relations may often be strained, economic cooperation has always had a parallel steady existence, according to Japanese diplomats who have spoken to the BBC. But the fact the attack took place in the cosmopolitan tech hub of Shenzhen may make both sides nervous. Top Japanese firms in China warning their staff may raise questions about their presence there and what that might mean for economic relations between Tokyo and Beijing.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjrq0ewj77o,"China nuclear sub sank in its dock, US officials say","The submarine sank earlier this year, in a major setback for the Chinese military, say US defence officials.",27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:26.550275,China News,BBC,China,"A Chinese nuclear-powered attack submarine sank in its dock earlier this year while under construction, in a major setback for the Chinese military, according to US defence officials. Speaking on condition of anonymity to the BBC's US partner, CBS, the officials said the loss of the submarine probably happened between May and June. Satellite images taken in June show what appear to be floating salvage cranes at the berth in Wuhan where, a month previously, the vessel had been seen. Beijing has not confirmed the reports. The US officials said it was ""not surprising"" the Chinese military would have covered up the loss of one of its newest assets.  It is unclear whether the submarine was carrying nuclear fuel at the time.  The BBC has reviewed commercial satellite images collected from the Wuhan shipyard. Images taken on 15 June appear to show a number of crane barges operating in and around the waters beside a berth. Previous images from 7 March and 29 May reveal a sole vessel docked at the same berth. The comparatively poor quality of these images means it is difficult to conclude if the two previous events are connected in any way and - crucially - if they actually show a specific submarine at berth.  The BBC showed these images to Mike Plunkett, a naval expert from Janes, who agreed they offered limited insight. He explained that imagery seen on 29 May “might show a submarine with a X-shaped rudder arrangement”. However, this alone was not enough to confirm that it was a Type 041, as it could also be a modified Type 039. He added “it would not be unusual to see a submarine alongside this pontoon” as China has one of its main production facilities for conventional submarines at Wuhan. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Friday he was not familiar with the topic and did not provide any information when asked about it at a Beijing news conference. The incident raises questions about China's defence industry, which is allegedly riddled with corruption.  China has the biggest navy in the world, with more than 370 ships, and is currently producing a new generation of nuclear-armed submarines, the Zhou-class, of which this was the first. Taiwan has said it carried out its own investigations into the fate of the submarine and had ""a grasp of the situation through multiple intelligence and surveillance methods"", but gave no further details. Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submariner and an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, first noticed the incident involving the submarine in July. He told the BBC the sinking was a ""setback"" that would cause ""pretty significant embarrassment"" for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) navy, but the safety risk was probably ""pretty low"". However, he added: ""If this ship eventually does get repaired, and I'm sure it will, it'll be a far more capable submarine than what they were building before at that shipyard.  ""I do not see it significantly altering the really impressive upward trajectory of the PLA navy’s capability."" The sinking comes at a time when Beijing has been increasingly assertive in laying claim to virtually the whole South China Sea, which is crucial to international trade. It has long-standing maritime disputes with other nations in the region, including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam."

The 595th-ranked 35-year-old ended a dire run of 24 successive defeats spanning more than 600 days, at her home tournament, the China Open, where she has now made history. Having overcome 65th-ranked American McCartney Kessler for her first win since January 2023, Zhang pulled off a massive upset by stunning US Open semi-finalist Emma Navarro to reach the third round. That made her the lowest-ranked player to defeat a top-10 opponent in the tournament's history, with 23-year-old Navarro ranked eighth in the world. In the Open era only one women's player has lost more than Zhang's 24 straight matches (excluding Billie Jean King Cup), when Madeleine Pegel failed to win any of her first 29 matches in the early days of the tour from 1968 to 1972. Zhang, the lowest-ranked player to ever compete in the main draw of the China Open - a WTA 1000 event, won 6-4 6-2 in Beijing on Friday and will meet 28th-seeded Russian Anastasia Potapova or Belgium's Greet Minnen next. The two-time Grand Slam quarter-finalist had won her most recent match against a top-10 player, beating number 10 Caroline Garcia in Tokyo in 2022. Zhang's career has been plagued by injuries and she took a six month-break last year, returning in Dubai in February.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly6xpz9p1no,A Japanese boy was killed in China. Was cyber-nationalism to blame?,The Chinese government has been accused of using online nationalism as a useful safety valve.,1 day ago,2024-10-15 10:31:26.838487,China News,BBC,China,"On a Tuesday morning in September, a 10-year-old boy was approaching the gates of a Japanese school in Shenzhen in southern China, when a stranger walked up and stabbed him. He died of his injuries. The killing shocked Japan and China, and sparked a diplomatic furore. The Japanese government said it believed what happened was motivated by xenophobia, with the country’s foreign minister blaming the attack on “malicious and anti-Japanese” social media posts. Online commentators have noted the killing happened on a politically sensitive date – 18 September, which is the anniversary of an incident that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in China in the early 1930s. For some, what happened is a sign of online nationalism – manifesting in recent years as rising anti-foreigner rhetoric – spilling over into the real world. For years, posts related to events during World War Two have proliferated on the Chinese internet, with the Japanese invasion during the war remaining a sensitive topic for nationalists on both sides. In China, Japan’s wartime atrocities have long been a sore point as Beijing maintains that Tokyo has never fully apologised. The online posts are part of a wider phenomenon, which encompasses both xenophobia and attacks on Chinese nationals for being unpatriotic. One argument by analysts is that this digital nationalism has gone mostly unchecked by the Chinese government, with online patriotism fanning flames of anti-foreigner sentiment as well as accusations against Chinese figures. Some are asking if this has gone too far. They have dubbed the online attacks calling Chinese figures unpatriotic a “Cultural Revolution 2.0”, the latest in a series of drives ensuring ideological purity. They see echoes of the violent, state-sponsored campaign against so-called enemies of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that traumatised the country in the 1960 and 1970s. Hundreds of thousands died in purges often led by youth militias known as the Red Guards. Families and neighbours turned on each other. In a recent essay, author and university professor Zhang Sheng noted that “in the past people summoned the Red Guards, now people summon the ‘little pinks’” – a popular nickname for the virtual army of online nationalists. While many on Chinese social media mourned the killing of the Japanese schoolboy, a few cyber-nationalists struck a very different tone. “I have no opinion on how Japanese die if they don’t apologise for history,” read one popular comment on Weibo, while another pointed out that the Japanese had killed many Chinese during World War Two “and haven’t apologised till this day. How could they be even close to being described as civilised?” A Chinese official reportedly wrote messages in a private group chat saying it is “not a big deal to kill a Japanese child” and “it’s in our regulations to kill Japanese”. He has since been placed under investigation, according to local media outlet Phoenix News. As Japanese officials demanded answers for the “despicable” crime, Beijing sought to play it down, heavily censoring discussion of the incident online and calling it an “accidental, individual case” and an “isolated incident”. But this is the third high-profile attack on foreigners in recent months, all of which China has described as “isolated incidents”. In June, a Japanese mother and her son were attacked at a bus stop outside a Japanese school, and a Chinese woman died while trying to shield them. This happened just weeks after four US university tutors were stabbed in a park in Jilin. While the motives for both attacks were also unclear, they spurred anxious discussion that they were linked to xenophobic rhetoric online. It is not just foreigners facing the ire of cyber-nationalists. In recent months, Chinese public figures and companies have also been castigated for being insufficiently patriotic. Beverage giant Nongfu Spring is considered a Chinese business success story, with its mineral water bottles a ubiquitous sight across the country’s convenience stores and restaurant tables. But in March, nationalists accused the company of using Japanese elements in its product design. One of its logos was said to resemble a Shinto temple, while the iconic mineral water bottle’s red cap was deemed to be a reference to the Japanese flag. It resulted in a brief but intense online campaign: some called for a boycott, while videos of people angrily stamping on Nongfu Spring bottles and chucking their drinks down the toilet were all over social media. Similarly, the author and Nobel Literature Prize laureate Mo Yan was accused of “beautifying” Japanese soldiers and being unpatriotic in his works by a nationalist blogger, who controversially sued the writer for insulting China. These moves have sparked deep concern. Hu Xijin, the former editor of state-run newspaper Global Times, warned that nationalistic attacks on creatives like Mo Yan could have a chilling effect. And the outspoken liberal intellectual Yu Jianrong said the recent stabbings of foreigners were fuelled by “dangerous populist tendencies, which deserve our utmost vigilance”. Even state media has accused online nationalists of “making patriotism a business”. One commentary by CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily said those who “stir up public opinion and add fuel to the flames in order to… gain traffic and make personal gains, should be severely punished”. But the ruling party has had a hand in stoking the fire, some say. “State-endorsed patriotism” and Beijing’s constant warnings about foreign influence has contributed to the “intense nationalism” we see today, says Rose Luqiu, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s communication school. What has aggravated it, she says, is the legal risk of being deemed unpatriotic. The Chinese government has now criminalised the “distortion and smearing [of] heroes and martyrs” – this was used in the lawsuit against the author Mo Yan. It has also passed a sweeping anti-espionage law and launched a campaign encouraging the public to report suspicious activity by foreigners. To legitimise its rule, it has stepped up efforts to strengthen patriotism in schools, where from a young age Chinese children are taught to love not just their country but also the CCP. Meanwhile, a global surge in Sinophobic sentiment during the Covid pandemic and growing suspicion of China in the West due to trade tensions has fed a sense among some Chinese that their country is being unfairly discriminated against by foreigners. China’s slowing economy and a spreading social malaise have also played a role. “Many people in China are confronted with severe social and economic worries. Inflation, housing crises, youth unemployment, and evaporating pensions are all causing anxieties. Nationalism is a readily available and highly potent framework for venting those frustrations,” says Florian Schneider, an expert in online Chinese nationalism at Leiden University. All these factors have resulted in nationalist bloggers becoming a prominent fixture of the Chinese internet in the last few years. Well-known influencers can amass millions of followers – and potentially earn income from the traffic – by pumping out patriotic content extolling the virtues of China and the CCP while denouncing their enemies. While they often act in the name of revolutionary leftist fervour, their behaviour is actually more similar to the far right found in other countries who lead xenophobic and reactionary movements, Professor Schneider tells the BBC. As “populists who are trying to make China great again”, they “harbour hopes of returning society to some imagined former glory, and see all manner of elites and foreign powers as roadblocks to this goal”. Sometimes authorities appear to listen to concerns. In July, they quietly dropped a controversial amendment to a national security law after a public outcry. They acknowledged that a proposed ban on “hurting Chinese people’s feelings” could “infringe upon the legitimate rights and normal life of the public”. Chinese social media platforms have tried to rein in online nationalists by periodically suspending their accounts. Well-known nationalist influencers Sima Nan and Guyanmuchan have been censored without warning. So was the blogger who tried to sue Mo Yan, whose lawsuit was also rejected by the courts. One vlogger, who shot to notoriety this year after he posted a video accusing a shopping mall of putting up decorations that resembled the Japanese flag, was similarly shut down. A scathing state media commentary denounced his video as “a malicious report that rides on the online traffic of patriotism”. Still, authorities appear to have a loose grip on online nationalists. While dissenters are swiftly shut down or in some cases arrested in the name of social stability, nationalist bloggers are allowed a freer rein, despite their sometimes inflammatory rhetoric. State media has even boosted these voices by republishing their content. The BBC has asked the Chinese government for a response on why nationalist content does not appear to be censored on social media as much as other content deemed sensitive. That could be down to the fact the state views online nationalism as a useful safety valve to “dissipate dissent in a way that does not undermine its authority”, particularly during its current economic troubles, where “society really needs an outlet to express frustration”, says Dr Luqiu. By encouraging nationalists and then occasionally reining them in, the government “harnesses nationalism to its advantage, only intervening when it risks spilling over” into an uncontrollable situation. It may seem risky, but Beijing has successfully crushed serious challenges to its authority in recent years, such as the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong in 2019 and the White Paper protests in 2022 against harsh zero-Covid policies. The government is thus confident it can manage the dangers, and it means nationalism is likely to stay despite the backlash, analysts say. “Nationalism is a mixed blessing for China’s leaders, and at the moment we are witnessing the costs of that,” says Professor Schneider. “But will the leadership rethink or even abandon its nationalism in favour of something less toxic? I wouldn’t hold my breath.” Additional reporting by Ian Tang. BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0z289ervmo,Finland to return pandas to China early due to cost,Inflation and debt are among the reasons Lumi and Pyry are being sent home eight years early.,25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:26.916592,China News,BBC,China,"A zoo in Finland will return two giant pandas to China eight years early, saying it can no longer afford to look after them. Lumi and Pyry were brought to Finland in 2018, after the two countries signed an agreement to protect the animals.  They were meant to stay in the Nordic country for 15 years, but will be sent home in November – with Ähtäri Zoo blaming inflation and debt linked to the Covid pandemic for the pandas' eviction.  It also said the zoo spent €1.5m (£1.2m) a year on the pandas' upkeep, as well as more than €8m on their enclosure.  Marko Haapakoski, curator at Ähtäri Zoo, said the €1.5m upkeep was ""much more than all the other species combined"".  It included a keeper required to stay with them at all times, a preservation fee to China and imported bamboo.  ""It's a good thing for the zoo because they were so expensive,"" but the pandas had been ""doing really well, so it's a pity"", said Mr Haapakoski. ""They're really nice to work with."" Another factor in the decision to return the pandas was the Finnish government rejecting pleas for state funding last year. ""They thought the pandas would bring more visitors, and that it was a good investment - turns out it wasn't so"", said Mr Haapakoski. The zoo revealed last year that it was discussing their return. Lumi and Pyry will soon go into a month-long quarantine before they are shipped back to China. A spokesperson for Finland's foreign ministry said the pandas' return was a business decision that did not involve the government, and that it should not impact relations between Finland and China.  Finland's Chinese embassy, meanwhile, told the Reuters news agency that while efforts had been made to try and help the zoo, a joint decision was eventually made to send the animals back.  China sends pandas to foreign zoos to strengthen its trading ties, relationships and image abroad - termed 'panda diplomacy'."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgvr9kgkqyo,China is part of the US election - but only from one candidate,There is a stark difference in how - and how often - each candidate addresses the US-China relationship.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:27.099817,China News,BBC,China,"The US and China are the two largest economies in the world. They have the two most powerful militaries in the world. The US-China rivalry, in the view of many international analysts, will be the defining global theme of the 21st Century. But at the moment, only one of the two major party presidential candidates is regularly talking about US-China policy - as he has done consistently for years. According to a review by BBC Verify, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has mentioned China 40 times in his five rallies since the presidential debate earlier this month. In just one hour at a town hall forum last week in Michigan, he brought up the country 27 times. And when he talks about China, Trump focuses on matters of tension between the two global powers, painting the country and the world’s second-largest economy, as a kind of economic predator. He has talked about the new tariffs he plans to impose on imports from Chinese companies – and those from other nations -  should he return to the White House.  He has said he wants to prevent Chinese-made cars from being sold because he believes they will destroy the American auto industry. He has warned China not to attempt to replace the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And he has blamed the Chinese government for the Covid pandemic. Many economists question the effectiveness of Trump’s tariff plans and warn that they would ultimately be harmful to US consumers. The Biden-Harris administration, however, has maintained, and even at times increased, the more narrowly focused tariffs that Trump imposed on China during his first term in office. Trump’s protectionist message is tailored to blue-collar voters in the key industrial Midwest battleground states who have felt the impact of increased competition from Chinese manufacturers.  Meanwhile, BBC Verify finds, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris did not mention China at all in her six rallies since the 10 September debate. Although, in a speech on the economy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday afternoon, she made a handful of references to the country. “I will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, communities, and companies,” she said at that event. Asked for comment, an aide to the vice-president told the BBC that even if Harris does not talk about China regularly, she has a record of working to counter what they described as China’s efforts to undermine global stability and prosperity. But when it comes to discussing China, the contrast between Trump and Harris on the campaign trail is unmistakable. On Monday afternoon, at a barn in Smithton, a small town in rural western Pennsylvania, Trump sat down with a group of local farmers and ranchers for a roundtable discussion specifically about China. The town may be just an hour outside of Pittsburgh, a Democratic Party urban stronghold, but this was decidedly Republican territory. Cows grazed peacefully on grasslands lined with dozens of “Trump for President signs”, while Trump supporters decorated two donkeys in “Make America Great Again” gear. The topic of the event, hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, a conservative think-tank, was “the Chinese Communist Party's growing threat to the US food supply”. The forum ended up being a more open-ended conversation about the threat of China, full stop. The farmers, ranchers and business executives on the panel complained about having to compete with heavily subsidised Chinese imports and about the low quality of Chinese goods. While the former president didn’t spend much time discussing the perceived dangers of Chinese ownership of US farmland – he instead promised that he would convince Chinese President Xi Jinping to buy more US agriculture exports – he again emphasised that he would use tariffs to shield the American economy from China. At one point, he spoke of the need to protect the US steel industry - in order to prepare for a hypothetical war with China. “If we’re in a war, and we need army tanks and we need ships and we need other things that happen to be made of steel, what are we going to do, go to China and get the steel?” he asked. “We’re fighting China, but would you mind selling us some steel?” Some of the heavier lifting on China during the forum was left to Richard Grenell, a roundtable panelist and senior advisor for the Protecting America Initiative. He warned the country has “quietly but strategically” worked against the US – particularly when Americans were distracted by other global issues. “They go after our local and state politicians; they go after our manufacturing,” he said. “There is no question they are looking to, at some point, leverage that investment and activity.” Grenell, who served as US ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence while Trump was in office, is considered a possible secretary of state - America’s top diplomat - if Trump wins another term in November. If Harris wins, on the other hand, there may not be a significant change from the current Biden administration, even if the current president has frequently deployed sharper rhetoric to describe the US-China rivalry. Since the start of his presidency, Joe Biden has identified China as one of the autocracies competing with the world’s leading democracies in what he describes as a historic global inflection point. According to public opinion surveys, China ranks low on the list of issues American voters care about – dwarfed by the economy, immigration and healthcare.  In a recent National Security Action survey of voters in key electoral battleground states, only 14% listed China as the top national security priority for the next president. Immigration led the list at 38%, followed by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, both at 28%. That could in part explain Harris’s seeming lack of interest in talking about China. In this abbreviated presidential campaign for her, she has a shorter timeframe to define herself in the eyes of voters, so focusing on America's main economic competitor may be less of a priority for the Democrat.  After the Trump event in Smithton, Bill Bretz, chair of the local county Republican Party committee, said that while China may not be at the top of voter concerns in Pennsylvania, it was important for Trump to talk about it. As the largest up-for-grabs electoral prize, Pennsylvania is perhaps the pivotal state in the 2024 presidential election. Both Trump and Harris will be hard-pressed to win the White House without it in their column. Polls currently show the two candidates in a dead heat there. “The majority of people have already picked the camp that they're in, but there are those group of people that are undecided,” he said. “If China is a straw that sways the scale one way or another, I think it's a great thing to bring up.” Additional reporting by Jake Horton and BBC Verify North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy94qq01qweo,Ten-year-old Japanese boy dies after stabbing in China,Authorities say the boy was attacked outside Shenzhen Japanese School in southern China.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:33.627701,China News,BBC,China,"A 10-year-old Japanese student has died one day after he was stabbed near his school in southern China. The boy, who was enrolled at the Shenzhen Japanese School, succumbed to his injuries early on Thursday, Japanese officials said. His assailant, a 44-year-old man surnamed Zhong, was arrested on the spot, local police said. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has called the attack ""extremely despicable"" and said Tokyo had ""strongly urged"" Beijing for an explanation ""as soon as possible"". Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said the case was being investigated and that China and Japan were ""in communication"". ""China expresses its regret and sadness that this kind of unfortunate incident occurred,"" he told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. Mr Lin also confirmed that the boy was a Japanese national with a Japanese father and a Chinese mother. The motive for the attack was not immediately known. But some observers have expressed concern that nationalist sentiment in China might be spilling into increasing violence against foreigners.  In June, a man targeted a Japanese mother and her child in the eastern city of Suzhou. That attack was also near a Japanese school and led to the death of a Chinese national who had tried to protect the mother and son. Earlier in June, four American teachers were stabbed in the northern city of Jilin. Beijing has described all of these attacks - including the one on Wednesday - as ""isolated incidents"". And on Wednesday, Mr Lin said China would continue ""to protect the safety of all foreigners in the country"".  The Japanese embassy in Beijing called on the Chinese government to ""prevent such incidents from happening again"". Some have pointed out that the stabbing happened on the anniversary of the notorious Mukden Incident, when Japan faked an explosion to justify its invasion of Manchuria in 1931, triggering a 14-year war with China. Ties between the two countries have long been acrimonious. For decades the two sides have clashed on a number of issues, ranging from historical grievances to territorial disputes. A former Japanese diplomat said Wednesday's attack in Shenzhen was the ""result of long years of anti-Japan education"" in Chinese schools. ""This has cost the precious life of a Japanese child,"" Shingo Yamagami, Japan's former ambassador to Australia, wrote on X. Some Japanese schools in China have contacted parents, putting them on high alert in the wake of the stabbing. The Guangzhou Japanese School cancelled some activities and warned against speaking Japanese loudly in public. Earlier this year, the Japanese government requested about $2.5m (£1.9m) to hire security guards for school buses in China."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje2ejnwwx9o,UK accounting giant PwC faces six-month China ban,The firm is being penalised for its role in the failure of property giant Evergrande.,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:33.757045,China News,BBC,China,"PwC's Chinese auditing arm has been suspended from the country for six months over its work on the collapsed Chinese property giant Evergrande. The Big Four accountancy firm is also being fined more than $62m (£47m) after Chinese authorities said it had helped cover up fraud at Evergrande. The real estate firm collapsed in January under a mountain of debt. PwC China admitted the work had fallen ""unacceptably below the standards"" expected within the firm and apologised for the impact on its clients. The Chinese authorities said PwC knew there were ""major misstatements"" in Evergrande's financial statements when it audited the firm.  As a result, the Chinese Ministry of Finance has imposed ""administrative penalties"" and suspended the operations of PwC's auditing business PwC ZhongTian for six months. Other PwC operations providing non-audit services in China are not affected. In addition, China's securities regulator has confiscated the revenue PwC earned auditing Evergrande and has also issued a fine.  An investigation by the regulator said PwC had ""seriously eroded the basis of law and good faith, and damaged investors' interest"". In response to the penalties, PwC said it had taken ""a number of accountability and remedial actions"", including the sacking of six partners and the launch of a process to fine responsible team leaders. An additional five staff have also left, and Hemione Hudson, PwC's global risk and regulatory leader, has been parachuted in to run the Chinese unit on an interim basis. PwC admitted the work done on the Evergrande audit had been ""well below"" standards expected at the firm. “It is not representative of what we stand for as a network and there is no room for this at PwC,"" the firm’s global chair Mohamed Kande said. “That is why, following a thorough investigation, we ensured that actions were taken to hold those responsible to account. “I remain confident in the China firm’s partners and staff as we work together to rebuild trust with stakeholders,” he added. PwC China said in a statement: ""We deeply regret and apologise for the impact this has had on our clients and people. We will work tirelessly to regain their trust."" Evergrande, which built property in more than 280 Chinese cities and branched out into other business sectors, teetered, then finally went into liquidation in January.  The Chinese authorities have accused Evergrande and its founder, Hui Ka Yan, of falsely inflating revenues at the firm to the tune of $78bn (£61.6bn) and imposed fines and bans on him personally as well as the business."

The top legislative body on Friday approved proposals to raise the statutory retirement age from 50 to 55 for women in blue-collar jobs, and from 55 to 58 for females in white-collar jobs. Men will see an increase from 60 to 63.  China's current retirement ages are among the lowest in the world.  According to the plan passed on Friday, the change will set in from 1 January 2025, with the respective retirement ages raised every few months over the next 15 years, said Chinese state media.  Retiring before the statutory age will not be allowed, state news agency Xinhua reported, although people can delay their retirement by no more than three years. Starting 2030, employees will also have to make more contributions to the social security system in order to receive pensions. By 2039, they would have to clock 20 years of contributions to access their pensions. The state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said in 2019 that the country's main state pension fund will run out of money by 2035 - and that was an estimate before the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit China's economy hard. The plan to raise retirement ages and adjust the pension policy was based on ""a comprehensive assessment of the average life expectancy, health conditions, the population structure, the level of education and workforce supply in China,"" Xinhua reported.  But the announcement has drawn some scepticism and discontent on the Chinese internet. ""In the next 10 years, there will be another bill that will delay retirement until we are 80,"" one user wrote on a Chinese social media site Weibo.  ""What a miserable year! Middle-aged workers are faced with pay cuts and raised retirement ages. Those who are unemployed find it increasingly difficult to get jobs,"" another chimed in.  Others said they had anticipated the announcement. ""This was expected, there isn't much to discuss. ""Men in most European countries retire when they are 65 or 67, while women do at 60. This is going to be the trend in our country as well,"" one Weibo user said. China's huge population has fallen for a second consecutive year in 2023 as its birth rate continues to decline.  Meanwhile, its average life expectancy has risen to 78.2 years, officials said earlier this year. According to the World Health Organization, almost a third of China's population - about 402 million people - will be aged over 60 by 2040, up from 254 million in 2019. A slowing economy, shrinking government benefits and a decades-long one-child policy have created a creeping demographic crisis in China, our China correspondent Laura Bicker wrote earlier this year. China's pension pot is running dry and the country is running out of time to build enough of a fund to care for the growing number of elderly. Over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. This is the country's largest age group, nearly equivalent to the size of the US population. So who will look after them? The answer depends on where you go and who you ask. Read our analysis here"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjyj2rd1zpo,China spent millions on this new trade route - then a war got in the way,"The BBC visits the border with Myanmar, where a war is raging on China’s doorstep.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:33.961235,China News,BBC,China,"“One village, two countries” used to be the tagline for Yinjing on China’s south-western edge. An old tourist sign boasts of a border with Myanmar made of just “bamboo fences, ditches and earth ridges” - a sign of the easy economic relationship Beijing had sought to build with its neighbour. Now the border the BBC visited is marked by a high, metal fence running through the county of Ruili in Yunnan province. Topped by barbed wire and surveillance cameras in some places, it cuts through rice fields and carves up once-adjoined streets. China’s tough pandemic lockdowns forced the separation initially. But it has since been cemented by the intractable civil war in Myanmar, triggered by a bloody coup in 2021. The military regime is now fighting for control in large swathes of the country, including Shan State along China’s border, where it has suffered some of its biggest losses. The crisis at its doorstep - a nearly 2,000km (1,240-mile) border - is becoming costly for China, which has invested millions of dollars in Myanmar for a critical trade corridor.  The ambitious plan aims to connect China’s landlocked south-west to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar. But the corridor has become a battleground between Myanmar rebels and the country's army. Beijing has sway over both sides but the ceasefire it brokered in January fell apart. It has now turned to military exercises along the border and stern words. Foreign Minister Wang Yi was the latest diplomat to visit Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw and is thought to have delivered a warning to the country's ruler Min Aung Hlaing. Conflict is not new to impoverished Shan State. Myanmar’s biggest state is a major source of the world’s opium and and methamphetamine, and home to ethnic armies long opposed to centralised rule.  But the vibrant economic zones created by Chinese investment managed to thrive - until the civil war. A loudspeaker now warns people in Ruili not to get too close to the fence - but that doesn’t stop a Chinese tourist from sticking his arm between the bars of a gate to take a selfie. Two girls in Disney T-shirts shout through the bars - “hey grandpa, hello, look over here!” - as they lick pink scoops of ice cream. The elderly man shuffling barefoot on the other side barely looks up before he turns away. “Burmese people live like dogs,” says Li Mianzhen. Her corner stall sells food and drinks from Myanmar - like milk tea - in a small market just steps from the border checkpoint in Ruili city. Li, who looks to be in her 60s, used to sell Chinese clothes across the border in Muse, a major source of trade with China. But she says almost no-one in her town has enough money any more. Myanmar’s military junta still controls the town, one of its last remaining holdouts in Shan State. But rebel forces have taken other border crossings and a key trading zone on the road to Muse. The situation has made people desperate, Li says. She knows of some who have crossed the border to earn as little as 10 yuan - about one pound and not much more than a dollar - so that they can go back to Myanmar and “feed their families”. The war has severely restricted travel in and out of Myanmar, and most accounts now come from those who have fled or have found ways to move across the borders, such as Li. Unable to get the work passes that would allow them into China, Li’s family is stuck in Mandalay, as rebel forces edge closer to Myanmar’s second-largest city. “I feel like I am dying from anxiety,” Li says. “This war has brought us so much misfortune. At what point will all of this end?"" Thirty-one-year-old Zin Aung (name changed) is among those who made it out. He works in an industrial park on the outskirts of Ruili, which produces clothes, electronics and vehicle parts that are shipped across the world. Workers like him are recruited in large numbers from Myanmar and flown here by Chinese government-backed firms eager for cheap labour. Estimates suggest they earn about 2,400 yuan ($450; £340) a month, which is less than their Chinese colleagues. “There is nothing for us to do in Myanmar because of the war,” Zin Aung says. “Everything is expensive. Rice, cooking oil. Intensive fighting is going on everywhere. Everyone has to run.” His parents are too old to run, so he did. He sends home money whenever he can. The men live and work on the few square kilometres of the government-run compound in Ruili. Zin Aung says it is a sanctuary, compared with what they left behind: “The situation in Myanmar is not good, so we are taking refuge here.” He also escaped compulsory conscription, which the Myanmar army has been enforcing to make up for defections and battlefield losses. As the sky turned scarlet one evening, Zin Aung ran barefoot through the cloying mud onto a monsoon-soaked pitch, ready for a different kind of battle - a fiercely fought game of football. Burmese, Chinese and the local Yunnan dialect mingled as vocal spectators reacted to every pass, kick and shot. The agony over a missed goal was unmistakable. This is a daily affair in their new, temporary home, a release after a 12-hour shift on the assembly line. Many of the workers are from Lashio, the largest town in Shan State, and Laukkaing, home to junta-backed crime families - Laukkaing fell to rebel forces in January and Lashio was encircled, in a campaign which has changed the course of the war and China’s stake in it. Both towns lie along China’s prized trade corridor and the Beijing-brokered ceasefire left Lashio in the hands of the junta. But in recent weeks rebel forces have pushed into the town - their biggest victory to date. The military has responded with bombing raids and drone attacks, restricting internet and mobile phone networks. “The fall of Lashio is one of the most humiliating defeats in the military’s history,” says Richard Horsey, Myanmar adviser to the International Crisis Group. “The only reason the rebel groups didn’t push into Muse is they likely feared it would upset China,” Mr Horsey says. “Fighting there would have impacted investments China has hoped to restart for months. The regime has lost control of almost all northern Shan state – with the exception of Muse region, which is right next to Ruili.” Ruili and Muse, both designated as special trade zones, are crucial to the Beijing-funded 1,700km trade route, known as the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor. The route also supports Chinese investments in energy, infrastructure and rare earth mining critical for manufacturing electric vehicles. But at its heart is a railway line that will connect Kunming - the capital of Yunnan province - to Kyaukphyu, a deep sea port the Chinese are building on Myanmar’s western coast. The port, along the Bay of Bengal, would give industries in and beyond Ruili access to the Indian Ocean and then global markets. The port is also the starting point for oil and gas pipelines that will transport energy via Myanmar to Yunnan. But these plans are now in jeopardy. President Xi Jinping had spent years cultivating ties with his resource-rich neighbour when the country’s elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was forced from power. Mr Xi refused to condemn the coup and continued to sell the army weapons. But he also did not recognise Min Aung Hlaing as head of state, nor has he invited him to China. Three years on, the war has killed thousands and displaced millions, but no end is in sight. Forced to fight on new fronts, the army has since lost between half and two-thirds of Myanmar to a splintered opposition. Beijing is at an impasse. It “doesn’t like this situation” and sees Myanmar’s military ruler Min Aung Hlaing as “incompetent”, Mr Horsey says. “They are pushing for elections, not because they necessarily want a return to democratic rule, but more because they think this is a way back.” Myanmar’s regime suspects Beijing of playing both sides - keeping up the appearance of supporting the junta while continuing to maintain a relationship with ethnic armies in Shan State. Analysts note that many of the rebel groups are using Chinese weapons. The latest battles are also a resurgence of last year’s campaign launched by three ethnic groups which called themselves the Brotherhood Alliance. It is thought that the alliance would not have made its move without Beijing’s tacit approval. Its gains on the battlefield spelled the end for notorious mafia families whose scam centres had trapped thousands of Chinese workers. Long frustrated over the increasing lawlessness along its border, Beijing welcomed their downfall - and the tens of thousands of suspects who were handed over by the rebel forces. For Beijing the worst-case scenario is the civil war dragging on for years. But it would also fear a collapse of the military regime, which might herald further chaos. How China will react to either scenario is not yet clear - what is also unclear is what more Beijing can do beyond pressuring both sides to agree to peace talks. That predicament is evident in Ruili with its miles of shuttered shops. A city that once benefited from its location along the border is now feeling the fallout from its proximity to Myanmar. Battered by some of China’s strictest lockdowns, businesses here took another hit when cross-border traffic and trade did not revive. They also rely on labour from the other side, which has stopped, according to several agents who help Burmese workers find jobs. They say China has tightened its restrictions on hiring workers from across the border, and has also sent back hundreds who were said to be working illegally. The owner of a small factory, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC that the deportations meant “his business isn’t going anywhere… and there’s nothing I can change”. The square next to the checkpoint is full of young workers, including mothers with their babies, waiting in the shade. They lay out their paperwork to make sure they have what they need to secure a job. The successful ones are given a pass which allows them to work for up to a week, or come and go between the two countries, like Li. “I hope some good people can tell all sides to stop fighting,” Li says. “If there is no-one in the world speaking up for us, it is really tragic.” She says she is often assured by those around her that fighting won’t break out too close to China. But she is unconvinced: “No-one can predict the future.” For now, Ruili is a safer option for her and Zin Aung. They understand that their future is in Chinese hands, as do the Chinese. “Your country is at war,” a Chinese tourist tells a Myanmar jade seller he is haggling with at the market. “You just take what I give you.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zlkz0ypyo,Row over aircons in classrooms as China swelters,Parents' calls to install air conditioners in classrooms spark a debate online.,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:34.059419,China News,BBC,China,"A row has erupted on Chinese social media over the use of air conditioners in classrooms as the country endures an unseasonal heatwave. Parents in some of China's hottest cities have called on schools to install air conditioners as temperatures exceed 35C.  The conversation heated up in the southern city of Changsha where the education department responded saying it will not install air cons so students can ""cultivate the spirit of hard work and endurance"".  The comment drew outrage online, sparking a debate on who should pay for the air conditioners and whether they should be used at all. ""Hard work and endurance? Can we please then ask the education bureau to work in 40-degree heat, then discuss whether this is the way to cultivate such spirit in children,"" wrote one Weibo user. Another wrote: ""Global warming has become so serious. What do you want the children to do?""  Most classrooms in China do not have air conditioners and rely on ceiling fans instead.   But calls to install them have intensified in recent months. “Without air conditioning, it would be challenging to concentrate on studying,” Lin Yujun, the father of a junior high school student in Guangdong in southern China, told Shanghai-based news site Sixth Tone. Not all parents are in favour of installing air conditioners. Some have voiced concern about the higher risk of catching a cold or other infections at school in air-conditioned classrooms. Others have suggested changes to the school calendar.   “It was never so hot in September in previous years. Perhaps the education board can extend school holidays, according to the weather,” a parent told CQ News in Chongqing. Earlier this year, China's weather bureau warned of hotter and longer heatwaves, adding that maximum temperatures across the country could rise by up to 2.8C within the next 30 years. Schools, however, are reluctant to commit to the steep cost - of the aircons and the electricity bills that would follow. A primary school in the southern city of Xiangtan drew criticism for asking parents to pay for the air conditioners - the school invited them to donate, reported Sixth Tone. The local education bureau later ordered the school to reimburse the parents. But comments online supported the school's request as reasonable, saying that  students' comfort should be the priority. ""Now that [authorities] have stopped parents from contributing, when will school students be able to use air conditioners under such persistently high temperatures,"" wrote Long Zhi Zhu, a commentator for local media outlet The Paper. ""[Everyone] has been going around in circles on this issue. Ultimately, the children are the ones who suffer,"" wrote a Weibo user. Some schools are trying to cope with the heat without the help of air conditioning - they have taken to placing buckets with large blocks of ice inside classrooms to cool the space down.  Some schools in eastern Jiangxi province and south-western Sichuan province postponed the start of the autumn semester, due to begin on 2 September, by a week. "

Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 71, was arrested in August 2020 after admitting to an undercover FBI agent that he sold US secrets to China.  Ma, a naturalised US citizen born in Hong Kong, worked for the CIA from 1982 to 1989. He went on to work for the FBI later in his career. Part of his plea agreement states that he must co-operate with prosecutors ""for the rest of his life, including by submitting to debriefings by US government agencies"". The plea deal requires him to submit to polygraph tests during those debriefings, according to the Associated Press news agency. At a sentencing hearing on Wednesday, lawyers for the US government told the court that he has been co-operative, and has already taken part in ""multiple interview sessions with government agents"". Officials say Ma collaborated with a relative, who was also a CIA agent, to supply secrets to intelligence officers employed by the Shanghai State Security Bureau. One meeting in Hong Kong was recorded on video and shows Ma counting $50,000 (£38,000) in cash for the secrets they shared, federal prosecutors say. While living in Hawaii in 2004 he took a job at the FBI's Honolulu office as a contract linguist. The FBI, already aware of his espionage activities ""hired Ma as part of a ruse to monitor and investigate his activities and contacts"", prosecutors said on Wednesday. According to the AP, the unnamed collaborator was Ma's brother, who died before he could be prosecuted.  At a court in Hawaii on Wednesday Ma was jailed for 10 years, as agreed with prosecutors, followed by five years of supervised release. ""Let it be a message to anyone else thinking of doing the same,"" FBI Honolulu Special Agent-in-Charge Steven Merrill said in a statement, according to the AP. ""No matter how long it takes, or how much time passes, you will be brought to justice."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp95mdjk95ko,Taiwan's president vows to resist 'annexation',William Lai made the comments on the self-governing island's national day address amid tensions with China.,5 days ago,2024-10-15 10:31:39.260114,China News,BBC,China,"President William Lai has pledged to uphold Taiwan's self-governing status in his most high-profile public address since taking office earlier this year. In a thinly-veiled reference to China's claim over the island, Lai said he would ""uphold the commitment to resist annexation or encroachment upon our sovereignty."" At the same time, Lai promised to maintain ""the status quo of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"" and pledged to cooperate with Beijing on issues such as climate change, combating infectious diseases and maintaining regional security.  Responding to Lai's speech, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it ""exposed his intransigent position"" on Taiwan independence. Lai was speaking to a crowd in Taipei to commemorate Taiwan's National Day, only nine days after Communist China celebrated its 75th anniversary. ""The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinates to each other,"" he said, in a reference to the governments of Taipei and Beijing respectively. ""On this land, democracy and freedom are thriving. The People's Republic of China has no right to represent Taiwan,"" he added. Lai previously told visitors there would be ""no surprises"" in his national day address, in a bid to reassure them that he would not do anything further to agitate Beijing. The disclaimer followed several speeches by President Lai over the past few months that some viewed as being provocative. ""The speech was much softer and less snarky than his recent speeches,"" Lev Nachman, a political scientist at the National Taiwan University, told the BBC in reference to Thursday's address. ""It gives China far less ammunition to use against him.""  ""Nevertheless,"" he added, ""Beijing will still find many reasons to hate this speech."" Mr Nachman said he expected a strong reaction from Beijing in the form of more military exercises in the next few days. Calling him ""intransigent"" on independence, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticised Lai's speech and his ""sinister intention to escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait in order to seek political gains."" ""No matter what the Lai Ching-te Administration says or does, it will not be able to change the objective fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the same China, nor will it be able to stop the historical trend that China is bound to be reunified, and will be reunified eventually,"" Mao Ning told reporters on Thursday, using Lai's Chinese name. Last week, Lai said it was ""absolutely impossible"" for China to be the ""motherland"" of Taiwan because the island's government was founded in 1911, decades before the current Communist regime of mainland China was founded in 1949. ""On the contrary, the Republic of China may actually be the motherland of citizens of the People’s Republic of China who are over 75 years old,"" Lai said at a concert to mark Taiwan's National Day on Saturday. Taiwan maintains the constitution of the Republic of China, which was founded on the Chinese mainland. When it lost a long civil war with the Communists in 1949, the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan and has been based there ever since. Last month, Lai also questioned China's assertion that its claim over the self-ruled island was based on territorial integrity. If that were the case, he suggested, Beijing would also be pushing to reclaim other so-called historic lands that once belonged to the Chinese empire. ""If China wants to annex Taiwan... it's not for the sake of territorial integrity,"" Lai said, in an interview to mark his first 100 days in office.  ""If it is really for the sake of territorial integrity, why doesn't China take back Russia?"" Lai referenced the 1858 Treaty of Aigun, which saw China concede large swathes of Manchuria to Russia. The concession occurred during what China refers to as the ""century of humiliation,"" when Western powers and Japan exploited the weakened Qing Dynasty. On Wednesday, China's government responded by saying President Lai was escalating tensions with ""sinister intentions"".  ""Lai Ching-te's Taiwan independence fallacy is just old wine in a new bottle, and again exposes his obstinate stance on Taiwan independence and his sinister intentions of escalating hostility and confrontation,"" said the statement from China's Taiwan Affairs Office. After his election in January, Lai succeeded Taiwan's previous president Tsai Ing-wen, who also came from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Lai's public comments until now are regarded by many political observers as going further than anything said by his predecessor, who was much more cautious in her public speeches. In spite of his administration's more confrontational tone, however, Lai has stressed his position of maintaining the ""status quo"" between Taiwan and China. He insists Taiwan has no need to declare independence because it is already an independent sovereign nation that has never been controlled by the People’s Republic of China. Lai also devoted a considerable amount of Thursday's speech to domestic issues such as energy, climate change and housing."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zpy3zj7ro,Harris or Trump? What Chinese people want from US election,People in Beijing tell the BBC's Laura Bicker their hopes and fears about who will win the White House race.,1 day ago,2024-10-15 10:31:39.353121,China News,BBC,China,"In China, people are following the US election with keen interest and some anxiety. They fear what could happen next at home and abroad, whoever wins the White House. “None of us wants to see a war,” says Mr Xiang, as the music in the park reaches a crescendo and a nearby dancer elegantly spins his partner. He has come to Ritan Park to learn dance with other seniors.  They gather here regularly, just a few hundred metres from the Beijing home of the American ambassador in China. In addition to new dance moves, the looming US election is also on their minds. It comes at a pivotal time between the two superpowers, with tensions over Taiwan, trade and international affairs running high. “I am worried that Sino-US relations are getting tense,” says Mr Xiang who’s in his sixties. Peace is what we want, he adds. A crowd has gathered to listen to this conversation. Most are reluctant to give their full names in a country where it is permissible to talk about the US president, but being critical of their own leader could get them in trouble. They say they are worried about war - not just about a conflict between Washington and Beijing but an escalation of current wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. That is why Mr Meng, in his 70s, hopes Donald Trump will win the election. “Although he imposes economic sanctions on China, he does not wish to start or fight a war. Mr Biden starts more wars so more ordinary people dislike him. It is Mr Biden who supports Ukraine’s war and both Russia and Ukraine suffer great loss from the war,” he said. Some sisters recording a dance routine for their social media page chip in. “Donald Trump said in the debate that he will end the war in Ukraine 24 hours after he takes office,” says one.  “About Harris, I know little about her, we think she follows the same route as President Biden who supports war.” Their opinions echo a key message being propagated on Chinese state media. China has called on the international community to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza while aligning itself with what it describes as its “Arab brothers” in the Middle East and has been quick to blame the US for its unwavering support of Israel. On Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the United Nations that China was playing a “constructive role” as he accused Washington of “exploiting the situation for selfish gain”. While most analysts believe Beijing does not have a favourite in this race for the White House, many would agree that Kamala Harris is an unknown quantity to Chinese people and the country’s leaders. But some believe she will be more stable than Trump when it comes to one of the biggest flashpoints between the US and China - Taiwan. “I don’t like Trump. I don’t think there is a good future between the US and China – there are too many problems, the global economy, and also the Taiwan problem,” says a father of a four-year-old boy in the park for a family day out. He fears their differences over Taiwan could eventually lead to conflict. “I don’t want it. I don’t want my son to go to the military,” he says as the young boy pleads to go back on the slide. China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and President Xi has said “reunification is inevitable”, vowing to retake it by force if necessary. The US maintains official ties with Beijing and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily, breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. Harris has not gone that far. Instead, when asked in a recent interview she stated a “commitment to security and prosperity for all nations.” Donald Trump is instead focused on a deal - not diplomacy. He has called on Taiwan to pay for its protection. “Taiwan took our chip business from us. I mean, how stupid are we? They’re immensely wealthy,” he said in a recent interview. “Taiwan should pay us for defence.” One of their biggest worries when it comes to the former US president is that he has also made it clear he plans to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This is the last thing many businesses in China want right now as the country is trying to manufacture enough goods to export itself out of an economic downturn. Ministers in China bristle with contempt at US-led trade tariffs which were first imposed by Donald Trump.  President Biden has also levied tariffs, targeting Chinese electronic vehicles and solar panels. Beijing believes these moves are an attempt to curb its rise as a global economic power.  “I don’t think it will do any good to the US to impose tariffs on China,” says Mr Xiang, echoing the sentiments of many we met. The tariffs will hit the US people, he adds, and increase costs for ordinary people. Many of the the younger generation, while patriotic, also look towards the US for trends and culture - and that, perhaps more than any diplomatic mission, has power too. In the park, Lily and Anna, aged 20 and 22, who get their news from TikTok, echo some of the national messages of pride spread by Chinese state media when it comes to this competitive relationship. “Our country is a very prosperous and powerful country,” they say, dressed in their national costumes. They love China, they said, although they also adore the Avengers and particularly Captain America. Taylor Swift is on their playlists too. Others like 17-year-old Lucy hope to study in America one day. As she cycles on an exercise bike, newly installed in the park, she dreams about visiting Universal Studios one day - after her graduation. Lucy says she is excited to see there is a female candidate. “Harris’s candidacy marks an important step forward for gender equality, and it’s encouraging to see her as a presidential candidate.” The People’s Republic of China has never had a female leader and not a single woman currently sits on the 24-member team known as the Politburo that makes up the most senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. Lucy is also worried about the intense competition between the two countries and believes the best way for China and the United States to improve their relationship is to have more people-to-people exchanges. Both sides have vowed to work towards this, and yet the number of US students studying in China has fallen from around 15,000 in 2011 to 800. Xi hopes to open the door for 50,000 American students to come to China in the next five years. But in a recent interview with the BBC, the US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, accused parts of the Chinese government of not taking this pledge seriously. He said that on dozens of occasions the security forces or a government ministry have prevented Chinese citizens from participating in public diplomacy run by the US. On the other side, Chinese students and academics have reported being unfairly targeted by US border officials. Lucy, however, remains optimistic that she will be able to travel to America one day, to promote Chinese culture. And, as the music strikes up nearby, she urges Americans to visit and experience China. “We may be a little bit reserved sometimes and not as outgoing or as extrovert as US people, but we are welcoming,” she says as she heads off to join her family.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly39yvde0go,Disabled orphans bear brunt of China's overseas adoption ban,"These kids, who make up the vast majority of those put up for adoption, face a painful wait for families.",5 days ago,2024-10-15 10:31:39.445528,China News,BBC,China,"Eight-year-old Grace Welch has been waiting since 2019 for her older sister to occupy the bed next to hers. Her parents had told her that, Penelope, a 10-year-old born in China, would be joining the family, who live in Kentucky in the US. Grace, also adopted from China, was born without her left forearm. Her mother, Aimee Welch, said Penelope too has a “serious but manageable” special need, although she did not wish to disclose it. The Welch family, who have four biological sons, sought to adopt children with disabilities after the birth of a nephew without arms. “He taught us all what a person with limb differences can achieve with the right love and support. His birth started us on the path towards adopting Grace,” Ms Welch said. “We believe in the dignity and worth of each person, just as they are, in all their diversity.” But the pandemic delayed their plans.  Then in September, China announced that it was putting a stop to international adoptions, including cases where families were already matched with adoptee children.  The painful wait will particularly determine the fates of China’s most vulnerable children - those with special needs. Up-to-date statistics are not readily available, but Beijing’s civil affairs ministry said that 95% of international adoptions between 2014 and 2018 involved children with disabilities. These children “will have no future” without international adoption as they are unlikely to be adopted domestically, says Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations. Ms Welch said Grace was especially saddened by the news that Penelope may never come home: “She told me, ‘We were meant to be a family of eight so that everyone could have a buddy.’” Ms Welch called on China to “keep the promises made to the children already matched with adoptive parents”.  Beijing has not commented since the September announcement, when it thanked families for their “love in adopting children from China"". It said the ban was in line with international agreements and showed China’s “overall development and progress”. China began allowing international adoptions in 1992 as the country was opening up, and they peaked in the mid 2000s. More than 160,000 children have been adopted by families across the world in the last three decades.  A contentious one-child policy had forced families to give up children, especially girls and kids with special needs. Social stigma around disability had also led to more children with special needs ending up in orphanages. Dani Nelson, who was adopted to the US in 2017, said she was given basic care at an orphanage in the southwestern city of Guiyang, but it was “not enough for me to live a normal life”. The 21-year-old was born with spina bifida - a spinal defect - and hydrocephalus, which is a neurological disorder that causes water to gather around her brain. In her first three years in the US, she had seven surgeries which she said helped her “lead a normal life”.  “I joined a swim team. I got a job… Adoption saved my life,” said Ms Nelson, who now works as a cashier at a coffee shop.  Like in many Asian societies, disabled people in China face discrimination and are sometimes even seen as a source of “bad luck”. China has made some strides in improving accessibility to the disabled, but public infrastructure, especially in rural areas, are still weaker than countries in the West. It has only recently started developing education institutions and curricula for students with special needs. Only the most seriously disabled receive financial support from the government.  The BBC had previously interviewed Chinese adults with special needs whose parents have had to stop working to care for them. Aware of these challenges, waiting families are concerned about what will happen to the children they were meant to adopt, some of whom need urgent medical treatment. Meghan and David Briggs were matched with a boy in Zhengzhou, Henan, in 2020. The 10-year-old has a “moderate special need that requires medical intervention”, Mrs Briggs said. The couple live with their biological son, also 10, in Pennsylvania. Mr Briggs said the family made a “wilful choice” to adopt a child who is more vulnerable and less likely to get the specialised care and therapy in an institution in China than with a family in the US. “Such care is a financial and emotional responsibility. We were prepared to offer this care because we view this child as our family,” said Mr Briggs, who himself was adopted from South Korea. “He was promised a family by his own government,” Ms Briggs said. “The children are the ones who will suffer with this decision,” she said. Not everyone agrees.  Some, including adult adoptees, are relieved about that Beijing has ended foreign adoption. “My experience as a transracial adoptee being raised in a predominantly white, Christian city is that you often get looked down upon. I was constantly reminded that I don’t belong,” said Lucy Sheen, who was adopted by a white family in the UK. Ms Sheen, now in her 60s, added that her adoptive family had little knowledge of her Chinese culture and heritage. She was once told off for asking to learn Mandarin. “Some adopters have a ‘white-saviour’ mentality or have the ideology that they are bringing us where they come from because ‘West is best’, I think that needs to change,” she added. Nanchang Project, a non-profit group that helps connect adoptees to their roots in China, said it felt “a sense of relief that no more children will be separated from their birthplace, culture, and identity”. “We hope this moment can shift focus toward the need for post-adoptive services to support Chinese adoptees and their families for the rest of their lives,” the group said in a statement last month. Under the new policy, China will only send children overseas for adoption if the adoptive parents are blood relatives. The BBC understands that US authorities are in talks with Beijing on whether a further exception can be made for waiting families. John and Anne Contant who were matched with five-year-old Corrine in 2019, said they “honour China’s decision to change course on their adoption policy”. “If there have been more families wanting to adopt domestically, that’s wonderful… Our ask is for these 300 children who have been matched [to families in the US] to be allowed to come home,” he said. The couple live in Chicago with six children. Three of them were adopted from China and live with albinism, as does Corinne. The Contants spoke to Corinne via WeChat when their plans to travel to China were shelved because of the pandemic. “Corinne met our children, saw her home and the room that had been prepared for her, and experienced the excitement our children felt in preparation for her arrival,” Mr Contant said. “In one of our conversations, she pointedly asked, ‘When are you coming to get me?’”"

For his first year in the job, he says he was paid almost 750,000 yuan ($106,200; £81,200). He was sure he would soon hit the million-yuan mark. Three years on, he is earning half of what he made back then. His pay was frozen last year, and an annual bonus, which had been a big part of his income, vanished. The “glow” of the industry has worn off, he says. It had once made him “feel fancy”. Now, he is just a “finance rat”, as he and his peers are mockingly called online. China’s once-thriving economy, which encouraged aspiration, is now sluggish. The country’s leader, Xi Jinping, has become wary of personal wealth and the challenges of widening inequality. Crackdowns on billionaires and businesses, from real estate to technology to finance, have been accompanied by socialist-style messaging on enduring hardship and striving for China’s prosperity. Even celebrities have been told to show off less online.  Loyalty to the Communist Party and country, people are told, now trumps the personal ambition that had transformed Chinese society in the last few decades. Mr Chen's swanky lifestyle has certainly felt the pinch from this U-turn. He traded a holiday in Europe for a cheaper option: South East Asia. And he says he “wouldn’t even think about” buying again from luxury brands like “Burberry or Louis Vuitton”. But at least ordinary workers like him are less likely to find themselves in trouble with the law. Dozens of finance officials and banking bosses have been detained, including the former chairman of the Bank of China. On Thursday, the former vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, Fan Yifei, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve,  according to state media. Fan was found guilty of accepting bribes worth more than 386 million yuan ($54.6m; £41.8m).  The industry is under pressure. While few companies have publicly admitted it, pay cuts in banking and investment firms are a hot topic on Chinese social media. Posts about falling salaries have generated millions of views in recent months. And hashtags like “changing career from finance” and “quitting finance” have gained more than two million views on the popular social media platform Xiaohongshu. Some finance workers have been seeing their income shrink since the start of the pandemic but many see one viral social media post as a turning point. In July 2022, a Xiaohongshu user sparked outrage after boasting about her 29-year-old husband’s 82,500-yuan monthly pay at top financial services company, China International Capital Corporation. People were stunned by the huge gap between what a finance worker was getting paid and their own wages. The average monthly salary in the country's richest city, Shanghai, was just over 12,000 yuan. It reignited a debate about incomes in the industry that had been started by another salary-flaunting online user earlier that year. Those posts came just months after Xi called for “common prosperity” - a policy to narrow the growing wealth gap. In August 2022, China’s finance ministry published new rules requiring firms to “optimise the internal income distribution and scientifically design the salary system”. The following year, the country's top corruption watchdog criticised the ideas of “finance elites” and the “only money matters” approach, making finance a clearer target for the country’s ongoing anti-corruption campaign. The changes came in a sweeping but discreet way, according to Alex*, a manager at a state-controlled bank in China’s capital, Beijing. “You would not see the order put into written words - even if there is [an official] document it’s certainly not for people on our level to see. But everyone knows there is a cap on it [salaries] now. We just don’t know how much the cap is.” Alex says employers are also struggling to deal with the pace of the crackdown: “In many banks, the orders could change unexpectedly fast.” “They would issue the annual guidance in February, and by June or July, they would realise that the payment of salaries has exceeded the requirement. They then would come up with ways to set up performance goals to deduct people’s pay.” Mr Chen says his workload has shrunk significantly as the number of companies launching shares on the stock market has fallen. Foreign investment has decreased in China, and domestic businesses have also turned cautious - because of the crackdowns and weak consumption. In the past his work often involved new projects that would bring money into his firm. Now his days are mostly filled with chores like organising the data from his previous projects. “The morale of the team has been very low, the discussion behind the bosses backs are mostly negative. People are talking what to do in three to five years.” It’s hard to estimate if people are leaving the industry in large numbers, although there have been some layoffs. Jobs are also scarce in China now, so even a lower-paying finance job is still worth keeping. But the frustration is evident. A user on Xiaohongshu compared switching jobs to changing seats - except, he wrote, “if you stand up you might find your seat is gone.” Mr Chen says that it's not just the authorities that have fallen out of love with finance workers, it's Chinese society in general. “We are no longer wanted even for a blind date. You would be told not to go once they hear you work in finance.” *The names of the finance workers have been changed to protect their identities."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmwrpe3m3do,Uncertainty for families as China ends foreign adoptions,"Beijing has given little reason for the change, only saying it was line with international agreements.",6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:39.638452,China News,BBC,China,"China has announced that it is ending the practice of allowing children to be adopted overseas, bringing uncertainty to families currently going through the process. A spokeswoman said that the rule change was in line with the spirit of international agreements. At least 150,000 Chinese children have been adopted abroad in the last three decades. More than 82,000 have gone to the US, a greater number than anywhere else in the world. At a daily briefing Thursday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in the future Beijing would only allow foreign nationals who are relatives to adopt Chinese children. She did not explain the reason for the decision, other than saying it was in line with international agreements. Ms Mao thanked families ""for their desire and love in adopting children from China"". The ban on foreign adoptions has created uncertainty for hundreds of families in the US currently going through the process of adopting children from China. In a call with US diplomats in China, Beijing said it would ""not continue to process cases at any stage"" other than those cases covered by an exception clause. This position was confirmed by spokeswoman Ms Mao. Washington is seeking clarification from China's civic ministry. China's controversial one-child policy, introduced in 1979 when the country was worried about a surging population, forced many families to abandon their children. Families that violated the rules were fined and, in some cases, lost jobs. In a culture that historically favours boys over girls, it often meant that female babies were given up. International adoption was formalised in the 1990s, and since then tens of thousands of children have been adopted, with about half going to parents in the US - including celebrities like Meg Ryan and Woody Allen. However, the international adoption programme has at various times come under criticism. In 2013, Chinese police rescued 92 abducted children and arrested suspected members of a trafficking network.  Critics at the time pointed to China's one-child policy and adoption laws, which they said had created a thriving underground market for buying children. A number of countries have expressed concerns about international adoptions.  Denmark has closed its only overseas adoption agency, over concerns about fabricated documents. The Netherlands has also said it will no longer allow its citizens to adopt children from abroad.  But Beijing has also altered the way it views children. In stark contrast to the position taken by officials at end of the 1970s, the country's leaders now worry there are not enough babies being born to sustain the population. In 2016 China scrapped the one-child policy and in 2021 Beijing formally revised its laws to allow married couples to have up to three children. In recent years, the Chinese government also offered tax breaks and better maternal healthcare, among other incentives, in an attempt to reverse, or at least slow, the falling birth rate. But these polices have not lead to a sustained increase in births, and in 2023 the country's total population fell for the first time in 60 years."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e95lny0x9o,Xi Jinping is worried about the economy - what do Chinese people think?,Two new pieces of research offer a rare glimpse into how Chinese people feel about their future.,1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:39.832299,China News,BBC,China,"China’s sputtering economy has its worried leaders pulling out all the stops.  They have unveiled stimulus measures, offered rare cash handouts, held a surprise meeting to kickstart growth and tried to shake up an ailing property market with a raft of decisions - they did all of this in the last week. On Monday, Xi himself spoke of ""potential dangers"" and being ""well-prepared"" to overcome grave challenges, which many believe was a reference to the economy.    What is less clear is how the slowdown has affected ordinary Chinese people, whose expectations and frustrations are often heavily censored. But two new pieces of research offer some insight. The first, a survey of Chinese attitudes towards the economy, found that people were growing pessimistic and disillusioned about their prospects. The second is a record of protests, both physical and online, that noted a rise in incidents driven by economic grievances. Although far from complete, the picture neverthless provides a rare glimpse into the current economic climate, and how Chinese people feel about their future. Beyond the crisis in real estate, steep public debt and rising unemployment have hit savings and spending. The world’s second-largest economy may miss its own growth target - 5% - this year. That is sobering for the Chinese Communist Party. Explosive growth turned China into a global power, and stable prosperity was the carrot offered by a repressive regime that would never loosen its grip on the stick. The slowdown hit as the pandemic ended, partly driven by three years of sudden and complete lockdowns, which strangled economic activity. And that contrast between the years before and after the pandemic is evident in the research by American professors Martin Whyte of Harvard University, Scott Rozelle of Stanford University's Center on China's Economy and Stanford masters student Michael Alisky. They conducted their surveys in 2004 and 2009, before Xi Jinping became China’s leader, and during his rule in 2014 and 2023. The sample sizes varied, ranging between 3,000 and 7,500. In 2004, nearly 60% of the respondents said their families’ economic situation had improved over the past five years - and just as many of them felt optimistic about the next five years.  The figures jumped in 2009 and 2014 - with 72.4% and 76.5% respectively saying  things had improved, while 68.8% and 73% were hopeful about the future.  However in 2023, only 38.8% felt life had got better for their families. And less than half - about 47% - believed things would improve over the next five years. Meanwhile, the proportion of those who felt pessimistic about the future rose, from just 2.3% in 2004 to 16% in 2023. While the surveys were of a nationally representative sample aged 20 to 60, getting access to a broad range of opinions is a challenge in authoritarian China.  Respondents were from 26 Chinese provinces and administrative regions. The 2023 surveys excluded Xinjiang and parts of Tibet - Mr Whyte said it was “a combination of extra costs due to remote locations and political sensitivity”. Home to ethnic minorities, these tightly controlled areas in the north-west have long bristled under Beijing's rule.  Those who were not willing to speak their minds did not participate in the survey, the researchers said. Those who did shared their views when they were told it was for academic purposes, and would remain confidential.   Their anxieties are reflected in the choices that are being made by many young Chinese people. With unemployment on the rise, millions of college graduates have been forced to accept low-wage jobs, while others have embraced a “lie flat” attitude, pushing back against relentless work. Still others have opted to be “full-time children”, returning home to their parents because they cannot find a job, or are burnt out. Analysts believe China’s iron-fisted management of Covid-19 played a big role in undoing people’s optimism. “[It] was a turning point for many… It reminded everyone of how authoritarian the state was. People felt policed like never before,” said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. Many people were depressed and the subsequent pay cuts ""reinforced the confidence crisis,” he added. Moxi, 38, was one of them. He left his job as a psychiatrist and moved to Dali, a lakeside city in southwestern China now popular with young people who want a break from high-pressure jobs. ""When I was still a psychiatrist, I didn't even have the time or energy to think about where my life was heading,"" he told the BBC. ""There was no room for optimism or pessimism. It was just work."" Work, however, no longer seems to signal a promising future, according to the survey. In 2004, 2009 and 2014, more than six in 10 respondents agreed that ""effort is always rewarded"" in China. Those who disagreed hovered around 15%. Come 2023, the sentiment flipped. Only 28.3% believed that their hard work would pay off, while a third of them disagreed. The disagreement was strongest among lower-income families, who earned less than 50,000 yuan ($6,989; £5,442) a year. Chinese people are often told that the years spent studying and chasing degrees will be rewarded with financial success. Part of this expectation has been shaped by a tumultuous history, where people gritted their teeth through the pain of wars and famine, and plodded on. Chinese leaders, too, have touted such a work ethic. Xi's Chinese Dream, for example, echoes the American Dream, where hard work and talent pay off. He has urged young people to ""eat bitterness"", a Chinese phrase for enduring hardship. But in 2023, a majority of the respondents in the Whyte and Rozelle study believed people were rich because of the privilege afforded by their families and connections. A decade earlier, respondents had attributed wealth to ability, talent, a good education and hard work. This is despite Xi’s signature “common prosperity” policy aimed at narrowing the wealth gap, although critics say it has only resulted in a crackdown on businesses.  There are other indicators of discontent, such as an 18% rise in protests in the second quarter of 2024, compared with the same period last year, according to the China Dissent Monitor (CDM). The study defines protests as any instance when people voice grievances or advance their interests in ways that are in contention with authority - this could happen physically or online. Such episodes, however small, are still telling in China, where even lone protesters are swiftly tracked down and detained. A least three in four cases are due to economic grievances, said Kevin Slaten, one of the CDM study's four editors. Starting in June 2022, the group has documented nearly 6,400 such events so far. They saw a rise in protests led by rural residents and blue-collar workers over land grabs and low wages, but also noted middle-class citizens organising because of the real estate crisis. Protests by homeowners and construction workers made up 44% of the cases across more than 370 cities. ""This does not immediately mean China’s economy is imploding,” Mr Slaten was quick to stress.  Although, he added, ""it is difficult to predict"" how such ""dissent may accelerate if the economy keeps getting worse"".  Chinese leaders are certainly concerned. Between August 2023 and Janaury 2024, Beijing stopped releasing youth unemployment figures after they hit a record high. At one point, officials coined the term ""slow employment"" to describe those who were taking time to find a job - a separate category, they said, from the jobless.  Censors have been cracking down on any source of financial frustration - vocal online posts are promptly scrubbed, while influencers have been blocked on social media for flaunting luxurious tastes. State media has defended the bans as part of the effort to create a “civilised, healthy and harmonious” environment. More alarming perhaps are reports last week that a top economist, Zhu Hengpeng, has been detained for criticising Xi's handling of the economy.  The Communist Party tries to control the narrative by “shaping what information people have access to, or what is perceived as negative”, Mr Slaten said. CDM’s research shows that, despite the level of state control, discontent has fuelled protests - and that will worry Beijing. In November 2022, a deadly fire - which killed at least 10 people who were not allowed to leave the building during a Covid lockdown - brought thousands onto the streets in different parts of China to protest against crushing zero-Covid policies. Whyte, Rozelle and Alisky don't think their findings suggest “popular anger about… inequality is likely to explode in a social volcano of protest"". But the economic slowdown has begun to ""undermine"" the legitimacy the Party has built up through ""decades of sustained economic growth and improved living standards"", they write. The pandemic still haunts many Chinese people, said Yun Zhou, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan. Beijing’s “stringent yet mercurial responses” during the pandemic have heightened people’s insecurity about the future.  And this is particularly visceral among marginalised groups, she added, such as women caught in a “severely discriminatory” labour market and rural residents who have long been excluded from welfare coverage. Under China’s contentious “hukou” system of household registration, migrant workers in cities are not allowed to use public services, such as enrolling their children in government-run schools. But young people from cities - like Moxi - have flocked to remote towns, drawn by low rents, picturesque landscapes and greater freedom to chase their dreams. Moxi is relieved to have found a slower pace of life in Dali. “The number of patients who came to me for depression and anxiety disorders only increased as the economy boomed,"" he said, recalling his past work as a psychiatrist.  ""There’s a big difference between China doing well, and Chinese people doing well.""  Whyte, Rozelle and Alisky’s research is based on four sets of academic surveys conducted between 2004 and 2023. In-person surveys were conducted together with colleagues at Peking University's Research Center on Contemporary China (RCCC) in 2004, 2009 and 2014. Participants ranged in age from 18-70 and came from 29 provinces. Tibet and Xingiang were excluded. In 2023, three rounds of online surveys, at the end of the second, third and fourth quarters, were conducted by the Survey and Research Centre for China Household Finance (CHFS) at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, China. Participants ranged in age from 20-60. The same questions were used in all surveys. To make responses comparable across all four years, the researchers excluded participants aged 18-19 and 61-70 and reweighted all answers to be nationally representative. All surveys contain a margin of error. The study has been accepted for publication by The China Journal and is expected to be published in 2025. Researchers for the China Dissent Monitor (CDM) have collected data on “dissent events” across China since June 2022 from a variety of non-government sources including news reports, social media platforms operating in the country and civil society organisations. Dissent events are defined as instances where a person or persons use public and non-official means of expressing their dissatisfaction. Each event is highly visible and also subject to or at risk of government response, through physical repression or censorship. These can include viral social media posts, demonstrations, banner drops and strikes, among others. Many events are difficult to independently verify.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9jgmexmx4o,BBC boss warns of Russian and Chinese propaganda,"The UK is losing out because of cuts to the World Service, the BBC's director general warns.",13 hrs ago,2024-10-15 10:31:49.629689,China News,BBC,China,"The UK is struggling to counter a rise in ""pure propaganda"" from countries like Russia and China because of cuts to the World Service, the BBC's director general has warned. Tim Davie called for more funding for its global services, a decade after the government stopped paying for most of the World Service. Last year, the BBC ended its Arabic, Persian and Hindi radio services, among others, as part of a plan to save £28.5m a year. Mr Davie told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday that, in contrast, ""malign powers, frankly - Russia, China, others - see the benefit of investing heavily in media, bordering into pure propaganda"". Russia and China are filling the gaps by spending between £6bn and £8bn on expanding their global media activities, including in countries like Lebanon, he will tell the Future Resilience Forum on Monday. In Lebanon, Russian-backed media is now transmitting on the radio frequency previously occupied by BBC Arabic, he said. BBC Monitoring listened to that Russian output on the day thousands of pagers and radio devices exploded last month. ""What they heard was unchallenged propaganda and narratives being delivered to local communities,"" Mr Davie said. ""Had the BBC been able to retain our impartial radio output, these messages would have been much harder for local audiences to find. ""In this context, the further retreat of the BBC World Service should be a cause for serious global concern."" The UK government paid for the World Service in full until 2014, when it handed over most of the cost to the BBC. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office currently pays £104m a year towards the World Service's total budget of £366m. The service reaches 320 million people a week across radio, TV and digital output.  In 2022, the corporation decided to stop broadcasting on radio in 10 languages, and to close more than 380 World Service jobs. ""We haven't closed a lot of language services,"" Mr Davie told Radio 4, saying the cuts that have been made have been a result of ""tight funding settlements, and there's only so much you can ask of the UK licence fee payer to pay for language services"". ""For decades this was funded by government,"" Mr Davie continued. ""There are very clear examples, where we've taken away BBC Arabic on radio, for instance... [and] others have come in [such as] Russian-backed media coming into Lebanon. ""I've got other examples where you see China and Russia deliberately spending billions of dollars on that strategic objective."" He added: ""This has to be a matter long term for the central government decision-making to say, 'OK, we have to, as a country, invest', and I don't think it's appropriate to charge all of this to the UK licence fee payer. ""It is a strategic decision and one I think we should value."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are fully committed to a successful BBC World Service that continues to provide essential, impartial and accurate news coverage and programming reaching millions of people across the globe."" Culture secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Radio 5 Live, in response to Davie's comments: ""We are very aware of the pressures that he describes and the way in which other state actors are investing in their own state-backed forms of media. And the critical role that the BBC World Service plays is the light on the hill for people all around the world.  ""But he is also very aware of the acute pressures on the public finances that we've inherited after a decade and a half of economic mismanagement. And so it's a conversation that we are going to have... not just around the licence fee, but also early next year (which) will kick off the process to renew the BBC's charter."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e1zjqdlp2o,Screams and chaos: Eyewitnesses describe Shanghai mall stabbings,This incident is the latest in a spate of knife attacks to hit China this year.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:49.707798,China News,BBC,China,"On Monday night, just 20 minutes before closing time, chaos erupted at the Ludu International Shopping Plaza in southwestern Shanghai’s Songjiang district. Police say that a 37-year-old man surnamed Lin, went on a stabbing spree lunging at strangers as he traversed the maze-like shopping centre, past food outlets and upstairs to a Wallmart. He managed to strike 18 people and killed three of them. A 28-year-old construction worker identified only as Zheng had just finished eating barbeque with a friend when he saw people “running, hiding and screaming”. He tells us that he and his friend saw the man with his knives and tried to stop him - running at him and throwing chairs to try to slow him down or knock the weapons out of his hands. But Zheng says the man was moving too quickly, and they lost him as he moved up to the second floor. “As everything became chaotic, we could only work out where he had gone to by hearing people’s screams,” Zheng says, adding, “As the attacker was stabbing people, he was shouting expletives in Chinese."" Zheng says he thought the killer’s route “was definitely pre-planned”. “I believe he deliberately chose the exits; he must have scouted the area beforehand.” Two young stallholders on the outside of the building – who saw police bring Lin to the ground – say he strode out of the shopping centre carrying a knife in each hand. Rather than running away from the scene of the carnage he had caused, he appeared calm, as if he knew exactly what he was doing. They tell the BBC that he carried himself as if he was in control of the situation, even as police officers caught him. Footage shared on social media captured the moment he was then taken away, his jacket splashed with what appeared to be the blood of his victims. Police say he had come to Shanghai with the aim of ""venting his anger… due to a personal economic dispute"" and that their investigations are continuing. But barely a day later, when the BBC visited the Ludu International Shopping Plaza, it was as if this carnage never happened. There was no extended crime scene lockdown. Just over 12 hours after the deadly attack, the blood had been mopped up, and the plaza was open for business as usual. Yet the shock remains. A young shopkeeper, who had been rostered off at the time of the attack, says she is now scared to come to work. “It’s like a movie. You can’t believe there’d be something so terrifying right next to you”. She points to the extra security and police now stationed near her clothes shop. “Look at them,” she says, while admitting that she does feel safer having these officers around. We ask about her colleagues who were at work and had to run with others who were screaming through the corridors, in order to stay alive. “Of course they were terrified. None of them came to work today. They say they don’t dare to return,” she says. One young woman who operates a stall selling phone accessories and other small electrical goods says that if she had delayed shutting shop by just 10 minutes, she would have been in the attacker's path. “When I heard about it later, I was so scared I couldn’t sleep. Today I arrived at work obviously still scared.” She says she feels very lucky but terrified by how close she came to such extreme danger. This incident is the latest in a spate of knife attacks to hit China this year. There has been discussion about economic pressures causing rifts in society, not to excuse horrendous acts like this but in an attempt to explain the seemingly inexplicable. Then there is the question of mental illness here and how it is treated. For many years, knife attacks on strangers have come in waves in this country and they seem to be horrific copycat attempts at gaining attention. Either way, there is something very troubling in China leading to these bloody assaults. This week is supposed to be a time to celebrate what China has become, 75 years after the Communist Party came to power, but a killing spree ushered in the seven-day break. Shocking footage of those who were injured, struggling in pain on the floor, spread on social media. A woman nursing a stabbed toddler on her lap could be seen sobbing as she tried to telephone for help. Her other hand shook uncontrollably. At the time of writing, a family member who declined to be identified, told the BBC that the two and a half year old girl was still in intensive care. The sharing of these images and discussion of the attack is now being censored on China’s tightly controlled social media platforms although some are finding ways to talk about the subject using certain expressions to avoid being blocked. Yet in online discussion forums, there are still those who’ve welcomed the fact that in this country – as opposed to say the United States – it is very difficult for ordinary people to get hold of guns, as access to automatic weapons would mean many more deaths in cases like this. Yet the official move to try to erase this incident, and others like it, from the public discourse reveals the extent to which this is troubling for the government. Managers from Walmart and the entire Ludu Plaza stopped many staff from speaking to us, sometimes even interrupting us mid-interview. Zheng for his part, says that on returning to the shopping centre the next day, he could not believe everything was simply “cleaned up” - no flowers. Nothing to mark the attack. “I can only feel sorrow for the victims,” he said."

Chinese police said they arrested a 37-year-old man surnamed Lin at the scene, adding that he had come to Shanghai to ""vent his anger due to a personal economic dispute"". Further investigations are continuing.  The incident took place at a shopping mall in Songjiang, a densely populated district in the city's south-west, which is also home to several universities. Police said the three people who died succumbed to their injuries at hospital. The others ""did not sustain life-threatening wounds"" and are not believed to be in danger. ""There was blood everywhere,"" an eyewitnes surnamed Shi told BBC News. Mr Shi, who runs a jewellery store at the ground floor of the Ludu International Commercial Plaza, said dozens of firefighters and special weapons and tactics (SWAT) officers entered the mall, and asked people to evacuate. ""I didn’t know what was happening, but suddenly, I saw people running in a panic,"" he said. ""No one had ever experienced something like this, and we weren’t mentally prepared for it... This kind of random incident is terrifying and unsettling,"" he said, adding that he had ""narrowly escaped"" death. Discussions about the incident now appear to have been censored on Chinese social media. The supermarket was open for business on Tuesday but with additional security.  Firearms are banned in China but the country has seen a spate of knife attacks in recent months. Last month, a 10-year-old Japanese student died a day after he was stabbed near his school in southern China. In June this year, four US college instructors were stabbed in a public park in the northeast city of Jilin. In May, a man stabbed dead two people and wounded 21 others at a hospital in the southern province of Yunnan."

Sabalenka's last defeat came on 10 August in the quarter-finals of the Canadian Open. The three-time Grand Slam champion has won 46 of her 57 singles matches in 2024. Sabalenka claimed the Cincinnati Open and the US Open during her current unbeaten run. The Belarusian can put pressure on world number one Iga Swiatek, who has skipped the China Open due to personal matters, if she goes all the way in Beijing.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxl8j8lyjzo,Fury as Filipino officials pose with 'China spy mayor',Disgraced ex-mayor Alice Guo flashes a wide smile and the peace sign in photos with her escorts.,6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:50.004625,China News,BBC,China,"Senior Filipino officials have sparked outrage for posing for photos with a former smalltown mayor accused of spying for China, as they escorted her home from Indonesia. Alice Guo is seen flashing a wide smile and the peace sign with the smiling interior minister and chief of the Philippine National Police. The photo was allegedly taken before they boarded a Manila-bound private jet in Jakarta late on Thursday. Ms Guo's story which has involved illegal scam centres, questions over her citizenship and a dubious account of her childhood, has gripped the Philippines for months. She was arrested just outside Jakarta on Wednesday, after a weeks-long chase. Authorities accuse Ms Guo of protecting scam centres and human trafficking syndicates that had used online casinos or Pogos (Philippine Online Gaming Operations) for cover while she was the mayor of Bamban. Her case has exposed how online casinos with mainland Chinese clients have long been used as a front for organised crime. Lawmakers have also accused Ms Guo of forging her Filipino citizenship and being a Chinese national, allowing her to run for public office and win on her first try, despite being a political novice. Her case has gripped the public imagination at a time when  Manila continues to spar with Beijing over reefs and outcrops in the South China Sea. Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos, who fetched Ms Guo from Jakarta, said he had the photo taken with her for ""documentation"". Mr Abalos said he was unaware that Ms Guo had posed with a wide smile and flashed the peace sign. ""She requested to speak with me and the [national police] chief because she had been receiving death threats. I told her she had nothing to fear because the police will protect her,"" he said in a press conference in Manila. ""We wanted to document it so that everything is clear. I couldn't see what she was doing because I was looking at the camera,"" he said. Ms Guo, who was in the same press conference, was asked about the photo. She said she had indeed told Mr Abalos and the PNP chief, Gen. Rommel Marbil, about the threats to her life. ""I asked for their help. I was also happy that I saw them. I feel safe,"" Ms Guo said.   By that time, Ms Guo had changed into an orange police detainee shirt. At the airport in Jakarta, she was casually dressed in a white striped t-shirt and jeans. She was also not in handcuffs. Another handout photo from the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation showed Ms Guo smiling with the authorities in the backseat of a vehicle. The criticism on social media was swift. ""We want answers, NOT a photoshoot. Alice Guo, the fake Filipino, has a lot of explaining to do,"" said Sen Risa Hontioveros, who is leading an inquiry in parliament on Ms Guo's case. ""The Philippine justice system is a circus,"" one X user said. ""Probably one of the most disturbing clips in the news right now. How can Alice Guo manage to still smile and wink like a movie star?"" another X user said. Another X user said the interior secretary and the police chief had posed for a photo with someone that is ""symbolic of their own failure""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qvy913012o,Aston Martin shares shaken after profit warning,"The company, famed for its links to James Bond, has been hit by falling sales in China.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:50.104133,China News,BBC,China,"Luxury carmaker Aston Martin's share price sank more than 20% after it said profits will be lower than expected this year. The company, famed for its links to fictional superspy James Bond, has been hit by supply chain issues and falling sales in China. The share price of Stellantis, the owner of brands such as Peugeot, Citroen, Fiat and Jeep, also plummeted on Monday after a profit warning. Carmakers across Europe have been suffering lately, with disappointing sales and increased competition from abroad taking a heavy toll on earnings. Aston Martin is a prestige brand which makes upmarket cars in relatively small quantities. Last year, it sold 6,620 vehicles, with about a fifth of those going to the Asia-Pacific region. However, the company says it has been hit by a fall in demand in China, where a slowing economy has affected sales of luxury cars.  It has also been affected by problems at a number of suppliers, which have affected its ability to build a number of new models. As a result, Aston says it will make about 1,000 fewer cars than originally planned this year.  Sales, which had originally been forecast to rise, are now expected to be lower than in 2023, and earnings will fall short of current market expectations. Adrian Hallmark, who became Aston Martin’s chief executive a few weeks ago, said it had become clear that “decisive action” was needed to adjust output.  But he added that he was “even more convinced than before” about the brand’s potential for growth. Meanwhile, Stellantis has become the latest large-scale carmaker to revise its financial forecasts, thanks to a deterioration in the industry outlook. The company has been struggling with weak demand in the US, a key market, where it has been forced to offer discounts in order to shift unsold stock.  It has also been facing increased competition from Chinese brands, which have been expanding aggressively abroad. As a result, it said it expects its profit margins to be significantly lower than previously thought this year.  The announcement sent its shares tumbling. By lunchtime on Monday, the price was down more than 14%. The problems at Stellantis and Aston Martin reflect a wider malaise in the European car industry.  On Friday, Volkswagen issued its second profit warning in three months, while it has also suggested it might have to close plants in Germany for the first time in its history. Its German rivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW have also downgraded their profit forecasts in recent weeks. Among the common issues are falling sales in China – until recently a highly lucrative market for expensive and profitable high-end models – coupled with growing competition from Chinese brands in other markets. According to Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research, European firms have been caught out by a wave of ""unsustainable"" discounting by Chinese brands in their home market, which has affected sales of high-priced vehicles. “German brands, and VW in particular, have been caught off-guard by the pace of change in China” he explains. Sales of electric cars, which manufacturers have invested huge sums in developing, have been faltering badly in Europe. According to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, sales of battery-powered cars were down nearly 44% in August compared to the same period a year ago, while their share of the market dropped to 14.4%, compared to 21% in 2023. The decline has followed the removal or reduction of incentives for electric car buyers in a number of European markets, including France and Germany. On Friday, EU nations are due to vote on plans to impose steep tariffs on imports of electric vehicles from China. The measures are designed to protect local producers from unfair competition. The European Commission claims Chinese manufacturers benefit from illegal subsidies from the Chinese government – and believes tariffs will create a level playing field.  But the plan is controversial, and has received a mixed reception from manufacturers."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8vz8j60kno,Maldives president visits India amid trouble in tourist paradise,President Muizzu is visiting India at a time when his country is staring at an economic crisis.,6 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:50.217000,China News,BBC,China,"Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu is expected to seek a bailout during his visit to India this week as the archipelago nation stares at an economic crisis with fears of debt default. It’s Muizzu's first official bilateral visit after he was voted to power late last year following a campaign centred on an 'India out' policy, with a promise to reduce Delhi's influence. Since then, ties have been strained between the countries but experts say the visit indicates that the Maldives can't afford to ignore its giant neighbour.  The foreign exchange reserves of the Maldives stood at about $440m (£334m) in September, just enough for one-and-a-half months of imports. Last month, global agency Moody’s downgraded the Maldives' credit rating, saying that “default risks have risen materially”. An Indian bailout will bolster the country’s foreign currency reserves. Soon after he took charge, Muizzu chose to travel to Turkey and China before visiting India - his visit to Beijing in January was seen as a high-profile diplomatic snub to Delhi as previous Maldivian leaders first visited Delhi after being elected. Around the same time, a controversy erupted in India after three Maldivian officials made derogatory comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “President Muizzu’s visit is a turnaround in several ways,” says Azim Zahir, a Maldives analyst and lecturer at the University of Western Australia. “Most notably, the visit is a realisation of how dependent the Maldives is on India, a dependency that no other country will find easy to fill,” he says. The Maldives consists of about 1,200 coral islands and atolls located in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The archipelago has a population of about 520,000 compared to India’s 1.4 billion. As a small island nation, the Maldives depends on its giant neighbour India for most of its food, infrastructure building and healthcare. Delhi and Male have not officially confirmed that a financial package for the Maldives is on the agenda during the visit. But experts believe it will be part of the discussion. “The key priority of Muizzu’s visit is to secure a financial helpline in the form of grant-in-aid and restructuring debt repayments,” a senior Maldivian editor, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. Muizzu also wants a “$400m currency swap deal sought by the Maldives central bank to shore up depleted foreign exchange reserves”, he added. The ratings agency Moody’s further expressed serious concerns over Male’s financial situation, saying that ""(foreign) reserves remain significantly below the government’s external debt service of around $600m in 2025 and over $1bn in 2026"". The public debt of the Maldives is about $8bn, including about $1.4bn it owes each to China and India. “Despite Muizzu stating on several occasions that China has given a green signal for deferring debt payments for five years, financial assistance from Beijing has not been forthcoming,” the Maldivian editor said. With no other country coming to the rescue, it appears that Muizzu is now reaching out to India to mend strained ties. “It’s about resetting the tone and negative rhetoric from senior officials of Muizzu’s government that has considerably impacted Indian tourist arrivals,” says Zahir. India has long wielded influence over the Maldives, whose strategic position in its backyard allowed it to monitor a crucial part of the Indian Ocean. But Muizzu wanted to change that by moving closer to China. In January, Muizzu’s administration gave an ultimatum to India to withdraw about 80 troops based in the country. Delhi said they were stationed there to man and operate two rescue and reconnaissance helicopters and a Dornier aircraft it had donated years ago. In the end, both countries agreed to replace troops with Indian civilian technical staff to operate the aircraft. A month after assuming charge, Muizzu's administration also announced that it would not renew a hydrographic survey agreement with India that was signed by the previous government to map the seabed in the Maldivian territorial waters. Then a row broke out after three of his deputy ministers made controversial comments about Modi, calling him a “clown”, “terrorist” and a ""puppet of Israel"". The remarks set off an uproar and calls to boycott the Maldives on Indian social media. Male said the comments were personal and did not represent the views of the government. The three ministers were suspended from the cabinet. In what was seen as a thinly-veiled criticism of the reaction on Indian social media, Muizzu said at the time: “We may be small, but that doesn’t give you the licence to bully us.” Muizzu’s administration also allowed the port call of a Chinese research ship, Xiang Yang Hong 3, much to Delhi's displeasure. Some saw it as a mission to collect data which could - at a later date - be used by the Chinese military in submarine operations. Nevertheless, there was a thaw in bilateral ties after Muizzu attended the swearing-in ceremony of Modi after he was elected for a third consecutive term in June this year. In August, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar's visit also gave a reboot to bilateral ties. ""The Maldives is one of the cornerstones of our ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy,"" Jaishankar said in Male. “To put it succinctly in the words of my Prime Minister Narendra Modi - for India, neighbourhood is a priority and, in the neighbourhood, Maldives is a priority,” he added. For Delhi, it’s a welcome change as it recently witnessed the ouster of the India-friendly government of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh and the return of KP Sharma Oli, who used to criticise India’s policies, as the prime minister of Nepal. Muizzu has realised that antagonising India is not an option and his pragmatism is not without reason. The number of Indian tourists visiting the Maldives dropped by 50,000 in the past year, resulting in an estimated loss of about $150m. He is aware if he doesn’t get financial support from India, the Maldives could become a paradise lost. That’s why his India visit is crucial."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ek1x3p7rjo,Maldives president in Delhi to seek aid and reboot ties,Mohamed Muizzu is expected to seek a bailout worth hundreds of millions of dollars during his India visit.,6 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:50.357587,China News,BBC,China,"Maldivian President Mohammed Muizzu has told the BBC that he is confident that India will come to the aid of the island nation as it faces an economic crisis. Muizzu, who begins a five-day visit to India on Sunday, is expected to seek a bailout worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives is staring at a debt default as its foreign exchange reserves have dropped to $440m (£334m), just enough for one-and-a-half months of imports. “India is fully cognizant of our fiscal situation, and as one of our biggest development partners, will always be ready to ease our burden, find better alternatives and solutions to the challenges we face,” Muizzu told the BBC in an email interview ahead of his visit. Experts point out that Muizzu's reconciliatory tone towards Delhi is a far cry from the rhetoric he adopted during his election campaign a year ago. That campaign had centred on an “India out” policy, demanding that Delhi must withdraw its troops from the island nation. Speaking to the BBC, Muizzu did not directly address his anti-India campaign but said: “We are confident that any differences can be addressed through open dialogue and mutual understanding."" An Indian relief package will bolster the country’s foreign currency reserves. Last month, global agency Moody’s downgraded the Maldives' credit rating, saying that “default risks have risen materially”. But Muizzu told the BBC that Male is not facing a sovereign debt default, adding that the country would not join an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme to handle the crisis. ""We have our own home-grown agenda,"" he said. However, Moody has said that “(foreign) reserves remain significantly below the government’s external debt service of around $600m in 2025 and over $1bn in 2026”. It’s not clear where Muizzu will find the money to overcome the reserves crisis and that’s where his Delhi visit is seen as crucial. India has already offered financial support worth $1.4bn to Male for various infrastructure and development projects. Since Muizzu came to power in November 2023, relations between Male and Delhi have become strained. Soon after taking over, he chose to travel to Turkey and China - his visit to the latter in January was seen especially as a high-profile snub to India as previous Maldivian leaders first visited Delhi after being elected. Around the same time, a controversy erupted in India after three Maldivian officials made derogatory comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Muizzu also gave an ultimatum to India to withdraw about 80 troops based in the country. Delhi said they were stationed there to maintain and operate two rescue and reconnaissance helicopters and a Dornier aircraft it had donated years ago. In the end, both countries reached a compromise by agreeing to replace soldiers with Indian civilian technical staff to operate the aircraft. Muizzu’s administration also announced that it would not renew a hydrographic survey agreement with India that was signed by the previous government to map the seabed in Maldivian territorial waters. But the Maldivian president defended his decision. “The decisions taken are based on our evolving domestic interests and strategic priorities. The will of the people, that elected me 10 months ago,” Muizzu said. “I believe both the Maldives and India have a better understanding of each others’ priorities and concerns,” he added. Some of Muizzu's decisions were seen as a way to reduce Delhi’s influence and forge closer ties with India’s rival China.  In February, Muizzu’s administration allowed the port call of a Chinese research ship, Xiang Yang Hong 3, in the Maldives, much to Delhi’s displeasure. Some saw it as a mission to collect data which could - at a later date - be used by the Chinese military for submarine operations. But Muizzu rejects the pro-China tag. “I have made clear our foreign policy the day I took office - that it is a ‘Maldives First’ policy. Our relationships with other nations are guided by the principles of mutual respect and trust, non-interference and the pursuit of peace and prosperity,” he insists. “We believe that through open communication and collaboration, we can address any concerns, contributing to a peaceful and prosperous Indian Ocean region,” he says. Despite Muizzu's attempts to move Male closer to Beijing, analysts say financial assistance from China hasn’t been forthcoming, As a result, the president's extraordinary turnaround towards India now is based on harsh realities. Muizzu’s Delhi visit ""is a realisation of how dependent the Maldives is on India, a dependency that no other country will find easy to fill"", says Azim Zahir, a Maldivian analyst."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm248g49nveo,Walz says he 'misspoke' in personal story about Tiananmen Square,"""I’m a knucklehead at times,"" the Democratic running mate says, conceding he was in the US when Chinese forces crushed protests.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:50.529431,China News,BBC,China,"US Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz has admitted during a live television debate that he ""misspoke"" when he claimed he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Kamala Harris' running mate was asked by a debate moderator why he had repeatedly said over the years he was in Hong Kong as China’s communist rulers crushed pro-democracy protests, when he was in fact back in his home state of Nebraska. Walz, who is governor of Minnesota, said: “I’ve not been perfect and I’m a knucklehead at times.” It was not the first time Walz has fallen afoul of fact-checkers this campaign cycle. His opponent on the debate stage, Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, has also courted controversy with unfounded claims in this campaign, most notably about Haitian immigrants eating pets.  In Tuesday night's CBS debate in New York City, the moderator asked Walz to explain why he had claimed he was in Hong Kong when Chinese forces killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of anti-government protesters in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, on 4 June 1989, shocking the world. Walz touted his work as a teacher, congressman and governor, before saying he sometimes gets ""caught up in the rhetoric"". When pressed by the moderator about the timing discrepancy, Walz replied: ""All I said on this was, I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just - that's what I've said."" He has previously said he was in Hong Kong a month before Tiananmen Square, then forged ahead with a yearlong teaching stint in the country in mainland China after the massacre. But news reports from the time show Walz was in Nebraska until that August, when he left for China. Republicans have branded him ""Tiananmen Tim"". Walz has also recently revised the amount of times he has been to China. In a 2016 interview he said he had visited the country ""about 30 times"". But the Harris-Walz campaign told US media this week the number of trips Walz took to China is ""likely closer to 15"". This is not the first time that the Harris-Walz campaign has acknowledged the running mate ""misspoke"". Aides for the Democratic ticket issued a clarification in August as it emerged Walz had talked in 2018 about ""weapons of war that I carried in war"" as a member of the National Guard. But Walz never served in combat. This summer he said he and his wife started their family thorough IVF - a fertility treatment that became politically charged this election cycle. His wife later clarified they used a different treatment, intrauterine insemination.

The JS Sazanami, a naval destroyer, travelled south through the strait on Wednesday, accompanied by ships from Australia and New Zealand.  It was on its way to military exercises in the South China Sea, Japanese media reported government ministers saying. The passage is a significant move by Japan, which is thought to have avoided sailing its ships through the strait in order not to upset China, which claims self-governed Taiwan and the strait.  Japan's government has declined to comment on the ship, citing military operation discretion.  But China on Thursday confirmed its military had responded to ""the activities of a Japanese Self-Defence Force ship entering the Taiwan Strait"". ""China is highly vigilant about the political intentions of Japan's actions and has lodged stern representations with Japan,"" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said. Chinese state newspaper Global Times, citing an unnamed source, said the Chinese military ""conducted tracking and monitoring throughout [the vessels'] entire course and had the situation under control"".  There has been an increase in patrols by the US and its allies to assert their freedom of navigation in the 180km (112-mile) Taiwan Strait. Both the US and Taiwan say it is a key shipping and trade route through which about half of the global container fleet passes, and is part of international waters and is open to all naval vessels. Beijing, which claims sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait, disagrees. For decades the US Pacific fleet was the only foreign navy that regularly transited the strait. But recently, it was joined by Canada and Australia, Britain and France. Two weeks ago Germany sailed two navy ships through the strait for the first time in decades. China's military accused Germany of increasing security risks by sailing though the strait on 13 September, but Berlin said it acted in accordance with international standards. It was the first time in 22 years for a German naval vessel to traverse the strait. These transits are highly political and designed to show China that America and its allies do not accept Beijing’s claims. For Japan, it is also another big step away from its long-held policy of not directly challenging China.  On Thursday, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary did not confirm details of the naval operation, but he said Japan felt a strong sense of crisis after repeated airspace violations by the Chinese military, which he said had occurred one after another over a short period of time. Taiwan has not commented on the passage, but its defence ministry said on Wednesday that it saw a surge in the number of Chinese military planes operating  around the island. Bec Strating, an international relations professor at La Trobe University in Australia, said Japan's reported transit is ""part of a broader pattern of greater naval presence by countries in and beyond Asia that are concerned about China's maritime assertions"". ""Japan in particular has been dealing with China's 'grey zone' tactics in the East China Sea,"" she told AFP news agency.  Grey zone warfare tactics are aimed at weakening an adversary over a prolonged period of time, analysts say. Last week, Beijing sent an aircraft carrier between two Japanese islands near Taiwan for the first time. In August, a Chinese spy plane flew inside Japan's airspace, prompting Tokyo to condemn the incursion as ""utterly unacceptable"" and a ""serious violation of sovereignty"".  The leaders of the Quad group of nations - Japan, Australia, India and the US - said last week that they would expand cooperation on maritime security to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea.

The deal was announced after Maldives President Mohammed Muizzu held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his five-day visit to India. The support includes a $400m currency swap deal and an additional 30bn rupees ($357m; £273m) in another swap agreement which will allow companies to do business in local currencies rather than in US dollars. The Maldivian president was given red carpet treatment after relations soured in recent months. Modi called his visit a ""new chapter"" in ties. ""India will always be there for the progress and prosperity of the people of Maldives,"" he said. The statements - and the Indian financial package - signal a significant improvement in relations between Male and Delhi, which have been strained since Muizzu came to power in November 2023. Soon after taking over, he chose to travel to Turkey and China - his visit to the latter in January was seen especially as a high-profile snub to India as previous Maldivian leaders traditionally visited Delhi first after being elected. Around the same time, India was angered by derogatory comments from three Maldivian officials about Modi. But analysts say the country’s ailing economy has made its leadership mend its ties with India.  The Maldives is staring at a debt default as its foreign exchange reserves have dropped to $440m (£334m), just enough for one-and-a-half months of imports. On Monday, Muizzu said he held ""extensive discussions"" with Modi to chart ""a path for the future collaboration between our two countries"". He thanked India and said the budgetary support would be ""instrumental in addressing foreign exchange issues"". The two countries have also agreed on a deal to start talks on a free trade agreement. Ahead of his meeting with Modi, Muizzu had told the BBC that he expected India to help the country as it has done in the past. “India is fully cognisant of our fiscal situation, and as one of our biggest development partners, will always be ready to ease our burden, find better alternatives and solutions to the challenges we face,” he said. Without referring to his anti-India campaign, he said: “We are confident that any differences can be addressed through open dialogue and mutual understanding.""

Wiktorowski, 43, joined Swiatek's team as coach in 2022 when she had one Grand Slam success to her name. The Pole helped Swiatek to four further Grand Slam titles, including three successive French Opens. She became the first Polish player to reach world number one in April 2022 and has spent a total of 123 weeks at the top of the rankings. ""After three years of the greatest achievements in my career, together with my coach Tomasz Wiktorowski we decided to part ways. I want to start with a big thank you and appreciating our work together,"" Swiatek wrote on Instagram. Muchova ends Sabalenka streak to reach China Open semis ""His experience, analytical and strategic attitude and enormous knowledge about tennis helped us to achieve things I've never dreamed of only a few months after we started working together."" Swiatek says she has held ""first talks"" with prospective new coaches and will take a ""couple of weeks"" to start work with her next appointment. She is not playing at the ongoing China Open, having withdrawn beforehand because of personal matters. The 23-year-old won the French Open and US Open during her opening season with Wiktorowski. During 2022, Swiatek embarked on a 37-match winning run - the longest streak by a woman this century. The Pole won a fifth Grand Slam - her fourth with Wiktorowski - at Roland Garros in June. But Swiatek was disappointed with her hard-court performances this season, exiting the Australian Open in the third round and the US Open at the quarter-finals stage. Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent: Swiatek says a chance to spend more time at home after three years of travelling will be welcome to Wiktorowski, and also indicates this is the right time for her to start working with a non-Polish coach. Piotr Sierzputowski guided her through the majority of her teenage years, with Swiatek suggesting in the past that she has been more comfortable being surrounded by people with whom she shares a language and a culture. It is, unusually, now four months since the world number one won a title. She has not played since losing to Jessica Pegula in the US Open quarter-finals, missed this week's China Open for personal reasons and will not play next week in Wuhan either ""after an important change in my team"". Swiatek has frequently criticised the relentless nature of the circuit and the increase in mandatory tournaments on the WTA Tour. She has already decided not to represent Poland in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals - which leaves next month's WTA Finals as perhaps her only appearance before the year is out.

Chris Newman, from the National Centre for Reptile Welfare (NCRW), told the BBC there seemed to be a ""worrying"" increase in cases, with three venomous scorpions appearing to have been shipped from China in the last month. ""We've had 200 stowaways this year. Twelve have been scorpions and three of those have been within the last month - the same species of scorpion from China,"" he said. It comes as a student from the University of Bristol discovered a live scorpion when she opened a clothing parcel from fast-fashion firm Shein, while a couple from Basingstoke told the BBC they were shocked to find a scorpion in a package ordered from Amazon last month.   Mr Newman said the apparent spike in cases reported to the charity has been concerning. ""In the scale of things, I'm sure there's millions of packages coming in from China, but to have three in the last month is worrying,"" he said. However, he said it was important to see it in context, adding: ""Overall, it's a rare occurrence."" Mr Newman described Chinese species of scorpion seen in Bristol, Olivierus martensii, as ""medically significant"" and ""very venomous"". They could be ""life threatening"", particularly for those more vulnerable, he said, but ""an average adult would just have a really bad day"". Claire and Joe Branscombe bought a treadmill from a third-party seller on Amazon with a warehouse address in China. ""Our cat was very interested in a package that had been delivered to us, we hadn’t had a chance to open it yet,"" Mrs Branscombe said. ""She was scratching at the corners, so we took a closer look and to our horror a live scorpion crawled out of the box. ""We were screaming: 'What is this?' ""We went into total shock."" They said scientists they contacted after making the find had identified it as an Olivierus martensii scorpion. ""It's funny, you wouldn't bat an eyelid if one ran across you in a hot climate, but in our living room in Hampshire, we thought it was an alien,"" Mrs Branscombe added. Terrified that there could be more scorpions inside, the couple put the treadmill out in the garden as they ""didn't know what else was going to be there"". The next morning, Mr Branscombe - armed with insect spray, gloves and other garden tools - checked it over and found no further stowaways. The couple said they complained to both the company and to Amazon. The company told them it had never happened before and said it was reviewing CCTV, while Amazon apologised to them for the situation and offered a partial refund on behalf of the seller. An Amazon spokeswoman apologised and said: ""Thankfully this is an incredibly rare case and we have apologised, refunded the customer, and are investigating with the third-party seller."" Mr Newman said the three scorpions he was aware of had come from different companies.  ""So it's not the same company, but it seems to be a problem that's occurring from China,"" he said.  He said 12 scorpions which had come to the UK had been reported to NCRW this year with ""most coming back in people's luggage"". ""One lady went to Mexico and brought one back in her shoe by accident. It was a very dangerous scorpion too,"" he said. ""It's quite surprising what does actually come back. We've had a total of 127 different species of animals come back as stowaways."" The centre has seen everything from a European tree frog in a home furnishings store, to a venomous spider in a case of Australian wine.  If someone finds a reptile or other exotic creature in their package or luggage, Mr Newman said ""the most important thing to do is try not to touch it by hand"". Instead, he advises people to get a glass or Tupperware to contain it. Then give them a call. ""Earlier this week, we’ve had a hermit crab that came back from Malta in a shell,"" he said.  ""We get lizards, scorpions, snakes, toads, frogs. We get all sorts of things come in.  ""Quite often people would let them go, which is the worst thing you could do. Technically its illegal to release a non-native species in this country."" On the scorpion found in Bristol, Mr Newman said: ""They are not particularly aggressive but they will defend themselves if they feel threatened.  ""And the poor little chaps just come all the way from China in a parcel so he’s been banged about so he’s probably not in the greatest mood if I'm honest. ""We are seeing more scorpions this year, from all over the world. ""If you find something in a parcel. Try to secure it, but work on the premise it could be harmful. Give us a call and we’ll give you advice on what to do from there and we’ll come to collect it."" The centre's emergency service operates 24/7 all year round and has 100 drop-off points across the UK. Alternatively, if it is a dangerous species, a collection service is offered. Once the animal has been established, it is found a new home.  ""Some will stay with us for education purposes, but mostly we find them new homes,"" Mr Newman said.  ""Those that are rare or endangered would go to zoos and institutions, others will go to private keepers.""  The service has seen a spike in the past month but this may be down to more people becoming aware of it after they signposted it on their website. Mr Newman said he still thought ""very few people find us"", adding: ""I suspect we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg."" It is an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to release any creature not normally resident in Great Britain into the wild. The UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology can be contacted if people find a creature they suspect is non-native."

The 37-year-old Serb lost the opening three games against America's world number 43, but bounced back to take the first set on a tie-break.  Djokovic then stumbled with victory in sight, forced into another tie-break after letting a 4-1 lead slip in the second set, before finally seeing off 20-year-old Michelsen 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (11-9). The fourth-seed joins the ATP Tour's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, in the third round following their wins earlier on Saturday.   ""It was a first match against Alex and I also hadn't played in a while, so it took me time to get the rust off,"" said the 24-time Grand Slam champion, who had played just one Davis Cup qualifier since losing to Australia's Alexei Popyrin at Flushing Meadows. ""He started terrifically. It was a very close encounter and I also thought it was a quite a high level of tennis.""  Michelsen had two points to take the match into a deciding set, including when serving at 9-8 up in the second-set tie-break, but unforced errors cost him.  Djokovic, who played with heavy strapping on his right knee, eventually capitalised on Michelsen's mistakes to claim victory on his first match in China since 2019 as he bids for his 100th tour-level title.  ""I'm just glad to keep my calm when it mattered and glad to be really challenged by a young player,"" he added. ""Now I'm looking forward to the next one."" The world number four will next play either 22-year-old Italian Flavio Cobolli or Swiss veteran Stan Wawrinka.   Gauff fights back to reach China Open final Group stage of Davis Cup Finals scrapped  Swiatek splits with coach Wiktorowski Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are both seeking their first Shanghai Masters title Earlier on Saturday, Italy's world number one Sinner and Spanish rival Alcaraz both enjoyed comfortable victories in their opening matches at the Shanghai Masters - just three days after contesting a dramatic China Open final.  Sinner, 23, bounced back from losing to Alcaraz in Beijing, cruising to a 6-1 6-4 victory over Japan's Taro Daniel at the ATP 1,000 event.  The top seed took just one hour and 17 minutes to book his place in the third round and followed a similarly destructive display from third seed Alcaraz, who was on court a minute less in his 6-2 6-2 win over China's Shang Juncheng.  It was the 21-year-old's 10th consecutive victory, with his China Open title following wins for Team Europe at the Laver Cup in September.  ""I've been playing really good tennis lately and I'm just trying to keep that up,"" said four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz, who has won four titles on the ATP Tour this year.  He will next play China's world number 560 Yibing Wu, while Sinner will face 37th-ranked Tomas Martin Etcheverry in the third round following the Argentine's 7-6 (7-5) 3-6 7-5 win over the Netherlands' Botic van de Zandschulp. At three hours and 43 minutes, it was the longest match in the tournament's history.  Elsewhere, Russian sixth seed Andrey Rublev fell to a 6-7 (7-9) 6-4 6-3 defeat by the Czech Republic's Jakub Mensik. Play was cancelled early on the outside courts because of rain, but Alexander Zverev's match against Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci continued under a roof on the venue's main stadium court. The 27-year-old German second seed clinched a 6-4 6-2 win to set up a third-round meeting with either Australia's world number 28 Jordan Thompson or Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gl843l90zo,China's long-range missile test sparks concerns,"Beijing said the test was ""routine"" but other countries in the region expressed strong concerns.",25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:57.222165,China News,BBC,China,"China says it carried out a rare test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into international waters, sparking protests from neighbouring countries. The launch on Wednesday – its first in more than 40 years - was “routine” and not aimed at any country or target, according to Beijing. Chinese media reported the government also gave “relevant countries” notice. But Japan said it had not received a warning and expressed concerns, along with Australia and New Zealand. The launch contributes to tensions across the Indo-Pacific region, with analysts saying it highlights China's increased long-range nuclear capabilities. The US warned last year that China has built up its nuclear arsenal as part of a defence upgrade. An intercontinental ballistic missile can travel more 5,500km - putting China within striking range of the US mainland and Hawaii. But Beijing’s arsenal is still estimated at less than a fifth of the size of the US's and Russia’s, and China has long maintained that its nuclear maintainance is only about deterrence. On Wednesday, Beijing announced that the long-range missile was fired at 08:44 local time (04:44 GMT). It carried a dummy warhead and landed in the designated area - believed to be in the South Pacific. Beijing's defence ministry added the test launch was ""routine"" and part of its ""annual training"". But analysts said China was last known to have test-fired an ICBM internationally in the 1980s. Typically, it tests internally - having previously fired ICBMs west into the Taklamakan Desert in the Xinjiang region. “This sort of testing is not unusual for other countries, including the United States, but is for China,” nuclear missile analyst Ankit Panda told the BBC. China’s “ongoing nuclear modernisation” already has resulted in substantial changes, he said. This launch now appears to also show a change in its approach. It has sparked immediate reaction from other countries. Japan said it had received “no notice” and expressed “serious concern” about Beijing’s military build-up. Meanwhile, Australia said the action was ""destabilising and raises the risk of miscalculation in the region” and that it had sought “an explanation” from Beijing. New Zealand called it “an unwelcome and concerning development”. Mr Panda said he doesn't believe China’s actions were primarily designed to send a political message - “but no doubt this will be a stark reminder to the region and to the US that nuclear dynamics in Asia are quickly changing”. Other analysts went further, saying it was another wake-up call for the US and its allies in the region. “To Washington, the message is that direct intervention in a conflict across the Taiwan Strait would involve the American homeland being vulnerable to attack,” said Leif-Eric Easley, an international relations professor at Ewha Women's University in South Korea. For US allies in Asia, the “provocative test… demonstrates China’s capabilities to fight on multiple fronts simultaneously,"" he added. ""Timing is everything,"" Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, wrote on X. ""[China's] statement claims the launch does not target any country, but there are high-levels of tension between China and Japan, Philippines, and of course perpetual tension with Taiwan."" While the relationship between Beijing and Washington has improved in the past year, China's increasing assertiveness in the region remains a sticking point. Tensions have ramped up between China and the Philippines as their ships have repeatedly collided in disputed waters.  Last month, Japan scrambled fighter jets after it accused a Chinese spy plane of breaching its air space, a move that it called  ""utterly unacceptable"". Beijing's relationship with self-governed Taiwan is another source of strain.  Taiwan's defence ministry said earlier on Wednesday that China had been carrying out ""intensive"" missile firing and other drills recently. The same statement noted that it detected 23 Chinese military aircraft operating around Taiwan on ""long-range missions"".  Beijing routinely sends ships and aircraft into Taiwanese waters and airspace, called a ""greyzone warfare"" tactic meant to normalise the incursions.        In July, China suspended its nuclear arms control talks with Washington, in retaliation for the US's continued arms sales to Taiwan.  The US last year warned of China's nuclear modernisation although its numbers still far short of Washington's.  The Pentagon estimated that China has more than 500 operational nuclear warheads in its arsenal, of which approximately 350 are ICBMs. The report projected that China will reach over 1,000 warheads by 2030; the US and Russia each say they possess more than 5,000 warheads.  There also have been conflicts around the Chinese military’s Rocket Force, the elite unit managing its nuclear arsenal. An aggressive anti-corruption campaign led to the firing of two of its leaders last year.  "

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5482yygp4o,Hong Kong jails two journalists for sedition,Editors at a now-defunct news site published articles about the city's national security crackdown.,26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:31:57.459637,China News,BBC,China,"A Hong Kong Court has jailed two journalists who led a pro-democracy newspaper after they were found guilty in a landmark sedition case last month. Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam, editors at the now-defunct Stand News media outlet, had published articles about the crackdown on civil liberties in the city under China. Chung was sentenced to 21 months, while Lam was given 11 months, but was released on medical grounds.  The publisher behind Stand News - Best Pencil - has been fined HK$5,000 (US$643; £480). It is the first sedition case against journalists in Hong Kong since the territory's handover from Britain to China in 1997. After a lengthy trial, which began in October 2022 and was originally scheduled to last just 20 days, district court judge Kwok Wai-kin Kwok found that 11 articles published by Stand News were seditious and that Stand News had become a ""danger to national security"". Their newspaper's editorial line supported ""Hong Kong local autonomy"", Mr Kwok said in a written statement. ""It even became a tool to smear and vilify the Central Authorities [in Beijing] and the [Hong Kong] SAR Government,"" he added. Both journalists were charged under a colonial-era sedition law - which until recently had been rarely used by prosecutors - rather than the controversial national security law (NSL). Stand News was among a handful of relatively new online news portals that especially gained prominence during the 2019 pro-democracy protests. Rights groups have condemned the sentencing. Reporters Without Borders told the BBC it is ""yet another nail in the coffin for press freedom in Hong Kong"". Since the introduction of the NSL in 2020, a host of media outlets have closed in Hong Kong. Critics say the law effectively reduces the city's once-prized judicial autonomy, making it easier to punish demonstrators and activists. China defends it as necessary for maintaining stability.   Stand News was among the last openly pro-democratic publications until its closure in December 2021, when more than 200 police officers were sent to raid its office.  Seven employees were arrested and accused of a ""conspiracy to publish seditious publications"", which included interviews with pro-democracy activists. Hong Kong's current chief executive John Lee supported the police operation at the time, calling those arrested the ""evil elements that damage press freedom"". The case has drawn international scrutiny and condemnation from western countries. The United States has repeatedly condemned the prosecutions of journalists in Hong Kong, saying that the case against the both editors ""creates a chilling effect on others in the press and media"". The former British colony has seen its standing in press freedom rankings plummet from 18th place to 135th over the past two decades, according to the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Their Asia-based Advocacy Manager Aleksandra Bielakowska told the BBC that the Hong Kong judiciary has become ""a political tool, used to threaten those who dare to speak independently"". ""Like in China, the regime is trying to create its own narratives, and make sure that all reporters will be only 'telling Hong Kong’s story well',"" she said. ""Deliberately targeting independent media and its journalists has left a huge void in Hong Kong’s media landscape that will be very difficult to rebuild,"" she added."

Trump described Si's display as ""the best performance there has been against me, by quite far"".  The 22-year-old from China reeled off four consecutive frames with breaks of 144, 61, 147 and 81 after Trump had taken the opening frame with a century of his own. While Trump took frame six with an 89, Si, who had lost his previous six meetings against the Englishman, sealed his win with another century and a run of 71.  Si will now face Xiao Guodong in a best-of-19 encounter in what will be only the third ranking final in the history of the sport to be contested by two players from China. Xiao, 35, won five consecutive frames as he came from 4-1 down to beat his compatriot Long Zehuang, to reach the third ranking final of his career.  Both world number 29, Xiao and Si, who is ranked 13, are yet to win a ranking event. However, Si will begin Saturday's final as the favourite after racking 672 points against Trump, who defeated him in the final of the German Masters in February. ""I've lost a lot of matches whilst making 60 plus breaks against him before, so I didn't think too much about beating him,"" said Si, who reached a world semi-final in 2023. ""I'd give myself nine out of 10 for the performance, with one point off for my safeties. Luck was on my side and Iâm really happy to have made a 147. I've seen a lot of professional players make their first and second maximum breaks, but I hadn't even made one.""  Trump, who has won the Shanghai Masters and the Saudi Arabia Snooker Masters this season, added: âThis is the best performance there has been against me, by quite far.  ""Apart from maybe John Higgins and the odd Ronnie performance, this is as well as you can play. It was like an exhibition game for him at the end. Now people have seen that, there will be a lot more pressure on him to win the World Championship and win events."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx250ygn9ddo,Oil price rise comes at a critical point,Any extended rise raises the possibility of higher petrol prices and gas and electricity bills.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:05.263156,China News,BBC,China,"The price of oil has jumped 5% after US President Joe Biden said the US was discussing possible strikes by Israel on Iran’s oil industry. Asked on a visit if he would support Israel striking Iran’s oil facilities, Biden said: “We’re discussing that."" Iran is the seventh largest oil producer in the world, exporting around half its production abroad, mainly to China. Since Iran’s missile attack on Israel on Monday, the price of benchmark Brent crude oil has risen 10% to $77 a barrel, although this remains below levels seen earlier this year. Any extended rise in energy prices raises the possibility of higher petrol prices and increased gas and electricity bills, pushing up the rate of inflation. So far this year, weaker demand from China and ample supply from Saudi Arabia have acted to hold down oil prices. The reaction in oil markets has, so far, been far more muted than, for example, to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But the escalation of violence in the Middle East and threat of further action is now stalking the markets. Of particular concern is whether any escalation could block the Straits of Hormuz, through which a third of oil tanker traffic and a fifth of LNG frozen gas has to pass. Since Russia’s war with Ukraine began, the world has become more dependent on shipped frozen gas in LNG tankers. Even if it is Asia that is most physically dependent on the flow of oil and gas out of the Persian Gulf, the immediate price impact of such developments would be significant. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Thursday of the “very serious” potential impact and that he was watching developments “extremely closely”. All this could come at the very moment the world’s central bankers declared a quiet victory over the three-year inflation shock from the pandemic and Ukraine war. It may help explain why G7 leaders are trying to moderate the expected response from Israel to Iran’s attack."

German prosecutors said that Yaqi X, 38, had been working for a company providing logistics services at the airport.  Prosecutors said she had repeatedly sent details on flights, passengers and military cargo transport to another figure who worked for China's secret services. The airport is considered an important centre for defence exports, particularly to Ukraine. A second suspect, Jian G, was detained earlier this year. He had worked as an aide for a member of the European Parliament from Germany's far-right AfD party. Yaqi X was remanded in custody and her home and workplace searched.  Between August 2023 and February 2024, prosecutors allege she had given Jian G information on the transport of military equipment and people linked to an unnamed German arms company. German sources told public broadcaster ARD that the defence company involved was Rheinmetall, Germany's biggest defence firm which has been heavily involved in supplying Ukraine with weapons, armoured vehicles and military equipment. Yaqi X's case appears to be linked to a spying case that unfolded last April involving parliamentary aide Jian G.  The MEP he had worked for, Maximilian Krah, dismissed Jian G as his assistant. Krah's office in Brussels was searched by police, although there was no indication that he was involved. Jian G was alleged to have spied on Chinese dissidents in Germany as well as passing information on the European Parliament to Chinese intelligence.  He had previously worked for dissident groups and had taken up German citizenship after coming to Germany in 2002. "

After three double faults in the first set, Gauff made nine in the second and nine more in the third as Sabalenka won 1-6 6-4 6-4. Her 21 double faults was the most by a player in a main draw match in 2024.  Top seed Sabalenka, who is a two-time winner of this event, will face fifth seed Zheng Qinwen of China in Sunday's final.

The Russian pair became the first sisters to play each other in a WTA main draw match since Serena Williams defeated older sister Venus at the Top Seed Open in Kentucky in August 2020. Erika, 20, claimed a 6-3 6-1 win over 17-year-old Mirra and will now play Italian world number six Jasmine Paolini for a quarter-final place. Mirra, the 16th seed, said prior to the meeting that she and Erika had agreed to split the prize money from the second round contest, whatever the outcome. French Open semi-finalist Mirra became the youngest player to be ranked in the top 20 since 2006 last week, courtesy of her run to the quarter-finals at the China Open in Beijing. But, despite being favourite against Erika, who is ranked 70th in the world, Mirra correctly predicted facing her sister would be ""a nightmare"". Erika is yet to progress beyond the second round in five Grand Slam appearances but, a lucky loser entry in the main draw in Wuhan, she rose to the occasion against her younger sibling. Already apprehensive about the ""stressful"" prospect of facing an opponent who knows her game inside out, Mirra claimed the first break of serve and led 3-1. But Erika responded emphatically by clinching three successive breaks amid a five-game streak to take the opening set. Erika, a junior French Open runner-up in 2021, extended that unanswered run of games to eight as she took charge with a 3-0 lead in the second set, before earning another break on her way to completing a commanding victory with her third match point. Earlier on Wednesday, US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka and world number four Coco Gauff made it through to the last 16 with straight-set wins. Belarusian Sabalenka, the number one seed at the event, beat Czech opponent Katerina Siniakova 6-4 6-4. American Gauff, 20, who won the China Open on Sunday, defeated Viktoriya Tomova of Bulgaria 6-1 6-2. US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula and Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen are also safely through, with Zheng becoming the first Chinese woman to win 40 matches in a year since Li Na in 2013. However, Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova was knocked out, losing 6-3 7-5 to world number 102 Hailey Baptiste of the United States.

Raducanu is ranked 57th in the world, but her climb up the rankings has been checked by the injury and the decision to play just one tournament between Wimbledon and the US Open this season.  Having reached the second round of the Australian Open in January, Raducanu decided to skip the French Open to focus on her fitness. She reached the fourth round at Wimbledon to return to the world's top 100 but was beaten in the first round of the US Open by American Sofia Kenin in August. Top seed Aryna Sabalenka had to come back from a set down to reach the quarter-finals at the Wuhan Open, but world number three Jessica Pegula suffered a surprise defeat. Belarusian Sabalenka, 26, lost a one-sided first set to Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva but recovered to win 1-6 6-4 6-0, winning each of the final nine games. However, American second seed Pegula fell to a straight-set loss to China's Wang Xinyu. The 51st-ranked Wang is through to her first WTA 1000 quarter-final, holding her nerve to take her second match point after being broken when serving for a place in the last eight at 5-4. Meanwhile, Italian third seed Jasmine Paolini and American fourth seed Coco Gauff both safely progressed. Paolini won 6-3 6-2 against Erika Andreeva - who defeated sister Mirra on Wednesday - while Gauff, winner of last week's China Open, also sealed a straight-set win, beating Marta Kostyuk 6-4 6-1. Wimbledon and French Open runner-up Paolini will meet Chinese fifth seed Zheng Qinwen, after she beat battled back to win 5-7 6-3 6-0 against Canada's Leylah Fernandez.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl0ydpjgzo,The shopping centre helping students feel at home,Leeds' Merrion Centre is promoting itself on Chinese social media to its growing East Asian clientele.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:05.797199,China News,BBC,China,"A 1960s shopping centre in the middle of Leeds may not seem the most obvious place for a cultural revolution.  But when a Taiwanese dessert parlour opened earlier this year it kickstarted a transformation that brought a flavour of East Asia to West Yorkshire and helped create a home from home for many international students. Meet Fresh is not a well known brand in the UK, but when a new branch opened in Leeds' Merrion Centre in February the queues snaked out the door. For many of those waiting patiently in line its arrival signalled the chance for a bit of home comfort. The restaurant is famous for its taro ball desserts, grass jelly and shaved ice - treats not normally found on the menu in Yorkshire, but a popular treat for many in Taiwan and surrounding countries. ""Some of our customers pass by and say, 'oh, Meet Fresh is here, like at home',"" manager Cherry Cheung says. Originally from Hong Kong, Cherry came to the UK with her husband, Hess, to open the new branch. And, like the Cheungs, many of their customers are also from overseas, with a large portion of their clientele international students studying in the city. In recent years the number of students at the University of Leeds coming from China alone has more than doubled, to more than 5,500. ""Because this brand is from Taiwan, most of our customers are international students,"" Cherry says. ""I'm actually very happy to see them, that they feel at home and that they can have their home food again."" Meet Fresh is just one of a number of Asian-inspired businesses that have opened in the Merrion Centre. And, shopping centre bosses have been quick to learn from their tenants, taking a leaf out of their book and using Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu - or Little Red Book - to help market the precinct. ""There's been a lot of redevelopment within our immediate catchment area over the last few years and we've seen an abundance of student accommodation around us,"" says James  Broughton, head of marketing and communications at the Merrion Centre. ""Part of that is the international students - they are a core part of our business."" According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) the nearby University of Leeds attracted 5,530 students from China in the 2022/23 academic year, up from 2,605 in 2017/18. ""Because a lot of our tenants are utilising Little Red Book we thought there was an opportunity there,"" said Mr Broughton. Xiaohongshu, has been described as China's Instagram for e-commerce and is mostly used by young, urban Chinese women. The shopping centre now has a social media role dedicated to making videos for the platform. Mr Boughton adds: ""Meet Fresh and some of our more Asian-inspired brands that are well known overseas have transformed the Merrion Centre and our customer base.  ""We have got plans to keep evolving the centre, keep it refreshed, keep it up to date and keep it relevant for the changing audience."" Traditional high street names now share the centre with bubble tea shops, a noodle bar and a Korean barbecue restaurant. Cathy, works at the Sing Kee supermarket, one of the first businesses to move in and said the promotion on Little Red Book was proving successful. ""For the Asian students, we have some colleagues that can speak Japanese, they also can speak Korean or Cantonese so they can chat with them,"" she tells me. ""They feel just like home."" ""Since last week I've noticed three times the amount of students come - really busy. Sometimes we just go out of stock."" Another business which has opened specifically to target the Asian market is Gordon Sung's hair salon. ""We've become popular because the Chinese are looking for an Asian hair stylist,"" says Mr Sung, adding that the salon's decor has been specifically chosen to make it ""feel like home"" for students. According to the HESA, the largest groups of students arriving in Leeds from East Asia come from China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia. Tyler Lou, 20, is a second year international student from China, who has come to Leeds to study education.  She says arriving in a new city thousands of miles from home was ""scary"" for the first week, but it now felt like home. ""Compared to other cities in the UK I think Leeds is more lively,"" she said. Ms Lou adds: ""I want to stay here, but I have to find a job. ""My friends all want to go back to China - they don't like the food here."" Duncun, 21, from Malaysia, describes being in Leeds as a ""very excellent experience"". The third year law student says: ""Most of my friends studied here already. I think that's the main reason I came here."" 18-year-old Cooper only arrived in Leeds the day before she spoke to ume - the first time she had travelled far away from her hometown in China. ""I  heard the lifestyle in Leeds is very chill and very relaxed,"" she says. ""I love it here so far.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ggdp7yxeo,Why global gaming hit's boss has a Brummie accent,The Chinese game sold more than 4.5 million copies within 24 hours.,3 days ago,2024-10-15 10:32:05.879872,China News,BBC,China,"He's the character crafting weapons and upgrading armour as gamers fight their way past rats, bears and centipedes - a sword-wielding blacksmith with a tiger's head and... a Brummie accent. Actor James Alexander, from Birmingham, was picked to play Yin Tiger for the English voiceover of the Chinese video game hit Black Myth: Wukong. The creators loved his accent so much they encouraged him to keep it for the part. His Brummie tones are now being heard through millions of headphones across the world, with the game selling 10 million copies in the first three days of its release in August. Black Myth: Wukong has sparked a tourism boom in China, prompting fans to visit breathtaking locations featured and also introduces a new audience to the 16th Century Chinese novel on which it is based.  The success of the game was ""well deserved"", said the voice actor. ""I woke up the morning it was released and had a message on my phone saying there were two million people playing, which was just mad,"" he said.  ""A lot of love has clearly gone into it."" The 32-year-old was cast by British creative services company PitStop Productions to play five parts.  The Chinese client had provided detailed character briefs, he explained, ""and seeing that as a voice actor you get excited thinking 'oh I can spice that up a bit'"". The character of Yin Tiger, was ""a bit stoic and a bit irritable as well,"" he said.  ""The Brummie accent leans in nicely to having that kind of humble nature to it, but also you can be quite threatening with it as well."" Yin Tiger is one of dozens of bosses players encounter as they move through the game's storyline. He also voices a Scorpion Lord ""who's drunk because he's got an unfortunate back story where he lost his wife to a large chicken"". A ""dim-witted"" rat man was given a soft West Country accent, and a ""very threatening ox"" was ""a bit more Cockney"", he explained.  The actor is no stranger to working on popular releases, having voiced about 20 characters in last year's hit game Baldur's Gate 3.  Others he appears in include Brawl Stars, Warhammer 40K: Darktide, Horizon Call of the Mountain and the latest TV adaptation of Watership Down.  The former supermarket worker said he had had no formal acting training and is ""constantly kicking myself I get to be part of these insane stories and experiences"".  He had always been a mimic he explained - trying to replicate voices he heard on TV or games - and had initially started applying for opportunities through casting websites.  ""That was seven years ago and if you'd said to me then I would be in this game or that game I wouldn't have believed you,"" he said. Beth Park from PitStop, with studios in London, said she had cast and directed more than 60 actors playing ""a couple of hundred"" parts in the Chinese game.  A snippet of it, previously released on YouTube, had resulted in a ""definite buzz"",  garnering millions of views ahead of its release.  But the numbers playing the game on its release were ""just crazy"", she said.  Within 24 hours, it broke the record for the most-played single-player title ever released on gaming platform Steam. It is the Chinese video game industry's first AAA release - a title typically given to big-budget games from major companies. Some early controversy surrounding its release has not dented its popularity with fans, with the game reportedly selling more than 20 million copies. ""I've worked on games that are incredibly popular in the past, and it's always just really lovely to have your work experienced by so many people,"" Ms Park said.  The action game is based on the classic 16th Century Chinese novel Journey to the West, with players taking on the role of the Destined One - a monkey with supernatural powers in search of magic objects.  The lead character is based on Sun Wukong, or the Monkey King, a key character in the classic which was ""incredibly important"" in Chinese culture, added Ms Park.  For the English voiceover version, the Chinese company had been keen to use British regional accents, she explained. ""But I didn't want the player to think 'now we're in a very specific part of Britain', so I went more for the character fitting the type of voice - so I tried to keep it fairly broad. ""We just snuck in a few accents here and there if it felt right."" Megan Richards, who plays one of the game's Spider Sisters, said her first experience of voicing a video game had been ""incredibly positive"". ""It's amazing the sort of worldwide and universal reach that it has had,"" she said.  The actor is also starring in Amazon Studio's production The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, playing Harfoot Poppy Proudfellow, of which series two has just been released.  She said the two jobs were ""incomparable"".  ""For this season we had three units going, so three separate crews working at the same time, which is massive,"" she said.  ""And then compare that to just three people working in a booth.""  Her Singaporean heritage and Mandarin lessons as a child had helped her identify and pronounce some of the Chinese names in the game,"" she explained.  ""I have never been part of a project that has Asian influence in it, so it's really nice to have that background and also able to see that representation in a video game."" Tourists had been flocking to remote parts of China to visit ancient temples and pagodas featured in the game after a government department released a video showing the real-world attractions.  ""I can only imagine how beautiful they are in real life,"" added Ms Park.  ""Games are intangible, so it's really nice when real world things happen because of the work.""

Yee, 26, crossed the line in one hour 48 minutes 21 seconds to finish 46 seconds clear of France's Leo Bergere, with Brazil's Miguel Hidalgo in third. Potter, winner of bronze at Paris 2024, finished 17 seconds behind Germany's winner Lisa Tertsch, as fellow Britons Georgia Taylor-Brown and Kate Waugh finished third and fifth respectively. Yee leads the overall men's rankings before next month's championship final, while reigning women's champion Potter is second to Olympic champion Cassandre Beaugrand. ""I just wanted to come back and have fun, the last few weeks have been absolutely chaotic. Iâm really pleased, that is a race to be proud of,"" Yee said. ""Since I was young [the swim] has been my weakest discipline but I have been working towards the point where I can call myself a complete triathlete and I feel Iâm getting close to that."" Championship runner-up in 2022, Yee led the run from start to finish to claim victory at the first race held in Weihai, as New Zealandâs Olympic silver medallist Hayden Wilde faded to seventh. Jack Willis was ninth, ahead of Max Stapley (11th), Connor Bentley (17th) and Harry Leleu (30th). Potter was unable to close the gap as Tertsch also led throughout the run to win in 02:04:42, but finished 41 seconds ahead of British team-mate Taylor-Brown. Waugh followed German Tanja Neubert over the line, with Sian Rainsley in 20th. The World Triathlon Championship Series Final takes place in Torremolinos-Andalucia in Spain from 17-20 October. Yee has taken maximum points from his three races counting towards the series ranking - at the WTCS Cagliari and Paris Olympics in addition to Weihai. Potter reduced the gap to Beaugrand with her first second-placed finish, having finished third in her past three races. She is 113.73 points behind the Frenchwoman, with 1250 points - compared to 1,000 in the other series races - up for grabs at the WTCS Finals. Tertsch is close behind in the standings following her victory, with 2020 champion and 2022 runner-up Taylor-Brown 408.74 points off the podium.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce81g9593dro,US debt would increase under Harris and soar under Trump - study,"Both candidates would add trillions to the national debt if their proposals were enacted, according to a new analysis.",8 days ago,2024-10-15 10:32:20.465916,China News,BBC,China,"Donald Trump's campaign proposals would increase the US national debt by double the amount Kamala Harris's would, according to a new analysis by a non-partisan group. Both candidates would add trillions to the national debt if their campaign pledges were enacted, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trump would add $7.5tn and Harris would add $3.5tn, the group said. The think tank warned on Monday that neither party appeared willing to address the country's growing $35.6tn debt. Both candidates have, at least partially, backed extending major tax cuts that the US passed during Trump's first term. These cuts form the biggest chunk of this hypothetical additional debt. Parts of that Trump tax plan are due to expire in 2025, setting up a tough tax fight for whoever wins the White House in November. Trump has vowed to extend the tax package in its entirety. He has also proposed new cuts which would eliminate taxes on overtime, social security and tips income, and grant domestic manufacturers an ultra low corporate rate of 15%.  He said he plans to raise money by imposing widespread tariffs - a tax on goods imported into the country, which could raise $2.7tn, according to the CRFB. Harris, by contrast, has pledged to roll back tax cuts for the wealthy and raise the 21% rate for corporations, which was meant to be permanent, to 28%. But she would extend the Trump cuts for Americans earning less than $400,000 and has backed his idea of eliminating taxes on tips.  Harris has also put forward a number of other proposals for tax relief, aimed at families with children and start-ups, while endorsing plans to subsidise child care and health care with hundreds of billions in new spending.  Many of their proposals would have to be approved by Congress, and it remains unclear how much either candidate would be able to muscle through the divided legislative branch which has ultimate power over taxes and spending.  ""Both candidates are wanting to get elected so, you know, tax cuts sound better than higher taxes so I think that's what you're hearing. Whether or not all of that gets through we'll see,"" said Jimmy Lee, the founder and CEO of the investment firm Wealth Consulting Group. But Mr Lee said he thought investors were not ""paying enough attention"" to the threat from spiralling borrowing.  The US has long been able to borrow cheaply, thanks to strong demand for its debt among private investors, which has helped to keep interest rates relatively low.  But some analysts have warned that the US may be facing higher costs in the future.  The ratio of US debt to its economy or GDP, gross domestic product is already one of the highest among major economies in the world.  It stands at about 120%, according to the IMF. That compares to 144% in Italy, 110% in Spain, 101% in the UK, 106% in Canada, 77% in China, 67% in Germany and 56% in Australia. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g42953qm0o,Canadian alleges 'psychological torture' in Chinese jail,"Michael Kovrig, whose arrest kicked off a diplomatic spat, says he was held in solitary confinement for months.",24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:20.612708,China News,BBC,China,"A former Canadian envoy whose imprisonment in China kicked off a high-profile diplomatic spat has accused Chinese authorities of inflicting ""psychological torture"" on him. Michael Kovrig says he was placed in solitary confinement for months and subjected to ""relentless interrogation"" when he was arrested in December 2018 and held for more than 1,000 days. The Chinese government has rejected his allegations, saying it handled his case lawfully. Mr Kovrig and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were detained on spying charges following the arrest of Chinese businesswoman Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver, in a case that Canada called ""hostage diplomacy"". The Canadian government had at that time detained Ms Meng, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei, on US fraud charges. The ""two Michaels"" were only freed nearly three years later, after US prosecutors dropped the extradition request and agreed to release Ms Meng. ""It was the most gruelling, painful thing I’ve ever been through,” said Mr Kovrig in an interview with Canadian public broadcaster CBC that aired on Monday night. Describing his ordeal for the first time, Mr Kovrig said that on the night he was arrested he was walking home from dinner in Beijing with his partner, who was six months pregnant at the time. “We came up a spiral staircase right in front of the plaza in front of my apartment building, and boom,” he said. “There’s a dozen men in black with cameras on them surrounding us, shouting in Chinese, ‘That’s him.’” Mr Kovrig, a former diplomat who was working as a senior advisor for the International Crisis Group think tank at the time, said he was then handcuffed, blindfolded and thrown into a black SUV. After being driven for almost an hour, he was taken into a padded cell, where he would remain for several months. “At that point they said, ‘You are under suspicion of endangering China’s state security. You are going to be interrogated,’” Mr Kovrig said. “A chill went down my spine.” Mr Kovrig alleged his treatment by the Chinese authorities broke international law. ""The United Nations standard is no more than 15 days in solitary confinement. More than that is considered psychological torture. I was there for nearly six months,"" he said. He added that he was kept in complete isolation under fluorescent lights for six months, while being subjected to six to nine hours of interrogation a day. Often, he said, he was locked in a chair for hours on end and at times was forced to survive on three bowls of rice per day. “They are trying to bully and torment and terrorise and coerce you into accepting their false version of reality,” Mr Kovrig said. After six months Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor, who were held separately, were formally arrested. Mr Kovrig was moved from his windowless cell to a pre-trial detention facility, where he shared a room with a dozen inmates. ""That was kind of like moving from hell to limbo,"" he said, describing how this time there was daylight coming in through Plexiglass windows and room to walk around. Mr Kovrig stayed there for the next two years, before his release in September 2021 - the same day that the US dropped its request to extradite Meng Wanzhou. Within two hours of Ms Meng's extradition request being dropped, he and Mr Spavor had cleared Chinese airspace on a plane to Canada, according to CBC. Responding to Mr Kovrig's interview, Lin Jian, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Chinese judicial authorities handled the case strictly in accordance with the law. ""Lies and smears cannot change the fact that the person you mentioned committed a crime. We advise the relevant parties to respect the facts and reflect on their mistakes,"" he told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday. Mr Kovrig's allegations of his treatment by the Chinese authorities stands in contrast with Ms Meng's experience in Canada. The heiress was released on bail and placed under house arrest, but was allowed to leave her home in the daytime and roam within a large swathe of Vancouver while under supervision.  She reportedly went on private shopping sprees at high-end boutiques, and had massages and art lessons in her mansion. Ms Meng later wrote she had time to finally ""read a book cover to cover"" and ""carefully complete an oil painting"". Her release was covered prominently and celebrated in China where many supported her and her father, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei. But the case severely strained China's diplomatic ties with Canada and the US, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at one point accusing China of ""using arbitrary detention as a tool to achieve political goals"". China denied these accusations, and countered that Ms Meng's arrest was an example of ""political persecution of Chinese citizens with the aim of suppressing China's high tech enterprises""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj04955442ro,Myanmar rebels reject embattled junta's peace offer,The offer comes after battlefield losses and defections in the three-year-long civil war.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:20.704960,China News,BBC,China,"Rebel groups have rejected a peace offer from Myanmar’s embattled junta, which is reeling from battlefield losses and defections in a civil war that has dragged on for more than three years. This is dictatorship's first such outreach since it seized power in 2021. It also comes after a ceasefire brokered by China in the northern Shan state fell apart. The junta called on ethnic armed groups and ""terrorist insurgent groups"" to ""communicate with us to solve political problems politically"", also urging them to join elections planned for next year. The exiled National Unity Government (NUG) said the offer was not worth considering, adding the junta had no authority to hold an election. The junta extended an olive branch Thursday as it struggled to fight on multiple fronts and stem a widespread rebellion.  Some reports say the junta now has control of less than half of Myanmar's territories.  In June, an alliance of three ethnic armies renewed an offensive against the military, seizing territory along a key highway to China's Yunnan province, which borders Myanmar. The fighting near the border in Shan state has blocked China's ambitious plan to connect its landlocked south-west to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar. Beijing's top diplomat, Wang Yi, is thought to have delivered a warning to the country's ruler Min Aung Hlaing during a visit to Myanmar last month. Armed groups should follow ""the path of party politics and elections in order to bring about lasting peace and development"", the junta said in its statement on Thursday. ""The country's human resources, basic infrastructure and many people's lives have been lost, and the country's stability and development have been blocked [because of the conflict]"" it said. But the rebel groups are sceptical of the offer.  The Karen National Union (KNU), which has been fighting for decades with the military for more autonomy along the border with Thailand, told AFP news agency that talks were only possible if the military agreed to ""common political objectives"". ""Number one: no military participation in future politics. Two [the military] has to agree to a federal democratic constitution,"" KNU spokesman Padoh Saw Taw Nee told AFP. ""Number three: they have to be accountable for everything they have committed... including war crimes and crimes against humanity,"" he said. ""No impunity."" If the junta does not accede to these demands, the KNU will ""keep putting pressure on [the junta] politically and militarily,"" he added. Maung Saungkha, the leader of the Bamar People's Liberation Army, told Reuters news agency that his group is ""not interested in this offer"".  ""They are hanging goat’s heads but selling dog meat,"" Soe Thu Ya Zaw, commander of the Mandalay People’s Defense Forces, wrote on Facebook. After the military ousted Myanmar's democratically-elected government in 2021, peaceful protests were met with killings and arrests.  This led ethnic armed groups to join forces with anti-coup militias across the country to fight back, plunging the country into a civil war. At least 50,000 people have been killed since the coup and more than two million people displaced, according to the United Nations. The UN warned last week that Myanmar was ""sinking into an abyss of human suffering"". Eyewitnesses had previously told the BBC about how the military has tourtued people in its custody, including by pouring burning petrol on them and forcing some to drink their urine. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9je2wnveko,Does Chinese investment benefit or damage Ireland?,"Ireland is home to 40 Chinese firms, which some critics say harms the country's reputation.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:20.788655,China News,BBC,China,"The Irish economy has been increasingly attracting Chinese investment, but does it come with a reputational cost? In 2020, 25 Chinese companies had operations in the Republic of Ireland. By this year the number had jumped to 40. For some this new flood of yuan into the country offers Ireland an opportunity to reduce its reliance on being the European base for US tech giants such as Apple and Alphabet. And it creates additional jobs. But for an increasing number of critics, Ireland being home to Chinese firms links the country to the human rights abuse allegations levelled against some such companies. These include Chinese clothing firm Shein, which since May 2023 has had its European headquarters in Dublin. Shein has long been attacked for how the workers who makes its clothes are treated. And earlier this year it had to admit that it found child labour in its supply chain. The Irish government is also in the diplomatically awkward position of luring many of the very Chinese companies that the US has sanctioned. Two cases in point – telecoms firm Huawei and drugs company WuXi Biologics. In May, Ireland’s Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Dara Calleary, welcomed a report celebrating how Huawei was contributing €800m ($889m; £668m) per year to the Irish economy. The firm has three research and development centres in Ireland. This is the same Huawei whose telecoms network equipment the US has banned since 2022 due to concerns over national security. The UK has moved in the same direction, ordering phone networks to remove Huawei components. And mobile phone networks in many Western nations, including Ireland, no longer offer Huawei handsets. Meanwhile, WuXi has, since 2018, invested more than €1bn in a facility in Dundalk, near the border with Northern Ireland. Earlier this month the US House of Representatives passed a bill to restrict US firms’ ability to work with WuXi, again citing national security concerns. The bill now has to go to the US Senate. Ireland’s Industrial Development Authority is the government agency whose mandate is to attract foreign investment into the country. It has three offices in China, and says it seeks “to promote Ireland as a gateway to Europe for Chinese investors”. Another Chinese firm that has its European headquarters in Ireland is social media video app TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based parent firm ByteDance. And the parent of Chinese online retailer Temu moved its global headquarters from China to Ireland last year. Prominent critics of Ireland rolling out a “green carpet” to Chinse firms include Barry Andrews, one of Ireland's members of the European Parliament. “Human rights and environmental abuses should not be allowed in Irish shopping baskets,” says the Fianna Fáil MEP. He points to a US Congress report from last year, which said there was “an extremely high risk that Temu’s supply chains are contaminated with forced labour”. Temu had told the investigation that it had a “zero-tolerance policy” towards the practice. “One person’s bargain is another’s back-breaking work for poverty wages,” adds Mr Andrews, whose party is part of the current Irish government coalition. Critics also argue that there are substantial differences between US tech firms operating in Ireland and Chinese ones – for example, about openness. For instance, Huawei and WuXi declined an opportunity to be interviewed for this article. Shein provided a spokesperson who was only prepared to speak off the record, then did not reply to follow-up questions. Some leading economists question whether Ireland even needs the few thousand jobs that the Chinese firms provide. “Ireland’s economy has been running at near full employment for the best part of a decade,"" says Dan O'Brien, chief economist at Ireland's Institute of International and European Affairs. Irish unemployment was 4.3% in August 2024, only slightly above its all-time low of 3.90% in October 2020. Economists generally consider an unemployment rate of around 4 to 5% to represent full employment. Mr O’Brien also points to the fact that a fifth of Ireland’s private-sector employment is directly, or indirectly, attributable to foreign direct investment (FDI), according to official figures. He says this is too high. It is so elevated because Ireland has one of the lowest standard corporation tax rates in Europe, at 12.5%. This is the tax that all but the very biggest firms have to pay on their profits. By comparison, the UK rate is 25%. Mr O’Brien says that Ireland’s level of FDI was already too high without the Chinese investment on top. “Given we are already overly dependent on FDI in a world that is at risk of deglobalisation, we don’t need another major source of FDI on top of that from the United States.” He adds EU rules should be “actively used to discourage Chinese FDI” in Ireland. The Irish government tells the BBC that it ""supports the common EU approach to China on de-risking... [but] the government has been clear that de-risking is not decoupling"". Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Peter Burke adds: “In an era of continuous global uncertainty, Ireland offers a stable and pro-business environment. Multinational companies, including Chinese companies, recognise these opportunities.” Given how much Ireland's economy does depend on FDI, some economists say Chinese investment in Ireland can be seen as a welcome insurance policy in case some US firms pull out. “There is a huge pressure on US tech companies to re-domicile and re-invest in the US,"" says Constantin Gurdgiev, an economist at Trinity College Dublin and the University of Northern Colorado. Meanwhile, other European countries, such as Poland, Estonia, Slovakia, and Malta, have made inroads in courting US investments, presenting Ireland with new competition from countries with cheaper housing and less rain. Dr Gurdgiev also points to “the forever-looming threat of global corporate tax reforms”, further eroding Ireland’s low corporation tax. The country has already signed up to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development rules, and as a result, this year introduced a 15% corporation tax rate for firms with an annual turnover of more than €750m ($835m; £625m). And earlier this month, the European Court of Justice ruled that Apple had to pay Ireland €13bn in unpaid taxes. It followed after the European Commission accused Ireland of giving Apple illegal tax advantages. Dublin consistently argued against the need for the tax to be paid, but said it would respect the ruling. Dr Gurdgiev adds that Ireland is acting “with some strategic foresight” in courting Beijing. And that even if Dublin is welcoming the likes of Huawei, he says that the strength and influence of the Irish diaspora in the US means that Washington will turn something of a blind eye. He argues that this is why the US authorities have been “largely laissez-faire in their approach to chasing tax optimization schemes that Dublin has been developing over decades”. Plus, he says Ireland provides the US, EU and China with a useful “neutral ground” where both US and Chinese tech firms can operate. Dr Gurdgiev adds that by putting itself in such a position, Ireland is playing a “dangerous geopolitical game” for a small economy. However, he says its diplomatic closeness to the US should make its position ""relatively safe""."

But, after 11 years of hard work the risk has paid off, in the shape of a contract with Next to produce a homeware range, created in her home city of Stoke-on-Trent. Ms Talbot recalled that during a shift hanging clothes, she thought, ""I would want something more quirky for my kids,"" so decided to leave. Now, her firm Scruffy Little Herbert is about to get international exposure for its home-inspired products. The work began in 2013, when Ms Talbot taught herself to screen print and tested designs inspired by the Potteries landscape and Staffordshire humour. ""Essentially, its about the feeling of home and nostalgia,"" she said. The business name was inspired by a children's story about the Staffordshire Hoard, a theme she is still keen to explore.  Her own children ""love"" the business - which started with clothing before focusing on ceramics - and have been inspired to create their own designs. ""They're always drawing their own little bottle kilns on things,"" she laughed. Ms Talbot is very pleased the Next range is being made in Stoke, given the city's industrial heritage. She said building the business to a high-street standard has taken a lot of hard work, particularly given the cost of living crisis. ""The last few years has been a bit tougher to be a small business,"" she explained. ""But it's always stayed going because it is my passion."" Her increasingly popular designs caught they eye of global retailer Next, and it was the retailer that approached her to ask for the first meeting. Ms Talbot said the retail giant is keen to work with ""up-and-coming designers, illustrators and small businesses because the want to support independents."" ""When I actually had to announce it, I was just so excited to let everyone know,"" she beamed. ""It's took a lot of hard work to get them there, but we're there!"""

Fritz saved three break points in the fifth game of the second set, giving him a 3-2 lead.  Djokovic, who had to withdraw from this year's French Open with a knee injury, was growing increasingly irate with the hip issue and called a medical timeout with Fritz 6-5 up.

World number one and defending champion Sinner reached the final with a 6-3 7-6 (7-3) win over Chinese wildcard Bu Yunchaokete. The Italian, 23, is competing in Beijing after the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) said on Saturday that it was appealing against the decision to clear him of blame after he twice tested positive for a banned substance. Wada said last month's ruling by an independent tribunal to find Sinner had no fault or negligence was ""not correct under the applicable rules"". It has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) and said the player should be banned for ""between one and two years"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgl05rp8r1o,The 91-year-old African president who keeps defying death rumours,"Cameroon's Paul Biya, 91, has not been seen for about a month, sending the rumour mill into overdrive.",5 days ago,2024-10-15 10:32:27.546512,China News,BBC,China,"Speculation over the wellbeing and whereabouts of Cameroon’s 91-year-old President Paul Biya has become a hot topic across Africa this week. After attending the China-Africa summit in Beijing in early September, it was perhaps no surprise that he gave the UN General Assembly in New York a miss.  But when he stayed away from this week’s summit of French-speaking countries (La Francophonie) at Viller Cotterêts, north of Paris, the rumour mill went into overdrive, as he had not been seen in public for about a month. Cameroon’s ambassador in France insisted that Biya was “in good health” and in Geneva - his habitual base when away from home. Other sources suggested this was because he needed to rest under medical supervision after a heavy diplomatic schedule in July and August.  After all, he is Africa’s oldest head of state and the second longest-serving, narrowly beaten to that record by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema of neighbouring Equatorial Guinea. Such mundane indications were not enough to still speculative guesswork about Biya in Africa-interested media and political circles. So finally the government spokesman, René Sadi, issued a formal denial of the rumours, adding that the president would return home ""in the next few days"".   And the head of the president's private office, with him in Geneva, also said he was “in excellent health”. Cameroon occupies a key strategic location, as the gateway to landlocked Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR). Apart from struggling to fully suppress jihadist violence around Lake Chad, it also wrestles with a complex and often violent crisis in its English-speaking regions. In leading the response to these challenges, Biya has brought an unusual personal style that often eschews the front of the stage, without any apparent personal need to engage in diplomatic presenteeism or performative summitry.  He is a habitual non-attendee at many gatherings of African leaders. Even back home, with his measured speech and cautious tone, Biya has for many years spaced his personal interventions, largely delegating the day-to-day running of the government, and handling of technical dossiers, to a succession of prime ministers. Unexplained absences from public view have been nothing out of the ordinary for this most enigmatic of presidents. Rumours that he has died do surface from time to time, largely because of these unannounced disappearances from the scene. But this low-key style belies the determination with which he contrived his arrival in power in 1982, elbowing aside his patron and predecessor Ahmadou Ahidjo, promising liberalising change before entrenching a hold on the presidency that no subsequent challenger or campaign of protest has managed to shift. As a wave of multi-party democratising change swept across much of Africa at the beginning of the 1990s, Biya was one of several incumbent leaders to shrewdly adapt, allowing sufficient reform to take the heat out of mass protest while nevertheless firmly keeping control.  Since one narrow election victory back in 1992, he has shrugged off subsequent political challenges, helped perhaps by manipulation of the polls and certainly by the divisions among often tactically inept opponents. Now, with Biya’s current seven-year term drawing to an end in November 2025, supporters have even been pressing the 91-year-old to stand again. Critics feel that it is long past time for Cameroon’s national leadership to pass to a younger generation who could tackle national problems and explore opportunities for development and progress with more speed and dynamism. In 2016 teachers and lawyers in the two mainly English-speaking regions, South-West and North-West, protested over the failure to properly resource English language rights and public services. If Biya had responded more rapidly and with a more assertively generous and loudly touted reform package, perhaps he could have assuaged discontent early on - and thus averted the eventual slide into violent confrontation between the security forces and armed militants demanding outright secession. Biya did later bring forward reforms – to meet the grievances of the English-speaking regions and, nationwide, to decentralise power to regional councils.  But sometimes citizens have faced long waits before the regime addresses their concerns - decentralised structures were not set up until many years after the original framework legislation had been passed. Some Cameroonians are, however, comfortable with Biya’s restrained approach to leadership and his readiness to leave successive prime ministers to handle routine decisions.  They see his role as more symbolic and distant, akin almost to a constitutional monarch. Certainly, this representational role is a dimension of the presidency with which he has seemed at ease.  On 15 August, for example, he was at Boulouris, on the Côte d’Azur in France, where he gave a detailed 12-minute address at the commemoration of the 1944 Allied landings to liberate southern France from the Nazis - an operation in which many troops from the French African territories took part. And in fact, despite frequent absences from the Cameroonian capital Yaoundé - usually retreating either to his home village in the forested south or to his preferred international base, Geneva’s Intercontinental Hotel - Biya has continued to take the key sensitive political and strategic decisions.  The main gatekeeper to the heart of power at the Étoudi presidential palace is the Secretary General of the Presidency, Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh. A power system where Biya, as the head of state, keeps his cards so close to his chest inevitably generates gossip about his own intentions for the 2025 election and about potential successors.  But some of the senior regime figures most frequently tipped, such as Laurent Esso and René Sadi, are by now themselves far from youthful. Support groups have also appeared to promote a passing of the torch to the president’s elder son Franck Biya, a businessman – although Franck himself has never shown any interest in politics or given any hint of such ambitions. But in today’s Africa, where disenchantment with the political establishment runs deep, particularly among young urban populations, establishment attempts to secure the continuation of power can carry risks. In neighbouring Gabon, President Ali Bongo was deposed by the army last year after the regime manipulated the 2023 election to deliver him a further seven-year term despite his fragile state of health. And when Senegal’s President Macky Sall lined up his Prime Minister Amadou Ba as his successor, he was decisively rebuffed by the voters who opted instead for the young reformist opponent Bassirou Diomaye Faye. Biya and his inner circle may feel confident of avoiding such scenarios. But that will require a shrewd reading of popular sentiment, especially among youth and the middle-class in big cities such as Yaoundé and Douala.

In his third ranking final - 11 years after losing the first of those to Chinese snooker doyen Ding Junhui in Shanghai - Xiao withstood a fightback to prevail in a high-quality match. Xiao made an impressive start and moved into a 5-3 lead following a 129 break in the opening session of only the third tour final between two players from mainland China. Si showed resolve with a century break in the eighth frame to pull one back but Xiao later made a run of 113 to extend his lead to 8-4 before winning the next frame of the evening session to move one away from victory. He would have to wait for his crowning moment as Si produced a stirring surge, which included a break of 131, to reduce the deficit to 9-7. The 22-year-old Si, who made the first 147 break of his career in a semi-final win over world number one Judd Trump, was playing elegantly as he chased down the lead. He had the first opportunity of the 17th frame but a miss on 46 opened the door for Xiao, who crafted a testing snooker and went on to end Si's challenge. The 35-year-old Xiao's success secured the top prize of Â£140,000. Xiao, who knocked out reigning world champion Kyren Wilson earlier in the tournament, will jump 11 places to 18th in the world rankings with his long-awaited title.

President Paul Biya has not been seen in public since 8 September, when he attended a China-Africa forum in Beijing. He has since missed events he was scheduled to be at, such as the United Nations General Assembly in New York. But in a statement, the head of Cameroon's civil cabinet said Biya was well and condemned the ""mischievous individuals"" speculating about the president's health and ""eventual death"". The statement came after days of opposition parties and civil society groups calling for information on Biya's health and exact whereabouts. ""The head of state continues to exercise his duties in Geneva and has never departed the [Swiss] city following his visit to Beijing,"" Samuel Mvondo Ayolo, director of the civil cabinet said on Wednesday evening. Biya has long been criticised for the amount of time he spends outside the country - and in Switzerland in particular. In 2018, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reported that since coming to power in 1982, Biya had spent the equivalent of four-and-a-half years on overseas trips. The Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva is said to be his favourite destination. In a separate statement, government spokesperson René Sadi said Biya would return to Cameroon ""in the next few days"". He dismissed reports of Biya's ailing health as ""pure fantasy"". After 42 years in power, Biya is one of Africa's longest-serving leaders.  Under his rule, Cameroon has moved from being a one-party state to multi-party politics, but it has also been marked by endemic corruption. Democratic gains have also been reversed, leading to the abolition of presidential term limits in 2008. Cameroon is also in the grips of a secessionist war that has killed more than 6,000 people in the west of the country. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwye2gljdewo,Cameroon bans reports on President Biya’s health,"Rumours about the leader's death, which have been denied by officials, have been swirling all week.",4 days ago,2024-10-15 10:32:28.124877,China News,BBC,China,"The Cameroonian authorities have banned the media from discussing the health of President Paul Biya, following rumours of his death. Interior Minister Paul Atanga Nji told regional governors that these stories “disturb the tranquillity of Cameroonians”. “Any debate in the media about the president’s condition is therefore strictly prohibited,” he insisted, threatening that “offenders will face the rigour of the law.” The 91-year-old leader – in office for more than four decades – has not been seen in public since 8 September, when he attended a China-Africa forum in Beijing. Several officials have pushed back against speculation around Biya’s condition, insisting he was in good health and on a private stay in Geneva, Switzerland. Nji said that the health status of the president was a matter of national security and urged governors to create units to ensure the order was being followed by private media outlets and social media. Many journalists in the country have said they consider the ban a violation of press freedom. “By saying that mention should not be made of the president’s [health] situation, I find it an infringement on our rights,” a Cameroonian journalist told the BBC on condition of anonymity. He added that “it’s going to really affect the way we report because we’ll certainly not want to run into trouble with government”. The media restrictions have also raised concerns about the safety of journalists in a country where media professionals are regularly targeted by officials and insurgent groups. In the past, Anglophone separatists have kidnapped journalists while the government has arrested and detained members of the media. “I will continue to report even though I fear they could track me down, because there’s no way my report will not talk about the president’s whereabouts or what could be happening to him. I’ll continue to do my job,” another journalist said. In a statement on Thursday, global press freedom organisation the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) urged the Cameroonian government to “end its threats to sanction private media journalists who report on the condition and whereabouts of President Paul Biya”. “The health of the president, who has been in power for 41 years and may seek re-election next year, is of public interest. Any misguided attempt to censor reporting about his health for national security reasons simply fuels rampant speculation,” Angela Quintal, head of CPJ’s Africa Programme, stated. “The Cameroonian government should simply put the rumours to rest by arranging a public appearance by the head of state,” she suggested. As speculation about the wellbeing of President Biya continues, Cameroonians are highly anticipating his return to the country in the coming days, as promised by the authorities.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8mvmmpmvro,Australia's lithium mining boom hit by sagging prices,"Some producers have halted operations, while others are increasing production, hopeful of an upturn.",26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:28.223290,China News,BBC,China,"Often called “white gold” and the key component in rechargeable batteries, the metal lithium is so light that it floats on water, but its price has sunk like a stone over the past year. Due to a combination of falling sales of electric vehicles, and a world oversupply of lithium ore, the cost of the main lithium compound has fallen by more than three quarters since June 2023. This decline has had a particularly hard impact on Australia, because it is the world’s largest producer of lithium ore, accounting for 52% of the global total last year. Australia also has the second-largest reserves of the mineral after Chile, with the vast majority in Western Australia, and a smaller amount in the Northern Territory. The sharp decline in lithium prices has led to mine shutdowns. Adelaide-based Core Lithium announced back in January that due to ""weak market conditions"" it was suspending mining at its Finniss site near Darwin, with the loss of 150 jobs.  Then in August, US firm Albemarle said it would be scaling back production at its Kemerton lithium processing plant, located some 170km (100 miles) south of Perth. This is expected to lead to more than 300 redundancies. Arcadium Lithium followed suit this month, announcing that it would be mothballing its Mt Cattlin mine in Western Australia, blaming low prices. The firm’s shares are listed in both the US and Australia. Yet as some producers are putting work on hold, others are expanding theirs, confident that global demand for lithium - and prices - will bounce back. Pilbara Minerals is one such firm. The Perth-based miner aims to boost its lithium ore production by an additional 50% over the next year. “What we've learned historically from lithium pricing is that it can change, and it can change rapidly,"" managing director Dale Henderson recently told ABC News.  “It doesn't faze us that much because we know the long-term outlook is fantastic.” This confidence is echoed by Kingsley Jones, founder, and chief investment officer at Canberra-based investment firm Jevons Global, which monitors the mining and metals sectors. “Lithium remains very strategic to the energy transition,” he tells the BBC. “Storage batteries for electricity is a big growth area,” he adds, pointing to the increased need for batteries to store the power generated by solar and wind power. But some analysts have warned that oversupply will keep the market under pressure until at least 2028. Another company moving ahead with increased lithium ore production in Australia is Perth-based Liontown Resources. In July, it started production at its Kathleen Valley mine, located 420 miles (680km) north-east of Western Australia’s capital. The facility gets 60% of its energy from its own solar panel farm. Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, has praised the site’s green approach, and his government has invested $A230m ($156m; £118m) in the facility. This move towards the use of renewables is also good news in financial terms for producers in Australia, as it reduces their dependence on buying expensive diesel, which is currently the main fuel that they use to generate electricity. Extracting lithium ore in the country requires three times more energy than in other big producing nations such as Chile and Argentina, says Prof Rick Valenta, the director of the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University of Queensland. Extraction in Australia requires additional energy because the lithium ore, also known as spodumene, has to be mined and removed from solid rock. Whereas in Chile and Argentina the ore is produced by evaporating it from brine collected from under the countries' vast salt plains. “As Australia has hard-rock mining operations, they use more energy and produce more emissions than brine operations,” Prof Valenta adds. The form of lithium that Australia exports – almost all of which goes to China – is partially processed ore, called spodumene concentrate. Prices of this have mirrored the sharp fall of refined lithium. One report this month said that the price of spodumene had hit its lowest level since August 2021. Chinese companies refine the spodumene into solid lithium, and into the two lithium compounds used in batteries - lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate.   This is where the real money is to be made, because a tonne of lithium carbonate is currently around 72,500 yuan ($10,280; £7,720) compared with just $747 (£630) for the same weight of spodumene concentrate. Given that price differential, Australian mining firms have unsurprisingly been moving to build their own lithium refineries instead of just exporting almost all spodumene, as is the case currently. In 2022-23, 98% was exported as spodumene concentrate. The first refined lithium to be commercially produced in Australia happened back in 2022, when Perth-based IGO announced that it was making battery-grade lithium hydroxide at its Kwinana Refinery in Western Australia. It co-owns the facility with Chinese firm Tianqi Lithium. Meanwhile, another Australian miner, Covalent Lithium, is building its own lithium refinery, also in Western Australia. And Albemarle has its refinery, albeit one currently reducing its output. Some commentators welcome the development of lithium refining in Australia, saying it will help to reduce China’s dominance of the global market for the metal. China currently accounts for 60% of all lithium refining. However, Kingsley Jones says that Australia needs to be more open to embracing Chinese investment in the lithium sector. He points out that the Australian government has, in his view, “adopted a strategy, we think unwisely, to preference investment from countries other than China” in the lithium sector in recent years. This has come as relations between the two countries have cooled since 2020. Last year, Canberra even blocked the sale of an Australian lithium miner to a Chinese firm. The government said at the time that it was simply following the advice of the country’s Foreign Investment Review Board. Mr Jones adds: “It’s an excellent example of how to shoot yourself in the foot as a producer.  You tell the biggest buyer to go away. So, they do.” Australia's Department of Industry, Science and Resources did not respond to a request for a comment. As Australia aims to become more of a lithium refiner, government scientists are continuing to research ways to do this in a more environmentally friendly way. A code, which if cracked, could make the country one of the greenest producers of the metal. Currently the process releases a lot of poisonous chlorine gas. “There is only one industrial method, and it has several drawbacks,” says Dongmei Liu, a research scientist at Australia’s national science agency, the CSIRO. “The process is very expensive and not very efficient.  Most importantly, it also produces chlorine gas.  It has severe environmental issues.” She and her team are instead working on a new process called “shock quenching”. It involves the extreme cooling of lithium vapour, and Dr Lui says it “avoids the chlorine gas emissions”. While Australia hopes to make its mineral industries less polluting, it also wants to recycle more. Lithium Australia is a listed company that sorts and processes batteries that have come to the end of their lives, to extract their lithium and other metals for reuse. “Global commodities prices place economic pressure on lithium, so creating a circular battery industry will benefit Australia by ensuring we have the sovereign capability to produce and recycle our own batteries,” says Lithium Australia chief executive Simon Linge. “If Australia is to establish a battery manufacturing industry, we must first ensure that no end-of-life lithium battery is being sent to landfill or exported to be recycled in some other country.” "

World number one Sinner recovered from a set down to beat Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-2, while Alcaraz earned a 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 victory against Yibing Wu. Sinner held his serve in an 11-minute sixth game to go 4-2 up in the deciding set of his match, before winning the next two games to close out the win in two hours 38 minutes.   ""It got stressful because if I lose the game at 3-2 and he makes the break then we are back even,"" said the Italian. ""Sometimes you have to wait for your chances, which I have done, while trying to stay calm mentally. Today that was the key."" Sinner has won six titles this year, including two Grand Slams, but is playing amid the World Anti-Doping Agency appealing against the decision to clear him of blame after he twice tested positive for a banned substance. He failed to take two break points when leading 6-5 in the first set before his Argentine opponent, who was impressing with his big serving and powerful game, won the tie-break. Sinner took the fifth game of the second on Etcheverry's serve with a fizzing forehand down the line, only for the world number 37 to respond by breaking straight back with an equally fine crosscourt forehand. The Italian secured a second successive break and comfortably served out for the set to level the match, before grinding out the deciding set to reach the last 16, where he will play either Roberto Carballes Baena, of Spain, or American Ben Shelton. ""It was a very tough match physically, but also mentally so I am very happy that I have been through this one and let's see what is coming,"" added Sinner. Gauff beats Muchova in China for eighth WTA title Sinner 'surprised' as Wada launches doping appeal World number two Alcaraz was playing China's Wu, who belied his ranking of 560. Both players produced blistering groundstrokes in a high-quality first set which Wu started strongly. He had the support of the home crowd and hit some eye-catching shots, especially off his backhand. However, his serve came under the greater pressure, and while he managed to get to a tie-break he lost it to go a set down. In the second set, Wu thought he had saved a break point in the sixth game only for his first serve to be deemed out after an Alcaraz review. The Spaniard then won the point to register the first break of the match and go 4-2 up, before going on to serve out the match. ""He's recovering his level. He's coming back from injury so his level deserves to be at the top for sure,"" said Alcaraz.  ""If he is still playing at this level and keeps going then I'm going to see him around more often.  ""I'm really happy to get through. I'm not used to the way I felt on court. He's a really powerful player and played strong. I felt like I was not dominating the game."" Daniil Medvedev also made it through, battling to a 5-7 6-4 6-4 victory against Matteo Arnaldi in two hours 44 minutes. Medvedev achieved the decisive break in the ninth game of the deciding set before going on to serve out for the match and will play either Stefanos Tsitsipas or Alexandre Muller in the last 16. ""It was a very tough match, a very close one,"" said Medvedev. ""I actually felt like that's where tennis is funny. I felt like in the first set, I was probably the better player, had more opportunities. I didnât manage to [win] it, played a bad game at the end of the set. ""In the other sets, I thought it was closer, maybe even he had the edge on some of the moments. But, that's why tennis is crazy, you can win when you don't expect it, and lose when you expect to win, so Iâm happy to be here again in two days.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqz2y9jd1ro,Modi meets top US tech leaders amid semiconductor push,The Indian prime minister met CEOs of top tech firms in New York a day after attending the Quad summit.,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:34.603394,China News,BBC,China,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged top tech companies in the US to explore India as a destination for manufacturing and innovation. He met CEOs of tech companies in New York a day after attending the annual meeting of Quad countries, which also includes the US, Australia and Japan. India has been positioning itself as an alternative to China to attract global firms looking at diversifying their supply chains. The country has been particularly focusing on manufacturing of semiconductors in the past few years but it still lags far behind major suppliers like China and Taiwan. Modi’s meeting with the tech leaders on Monday was attended by 15 top CEOs, including Google’s Sundar Pichai, Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen, IBM’s Arvind Krishna and NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang. Addressing the gathering, Modi said, “they can co-develop, co-design, and co-produce in India for the world"". India’s foreign ministry said in a statement that the roundtable meeting touched upon technology’s use in innovations, “which have the potential to revolutionise the global economy and human development”. Modi also addressed a rally of Indian-Americans whom he called “brand ambassadors” of the country and told the crowd of 15,000 in New York that India was key to “global development, global peace, global climate action, global innovations, global supply chains”. On Saturday, Modi met US President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Quad summit and the two countries signed several agreements. The India-US semiconductor pact – which they have described as a “watershed arrangement” – aims to establish a fabrication plant which will produce chips for national security, next-generation telecommunications and green energy applications, said a joint release. This is India’s first such project with the US in which the country will provide chips to the US armed forces, allied militaries and Indian military. Previous attempts at building homegrown semiconductor manufacturing industry in India have not seen desired results. But as the US aims to build resilience against China’s semiconductor industry – vital for modern technology – the deal gives a renewed fillip to India. The Indian Express newspaper reported that the plant will focus on “three essential pillars for modern war fighting: advanced sensing, advanced communications and high voltage power electronics”. The two leaders or the joint statement didn’t make any mention of the ongoing tensions over the targeting of Sikh leaders in the US and Canada. Sikh separatist leaders, who have been demanding a separate homeland to be carved out of India for decades, say they have faced threats and assassination attempts by groups backed by India. India denies the allegations. This was Modi's first US visit since he won his third term in June and it came weeks before the US presidential elections, where the Democrats are vying for re-election against former President Donald Trump of the Republican party. Last week, Trump had announced that Modi was “a fantastic man” and he was going to meet him. But Indian diplomats were quiet about this meeting and it hasn’t happened so far. On Saturday, the Quad leaders issued a joint communique which focused largely on maritime security in the Indo-Pacific region. “We strongly oppose any destabilising or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion…We seek a region where no country dominates and no country is dominated - one where all countries are free from coercion, and can exercise their agency to determine their futures,” the statement read. Analysts say the statement didn’t name China but a large part of the message was aimed at the country. They also noticed that the language appeared to be much stronger. “The language in the joint statement on provocations in the South China Sea, while not directly referring to China, is stronger than it's ever been before. And that’s because all four Quad states are increasingly concerned about the escalation in Chinese activities there,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Centre think-tank in Washington. The Quad partners also announced the expansion of maritime surveillance, a pilot logistics network for natural disasters and a project to combat cervical cancer."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rdy132q3lo,Thieves snatched his phone in London - it was in China a month later,Akara tells the BBC about the journey his phone took after it was snatched from his hands by thieves.,7 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:34.703725,China News,BBC,China,"Early on a Saturday morning in April, Akara Etteh was checking his phone as he came out of Holborn tube station, in central London. A moment later, it was in the hand of a thief on the back of an electric bike - Akara gave chase, but they got away. He is just one victim of an estimated 78,000 ""snatch thefts"" in England and Wales in the year to March, a big increase on the previous 12 months. The prosecution rate for this offence is very low - the police say they are targeting the criminals responsible but cannot ""arrest their way out of the problem"". They also say manufacturers and tech firms have a bigger role to play. Victims of the crime have been telling the BBC of the impact it has had on them - ranging from losing irreplaceable photos to having tens of thousands of pounds stolen. And for Akara, like many other people who have their phone taken, there was another frustration: he was able to track where his device went, but was powerless to get it back. He put his iPhone 13 into lost mode when he got home an hour or so later - meaning the thieves couldn't access its contents - and turned on the Find My iPhone feature using his laptop. This allowed Akara to track his phone's rough location and almost immediately he received a notification to say it was in Islington. Eight days later, the phone was pinging in different locations around north London again. In a move he says he ""wouldn't recommend"" with hindsight, he went to two of the locations his phone had been in to ""look around"". ""It was pretty risky,"" he said. ""I was fuelled by adrenaline and anger.""  He didn't speak to anyone, but he felt he was being watched and went home. ""I am really angry,"" he said. ""The phone is expensive. We work hard to earn that money, to be able to buy the handset, and someone else says 'screw that'."" Then, in May, just over a month after the theft, Akara checked Find My iPhone again - his prized possession was now on the other side of the world - in Shenzhen, China.  Akara gave up. It is not uncommon for stolen phones to end up in Shenzhen - where if devices can't be unlocked and used again, they are disassembled for parts. The city is home to 17.6 million people and is a big tech hub, sometimes referred to as China's Silicon Valley. In the moments after Akara’s phone was stolen, he saw police officers on the street and he told them what had happened. Officers, he said, were aware of thieves doing a “loop of the area” to steal phones, and he was encouraged to report the offence online, which he did. A few days later, he was told by the Metropolitan Police via email the case was closed as “it is unlikely that we will be able to identify those responsible”. Akara subsequently submitted the pictures and information he had gathered from the locations where his stolen phone had been. The police acknowledged receipt but took no further action. The Metropolitan Police had no comment to make on Akara’s specific case, but said it was “targeting resources to hotspot areas, such as Westminster, Lambeth and Newham, with increased patrols and plain clothes officers which deter criminals and make officers more visibly available to members of the community”.  Many other people have contacted the BBC with their experiences of having their phones taken. One, James O’Sullivan, 44, from Surrey, says he lost more than £25,000 when thieves used his stolen device's Apple Pay service. Meanwhile, Katie Ashworth, from Newcastle, explained her phone was snatched in a park along with her watch, and a debit card in the phone case. “The saddest thing was that the phone contained the last photos I had of my mum on a walk before she got too unwell to really do anything - I would do anything to get those photos back,"" the 36-year-old says.  Again, she says, there was a lack of action from the police. ""The police never even followed it up with me, despite my bank transactions showing exactly where the thieves went,"" she said. ""The police just told me to check Facebook Marketplace and local second-hand shops like Cex."" So why are the police seemingly unable to combat this offence - or recover stolen devices? PC Mat Evans, who has led a team working on this kind of crime for over a decade within West Midlands Police, admitted that only ""quite a low number"" of phones that are stolen actually get recovered. He says the problem is the speed with which criminals move. ""Phones will be offloaded to known fences within a couple of hours,"" he said. ""It's always a battle against the clock immediately following any of these crimes, but people should always report these things to the police, because if we don't know that these crimes are taking place, we can't investigate them."" And sometimes just one arrest can make a difference. ""When we do catch these criminals, either in the act or after the fact, our crime rates tank,"" he said.  ""Quite often that individual has been responsible for a huge swathe of crime."" But the problem is not just about policing. In a statement, Commander Richard Smith from the National Police Chiefs' Council, which brings together senior officers to help develop policing strategy, said it would ""continue to target"" the most prolific criminals. ""We know that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem,"" he said.  ""Manufacturers and the tech industry have an important role in reducing opportunities for criminals to benefit from the resale of stolen handsets."" Stolen phones can already be tracked and have their data erased through services such as ""Find My iPhone"" and ""Find My Device"", from Android. But policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said this week the government wanted manufacturers to ensure that any stolen phone could be permanently disabled to prevent it being sold second-hand. Police chiefs will also be tasked with gathering more intelligence on who is stealing phones and where stolen devices end up. A growing demand for second-hand phones, both in the UK and abroad, is believed to be a major driver behind the recent rise in thefts, the government said. The Home Office is to host a summit at which tech companies and phone manufacturers will be asked to consider innovations that could help stop phones being traded illegally. PC Evans said there was ""no magic bullet"", but he said there was one thing manufacturers could do which would be ""enormously helpful"" to the police - more accurate tracking.  ""At this moment in time, phone tracking is okay,"" he said.  ""But it's not that scene in Total Recall yet, where you're able to run around with a tracking device in your hand, sprinting down the road after a little bleeping dot.  ""I appreciate it's a big ask from the phone companies to make that a thing, but that would be enormously helpful from a policing perspective."" Apple and Android did not provide the BBC with a statement, but Samsung said it was ""working closely with key stakeholders and authorities on the issue of mobile phone theft and related crimes"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgry10924jqo,How worried should I be about rising oil prices?,"As the conflict across the Middle East widens, rising oil prices are being closely watched.",4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:34.806531,China News,BBC,China,"As the conflict across the Middle East widens, rising oil prices are being closely watched. The cost of oil affects everything from the price of food at the supermarket to how much it costs to fill up your car. The price of crude oil has risen almost 10% this week to around $78 a barrel as the conflict has intensified.  That may seem like a big jump, but the price of crude oil tends to be volatile, and in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a barrel of benchmark Brent crude hit almost $130. The uptick comes as many countries, including the UK, are just beginning to recover from the sharp rise in oil prices after the Covid pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine. So how worried should we be? Crude oil is a key ingredient in petrol and diesel, meaning higher oil prices could drive up prices at the pumps just when they've just hit their lowest level for three years. If a company delivering goods, such as food, is hit by higher fuel costs, it is also likely to raise its prices. These increased costs could then be passed on by supermarkets selling the food to us, the consumer. The cost of living goes up. ""Everything we go and buy in the shop has been transported around and has been made from things that have been transported around. The increase in fuel costs tends to filter into everything,"" Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec, tells the BBC. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, which sets interest rates, has warned the conflict in the Middle East has the potential to have a ""very serious"" impact on the UK. Mr Bailey said he was watching developments ""extremely closely"". This comes as he signalled interest rates are on the path downwards, and the UK's prospects on inflation - which has come down after being driven up by high oil and gas prices in 2022 - are looking brighter. Yet so far a rise to about $78 a barrel is not the time for alarm bells. If the ""worst-case scenario"" of further escalation does not materialise, oil prices are likely to ""ease back quite quickly"", says Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. Iran is the world's seventh largest oil exporter, with half of its exports going to China. If supplies were disrupted, China could turn to Russia. But Ms Bain warns markets are ""finely balanced"", and if the conflict escalates, ""taking out a medium-sized supplier like Iran would lead to a spike in prices"". She says there is ""more than enough capacity"" globally to cover the gap if Iranian production is lost, but there is the question of where Saudi Arabia's ""loyalty will lie"" as the world's second largest oil producer and whether it will increase or restrict further production. Mr Macpherson says if Israel did decide to attack Iran's oil sector, a rise in the price of Brent crude could increase the cost of filling up at the pumps ""quite quickly"".  He explains that this scenario could threaten general inflation in the UK, which could in turn influence any decision from the Bank of England to lower interest rates. However, he also points out ""there might not ultimately be any disruption to supply"" at all. The direct impact of Iran's oil production is not the only concern.  There is a risk that any escalation in the region could block the Strait of Hormuz, a relatively narrow channel through which a huge amount of oil tanker traffic passes -about a third of total seaborne-traded oil. It is also the path through which a fifth of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is transported, a commodity that the world has become more dependent on since sanctions were imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Asia is most physically dependent on the flow of oil and gas out of the Persian Gulf, and the immediate impact of an escalation would be significant. Disruption to LNG shipments from one of the world's biggest exporters in Qatar would lead to higher gas prices - which could in turn lead to a rise in household gas and electricity bills. As with oil, gas prices filter down supply chains, affecting the cost of virtually all goods. UK energy bills have risen 10% for this winter, but are currently predicted to fall slightly in January. This forecast could change of course, if an escalation to the conflict in the Middle East affects global gas supplies, and leads to higher prices. But Ms Bain says the risk of strait being blocked as a result of the conflict is small. And if it does transpire, Mr Macpherson adds the effect on the UK would be minimal, given that most of Europe's gas is supplied mainly from Norway. There are a lot of possible outcomes, but in terms of what will happen with oil prices in the coming weeks and months, ""nobody knows"", Mr Macpherson admits.  There's a ""wide spectrum"" of what could come next, he adds, but ""there is really no way of telling where we will be this time next week""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm29j4kx4vmo,"Wait a few more minutes for an electric Uber, says boss",The platform wants customers to go 'green' as it tries to boost the take-up of electric cars.,7 days ago,2024-10-15 10:32:34.916576,China News,BBC,China,"People waiting for an Uber should be patient enough to wait a few minutes longer for an electric car, the boss of the ride-hailing firm has said. ""A couple of minutes isn't going to kill anyone,"" Dara Khosrowshahi told the BBC in an interview. Uber is rolling out new options to encourage customers to choose electric rides, but at the same time he says governments should be doing more to support sales of electric vehicles (EVs). Cheaper, Chinese-made electric vehicles are also ""good for the environment"" he said. Despite that, many countries are pushing back against the import of Chinese EVs because they see them as unfair competition for domestic carmakers. ""High quality"" Chinese-made EVs are part of the solution to the climate crisis, Mr Khosrowshahi said. He also called on the new UK government to stick to its pre-election pledge and end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, after the previous government pushed the deadline back to 2035. Uber's push to get customers to pick the green ride option is part of the company's overall sustainability aims - that all its car journeys and deliveries should be carried out in ""zero emissions vehicles"" by 2040.  But the ambition is set to become more challenging as it plans to expand beyond cab rides and food delivery. Customers can already pick an EV when they book an Uber. A new option will allow them to register a permanent preference for taking an electric vehicle. Most Ubers are still petrol, diesel or hybrid vehicles, so it is likely customers will have to wait a little longer for an EV to arrive. ""We're not saying, hey, wait 15 minutes, but if you have to wait another two, three minutes to help the environment, why not make that investment?"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. In London, almost a third of Uber drivers have invested in an EV, so the difference in waiting times may not be long. But EV uptake is lower elsewhere in the UK and worldwide. In European cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, Madrid and Paris only 20% of the miles driven by Uber vehicles are fully electric. As well as benefiting the planet, Mr Khosrowshahi believes the shift to electric will benefit Uber's business in the long run.  However, he says the firm currently makes a smaller profit margin on electric car rides.  Uber is also introducing more delivery services, hoping to challenge rivals on things like household products and groceries. ""You can get pet food from your local shop with an Uber courier within the next hour or two,"" said Mr Khosrowshahi. ""Ultimately we think that [it] can be even better than Amazon,"" he said. Critics have pointed out that ride-hailing and delivery services have already contributed to a rise in the number of car journeys being made, whether that's swapping a night bus for a cab ride, or getting a bubble tea delivered to your desk.  Mr Khosrowshahi said he understood that governments had broader things to consider around tariffs on electric vehicles, but saw Chinese-made vehicles as part of the solution.  ""For us we want to electrify our fleet and we want to make sure that it is affordable for our drivers,"" he said. Price is one of the biggest obstacles to the broader take-up of electric cars.  Concerns over electric charging infrastructure have also contributed to EV sales stalling in many parts of the world. Mr Khosrowshahi said he thought governments should be providing more support for the switch to electric, including in the UK, but he would like that support to be targeted at those who drive the most, such as Uber drivers, or for corporate fleets, rather than individuals. ""The Uber driver drives four to five times the miles of average drivers,"" he said.  Carmakers are calling for subsidies to be more balanced between business and individual buyers to encourage demand more broadly. The US and European Union (EU) argue the Chinese are unfairly subsiding their carmakers and have imposed tariffs - or import taxes - to bring prices of Chinese cars more into line with domestic manufacturers.  The UK has not imposed tariffs on Chinese-made cars. Using tariffs to make Chinese cars more expensive for European and American consumers was ""negative"" for the planet, Mr Khosrowshahi said. Without such tariffs, cars made by Chinese firms could potentially be supplied more cheaply to consumers in US and EU. Uber also has a tie-up with Chinese carmaker BYD, the second-largest EV company after Elon Musk's Tesla. "

South Kesteven District Council (SKDC) contracted Leisure Energy Limited to procure and supply solar panels for Grantham Meres Leisure Centre, which subcontracted the work to Geo Green UK. However, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), the panels were being supplied by PV manufacturer Canadian Solar - a company facing allegations of using forced labour in China, which they have strongly denied. The LDRS has contacted Canadian Solar for comment on the council opting for a new supplier. The panels will now be supplied by JA Solar, which the council said uses more ""transparent"" supply chain practices. In May 2022, CEO and chairman of Canadian Solar Dr Shawn Qu insisted that no evidence of forced labour within the company’s supply chain had been found. He said: “Canadian Solar strongly condemns the illegal practice of modern slavery or forced labour of any kind. ""We are confident in the management quality processes that we have in place across our international supply chains."" More than £4 million, made up of a grant from the government’s Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme and funding from the council’s own budget, is being used to install an air source heat pump at the leisure centre on Trent Road. To offset the conversion from gas, solar panels were also planned to support the heating system, utilising a separate grant of £445,725 from the government’s Swimming Pool Support Fund. During a full council meeting on Thursday, SKDC leader Ashley Baxter said he disagreed with using Canadian Solar, stating he actively sought alternatives due to the allegations. He shared that councillor David Bellamy and Alicia Kearns, Conservative MP for Stamford and Rutland, had alerted him to the concerns surrounding Canadian Solar’s supply chain. At the meeting, Baxter said “pretty much the whole PV market is muddled up with ethical concerns,"" discussing claims Uyghur people are facing a genocide and are being used as forced labour to produce many household items, including PV panels. “No one on this council, I’m sure, would support either genocide or the ongoing treatment of the Uyghur people,” he added. Baxter said that the project ""remains on schedule"" despite the supplier switch and that the move would help the council to reduce their carbon footprint.  “We are revitalising a neglected facility and we are becoming more sustainable,” he added. Canadian Solar is one of the main names behind the Mallard Pass Solar Farm, which is said to be the largest solar farm in the country.  It is being developed on the border of Stamford and Rutland by Windel Energy and Recurrent Energy, the latter of which is a subsidiary of Canadian Solar Inc. Despite opposition from local residents, SKDC and Kearns, the 2,000-acre solar farm was approved by the Labour government just over a week after the General Election in July. In 2022, Dr Qu said: “Canadian Solar continues to take steps to ensure that our supply chain remains free of modern slavery and forced labour."" He said they had ""published clear policies and processes"" relating to the prevention of modern slavery and forced labour. Dr Qu also said the company works with national trade bodies to ""agree and implement strong and accountable supply chain protocols"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgry10924jqo,How worried should I be about rising oil prices?,"As the conflict across the Middle East widens, rising oil prices are being closely watched.",4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:40.671477,China News,BBC,China,"As the conflict across the Middle East widens, rising oil prices are being closely watched. The cost of oil affects everything from the price of food at the supermarket to how much it costs to fill up your car. The price of crude oil has risen almost 10% this week to around $78 a barrel as the conflict has intensified.  That may seem like a big jump, but the price of crude oil tends to be volatile, and in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a barrel of benchmark Brent crude hit almost $130. The uptick comes as many countries, including the UK, are just beginning to recover from the sharp rise in oil prices after the Covid pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine. So how worried should we be? Crude oil is a key ingredient in petrol and diesel, meaning higher oil prices could drive up prices at the pumps just when they've just hit their lowest level for three years. If a company delivering goods, such as food, is hit by higher fuel costs, it is also likely to raise its prices. These increased costs could then be passed on by supermarkets selling the food to us, the consumer. The cost of living goes up. ""Everything we go and buy in the shop has been transported around and has been made from things that have been transported around. The increase in fuel costs tends to filter into everything,"" Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec, tells the BBC. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, which sets interest rates, has warned the conflict in the Middle East has the potential to have a ""very serious"" impact on the UK. Mr Bailey said he was watching developments ""extremely closely"". This comes as he signalled interest rates are on the path downwards, and the UK's prospects on inflation - which has come down after being driven up by high oil and gas prices in 2022 - are looking brighter. Yet so far a rise to about $78 a barrel is not the time for alarm bells. If the ""worst-case scenario"" of further escalation does not materialise, oil prices are likely to ""ease back quite quickly"", says Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. Iran is the world's seventh largest oil exporter, with half of its exports going to China. If supplies were disrupted, China could turn to Russia. But Ms Bain warns markets are ""finely balanced"", and if the conflict escalates, ""taking out a medium-sized supplier like Iran would lead to a spike in prices"". She says there is ""more than enough capacity"" globally to cover the gap if Iranian production is lost, but there is the question of where Saudi Arabia's ""loyalty will lie"" as the world's second largest oil producer and whether it will increase or restrict further production. Mr Macpherson says if Israel did decide to attack Iran's oil sector, a rise in the price of Brent crude could increase the cost of filling up at the pumps ""quite quickly"".  He explains that this scenario could threaten general inflation in the UK, which could in turn influence any decision from the Bank of England to lower interest rates. However, he also points out ""there might not ultimately be any disruption to supply"" at all. The direct impact of Iran's oil production is not the only concern.  There is a risk that any escalation in the region could block the Strait of Hormuz, a relatively narrow channel through which a huge amount of oil tanker traffic passes -about a third of total seaborne-traded oil. It is also the path through which a fifth of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is transported, a commodity that the world has become more dependent on since sanctions were imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Asia is most physically dependent on the flow of oil and gas out of the Persian Gulf, and the immediate impact of an escalation would be significant. Disruption to LNG shipments from one of the world's biggest exporters in Qatar would lead to higher gas prices - which could in turn lead to a rise in household gas and electricity bills. As with oil, gas prices filter down supply chains, affecting the cost of virtually all goods. UK energy bills have risen 10% for this winter, but are currently predicted to fall slightly in January. This forecast could change of course, if an escalation to the conflict in the Middle East affects global gas supplies, and leads to higher prices. But Ms Bain says the risk of strait being blocked as a result of the conflict is small. And if it does transpire, Mr Macpherson adds the effect on the UK would be minimal, given that most of Europe's gas is supplied mainly from Norway. There are a lot of possible outcomes, but in terms of what will happen with oil prices in the coming weeks and months, ""nobody knows"", Mr Macpherson admits.  There's a ""wide spectrum"" of what could come next, he adds, but ""there is really no way of telling where we will be this time next week""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm29j4kx4vmo,"Wait a few more minutes for an electric Uber, says boss",The platform wants customers to go 'green' as it tries to boost the take-up of electric cars.,7 days ago,2024-10-15 10:32:40.761120,China News,BBC,China,"People waiting for an Uber should be patient enough to wait a few minutes longer for an electric car, the boss of the ride-hailing firm has said. ""A couple of minutes isn't going to kill anyone,"" Dara Khosrowshahi told the BBC in an interview. Uber is rolling out new options to encourage customers to choose electric rides, but at the same time he says governments should be doing more to support sales of electric vehicles (EVs). Cheaper, Chinese-made electric vehicles are also ""good for the environment"" he said. Despite that, many countries are pushing back against the import of Chinese EVs because they see them as unfair competition for domestic carmakers. ""High quality"" Chinese-made EVs are part of the solution to the climate crisis, Mr Khosrowshahi said. He also called on the new UK government to stick to its pre-election pledge and end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, after the previous government pushed the deadline back to 2035. Uber's push to get customers to pick the green ride option is part of the company's overall sustainability aims - that all its car journeys and deliveries should be carried out in ""zero emissions vehicles"" by 2040.  But the ambition is set to become more challenging as it plans to expand beyond cab rides and food delivery. Customers can already pick an EV when they book an Uber. A new option will allow them to register a permanent preference for taking an electric vehicle. Most Ubers are still petrol, diesel or hybrid vehicles, so it is likely customers will have to wait a little longer for an EV to arrive. ""We're not saying, hey, wait 15 minutes, but if you have to wait another two, three minutes to help the environment, why not make that investment?"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. In London, almost a third of Uber drivers have invested in an EV, so the difference in waiting times may not be long. But EV uptake is lower elsewhere in the UK and worldwide. In European cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, Madrid and Paris only 20% of the miles driven by Uber vehicles are fully electric. As well as benefiting the planet, Mr Khosrowshahi believes the shift to electric will benefit Uber's business in the long run.  However, he says the firm currently makes a smaller profit margin on electric car rides.  Uber is also introducing more delivery services, hoping to challenge rivals on things like household products and groceries. ""You can get pet food from your local shop with an Uber courier within the next hour or two,"" said Mr Khosrowshahi. ""Ultimately we think that [it] can be even better than Amazon,"" he said. Critics have pointed out that ride-hailing and delivery services have already contributed to a rise in the number of car journeys being made, whether that's swapping a night bus for a cab ride, or getting a bubble tea delivered to your desk.  Mr Khosrowshahi said he understood that governments had broader things to consider around tariffs on electric vehicles, but saw Chinese-made vehicles as part of the solution.  ""For us we want to electrify our fleet and we want to make sure that it is affordable for our drivers,"" he said. Price is one of the biggest obstacles to the broader take-up of electric cars.  Concerns over electric charging infrastructure have also contributed to EV sales stalling in many parts of the world. Mr Khosrowshahi said he thought governments should be providing more support for the switch to electric, including in the UK, but he would like that support to be targeted at those who drive the most, such as Uber drivers, or for corporate fleets, rather than individuals. ""The Uber driver drives four to five times the miles of average drivers,"" he said.  Carmakers are calling for subsidies to be more balanced between business and individual buyers to encourage demand more broadly. The US and European Union (EU) argue the Chinese are unfairly subsiding their carmakers and have imposed tariffs - or import taxes - to bring prices of Chinese cars more into line with domestic manufacturers.  The UK has not imposed tariffs on Chinese-made cars. Using tariffs to make Chinese cars more expensive for European and American consumers was ""negative"" for the planet, Mr Khosrowshahi said.

""I thought it was a toy - and then it moved,"" Sofia Alonso-Mossinger said, adding it had been ""pretty scary"". With the help of her flatmates at the University of Bristol, the venomous invader was moved into a tub before being collected by an expert. China-based Shein said it had conducted an internal investigation and had confirmed that ""all standard operating processes have been adhered to"". The electrical and electronic engineering student said: ""I unzipped the outer packaging and saw something move and was like, what's this?"" After realising it was a scorpion, Ms Alonso-Mossinger, 18, rezipped the bag containing a pair of boots, got it out of her room and called her flatmates. ""I thought I was dreaming,"" she said. ""I feel like I am all right with spiders and things but it was scary being in my room with a random scorpion."" Phoebe Hunt, 18, said she heard screaming and rushed out to find her flatmate with ""a live scorpion in a bag on her boots"". She said they were ""not exactly buzzing to have a scorpion in the flat"". ""At first, I'll be honest, I said we should kill it and then everyone pointed out that wasn't the most humane thing so we scooped it up and put it in a Tupperware."" Oliver James, another flatmate who is studying zoology, transferred the scorpion into a plastic container with kitchen tongs. ""It was a bit nerve-wracking,"" he said, as no one knew how venomous it was. The flatmates then gave the scorpion water on kitchen towel, which it drank immediately, and some card to hide under before contacting animal groups. Phoebe said they had tried the RSPCA but realised it was more set up to collect cats and dogs, before getting in touch with the National Centre for Reptile Welfare (NCRW). The charity was able to send someone over within a couple of hours. NCRW's Chris Newman said reports of such stowaways were surprisingly frequent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx6d654556o,'No preaching' and other tactics as China woos African leaders,China is feting African leaders at a summit in Beijing aimed at strengthening ties.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:41.126349,China News,BBC,China,"With pomp and splendour, China has welcomed Africans leaders to Beijing this week for a summit to strengthen ties at a time of increasing political and economic turmoil around the world.  “It appeals to their vanities,” Macharia Munene, a Kenya-based professor of international relations tells the BBC, referring to the red carpet welcome - spiced up with entertainment by dancers in colourful costumes - that the leaders received.  The optics were carefully choreographed to make the leaders feel that it is a meeting of equals. Many of them - including South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and Kenya's William Ruto - held one-to-one meetings with their Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and were given tours of Beijing and other cities at the heart of China's development ahead of the summit. As Prof Munene puts it, China's aim is to show African leaders that ""we are in the same boat, we are all victims of Western imperialism"".  Paul Frimpong, executive director of the Ghana-based Africa-China Centre for Policy and Advisory, says that Western powers - as well as oil-rich Gulf states - are trying to match China's influence in Africa. “There is a keen interest and competition in and around what Africa’s potential is,” he tells the BBC. Cobus van Staden, co-founder of the China-Global South Project, writes that China goes out of its way to emphasise its own status as a developing country, signalling solidarity with Africa and the rest of the Global South. ""It avoids the dreariness of the US and EU’s ongoing aid focus with its attendant conditionality and preaching,” he adds.  Over the last two decades, China's diplomacy has paid off. Out of all the countries in the world, it has risen to become Africa's largest trading partner.  Data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows that a fifth of Africa’s exports go to China, the bulk of which includes metals, mineral products and fuel. The exports have quadrupled in US dollar terms since 2001.  For African countries, China is also the “single largest source of imports"" of manufactured goods and machinery, according to the IMF. But the balance of trade, in most cases, favours China massively. This is something Mr Ramaphosa sought to address in his bilateral meeting with President Xi. “We would like to narrow the trade deficit and address the structure of our trade,” South Africa's president said. A joint communique issued afterwards said that “China showed it was willing to uplift job creation, citing recruitment conferences for Chinese enterprises to promote local employment in South Africa"".   Kenya, on the other hand, is seeking more credit, despite a heavy debt burden that gobbles up nearly two thirds of its annual revenue and which recently triggered street protests after the government sought to introduce new taxes to fund the budget deficit. Mr Ruto hopes to secure funding for various infrastructure projects, including the completion of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to connect Kenya's coast to neighbouring Uganda, the building of roads and dams, the establishment of a pharmaceutical park and a technology-driven transport system for the capital, Nairobi. After connecting Nairobi to the port city of Mombasa, China discontinued its financing of the controversial SGR four years ago, leading to rail tracks ending in a field outside the lake city of Naivasha.  As a major bilateral lender to many African countries, China has often come under scrutiny for its deals, particularly in recent years when several African countries, including Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia, experienced debt distress. Debt sustainability is at the centre of discussions at every major forum on Chinese and African relations, and it is likely to be the case at the latest summit as well, Mr Frimpong says. The debt crisis is a reminder that foreign powers are motivated by their own interests - and African states need to improve their economies and finances in order to reduce their reliance on them. This is especially the case as the IMF predicts that China’s economic growth will continue to slow - and recommends that African countries adapt by deepening regional economic integration and implementing structural reforms to increase local revenue. Most of all, as Dr Van Staden points out, African leaders need to ""overcome the velvet rope aspect of these summits to make their own deals, set their own terms, and throw their own parties"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvnym0j0xo,African nations race to put satellites in space,Falling launch costs have given African nations a chance to send their own satellites into orbit.,7 hrs ago,2024-10-15 10:32:41.218359,China News,BBC,China,"One by one, the satellites – each of them encrusted with a hodge-podge of solar panels and other gizmos – detached from their mothership. They had blasted off from Earth just an hour earlier, on 16 August. The 116 satellites onboard the launch vehicle were mostly designed and built by Western nations and businesses – but one of them was different. It was the first such spacecraft ever developed by the African country of Senegal. A small CubeSat called GaindeSAT-1A, it will provide earth observation and telecommunications services. Senegal’s president called it a big step towards “technological sovereignty”. The cost of launching a satellite has fallen significantly in recent years, says Kwaku Sumah, founder and managing director at Spacehubs Africa, a space consultancy. “That reduction in cost has opened the market up,” he adds. “These smaller nations… now have the opportunity to get involved.” To date, a total of 17 African countries have put more than 60 satellites into orbit and, along with Senegal, both Djibouti and Zimbabwe have also watched their first satellites become operational during the past 12 months. Dozens more African satellites are expected to go into orbit in the coming years. And yet, the continent currently has no space launch facilities of its own. Plus, powerful countries elsewhere in the world are arguably using nascent African space programmes as a means of building relationships and asserting their geopolitical dominance more broadly. Can more African nations chart their own way into orbit – and beyond? “It’s important for African countries to have their own satellites,” says Mr Sumah. He argues that it means better control over the technology and easier access to satellite data. This information could help Africans monitor crops, detect threats posed by extreme weather such as floods, or improve telecommunications in remote areas, he adds. But boldly going to space is still seen as “something for the elite” in Africa, says Jessie Ndaba, co-founder and managing director at Astrofica Technologies, a space tech firm in South Africa that designs satellites. Business at her firm remains “very slow” overall, she adds. Given the massive threat posed to the continent by climate change, space tech should be used to monitor food and resources, she suggests. An African space race to reach the moon or Mars, in contrast, wouldn’t be helpful: “We’ve got to look at the challenges that we have in Africa and find ways of solving those.” For Sarah Kimani, of the Kenyan Meteorological Department, satellites have proved invaluable in helping her and her colleagues track dangerous weather conditions. She recalls using earth observation data provided by Eumetsat, a European satellite agency, to monitor a major dust storm in March. “We were able to tell the direction of this dust storm,” she says. Later this year, she and her colleagues will begin receiving data from the latest generation of Eumetsat spacecraft, which will provide wildfire and lightning monitoring tools among other benefits. “It will help us improve our early warning systems,” adds Ms Kimani, noting that the collaboration with Eumetsat has been “very efficient and effective”. Climate change brings meteorological threats that can emerge rapidly – from major storms to extreme drought. “The intensity of these hazards… is changing,” says Ms Kimani, noting that satellite data that could be updated as frequently as every five minutes, or less, would help meteorologists track such phenomena. She also argues that Kenya – which put its first operational earth observation satellite into orbit last year – would benefit from having more of its own meteorological spacecraft in the future. As would other African countries in general. “Only Africa understands her own needs,” says Ms Kimani. Currently, many African nations with young space programmes are dependent on foreign technology and experts, says Temidayo Oniosun, managing director of Space in Africa, a market research and consulting company. Some countries have sent students and engineers abroad to pick up space tech know-how. “The problem is, when these guys come back, there is no laboratory, no facility for them,” says Mr Oniosun. Senegal’s new satellite was built by Senegalese technicians. While not wanting to detract from their significant achievement, it is worth noting that development of the satellite was made possible through a partnership with a French university, and that the spacecraft was launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from California. Europe, China and the US have all involved themselves in numerous African space programmes. This has helped boost African technology into orbit, for sure, but it has also served as a “critical diplomatic tool”, says Mr Oniosun. It makes him “a little worried”, he admits. Observers have suggested that African space programmes are not just about getting African nations into space – they are also, to some extent, arenas where some of the world’s most powerful countries compete with one another. Mr Sumah is positive about the situation. “We can… play these different powers against each other to get the best deals,” he says. Officials in both the US and China have considered the “strategic” implications of involving themselves in African space endeavours, says Julie Klinger, at the University of Delaware. “That does bring with it an intensifying need for updating global treaties and strategies around maintaining a peaceful and manageable space environment,” she adds. But there are opportunities, too. Dr Klinger notes that space launches from equatorial regions – which may not require as much fuel – could mean that African space ports have an important role to play in the coming decades. The Luigi Broglio Space Center, an old Italian-built space port including a sea platform off the coast of Kenya, could be brought back into service one day, for example. The last launches there took place in the 1980s. Ultimately, we can expect to see rising activity in space from African nations. “We’ve got close to 80 satellites that are currently in development,” says Mr Oniosun, “I think the future of the industry is very bright.”"

Sir Ian Cheshire, who was also the former chairman of Barclays, said it would be better for the company to list in the UK as London-listed firms have to meet certain environmental quality controls. The alternative could be Shein listing on another exchange, which ""might just let them do what they want"", he told the BBC's Today programme. Sir Ian's comments come after Superdry boss Julian Dunkerton said Shein was being allowed to ""dodge tax"" and was a ""complete environmental disaster"". On Tuesday, Mr Dunkerton said the fast fashion giant had an unfair advantage because import duties are not charged on the low-value parcels it sends direct to customers from overseas. ""We’re allowing somebody to come in and be a tax avoider, essentially,"" the Superdry boss said. Shein, which was founded in China but has relocated to Singapore, has been laying the groundwork for a potential sale of shares on the stock market, prompting closer scrutiny of its practices. Its formula of offering a wide range of cheap clothes - backed up with campaigns on Instagram, TikTok and other social media - has turned it into one of the biggest fashion retailers in the world. The firm filed initial documents for a London listing earlier this year. This was after a potential New York listing came under fire from both Democrat and Republican politicians, who were concerned over the company's ""deep ties to the People’s Republic of China"". Shein has also been accused of using forced labour in parts of its supply chains, which it denies. It previously told the BBC it has a ""zero tolerance for forced labour"". Sir Ian told the BBC on Wednesday that Shein being listed in London could mean the UK could influence the firm. He said the London Stock Exchange had a ""good set of controls and quality requirements"", adding companies ""can’t just show up and be accepted with open arms"". ""I would always vote for companies coming to London to be on the responsible side of the [green] transition and moving in the right direction,” Sir Ian said, adding that another stock exchange ""might just let them do what they want"". Sir Ian said there were ""lots of difficult decisions and nuances"" when assessing companies for their environmental impact, such as oil and gas firms. In response to critics arguing that Shein had an unfair advantage on import charges, Sir Ian said that large numbers of UK clothing retailers bring in clothes from China, Bangladesh, and India, for example, and pay duties on large containers. Shipments worth less than £135 sent directly to UK shoppers do not currently face import duties, but firms bringing in larger consignments do. He said if there was a ""mismatch"" where small packages do not pay import duty, the government should look at it. He added the rules were set up like that ""because it was too difficult to track every parcel back in the day"", but ""now we've go the technology"". ""If you think that's a problem, then the government can fix it,"" he suggested. On Tuesday, Mr Dunkerton also said Shein was a ""complete environmental disaster"". ""Personally, I would force them into paying import duty, VAT and possibly even an environmental tax,” he told the BBC. Shein has previously said it complies fully with all its UK tax liabilities. The firm has been contacted for comment."

Giving his annual update on security threats faced by the UK, Ken McCallum said GRU agents had carried out ""arson, sabotage and more dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness"" in Britain after the UK backed Ukraine in its war with Russia. MI5 had also responded to 20 plots backed by Iran since 2022, he said, although he added the majority of its work still mostly involved Islamist extremism followed by extreme right-wing terrorism. The complex mix of terror-related threats and threats from nation states meant MI5 had ""one hell of a job on its hands"", he warned. In a wide-ranging speech, he said: There was a ""dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies"" MI5 had to deal with, he told the briefing at MI5's counter-terrorism operations centre in London. ""The first 20 years of my career here were crammed full of terrorist threats.  ""We now face those alongside state-backed assassination and sabotage plots, against the backdrop of a major European land war,"" he said.  The UK's ""leading role"" in supporting Ukraine means ""we loom large in the fevered imagination of Putin's regime"" and further acts of aggression on UK soil should be expected, he warned. The UK's current terror threat level is substantial - meaning an attack is likely. More than 750 Russian diplomats had been expelled from Europe since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ""the great majority of them"" spies, Mr McCallum said. This affected the Russian intelligence services' capability, he explained, and added that diplomatic visas had been denied to those who Britain and allies considered Russian spies. Russian state actors turned to proxies, such as private intelligence operatives and criminals, to do ""their dirty work"", but this affected the professionalism of their operations and made them easier to disrupt. While Mr McCallum has spoken publicly before about both the Russian and Iranian threats, he has not previously accused Moscow in such stark terms.  On Iran, he said the 20 Iran-backed plots MI5 had responded to presented ""potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents"". He said that since the 2022 killing of Mahsa Amini - the 22-year-old who died in Iranian police custody after being arrested for allegedly violating rules requiring women to wear the headscarf - ""we’ve seen plot after plot here in the UK, at an unprecedented pace and scale"". In a previous public address he referred to 10 plots against Iranians in the UK. That number has now doubled, implying that Iranian state activity is undeterred by the threat of being caught.  He added that, as the war in the Middle East continues, MI5 would give its ""fullest attention to the risk of an increase in – or a broadening of – Iranian state aggression in the UK"". In both cases, Russia and Iran, the MI5 boss stressed that because it was difficult - to almost impossible - for their accredited diplomats to carry out such actions, they were turning increasingly to underworld criminal gangs. In response, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said that Tehran rejects ""accusations"" put forward by Mr McCallum. Speaking about China, the head of MI5 said the economic relationship with the UK helped to underpin security. However, he later told reporters the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had a programme to steal data and information, and ""we have seen 20,000 obfuscated approaches to individuals by China"". The number of young people being drawn into online extremism is growing, Mr McCallum warned.  About 13% of those investigated for involvement in terrorism were under 18 - a threefold increase in the last three years. The security agency was seeing ""far too many cases where very young people are being drawn into poisonous online extremism"". ""Extreme right-wing terrorism in particular skews heavily towards young people, driven by propaganda that shows a canny understanding of online culture,"" he said. Responding to questions from reporters, he reiterated concerns about the role of the internet being the ""biggest factor"" driving the trend, and described how easily youngsters could access material from their bedrooms. A high proportion of the threat was made up by “lone individuals indoctrinated online"" he said. “In dark corners of the internet, talk is cheap. Sorting the real plotters from armchair extremists is an exacting task,” he said. “Anonymous online connections are often inconsequential, but a minority lead to deadly, real world actions.” Home Office figures published last month show that of 242 people detained on suspicion of terror offences in the year to June, 17% (40) were aged 17 and under.  Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the ""sober findings"" outlined by Mr McCallum but said the public should be ""reassured that our security services are world class and will do everything necessary to keep us safe""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r84p0dp1jo,Blast kills two Chinese near Pakistan's Karachi airport,"A third body, not yet officially identified, is thought to be that of the attacker, the BBC understands.",8 days ago,2024-10-15 10:32:52.366144,China News,BBC,China,"Two Chinese nationals have been killed and at least 10 people injured in a suspected suicide attack near Karachi airport in Pakistan. A third body, not yet officially identified, is thought to be that of the attacker, the BBC understands. The Chinese embassy in Pakistan said the explosion on Sunday night was a ""terrorist attack"" targeting a convoy of Chinese engineers working on a power project in Sindh province. The separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has in recent years carried out attacks on Chinese nationals involved in development projects in Pakistan, has said it carried out the attack. In a statement released on Monday, the militant group said it had ""targeted a high-level convoy of Chinese engineers and investors"" arriving from Karachi airport.  A later statement from the group described it as a suicide attack, and named the perpetrator as Shah Fahad, part of a BLA suicide squad called Majeed Brigade. The attack was carried out using a ""vehicle-borne improvised explosive device"", Reuters news agency quoted the BLA as saying. The explosion happened around 23:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Sunday. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called the attack a ""heinous act"" and offered his condolences to the Chinese people. ""Pakistan stands committed to safeguarding our Chinese friends,"" he wrote on X. The country's foreign ministry said it is ""in close contact"" with Chinese authorities and will ""bring to justice those responsible for this cowardly attack"".  ""This act of terrorism is an attack not only on Pakistan, but also on the enduring friendship between Pakistan and China,"" the ministry said.  ""This barbaric act will not go unpunished,"" it added. The Chinese embassy said that the engineers were part of the Chinese-funded enterprise Port Qasim Power Generation Co Ltd, which aims to build two coal power plants at Port Qasim, near Karachi.   Thousands of Chinese workers are in Pakistan, many of them involved in creating an economic corridor between the two countries as part of Beijing’s multibillion dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The Port Qasim plant is part of the corridor, along with a number of infrastructure and energy projects in Pakistan's Balochistan province, which has a rich supply of natural resources, including gas and minerals. The BLA along with other ethnic Baloch groups has fought a long-running insurgency for a separate homeland. It has regularly targeted Chinese nationals in the region, claiming ethnic Baloch residents were not receiving their share of wealth from foreign investment the province and natural resources extracted there.  The Chinese embassy on Monday reminded its citizens and Chinese enterprises in Pakistan to be vigilant and to ""do their best to take safety precautions"". The embassy added that it hoped Pakistan would thoroughly investigate the attack and ""severely punish the murderer"".  The blast was reportedly heard in various areas around the city, with footage from local media showing thick smoke and cars set alight. Pictures online show security officials and firefighters investigating the explosion site, with several vehicles charred by the blast. A police surgeon, Dr Summaiya told Dawn news: ""Ten injured persons, including one in critical condition, have been brought the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [JPMC]."" She added the injured included a police constable and a woman. A statement posted on X from Sindh's Interior Minister's office said that a ""tanker truck"" had exploded on Airport Road. Roads leading to Jinnah International Airport were sealed off following the attack, but the airport is functioning as usual on Monday. There has also been heightened security in Pakistan as it prepares to host the leaders' summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). There have been multiple attacks on Chinese nationals in Pakistan in recent years. The BLA has claimed responsibility for several of them, including an attack in March on a Pakistani naval airbase near Gwadar port, another main feature of the China-Pakistan economic corridor. In April 2022, the group killed three Chinese tutors and a Pakistani driver in a suicide bombing near Karachi University's Confucius Institute.  In November 2018, gunmen killed at least four people in an attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi.   Additional reporting by Zahra Fatima, BBC News"

The move, which could lead to tariffs on a key Canadian export, came a week after Canada said it would impose new border taxes on Chinese-made electric vehicles, steel and aluminium. Beijing also said it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the EV tariffs, which it criticised as ""discriminatory"" and ""unilateral"". Canada's minister of agriculture said plans for the canola investigation were ""deeply concerning"" and the government was closely monitoring the situation. The latest tit-for-tat comes as a rising number of governments, including the US and European Union, erect barriers against Chinese-made electric cars. In announcing the EV tariffs last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said countries such as China had ""chosen to give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace"". Western countries allege that Chinese firms are benefiting from subsidies and other government help, allowing for ""dumping"", which is when product is sold below cost, making it difficult for other firms to compete. China cited similar dumping complaints in its probe of Canadian canola oil, noting that imports had jumped 170% since 2023, while prices had ""continuously fallen"". ""China's position is clear-cut. The country will take all measures necessary to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in announcing the measures. China has also launched investigations of European pork and dairy products. It recently declined to impose tariffs on French cognac, despite alleged dumping.  Canola, also known as rapeseed, is a major agricultural product in Canada, accounting for roughly one-quarter of all farm crop receipts, according to the Canola Council, an industry group. Canada exports more than 90% of its canola, which is sold as raw seed, oil, or meal and is used for cooking, animal feed and some forms of energy, according to the council.  China's imports of Canadian canola were worth roughly $C5bn ($3.7bn;£2.8bn) last year, making the country the second biggest market after the US. It has been the target in previous trade disputes.  Beijing blocked exports from two major Canadian grain companies for three years  citing pest concerns, following the 2018 arrest in Vancouver of Chinese businesswoman Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the tech firm Huawei.  Canada's agriculture minister, Lawrence MacAulay, said Canadian farmers ""depend on, and play by, a rules-based global trading order that provides reliable market access"".  Calling Beijing's announcement ""deeply concerning"", he said Ottawa is monitoring developments closely.  ""We will continue to defend and support the sector every step of the way,” he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wn827dedyo,A Himalayan river may be making Everest taller,"River erosion at its base is helping push Mount Everest upwards, a new study says.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:52.587907,China News,BBC,China,"Mount Everest is 15-50m taller than it would otherwise be because a river is eroding rock and soil at its base, helping push it upwards, according to a new study. Loss of landmass in the Arun river basin 75km (47 miles) away is causing the world’s highest peak to rise by up to 2mm a year, University College London (UCL) researchers said. “It’s a bit like throwing a load of cargo off a ship,” study co-author Adam Smith told the BBC. “The ship becomes lighter and so floats a little higher. Similarly, when the crust becomes lighter… it can float a little higher.” Pressure from the collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates 40-50 million years ago formed the Himalayas and plate tectonics remains the major reason for their continued rise. But the Arun river network is a contributing factor to the mountains’ rise, the UCL team said. As the Arun flows through the Himalayas it carves away material – the river bed in this case - from the Earth's crust. This reduces the force on the mantle (the next layer under the crust), causing the thinned crust to flex and float upward. It’s an effect called the isostatic rebound. The research, published in Nature Geoscience, adds that this upward pushing force is causing Everest and other neighbouring summits, including the world’s fourth and fifth highest peaks, Lhotse and Makalu, to move upward. “Mount Everest and its neighbouring peaks are growing because the isostatic rebound is raising them up faster than erosion is wearing them down,” fellow co-author of the study Dr Matthew Fox told the BBC. “We can see them growing by about two millimetres a year using GPS instruments and now we have a better understanding of what’s driving it.” Some geologists not involved in the study said the theory was plausible but there was much in the research that was still uncertain. Everest stands on the border between China and Nepal, and its northern part is on the Chinese side. The Arun river flows down from Tibet into Nepal and then merges with two other rivers to become the Kosi which then enters northern India to meet the Ganges. It is a very high silt-yielding river given the steepness of the mountains it flows through and the force it has, allowing it to carve off so much rock and soil on its way. But the UCL researchers say it most likely earned its real strength when it “captured” another river or water body in Tibet 89,000 years ago, which in geological timescales is a recent event. A Chinese academic, Dr Xu Han of China University of Geosciences, was the lead author in the study during a scholarship visit at the UCL. “The changing height of Mount Everest really highlights the dynamic nature of the Earth’s surface,” he said. “The interaction between the erosion of the Arun river and the upward pressure of the Earth’s mantle gives Mount Everest a boost, pushing it up higher than it would otherwise be.” The UCL study says the Arun river most likely gained the capacity to carve off an extraordinary amount of rocks and other materials after it captured another river or water system in Tibet.  Professor Hugh Sinclair with the School of Geosciences at University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, said the underlying process identified by the UCL team was perfectly reasonable. But, he added, the exact amounts and timescales of river incision (or how the river cuts downward into its bed and deepens its channel) and the consequent surface uplift of surrounding peaks had large uncertainties. “Firstly, predicting river incision of such large catchments in response to drainage capture (one river capturing another river or lake) is challenging,” he said. This uncertainty is something the authors have acknowledged in the study. Secondly, said Prof Sinclair, the distance over which mountains uplift from a point of intensive localised erosion is extremely hard to predict. “However, even accounting for these reservations, the possibility that some of Everest’s exceptional elevation is linked to the river, represents an exciting insight.”"

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3zv787d5o,'Right time to buy into Britain' and university expenses,"The papers lead on a variety of stories, including a business summit in the UK on Monday.",1 day ago,2024-10-15 10:32:52.864902,China News,BBC,China,"The Times features more details of the letter written by some of the world's top businesses before today's investment summit, who say Britain now has a real opportunity to grow its economy. They argue that our universities, legal expertise and financial services have provided what they call the 'bedrock of a strong investment proposition'. The 14 signatories include five of the world's richest banks, private equity firms, leading insurers and tech giants. They say Britain's greater stability has increased its attractiveness to investment, which the paper says is a reference to Labour's election victory at a time of uncertainty in many large economies.  The Daily Telegraph, though, highlights a warning from business leaders that any government raid on National Insurance contributions could damage investment in the UK. It suggests they were worried by a strong hint from the Business Secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, that the Budget could include plans to increase employers' NI contributions. The paper says City figures such as the chief executive of Lloyds Bank - Britain's biggest lender - said NI would be one of the worst taxes to increase because it would in effect put a handbrake on investment by making it more expensive to hire staff. The Telegraph also reports that Israel has accused the United Nations of turning a blind eye to Hezbollah in Lebanon — because Israeli troops discovered one of the organisation's tunnels just 100 yards from a peacekeeping base. An Israeli general tells the paper that construction of the tunnels needs a lot of equipment which would be very difficult to hide from peacekeepers. The UN has defended its peacekeeping mission. Meanwhile China — says the Financial Times — is under increasing pressure to deliver more measures to stimulate its economy. Analysts says lower than expected consumer and factory prices last month have worried investors. They are said to be disappointed that there have been no more clearer details about a stimulus package first announced at the end of last month. It is thought official figures to be released this week will paint a picture of a two-speed economy in China, with strong trade figures, but still overall lower-than-expected third quarter GDP. According to the Daily Mirror, all six state premiers in Australia have turned down a chance to meet the King during his tour there. They had been invited to meet him at a reception in Canberra next Monday. Buckingham Palace has not commented. The pro-royal Australian Monarchists League told the paper the 'snubs' were a slap in the face for the Royal Family. The Daily Mail says the prime minister is now facing calls for an independent inquiry into the decision to give Taylor Swift a ""Very Very Important Person"" police escort during her recent tour in the UK. The taxpayer-funded protection is normally reserved for senior cabinet members or the royal family. The paper says senior Conservatives are furious the Attorney General, Lord Hermer, is reported to have intervened. His spokesman said the decision had been one for the Metropolitan Police. And the Guardian reports that a number of medical schools across Europe, including in the UK, are to start integrating climate-related health issues into their curricula.

Tata was one of India's most internationally recognised business leaders. The Tata Group is one of India's largest companies, with annual revenues in excess of $100bn (£76.5bn). In a statement announcing Tata's death, the current chairman of Tata Sons described him as a ""truly uncommon leader"". Natarajan Chandrasekaran added: ""On behalf of the entire Tata family, I extend our deepest condolences to his loved ones. ""His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles he so passionately championed."" During his tenure as chairman of the Tata Group, the conglomerate made several high-profile acquisitions, including the takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, UK-based car brands Jaguar and Land Rover, and Tetley, the world's second-largest tea company.  UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said in tribute that Tata was a ""titan of the business world"" who ""played a huge role in shaping British industry"". A profile published in the Economist magazine in 2011 called Tata a ""titan"", crediting him with transforming the family group into ""a global powerhouse"". ""He owns less than 1% of the group that bears his family name. But he is a titan nonetheless: the most powerful businessman in India and one of the most influential in the world,"" the magazine said. In 2012, he retired as chairman of the group and was appointed chairman emeritus of Tata Sons, the group's holding company. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Tata as a ""visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being"". Paying tribute on X, formerly known as Twitter, Modi recounted ""countless interactions"" with Tata and said he was ""extremely pained"" by his death. Tata - whose body is lying at a cultural centre in Mumbai to allow people to pay their respects - is to receive a state funeral later on Thursday. Tata was born in a traditional Parsi family in 1937. He studied architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University in the US. In 1962, he joined Tata Industries - the promoter company of the group - as an assistant and spent six months training at a company plant in Jamshedpur. From there, he went on to work at the Tata Iron and Steel Company (now Tata Steel), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and National Radio and Electronics (Nelco). In 1991, JRD Tata, who had led the group for over half a century, appointed Ratan Tata as his successor. ""He [JRD Tata] was my greatest mentor... he was like a father and a brother to me - and not enough has been said about that,"" Tata later told an interviewer. In 2008, the Indian government awarded him the Padma Vibhushan, the country's second-highest civilian honour. Peter Casey, author of The Story of Tata, described Tata as a ""modest, reserved and even shy man"" who had a ""stately calm"" about him and a ""fierce discipline"". He was drawn into a rare unsavoury controversy in 2016, when his successor as Tata Sons chairman, Cyrus Mistry, was ousted from the role, sparking a bitter management feud. Mistry died in a car crash in 2022. The business tycoon also had a lighter side to him. His love for fast cars and planes was well-known - the Tata group website describes these as some of his ""enduring passions"". Tata was also a scuba diving enthusiast, a hobby that fizzled with age ""as his ears could take the pressure no more"". He was also a dog lover and fondly remembered the many pets who gave him company over the decades. ""My love for dogs as pets is ever strong and will continue for as long as I live,"" the industrialist said in a 2021 interview. ""There is an indescribable sadness every time one of my pets passes away and I resolve I cannot go through another parting of that nature. And yet, two-three years down the road, my home becomes too empty and too quiet for me to live without them, so there is another dog that gets my affection and attention, just like the last one,"" he said. He was also often praised for his simplicity. In 2022, a video of him travelling in a Nano car - one of the world's cheapest cars, now mostly remembered as one of Tata's failed dreams - went viral on social media."

He said he had received intelligence showing Moscow was using satellites provided by other countries to gather information about Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure.  ""Radiation does not respect state borders and many nations could feel a devastating effect,” he warned the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.  Russia has repeatedly targeted energy facilities across Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022.  ""Any critical incident in the energy system could lead to a nuclear disaster - a day like that must never come,"" Zelensky said. ""Moscow needs to understand this, and this depends in part on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor. ""These are nuclear power plants. They must be safe."" The UN nuclear watchdog warned last month that safety at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Russian-occupied Ukraine was deteriorating.  It followed a strike near the site's perimeter, close to essential water sprinkler ponds and about 100m from the only remaining high-voltage line.  The plant was seized by Russian forces early in the war and has come under repeated attacks, which both sides have blamed the other for. Zelensky said in his speech on Wednesday that Russia had destroyed all of Ukraine’s thermal power plants and a large part of its hydroelectric capacity as a way to “torment” Ukrainians ahead of winter. ""Energy must stop being used as a weapon,"" he said. A major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes in April, and millions of Ukrainians have suffered blackouts this year alone. While in the United States, Zelensky says he plans to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.  An official on Donald Trump's campaign said the Republican nominee would not meet the Ukrainian leader - despite statements from officials in Kyiv last week saying Zelensky was planning to see the former president. Trump described Zelensky as the ""greatest salesman on Earth"" following his speech and claimed the US would be ""stuck in that war"" unless he was elected in November. Also in his UN speech, Zelensky criticised China and Brazil for pushing for talks with Russia, questioning their motivations. He made a renewed appeal for countries to back his proposals for a full and just peace, reiterating his position that Russian forces needed to withdraw from Ukraine's internationally-recognised borders to bring an end to the war.  Ukraine would not accept a return to a ""brutal, colonial past"", he added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8095xjg4po,Genetic ghosts suggest Covid’s market origins,"A team of scientists say it is ""beyond reasonable doubt"" the Covid pandemic started with infected animals.",19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:32:59.966805,China News,BBC,China,"A team of scientists say it is “beyond reasonable doubt” the Covid pandemic started with infected animals sold at a market, rather than a laboratory leak. They were analysing hundreds of samples collected from Wuhan, China, in January 2020. The results identify a shortlist of animals – including racoon dogs, civets and bamboo rats – as potential sources of the pandemic. Despite even highlighting one market stall as a hotspot of both animals and coronavirus, the study cannot provide definitive proof. The samples were collected by Chinese officials in the early stages of Covid and are one of the most scientifically valuable sources of information on the origins of the pandemic. An early link with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was established when patients appeared in hospitals in Wuhan with a mystery pneumonia. The market was closed and teams swabbed locations including stalls, the inside of animal cages and equipment used to strip fur and feathers from slaughtered animals. Their analysis was published last year and the raw data made available to other scientists. Now a team in the US and France says they have performed even more advanced genetic analyses to peer deeper into Covid’s early days.  It involved analysing millions of short fragments of genetic code – both DNA and RNA – to establish what animals and viruses were in the market in January 2020. ""We are seeing the DNA and RNA ghosts of these animals in the environmental samples, and some are in stalls where [the Covid virus] was found too,"" says Prof Florence Débarre, of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. The results, published in the journal Cell, highlight a series of findings that come together to make their case. It shows Covid virus and susceptible animals were detected in the same location, with some individual swabs collecting both animal and coronavirus genetic code. This is not evenly distributed across the market and points to very specific hotspots. ""We find a very consistent story in terms of this pointing - even at the level of a single stall - to the market as being the very likely origin of this particular pandemic,"" says Prof Kristian Andersen, from the Scripps Institute in the US. However, being in the same place at the same time is not proof any animals were infected. The animal which came up most frequently in the samples was the common raccoon dog. This has been shown to both catch and transmit Covid in experiments. Other animals identified as a potential source of the pandemic were the masked palm civet, which was also associated with the Sars outbreak in 2003, as well as hoary bamboo rats and Malayan porcupines. The experiments have not been done to see if they can spread the virus. The depth of the genetic analysis was able to identify the specific types of raccoon dogs being sold. They were those more commonly found in the wild in South China rather than those farmed for their fur. This gives scientists clues about where to look next.  The research teams also analysed the genetic code of the viral samples found in the market, and compared them to samples from patients in the early days of the pandemic. Looking at the variety of different mutations in the viral samples also provides clues. The samples suggest, but do not prove, that Covid started more than once in the market with potentially two spillover events from animals to humans. The researchers say this supports the idea of the market as the origin, rather than the pandemic starting elsewhere with the market adding fuel to the fire in a superspreading event. The scientists also used the mutations to build the virus’s family tree and peer into its past. “If we estimate when do we believe most likely the pandemic started versus when do we believe most likely the outbreak at the market started, these two overlap, they’re one and the same,” says Prof Andersen. In their scientific publication, the full genetic diversity of coronavirus seen in the early days of the pandemic was found at the market. Prof Michael Worobey, of the University of Arizona, said: ""Rather than being one small branch on this big bushy evolutionary tree, the market sequences are across all the branches of the tree, in a way that is consistent with the genetic diversity actually beginning at the market."" He said this study, combined with other data – such as early cases and hospitalisations being linked to the market – all pointed to an animal origin of Covid. Prof Worobey said: “It's far beyond reasonable doubt that that this is how it happened”, and that other explanations for the data required ""really quite fanciful absurd scenarios"". “I think there's been a lack of appreciation even up until now about how strong the evidence is.” The lab-leak theory argues that instead of the virus spilling over from wildlife, it instead came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which has long studied coronaviruses. It is located a 40-minute drive away from the market. The US intelligence community was asked to weigh up the likelihood of a leak – either accidental or deliberate. In June 2023, all the agencies involved said either a leak or animal origins were plausible scenarios. The National Intelligence Council and four other agencies said animals were the likely source. The FBI and the Department of Energy thought it was more likely to be a laboratory incident. Prof Andersen said: ""To many this seems like the most likely scenario - 'the lab is right there, of course it was the lab, are you stupid?'. I totally get that argument."" However, he says there is now plenty of data that ""really points to the market as the true early epicentre"" and ""even locations within that market"". Identifying the animals that could have been the source of the pandemic does provide clues to where scientists could look for further evidence of an animal origin. However, because farms destroyed their animals in the early days of Covid it means there may no longer be any evidence left to find. ""In all likelihood, we missed our chance,"" says Prof Worobey. Prof Alice Hughes, from the University of Hong Kong, who was not involved in the analysis, said it was a “good study”. “[But] without swabs from the actual animals in the market, which were not collected, we cannot obtain any higher certainty."" Prof James Wood, the co-director of Cambridge Infectious Diseases, said the study provided “very strong evidence” of the pandemic starting in wildlife stalls at the market. However, he said it could not be definitive because the samples were collected after the market closed, and the pandemic probably started weeks earlier. And he warned ""little or nothing"" was being done to limit the live trade in wildlife, and ""uncontrolled transmission of animal infections poses a major risk of future pandemics""."

The Philippines has claimed a Chinese ship ""directly and intentionally rammed"" into its vessel, while Beijing has accused the Philippines of ""deliberately"" crashing into a Chinese ship. Saturday's collision near the Sabina Shoal is the latest in a long-running - and escalating - row between the two countries over various islands and zones in the South China Sea.  Within the past two weeks, there have been at least three other incidents in the same area involving ships belonging to the two countries.  The Sabina Shoal, claimed by China as Xianbin Jiao and as Escoda Shoal by the Philippines, is located some 75 nautical miles from the Philippines' west coast and 630 nautical miles from China. The South China Sea is a major shipping route through which $3 trillion worth of trade passes through a year. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.  Following the latest clash, China's coast guard called on the Philippines to withdraw from the Sabina Shoal while pledging to ""resolutely thwart all acts of provocation, nuisance and infringement"". The Philippines coast guard said it would not move its vessel - the Teresa Magbanua - ""despite the harassment, the bullying activities and escalatory action of the Chinese coast guard"". There were no casualties following the crash but Philippines Coast Guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said that the 97-meter (318-feet) Teresa Magbanua had sustained some damage after being hit ""several times"" by the Chinese ship. The US ambassador to the Phillipines, MaryKay L Carlson, criticised what she called China's dangerous actions in the region.  ""The US condemns the multiple dangerous violations of international law by the [People's Republic of China], including today's intentional ramming of the BRP Teresa Magbanua while it was conducting lawful operations within the[Philippines] EEZ."" she wrote in a post to X. ""We stand with the Philippines in upholding international law.""  China has repeatedly blamed the Philippines and its ally the US for the escalating tensions. Last week, a defence ministry spokesperson said Washington was ""emboldening"" Manila to make ""reckless provocations"". Observers worry the dispute could eventually spark a larger confrontation in the South China Sea. A previous attempt by the Philippines to get an independent arbitral tribunal to rule on the matter ended with the decision that China had no lawful claims within its so-called nine dash line, the boundary it uses to claim a large swathe of the South China Sea. Beijing refused to participate in the proceedings, and has also refused to recognise the ruling. But in recent weeks both countries have made an attempt to de-escalate the immediate conflicts out at sea. Last month they agreed to allow the Philippines to restock the outpost in the Second Thomas Shoal with food, supplies and personnel. Since then this has taken place with no reported clashes. Correction 13 September 2024: This article originally reported that the Philippines attempted to get the UN to arbitrate – it has been updated to reflect that an independent tribunal, in which China refused to participate, ruled on the South China Sea dispute."

Wada said last month's ruling by an independent tribunal to find the Italian world number one had no fault or negligence was ""not correct under the applicable rules"". It has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) and said Sinner should be banned for ""between one and two years"". The 23-year-old said: ""Obviously I'm very disappointed and also surprised of this appeal because we had three hearings. All three hearings came out very positively for me. ""I knew it a couple of days ago, that they were going to appeal, that today it's going to go official."" Sinner was on court against Roman Safiullin in the last 16 of the China Open in Beijing when Wada's appeal was announced. He beat the Russian 3-6 6-2 6-3 to progress to the quarter-finals. Jannik Sinner has won the Australian and US Open this year Sinner was cleared of any wrongdoing after twice testing positive for low levels of a metabolite of clostebol - a steroid that can be used to build muscle mass - during the Indian Wells tournament in March. The case was presented to a tribunal by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA). The ITIA said its process was run according to Wada guidelines but respected its right to appeal. Will cloud hang over Sinner's US Open victory? Djokovic wants 'clear protocols' over doping cases Sinner parts with physio & fitness coach after investigation Sinner was provisionally suspended but challenged the decision and was able to continue playing. Sinner's defence said he was inadvertently contaminated by the banned substance by his physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi. The ITIA accepted Sinner's explanation that Naldi had applied an over-the-counter spray - widely available in Italy - which contained clostebol to treat a cut on his own hand. The tribunal ruled that Sinner was not to blame, but stripped him of his ranking points and prize money for reaching the Indian Wells semi-finals. He has since stopped working with Naldi. Sinner won the US Open in New York this month, 19 days after he was cleared. Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent Wadaâs statement suggests it is not questioning Sinnerâs explanation, but does believe he shares some of the blame. The Court of Arbitration for Sport will now need to decide whether the world number one should be held in any way responsible for a sequence of events which began with his physio using a spray to treat a cut on his finger. The spray, which contained clostebol, had been passed on by Sinnerâs fitness coach, who had been brought into the team partly because of his anti-doping expertise. Gloveless massages - with hands which may or may not have been washed - and lesions on Sinnerâs skin resulted in the two positive tests, the tribunal determined. While Sinner is free to play on, the case could take many months to resolve. The International Tennis Integrity Agency appealed to Cas in January against the decision to exonerate Tara Moore of doping, and the hearing is still to be scheduled. Whether Sinner's case is fast-tracked because of its high profile nature remains to be seen. Get tennis news sent straight to your phone Live scores, results and order of play"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20mz0l36gjo,"Russia planning to target nuclear plants, Zelensky says","Ukraine's president warns the UN about the possibility of ""nuclear disaster"".",25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:00.290723,China News,BBC,China,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has told the United Nations that Russia is planning deeper attacks on his country's nuclear power plants, warning of possible ""nuclear disaster"".  He said he had received intelligence showing Moscow was using satellites provided by other countries to gather information about Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure.  ""Radiation does not respect state borders and many nations could feel a devastating effect,” he warned the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.  Russia has repeatedly targeted energy facilities across Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022.  ""Any critical incident in the energy system could lead to a nuclear disaster - a day like that must never come,"" Zelensky said. ""Moscow needs to understand this, and this depends in part on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor. ""These are nuclear power plants. They must be safe."" The UN nuclear watchdog warned last month that safety at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Russian-occupied Ukraine was deteriorating.  It followed a strike near the site's perimeter, close to essential water sprinkler ponds and about 100m from the only remaining high-voltage line.  The plant was seized by Russian forces early in the war and has come under repeated attacks, which both sides have blamed the other for.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20myx1erl6o,Would Donald Trump’s taxes on trade hurt US consumers?,What could happen if Donald Trump drastically increases tariffs as he has promised to do?,6 hrs ago,2024-10-15 10:33:00.389983,China News,BBC,China,"Donald Trump has pledged to drastically increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US if he is elected president again. He has promised tariffs - a form of tax - of up to 20% on goods from other countries and 60% on all imports from China. He has even talked about a 200% tax on some imported cars.  Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.   He has claimed on the campaign trail that these taxes are ""not going to be a cost to you, it’s a cost to another country"". This is almost universally regarded by economists as misleading. In practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import. So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 (£38,000) subject to a 10% tariff, would face a $5,000 charge. The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.  So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government. Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3,100bn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP. And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues. The question of where the final “economic” burden of tariffs falls, as opposed to the upfront bill, is more complicated. If the US importing firm passes on the cost of the tariff to the person buying the product in the US in the form of higher retail prices, it would be the US consumer that bears the economic burden. If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn’t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed. Alternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers. In that scenario, the exporting firm would bear the economic burden of the tariff in the form of lower profits. All three scenarios are theoretically possible. But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers. A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that ""imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases"". Only 2% disagreed. Let’s use a concrete example. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018. Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products. There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall. The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump’s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth. A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year. The left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family. Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation. Yet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs. “Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,"" he said on the campaign trail. The political context for Trump’s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001. In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million. Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor. And researchers who studied the impact of Trump’s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers. By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018. It is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact. And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been. Trump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year. “Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly,” he has said. In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs. Part of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump’s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally. Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed. For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018. The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs. There are some economists who support Trump’s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession. Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits. And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump’s proposed extension of tariffs, has kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018. It has also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.

Croatia's Cilic, who started the tournament at 777th in the world, has spent the majority of the past two seasons out with a knee injury which required multiple surgeries. Given a wildcard to play in Hangzhou, the former world number three had not won an ATP Tour match in 22 months before this week. On Tuesday, just four days before his 36th birthday, he beat home favourite Zhang Zhizhen 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-5) to lift the title. ""It has been a difficult period for me - I lost my ranking and I didn't play too much,"" said Cilic, who reached a career-high ranking of third in 2018. Cilic had the latest surgery on his right knee in May, saying it was the ""best option"" to help overcome the problem and return to court. He played just two matches in 2023 and another four times at the start of this season. The comeback began on the Challenger Tour - the tier below the main ATP events - in August before stepping up a level again over the past week in China. Cilic hit 18 aces and won 42 of 50 first-service points (84%) against 43rd-ranked Zhang. In his post-match speech, the 2014 US Open champion dedicated the victory to his family - including his wife and two children - for their support during the low moments. ""Everybody at home has been with me in this difficult period, working day by day, believing and pushing me, giving me strength and spirit,"" Cilic said. ""I'm happy to make this victory, not just for me, but for them. For everyone there is a small piece of this trophy."" On the back of winning a 21st title of his career, Cilic will rise 404 places in the rankings to 373 next week. Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone"

The Chinese woman had complained on social media that she was harassed by the couple seated behind her on a Cathay flight after reclining her seat.  The Hong Kong flag carrier said on Sunday that it had added the couple to its no-fly list, saying it has ""a strict zero-tolerance policy"" towards behaviours that disrespect fellow passengers. The Chinese woman's post on social media platform Xiaohongshu, which captured part of the confrontation, had garnered 194,000 likes as of Monday morning and drawn mixed reactions online. The incident took place on a flight from Hong Kong to London on 17 September. In her post, the Chinese woman recalled how the middle-aged couple - a husband and wife - had accused her of obstructing their view of the in-flight television and asked her to straighten her seat.  When she refused, the wife stretched her legs and put them on the armrests of her seat, then started scolding her in Cantonese and slapping her arm, the woman said. ""When she realised I couldn't speak Cantonese, she started calling me 'mainland girl' in a derogatory tone,"" she said. The husband, who was seated directly behind her, ""frantically pushed"" the back of her seat, the woman said. Her video showed the seat vibrating.  Another scene showed the wife raising her middle finger at the woman. The woman then sought help from a flight attendant, who suggested that she straighten her seat.  ""I was shocked because it was not meal time, yet the flight attendant wanted me to compromise,"" the woman said. ""I rejected the suggestion.""  Several passengers who witnessed the incident criticised the Hong Kong couple's behaviour.  ""Don't call yourself a Hong Konger, you bully,"" one passenger said. Another said, ""This is too much. How old are you? Why are you bullying a young girl?"" The woman's post on Xiaohongshu sparked similar outrage. ""If they want more space, they should have paid for first-class seats,"" one person wrote. Several commenters were quick to defend Hong Kong's reputation, with one saying ""Most people in Hong Kong are kind, this couple is an exception.""  It has also triggered a debate on whether reclining one's aeroplane seat is an acceptable practice. Several users said that it should be acceptable, given that the ability to recline is a built-in function of the seats.  Others said it can get uncomfortable when passengers in front recline their seats too far back."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m099zm4wyo,"One in three children short-sighted, study suggests","There was a notable rise after Covid when children spent less time outdoors, researchers say.",25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:00.702281,China News,BBC,China,"Children's eyesight is steadily getting worse with one in three now short-sighted or unable to see things in the distance clearly, a global analysis suggests. The researchers say Covid lockdowns had a negative impact on eyesight as children spent more time on screens and less time outdoors. Short-sightedness, or myopia, is a growing global health concern which is set to affect millions more children by 2050, the study warns. The highest rates are in Asia - 85% of children in Japan and 73% in South Korea are short-sighted with more than 40% affected in China and Russia. Paraguay and Uganda, at about 1%, had some of the lowest levels of myopia, with the UK, Ireland and the US all about 15%. The study, published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, looked at research involving more than five million children and teenagers from 50 countries across all six continents. Their number-crunching revealed that short-sightedness tripled between 1990 and 2023 - rising to 36%. And the increase was ""particularly notable"" after the Covid pandemic, the researchers say. Myopia usually starts during primary school years and tends to worsen until the eye has stopped growing, at about 20 years of age. There are factors that make it much more likely - living in East Asia is one of those. It is also down to genetics - the traits children inherit from their parents - but there are other factors too, such as the particularly young age (two years old) that children start their education in places like Singapore and Hong Kong. This means they are spending more time focusing on books and screens with their eyes during their early years, which strains the eye muscles and can lead to myopia, research suggests. In Africa, where schooling starts at the age of six to eight years old, myopia is seven times less common than in Asia. During Covid lockdowns worldwide, when millions had to stay indoors for lengthy periods, children and teenagers' eyesight took a hit. ""Emerging evidence suggests a potential association between the pandemic and accelerated vision deterioration among young adults,"" the researchers write. By 2050, the condition could affect more than half of teens worldwide, the research predicts. Girls and young women are likely to have higher rates than boys and young men because they tend to spend less time doing outdoor activities at school and at home as they grow up, the study suggests. Girls' growth and development, including puberty, starts earlier which means they tend to experience short-sightedness at an earlier age too. Although Asia is expected to have the highest levels compared with all other continents by 2050, with nearly 69% short-sighted, developing countries may also reach 40%, the researchers say. Children should spend at least two hours outside every day, particularly between the age of seven and nine, to reduce their chances of being short-sighted, say UK eye experts. It is not clear if it is the presence of natural sunlight, the exercise taken outdoors or the fact that children's eyes are focusing on objects that are further away that makes the difference. ""There is something about being outside that is a real benefit to children,"" says Daniel Hardiman-McCartney, clinical adviser from the UK College of Optometrists. He also recommends that parents take their children for an eye test when they are seven to 10 years old, even if their vision was checked at a younger age. Parent should also take note - myopia runs in families. If you are short-sighted then your children are three times more likely than others to be short-sighted too. Myopia cannot be cured but it can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Special lenses can slow down the development of myopia in young children by encouraging the eye to grow differently, but they are expensive. In Asia, where these special lenses are very popular, glass classrooms which mimic learning outdoors are also being used. The concern is that high rates of myopia could lead to large numbers of unusual eye conditions in older age."

This will be the first visit by a high ranking Indian minister to Pakistan in nearly a decade. The trip comes after Mr Jaishankar's Pakistani counterpart attended a similar meeting of foreign ministers from the SCO in India last year - he was the first senior Pakistani politician to visit since 2011.  Relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours have been tense for years and they have fought three wars since they became independent nations in 1947 - two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir. The SCO is a political union of countries formed to discuss security and economic matters in Central Asia. The organisation was created by China, Russia and four Central Asian countries in 2001 as a countermeasure to limit the influence of Western alliances such as Nato.  India and Pakistan joined the group in 2017. While India chaired the SCO in 2023, Pakistan will be hosting this year's summit from 15 October to 16 October.  At a press briefing on Friday, India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal confirmed that Mr Jaishankar will lead the Indian delegation to Pakistan.  The last time an Indian foreign minister visited the nation was in 2015, when Sushma Swaraj attended a security conference in Islamabad and held rare talks with Pakistani officials.  Days later, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a surprise trip to Lahore where he met then Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.  Ties between India and Pakistan have always been strained but they hit a new low in 2019, when India launched strikes in Pakistani territory, following a militant attack on Indian troops in Indian-administered Kashmir.  Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it. Separatist insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir has led to thousands of deaths over three decades. India accuses Pakistan of supporting insurgents but its neighbour denies this. A thaw of relations seemed in sight last year when Pakistan's Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited the Indian state of Goa for a SCO meeting.  But Mr Zardari said his visit was ""focussed exclusively on the SCO"" and did not hold any direct talks with Mr Jaishankar during his trip.  In an interview with the BBC at that time, he said that the onus was on India to restart peace talks between the two countries."

The jail term is the first handed down by the city's court under a new local national security law that was passed in March. The law, also called Article 23, expands on the national security law that was imposed by Beijing in 2020. Critics feared the law could further erode civil liberties in the city, while Beijing and Hong Kong defended it, saying it was necessary for stability. Chu Kai-pong, 27, was arrested at a subway station in June wearing a T-shirt sporting the phrase ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"". He was also wearing a mask that read ""FDNOL"" - initials for another slogan, ""Five demands, not one less"". Both slogans were frequently heard in large-scale protests in Hong Kong during the months-long anti-government demonstrations in 2019. Local media reported he was also carrying a box containing his excrement to use against people opposing his views. Chu was arrested on 12 June, the anniversary of a key date of the 2019 protests when particularly large crowds took to the city's streets. The court heard Chu told police he wore the T-shirt to remind people of the protests, according to Reuters. He was previously jailed for three months in a separate incident for wearing a T-shirt with the same slogan, as well as possession of other offensive items. Chu has been remanded in custody since 14 June. On Monday, he pleaded guilty to one count of doing an act with a seditious intention"". In his judgement read out on Thursday, chief magistrate Victor So, who was handpicked by the government to hear national security cases, said Chu intended to ""reignite the ideas behind"" the 2019 protests. He said Chu ""showed no remorse"" after his previous conviction, and that the sentence reflected the ""seriousness"" of the sedition charge. The conviction and sentencing have been criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International's China director Sarah Brooks described it as ""a blatant attack on the right to freedom of expression"", and called for the repealing of Article 23 in a statement.  The sentencing comes after a landmark ruling of another case last month, when two journalists who led the pro-democracy newspaper Stand News were found guilty of sedition. That marked the first sedition case against the city's journalists since Hong Kong's handover from Britain to China in 1997."

The Finals have undergone numerous changes since the World Group was disbanded at the end of 2018. The latest alteration will ensure teams play fewer ties on neutral venues, and also reduce the workload on the players. International Tennis Federation president David Haggerty said: ""Moving the Davis Cup September stage from six-day group stage events to two-day home or away ties will ease playersâ schedules immediately following the US Open, while maintaining the intensity of the competition that they all love."" Instead of four groups of four playing out next September, there will be seven home or away ties, with the winners, plus the hosts, contesting Novemberâs Finals. The menâs ATP Tour, which was given a voice in the decision-making process by the ITF two years ago, will be pleased at the shorter duration. Many players have also advocated the return of more frequent home and away ties to avoid two teams having to play at a neutral venue.  In September, the United States, Chile, Germany and Slovakia had to travel to China to contest the group stage. The USA had five men in the top 20 at the time and none of them made the trip. Change is also coming to the Billie Jean King Cup Finals from 2025. The Finals, which are currently contested by 12 teams, will revert to an eight-team event to mirror the existing Davis Cup format. To enable the transition, next Aprilâs qualifying ties will be played in a group format, with 21 teams split into seven groups. The seven group winners will join the hosts in the Finals. A bidding process to host next yearâs Finals is under way.  This year - for the first time - the Finals of both competitions will be held at the same venue in Malaga. The Billie Jean King Cup Finals, which include Great Britain, start on 13 November, with the Davis Cup Finals getting under way six days later.

David Lin, 68, was given a life sentence in 2006 on charges that the US says were bogus, after he was convicted of fraud for helping an underground church launch a meeting centre in Beijing. His release took place just weeks after US national security adviser Jake Sullivan met China's foreign minister in the Chinese capital. His daughter, Alice, told Politico: ""No words can express the joy we have - we have a lot of time to make up for."" She added the US State Department contacted her on Saturday to confirm Chinese authorities had released her father from prison and that he would be flying into San Antonio, Texas, on Sunday. ""We welcome David Lin's release from prison in the People's Republic of China,"" a State Department spokesperson said. ""He has returned to the United States and now gets to see his family for the first time in nearly 20 years."" The timing of Jake Sullivan's meeting with foreign minister Wang Yi  indicates he may have had a hand in the negotiations that lead to Mr Lin's release. ""I know that Jake Sullivan did raise my dad’s case,"" his daughter told Politico.  While incarcerated, Mr Lin missed his daughter's wedding and the birth of his grandson. His release comes days ahead of a congressional hearing focused on US citizens detained in China, of whom there are estimated to be 200.  Two other Americans, Mark Swidan and Kai Li, are considered to be unjustly imprisoned by the State Department. Swidan is currently on death row for alleged drug trafficking. All are said to be experiencing health issues.  China does not recognise dual nationality, meaning people who hold both an American and Chinese passport are regarded as Chinese citizens by Beijing."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c153d14vqwyo,TD Bank fined $3bn in historic money laundering settlement,TD Bank has pleaded guilty to US criminal charges. Prosecutors say one client laundered more than $470m in drug proceeds at the bank.,4 days ago,2024-10-15 10:33:07.826408,China News,BBC,China,"TD Bank, one of Canada's biggest lenders, has agreed to pay more than $3bn (£2.3bn) and pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the US after allowing drug cartels and other criminals to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit funds.  Prosecutors said the bank operated with inadequate guards against money laundering for nearly a decade, failing to act even when staff flagged obvious cases of abuse, such as a customer making daily deposits of $1m in cash.  The lender is now facing restrictions on its growth in the US - as well as the biggest fine ever under anti-monetary laundering law.  The chief executive of TD Bank said the bank was taking ""full responsibility"" for its failures. Bharat Masrani said the bank had the financial strength to weather the situation and would be making ""the investments, changes and enhancements required to deliver on our commitments"".  The bank said it would be a multi-year process, but it had already taken some steps to overhaul its anti-money laundering programme, adding more than 700 new staff specialised in the issue.  ""This is a difficult chapter in our bank's history. These failures took place on my watch as CEO and I apologise to all our stakeholders,"" he said on Thursday.  Mr Masrani announced last month he would retire in April 2025 after a decade at the bank's helm.  TD Bank is the largest lender in US history to plead guilty to failures under the Bank Secrecy Act and the first to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, the US justice department said.  The growth restriction its US retail business faces under its agreement with regulators is unusual - reserved for severe cases of wrongdoing, such as the fake account fraud uncovered at Wells Fargo several years ago.  Attorney General Merrick Garland said the bank was cooperating with the investigation and further individual prosecutions were expected.  “By making its services convenient for criminals, TD Bank became one,” he said.  At a press conference announcing the charges, US officials said the bank - the 10th largest in the US - had ""starved"" its compliance programmes of investment, even as it grew.  By 2018, it failed to monitor more than 90% of the transactions on its network, activity worth more than $18tn, prosecutors said at a press conference. The gaps in compliance were so well-known internally that staff joked that the bank's motto - ""America's most convenient bank"" - was marketed toward criminals, they said.  Officials said one customer used TD Bank to launder more than $470m in drug proceeds, making large cash deposits and bribing staff with gift cards.  The scheme allowed payments from fentanyl users to flow back to drug networks in Mexico and China, officials said.  Officials said another scheme involved participation of five bank staff, who helped to issue dozens of ATM cards, facilitating the transfer of $39m in illicit funds to Colombia.   TD is the sixth largest bank in North America by assets and serves over 27.5 million customers around the world. The settlement announced on Thursday will include a period of outside monitoring.  The penalties includes $1.8bn to the justice department and $1.3bn to the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, as well as payments to other regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve.  Shares plunged more than 5% on the news. "

Researchers at the University of Liverpool and Maynooth University published its findings in the journal Obesity, which included more than 8,000 youngsters. They found age 11 ""may be a sensitive period in which psychological wellbeing is associated with future body weight"". Data from 4,556 11-year-olds and 3,791 14-year-olds considered overweight or obese was analysed, with the group being followed up once aged 17. Psychological wellbeing was ranked using questions answered by children and their caregivers on issues such as self-esteem, happiness with life, depressive symptoms, social support, satisfaction with appearance and online bullying. The study found better mental health and psychosocial wellbeing at age 11, but not at age 14, was associated with the reversal of being overweight or obese by 17. Among those classed as overweight or obese at age 11 or 14, about 16% - 12% of 11-year-olds and 4% of 14-year-olds - were considered a normal weight at 17. Dr I Gusti Ngurah Edi Putra, from the Institute of Population Health at the University of Liverpool, said: ""While further work needs to be done to understand why early adolescence is a critical point, we know this is a time in a child's life when they may be experiencing change - moving up into high school for example."" She said integrating psychological support into current obesity prevention and treatment could be helpful.  Professor Eric Robinson, also from the institute, said being overweight or obese was ""difficult to live with psychologically"". ""As a society we need to be doing a much better job of supporting people with obesity if we are to ever make serious progress in reducing obesity,"" he added.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220407-how-tall-will-mount-everest-get-before-it-stops-growing,How tall can Mount Everest grow?,"Arching over 8,849 metres (29,032ft) into the sky, Everest is the world’s tallest mountain. But will it always be?",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:08.038305,China News,BBC,China,"Arching over 8,849 metres (29,032ft) into the sky, Everest is the world’s tallest mountain. But will it always be? Aurora Elmore was approaching Mount Everest's South Base Camp in Nepal. But rather than taking the traditional 12-day hiking route, she was soaring between the frozen peaks, the rotor blades of her helicopter slicing through the thin air with a whap, whap, whap. It was April 2019, and she was delivering supplies to a team of scientists working on the slopes of the world's tallest mountain. Her reward was a spectacular view: the day was crystal clear, exposing the entire Himalayan range. Over the next two months, researchers on the National Geographic and Rolex expedition she helped to organise would study the effects of climate change on this part of the Himalayas. Elmore, a geologist and at the time senior programme manager of the National Geographic Society in the US, supported the team installing the world's highest weather station on the flanks of Mount Everest. During the course of their expedition, her colleagues discovered the world's highest evidence of microplastic pollution in snow and stream water close to the summit.  Gliding closer to Everest's iconic peak, Elmore got a bird's-eye view of them. A miniature city of green and yellow tents, each sheltering mountaineers headed for the top, had formed at Everest Base Camp more than 5km (3 miles) above sea level. Thousands flock to Everest every spring to make an attempt to reach the roof of the world. And while few of the climbers would have noticed, Everest grew a tiny bit bigger during their time on the mountain. Mount Everest, along with the rest of the Himilayas, inches further skyward every year. It raises an interesting question – with enough time, just how tall can Mount Everest grow? There are mountains on other planets in our Solar System that dwarf those on our own, so are there limits to how big a mountain can get on Earth? Mount Everest towers 8,848.86m (29,032ft) above sea level, according to the most recent official joint survey by China and Nepal, whose borders run across its summit. But it isn't the only giant in these lands – 10 of the world's 14 peaks higher than 8,000m (26,247ft) above sea level can be found in the Himalayan range. Everest, Elmore says, is among friends. ""If you've ever flown over Greenland or the Canadian Rockies you can see big mountains, but [the Himalayas] are just on another level,"" she says. Surrounded by so many other enormous peaks, is it possible to discern just what a monster Everest is? Elmore hesitates before answering. ""It's kind of like trying to tell the tallest person on a basketball team,"" she says finally. ""They're all tall, but which one is the teeny [bit taller]?"" You might also like: The history of measuring the tallest mountain in the world stretches back to 1852. In Europe, Charles Dickens was publishing serialised instalments of his novel Bleak House. North America had started testing its first steam-powered fire engine. In Asia, the height of Mount Everest was a mystery. It was known only as ""Peak XV"". Radhanath Sikdar, an Indian mathematician, had been employed by the British to work on their Great Trigonometrical Survey. They wanted to gather a more accurate geographical picture of the territory they were occupying so they could control it more effectively, be it for trade or military purposes. Sikdar used trigonometry. He measured the horizontal and vertical angles of Everest's summit from other mountaintops whose positions and heights were already known. In doing so he made a momentous discovery: the tallest mountain ever recorded. According to his calculations, the mountain stood at 8,839.8m (29,002ft) tall. Though the technology behind measuring mountains has advanced since the 1850s, his figure was astonishingly accurate, just nine metres off the latest official height. Despite Sikdar's findings, the mountain eventually was named after his previous boss, British surveyor Sir George Everest, who had retired several years before Sikdar's discovery. Since then, teams have continued to work to understand Mount Everest's height. In 1954 an Indian survey determined Mount Everest to be 8,848m (29,029ft) tall, a figure which was accepted by the Nepalese government. But then, in 2005, the Chinese measured it at 8,844.43m (29,017ft) – nearly four metres (13ft) lower. In 2020, teams from China and Nepal jointly agreed upon a new officially accepted height that was 0.86m (2.8ft) higher than the Survey of India's original calculation.  While these changes in the measured height are partly due to improvements in the measuring technology available to surveyors, there has also been some politics involved. China and Nepal historically have argued over whether the snow cap on the summit should be included in the measurement or not. But we mustn't ignore that Everest also grows a tiny little bit taller every year too. Once, the craggy limestone peaks that skim the sky of Everest were on the ocean floor. Scientists believe it all began to change about 200 million years ago – at around the time the Jurassic dinosaurs were beginning to emerge – when the supercontinent of Pangea cracked into pieces. The Indian continent eventually broke free, journeying north across the vast swathe of Tethys Ocean for 150 million years until it smacked into a fellow continent – the one we now know as Asia – around 45 million years ago. The crushing force of one continent hitting another caused the plate beneath the Tethys Ocean, made of oceanic crust, to slide under the Eurasian plate. This created what is known as a subduction zone. Then the oceanic plate slipped deeper and deeper into the Earth’s mantle, scraping off folds limestone as it did so, until the Indian and Eurasian plates started compressing together. India began sliding under Asia, but because it's made of tougher stuff than the oceanic plate it didn't just descend. The surface started to buckle, pushing the crust and crumples of limestone upwards. And so the Himalayan mountain range began to rise skyward. By around 15-17 million years ago, the summit of Everest had reached about 5,000m (16,404ft) and it continued to grow. The collision between the two continental plates is still happening today. India continues to creep north by 5cm (2in) a year, causing Everest to grow by about 4mm (0.16in) per year (although other parts of the Himalayas are rising at around 10mm per year [0.4in]). But understanding how and why Everest's height changes is more complex than just this. While plate tectonics push the summit higher into the sky, erosion claws away at it. To understand this process better, scientists studied another mountain some 8,700km (5,405 miles) away from Mount Everest, in Alaska. Rachel Headley, an associate professor of geosciences at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, was part of a scientific expedition to Mount Saint Elias on the border of Alaska and Canada between 2005-2008. The mission intended to understand the complex roles of tectonics and erosion in how mountains grow and shrink. The second largest mountain in both Canada and the US, Saint Elias faces the same effects as Everest, from tectonic activity to erosion, but across a far smaller, more manageable area. ""In that region, Alaska, there were very particular weather patterns that had helped these large glaciers grow,"" Headley says. ""And then both glaciers and rivers, landslides, and avalanches were all kind of the processes that connected to tear them down."" Headley's role on the team was to understand the thickness of the Seward Glacier, which runs through the Saint Elias mountains, and how fast it was moving. Both can impact the rate of erosion, which can affect how quickly a mountain's height is worn away. ""If we have a thinner glacier, and it's moving super fast… we know there has to be some sliding, which we think is really important for erosion,"" she says. ""Sliding"" can cause glacial abrasion, which is when the glacier drags rock fragments across the surface as it moves, creating a sandpapering effect. Weather can also cause significant erosion to a mountain. Elmore describes one of the weather stations she helped install during the 2019 Mount Everest expedition as being ""damaged by rocks the size of cricket balls that were picked up by the wind and thrown at it"". Buffetting by debris and ice picked up by the wind takes its toll after a while. Many of the highest peaks in the world, including Everest, have permanent snow caps that help protect them from this wind-blown barrage. Rock covered in a soft blanket of snow suffers less weathering and erosion than bare rock, says Headley. It also protects the rock from chemical reactions with the air that can gradually degrade the minerals in the limestone that comprises much of the uppermost parts of Mount Everest. But there are still places where the rock is exposed to the elements. ""For a tall mountain range, you can basically get to such a steep angle in the rock that it can't actually support ice, and snow, and then you start to get avalanches, and you get bare rock,"" says Elmore. Rock falls and land slides – a constant hazard on Everest and the surrounding area – both play a role in shaving away at Everest's height, and rivers too. They have been estimated to be cutting gorges into the rock at a rate of between 4-8mm (0.2-0.3in) a year. River uplift Everest's uplift of around 2mm (0.08in) per year is higher than would be expected due to regional tectonics alone. The reason could be due to the nearby Arun River ""capturing"" another river – some 89,000 years ago, according to a paper in Nature Geoscience published September 2024, which used computer models to assess possible changes in the river networks. The changes led to increased erosion from the Arun River, the researchers say, creating a gorge. The reduction in weight on the Earth’s crust in turn triggered the surrounding landscape, including Mount Everest, to rebound upwards. But the exact impact erosion has on a mountain's height is still to be understood. A 2024 paper which used computer models to assess possible changes in the river network around Everest thousands of years ago found that erosion due to changes in river networks could actually have contributed to a speeding up of the growth. Some scientists believe that reducing the weight of a mountain (by taking away the snow, ice and rock it's made of) might actually allow the tectonic plates to push the, now lighter, mountain even further into the sky.  Headley's colleague Terry Pavlis, who was the lead investigator on the St Elias Erosion Tectonics Project (Steep), explains that, on a large scale, ""erosion attacking a landscape allows it to rise up"". In some parts of the world, entire landmasses are still rearing up after the last ice age – something known as isostatic rebound. Parts of North America and northern Europe, including Scotland, are rebounding after the rocky crust there was squashed by enormous continental ice sheets that waxed and waned during the Pleistocene. According to one study by researchers at Germany's University of Postdam, up to 90% of the uplift in the European Alps can be explained by this surprisingly elastic response to the end of the ice age. Experts believe similar glacial isostatic rebound may have taken place on the Tibetan Plateau and in the Himalaya as the ice age glaciers receeded – contributing between 1-4mm (0.04-0.16in) a year to the uplift. ""But there's some kind of equilibrium between how fast that landscape can erode and how high those peaks can get,"" adds Pavlis. The exact details of this equilibrium are still being explored. In a region like the Appalachians in north-eastern North America, or the Scottish Highlands, erosive forces like rivers and landslides are cutting mountains down lower and lower, Headley says. ""But in regions with tectonic activity, the tectonic force can be driving the mountains up slower, faster, or at around the same rate as the erosion is cutting it down. We don't fully understand all the drivers in those types of systems."" So how are mountains actually measured nowadays? One of the most common instruments used is the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which records the precise position of the mountain peak using a network of satellites. GNSS can ""measure heights to the millimetre,"" according to Pavlis. The challenge, for a mountain like Everest, has always been the weight of the equipment. ""It's hard enough to get to the peak – try adding a 30lb (13kg) instrument,"" he says. A helicopter taxi to the top with the heavy luggage is out of the question – the thin air around Everest's summit means the engine can't produce enough power and there's too much drag from the rotor blades to operate safely. The strong winds and jagged creeks also make touching down anywhere near the summit dangerous. One helicopter pilot did set a world record by touching down briefly on top of Mount Everest in 2005, but only after the manufacturer stripped it bare of every unessential item to make it feather light. Luckily, GNSS systems have gotten smaller over the years. Now they weigh more like 1.2kg (2.6lbs) and are ""about the size of a lunchbox, maybe a little smaller"", says Pavlis. But the devices still need batteries, which can struggle in cold temperatures. The average temperature at the summit of Everest during the summer monsoon months is a balmy -19C. And there are other complications too. ""There's an antenna that's about, you know, half a metre in diameter. And those have to be set up somehow so that they are absolutely stationary,"" Pavlis explains.  To gather millimetre-accurate results the instrument then has to record for several hours. In the thin air of Everest's ""death zone"", operating these instruments can be hazardous for surveyors. Members of a Nepalese expedition to take GNSS measurements on Everest in 2019 spent two hours on the summit – far longer than most who make their way there – after arriving at 03:00 in the pitch black and biting cold. Another option, often used in addition to GNSS for the most accurate readings, is Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). ""GPR uses radar pulses to image below the surface, so it can tell us the thickness and internal structure of snow and ice overlying the rocks on Everest's summit,"" says Elmore. ""There's something like 4m (13ft) of snow and ice on the top of Mount Everest, but that can change depending on the climate."" While Elmore and her team were conducting their own scientific experiments on Everest they leant the Nepalese expedition a GPR device so they could take measurements from the summit. ""It had to be a specific design of GPR, one that was super lightweight so [it could be carried] to the top of Everest, but that also had the right transmitter and receiver to measure the ice,"" says Elmore. The device had recently been used at the summit of Denali, the tallest mountain in the US, so they knew it was up to the job. Despite the many hurdles they faced, the Nepalese team's expedition to measure the height of Everest was successful. They had hoped to answer questions about whether a deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal in April 2015 had affected Mount Everest's height. Initial reports indicated the mountain had shifted 3cm (1.9in) to the south-west by the large earthquake, which killed 9,000 people and damaged hundreds of thousands of homes, but had not changed its height. The project, however, soon became muddied with international politics. A few months later a team of Chinese surveyors conducted their own measurements during an expedition from the other side of the mountain. They had their own figure, which didn't include the snow cap. The Nepalese figure, on the other hand, did. In October 2019, the two countries decided to combine their data and in December 2020 they released the figure for the new official height – 8,848.86m (29,032ft), including the snow on top. As China and Nepal found, deciding exactly what you measure, and how you measure, is fundamental to establishing a mountain's height. For example, to agree upon how tall a mountain is, we must first agree on where the bottom is. But that's not as easy as it might sound. For centuries mountains have been measured using sea level as the base from where their height is calculated. But the Earth is not perfectly round: it bulges along the equator. And sea level isn't static, it is pulled and changed by our planet's gravity. Plus, Everest isn't sticking out of the ocean, it's nestled among a landscape of other mountains. Many complex calculations have to be done to establish where sea level would actually be, and Everest's relative height to it. When that starting point is changed, everything changes. But let's say scientists started their measurements from the core of the planet instead. Everest would no longer be considered the tallest mountain on Earth. The mountain that measures the greatest distance from the centre of Earth to its peak is Mount Chimborazo, in Equador at 10,920m (35,826ft). What about starting from the seabed? The accolade of tallest mountain would then go to Mauna Kea, a volcano in Hawaii that arches 10,000m (32,808ft) from the ocean floor. Looking beyond our own planet, we can see examples of just how enormous mountains can become. Olympus Mons, a volcano on Mars, towers 21km (19.2 miles) into the sky and stretches 624km (388 miles) wide. It is roughly the size of the state of Arizona. Because gravity on Mars is weaker than on Earth, and because Mars doesn't have tectonic plates shifting and colliding beneath the surface, the ooze of lava that flowed out of the Martian volcano in the planet's past was able to grow to monstrous proportions. Could Everest become a similar giant? In the 1980s, a researcher at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, UK, attempted to estimate what such a limit might be on Earth, taking into account the strength of gravity and the strength of the rock underlying the mountain. The calculations, which made ""no presensions to serious geophysics"" estimated the theoretical maximum height of a mountain range with a granite base – as Mount Everest largely has – to be 45km (28 miles) on Earth.  But there are a number of barriers – apart from our planet's relentless weather – that might stand in the way of this, according to Headley. For starters, ""you would eventually run out of your tectonic forces, and then it would stop growing"", she says. Scientists believe that eventually the Earth's mantle will cool to such a degree that the planet-wide dance of plate tectonics will end. Until then, earthquakes and landslides will also erode away the mountain too. ""At some point, [the mountain] becomes so steep that it's unstable and chunks start falling off,"" Elmore says. With the wind, snow and ice buffeting, cracking and splitting the rock, Everest is unlikely to ever reach the sizes seen on Mars. ""We have our weather systems, and weather is really good at creating erosional forces,"" Headley says. ""Basically, the fact that we have water, whether in the form of ice or snow, or just rain, is what really can limit mountain growth."" For now, Everest keeps edging, bit by bit, into the sky as other forces try to tear it down. Elmore's 2019 team discovered global warming was yet another of these, driving considerable thinning of the snow and ice on the upper reaches of the mountain in recent decades and revealing more bare rock to the erosive impacts of weather. Everest is also far from being the fastest-growing mountain on our planet. The closest contender for the top spot is perhaps Nanga Parbat, a neighbour to Everest located in the Pakistani Himalayan range, which is 8,126m (26,660ft) tall and growing at 7mm (0.27in) per year. In 241,000 years it could overtake Everest to be the tallest mountain on Earth, provided rates of erosion don't change. Others, such as those in the Swiss Alps, are also growing rapidly thanks to an imbalance in the amount of erosion taking place. Scientists found that uplift is more than 50 times faster than any negative effects from erosion here. But the Swiss Alps are far shorter than Mount Everest and most studies suggest the mountains there are currently growing at 2-2.5mm (0.08-0.1 inches) per year.  Meanwhile, Everest retains its allure as a mountain at the extreme of what can be found and endured here on Earth. Its reputation as the highest peak on our planet continues to attract climbers from all over the world, even as its height continues to shift. Over a video call I ask Billi Bierling, a mountaineering journalist who hiked Everest herself in 2009, whether an extra millimetre, metre or mile higher matters to people like her. She is relaxing on the sofa at her mother's house in Germany, preparing to head back to Nepal for the summer season in March. ""The exact measurement doesn't matter,"" she says, laughing warmly at my question. ""What matters is that it's the highest, and that you go to the highest point. If you're having a bad day, or someone is not very nice to you, or they put you down, you can think to yourself, you know what? I've climbed Everest."" For most who reach the summit, it is simply being there that counts. -- *This story was first published on 14/4/2022 and updated on 2/20/2024 to include a new study which found changes to the river networks around Everest could be contributing to its uplift. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

The Financial Times describes it as ""Historic accord"", but the Daily Mail says critics have called the deal ""shameful"", summarising with the headline ""Starmer's surrender"".  The Times reports that Sir Keir Starmer received private warnings from the United States about the deal and there were concerns among officials that it could benefit China, an ally of Mauritius, a claim denied by government insiders. In its editorial, the Daily Telegraph has described the move as a ""national scandal"", labelling it a ""giveaway"". The Mirror disagrees, saying ministers have ""finally put right one of the last remaining wrongs from British colonial rule"". In its coverage, the Guardian focuses on the reaction of Chagossians.  The paper says not everyone is happy sovereignty has been passed to Mauritius but it quotes one campaigner who says the deal is a ""recognition of the injustice done against those who were forced to leave their homes"". The I says UK scientists are working on a vaccine to ""wipe out ovarian cancer within five years"". The jab, which is being created by researchers at Oxford University, works by teaching the immune system to recognise and attack the earliest stages of the cancer. The paper says there are hopes it could be given to women preventively on the NHS, ""with the aim of eliminating the disease"".  The Mirror also covers the story, with the headline ""scientists aim for world first"". Boris Johnson has told the Telegraph he believes Britain needs a referendum on its membership of the European Convention on Human Rights. The former prime minister says there's a ""strong case"" to give the public a say on the matter. He also suggests the ECHR doesn't ""provide people with protections they wouldn’t otherwise have”. Many of the papers have picked up on Prince William saying he didn't attend this summer's Olympics in Paris because he didn't want to risk bringing Covid home to his wife during her cancer treatment. ""Wills Olympic virus fear"" says the Sun, while ""Prince missed Paris to keep Kate safe"" is the Times' take. He made the comments yesterday while meeting some of Britain's Olympic and Paralympic swimmers. He said after hearing of athletes catching Covid his family had watched ""the whole thing"" at home rather than attend any events in person. The Times celebrates ""dogged rescuers"" who came together to help save Rose the Jack Russell who was trapped on a ""cliff for a week"". The dog had fallen through a gap in a rocky outcrop near Halifax in West Yorkshire. The paper says the community stepped up after two failed rescue attempts by the fire service.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c981glp4v1lo,What time is the VP debate? Everything to know for Vance v Walz,Tuesday night's head-to-head will be their first and only showdown in the 2024 presidential election cycle.,1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:15.416725,China News,BBC,China,"The two US vice-presidential candidates are set to face each other on the debate stage, just over a month before the White House election.  Ohio Republican Senator JD Vance will square off against Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz in New York City on on Tuesday night. This debate comes three weeks after a single presidential clash between Donald Trump, who picked Vance as his running mate, and Kamala Harris, who picked Walz.  Here's everything you need to know. The 90-minute clash will be held on Tuesday 1 October at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST) at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.  It will be aired on CBS network TV and livestreamed on platforms where CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+ are accessible. The forum will be moderated by CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell and by Margaret Brennan, who hosts the network's current affairs show Face the Nation.  There will be two breaks, each lasting four minutes.  The BBC will have a team of reporters in New York and in Washington providing analysis, fact checks and reactions as part of our live coverage. The BBC will show the debate live to UK and international audiences on the BBC News Channel, BBC One, iPlayer, BBC News Website and app, along with FAST/CTV platforms in the US.  The vice-presidential debate rules mirror those of the face-off between Trump and Harris last month, with one small difference: microphones will be hot.  While CBS says it reserves the right to mute the candidates' microphones, they will remain on even when it isn't a candidate's designated turn to talk.  The two will be standing, unlike the last three vice-presidential debates in previous US election cycles, when candidates were seated.  Walz will stand behind the podium on stage left - the right side on the screen. Vance will stand opposite him.  Campaign aides will not be allowed to speak to the pair during breaks. Neither will the running mates be permitted to bring pre-written notes on stage.  The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions from moderators. The other candidate will be allowed two minutes to respond. Each candidate will have one minute for rebuttals.  CBS says it will be up to Vance and Walz to fact-check each other’s statements, though “the moderators will facilitate those opportunities” during rebuttal time. There will be no live studio audience or opening statements.  Candidates will receive two minutes for closing statements. Vance won a coin toss and chose to have the final word. Walz has been preparing with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in as Vance.  He has been holding late-night and weekend sessions and studying videos of his rival. Vance is preparing with Republican congressman Tom Emmer, who represents Walz's home state of Minnesota.  He is also holding sessions with his lawyer wife, Usha Vance, and senior Trump adviser Jason Miller. It's likely Vance will target Walz - a former public school teacher and football coach - for what Republicans say was his heavy-handed Covid policies in Minnesota, including setting up a hotline to report on those breaching social distancing rules.  Vance may also criticise Walz for signing legislation last year that allows tampon dispensers to be installed in boys' toilets at public schools.  He may also accuse Walz of misrepresenting his military record. In August, the Minnesota governor acknowledged he ""misspoke"" when he said in 2018 that he had handled assault weapons ""in war"" while advocating for stricter gun laws. Walz resigned from the National Guard before his unit was deployed to Iraq. The Minnesota governor is likely to attack Vance for some of his past comments, including calling some Democratic politicians a ""bunch of childless cat ladies with miserable lives"".  Walz may also go after the Ohio senator for repeatedly defending baseless stories about migrants eating household pets in an Ohio town.  He may also seek to embarrass Vance over his leaked messages from 2020 in which he said Trump had ""thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70w909znl6o,"Time stood still, Trump says at site of assassination attempt",Donald Trump invited tech billionaire Elon Musk to the stage to join him attacking his Democratic opponent.,6 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:15.515916,China News,BBC,China,"Nearly three months after an assassin’s bullet came close to taking his life, former President Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania - a place of ""tragedy and heartache"" - to promise his supporters victory in the 5 November presidential election. One person - a volunteer fire chief - was killed in the 13 July shooting, which also left two bystanders seriously wounded and Trump shot in the ear. “For 15 seconds, time stood still,” Trump told the crowd. “This vicious monster unleashed evil… the villain did not succeed in his goal.” For Saturday's rally, though, security was tight - a result of increased scrutiny of the Secret Service in the wake of two attempts on Trump’s life - the second last month at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Also in attendance were Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, as well as son Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who endorsed Trump after the earlier shooting. Trump largely stuck to familiar talking points during his speech, railing against the “corrupt system”, promising to bring “respect” back to US foreign policy and vowing to shut the “open border”, which he claims is a source of crime. “You deserve a government that protects and respects its own citizens, and defends your sovereignty, your security, your dignity and your freedom,” he told the thousands gathered at the showgrounds in Butler to large applause. He also struck out at his political opponents, accusing them of “slandering” him and attempting to interfere in the election, and “who knows - maybe even tried to kill me.” “But I’ve never stopped fighting for you,” he added. “Never will.” Trump repeatedly referenced the previous shooting, and the event included a moment of silence for Corey Competore, the volunteer firefighter who was killed in the July shooting. “He’s become somewhat of a folk hero,” Trump added. “Our beautiful Corey.”  The former president had fulsome praise for Elon Musk and went out of his way to invite him to the stage. The tech billionaire told the crowd he thought this was ""the most important election of our lifetime"" and exhorted voters to register and elect Trump. Between 25,000 and 30,000 people were expected at the rally, which snarled traffic to a standstill in the rural town north of Pittsburgh for the entirety of Saturday. Many waited for as many as 10 hours in harsh sun to be let in past a long string of vendors selling Trump-Vance campaign flags, hats, signs and orange wigs meant to emulate the former president. “I certainly admire his willingness to come back here and give the speech he was denied last time,” said Teresa Wilson, a former US Marine who also attended the previous rally on 13 July. “I’d understand if he avoided coming back - I know some spectators who didn’t want to return, and some who were very apprehensive,” she added. “If he can stand in the place of the previous attempt, then we as his constituency can certainly show up to offer our support.” With just 31 days to go until Americans vote, polls show Trump and Kamala Harris in a tight race in Pennsylvania -  a hotly contested battleground state that could prove pivotal. Data from the New York Times and Siena College, for example, shows the two nearly deadlocked in a tie, 49% to 48% in Harris’s favour. In dozens of interviews with Trump supporters at the rally, most identified the economy - particularly inflation - as their primary concern ahead of the election. “We’re not being taken care of. People can’t afford food. They can barely afford gas [petrol],” said Jessenia Anderson, a voter who was at the rally wearing a red ""Latinas for Trump"" T-shirt. “I have a family, but I find myself making cheaper [meals], buying cheaper things.” Others - such as rapper Sean Moon, a Tennessee voter - pointed to the US-Mexico border and concern over immigration as the main reason they supported the former president. Migrant crossings over the US southern border hit record levels under the Biden-Harris administration but the numbers have dropped significantly in recent months. “That’s an existential threat for this country,” said Mr Moon, the son of a North Korean refugee, about migrant crossings. The event in Butler, he said, was his 15th consecutive Trump rally. “There are people coming in without being vetted. They tell untruths and get rewarded for it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq64qm2v7m9o,N Korea's Kim calls Putin 'closest comrade',Kim said relations between North Korea and Russia would be raised to a new level.,7 days ago,2024-10-15 10:33:15.599694,China News,BBC,China,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent a birthday message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him his ""closest comrade"".  Kim, congratulating Putin on his 72nd birthday, added that relations between both countries would be raised to a new level.  Relations between Pyongyang and Moscow have deepened since the start of the Ukraine war - in a move that has worried the West. Separately on Tuesday, Kim said Pyongyang would speed up steps to make his country a military super power with nuclear weapons.  According to Yonhap News quoting North Korean state media KCNA, Kim praised relations between both countries, saying they had become ""invincible and eternal"", since Putin's visit to Pyongyang in June.  ""Meetings and comradely ties between us... will make a positive contribution to further consolidating the eternal foundation of the DPRK-Russia friendship,"" he added, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  The relationship between North Korea and Russia goes back decades - to Stalin and Kim Il-sung, the current Kim's grandfather. The Soviet Union supported North Korea in its early days with weapons and technology, and Pyongyang has never wanted to completely rely on China - which it does not fully trust. Earlier this year, Putin and Kim signed an agreement pledging that they would help each other in the event of ""aggression"" against either country - though it was unclear what would constitute aggression.  Kim has been accused of helping Russia in the war against Ukraine by supplying it with weapons in exchange for economic and technological assistance.  There has been growing evidence that Russia has been deploying North Korean missiles in Ukraine. For Putin, the relationship is likely more tactical than strategic. He needs support for his war in Ukraine and North Korea will certainly be willing to sell him whatever munitions he is willing to pay for. Jeffrey Lewis, a director at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, had earlier said both Kim and Putin were ""trying to reduce the pain of international sanctions by creating an alternate network of friends and partners beyond the reach of US sanctions"".  North Korea certainly can benefit enormously from access to Russian military technology – which despite Russia’s problems is still far more advanced than North Korea’s homegrown and reverse-engineered systems.   North Korea is primarily trying to perfect its nuclear and missile arsenal. It has made very surprising progress in the last decade in producing new missile systems and miniaturising its nuclear devices.  But Russia has far more advanced thermonuclear warhead designs, re-entry vehicle designs and solid rocket motor designs. During a visit by Kim to Russia in September 2023, Putin had promised to help North Korea develop its satellites, after several failed launches by Pyongyang.  A South Korean lawmaker also separately on Tuesday claimed that Seoul's military had detected apparent signs that North Korea had started to build a possible nuclear-powered submarine. Citing Korea's intelligence agency, Rep Kang Dae-sik said construction was still in its early stages and ""further confirmation is needed on whether it is nuclear powered"".  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgny3vm6d1o,Superdry boss says Shein allowed to 'dodge tax',"The fashion giant gets an unfair tax break because it ships items direct to customers, Julian Dunkerton says.",24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:15.774503,China News,BBC,China,"The boss of the clothing chain Superdry says its rival Shein is being allowed to ""dodge tax"", and is urging the government to take action. Julian Dunkerton told the BBC the fast fashion giant was enjoying an unfair advantage because import duties are not charged on the low-value parcels it sends direct to customers from overseas. Shein declined to comment, but has previously said that its success was due to its ""efficient supply chain"", not tax exemptions. The Treasury said tax policies had to balance the interests of consumers and retailers.  However, Mr Dunkerton said it would be in the UK's interests to get rid of this tax ""loophole"". “The rules weren’t made for a company sending individual parcels [and] having a billion-pound turnover in the UK without paying any tax,” said Mr Dunkerton, founder and chief executive of Superdry. ""We’re allowing somebody to come in and be a tax avoider, essentially.""  Shipments worth less than £135 that are sent directly to UK shoppers do not face import duties, but firms bringing in larger consignments do.  Before the arrival of a globalised online marketplace the exemption had limited impact, but retailers in the US and EU are now increasingly being undercut by low-cost Chinese rivals, and state treasuries are missing out on potential tax take. Mr Dunkerton also described Shein as a ""complete environmental disaster"". ""Personally, I would force them into paying import duty, VAT and possibly even an environmental tax,” he told the BBC. Shein has previously said it complies fully with all its UK tax liabilities. Mr Dunkerton is not the only retail boss to criticise how the import duty system works. In July, the boss of Sainsbury's, Simon Roberts, said ""all retailers should be working on the same basis"". About 20% of Sainsbury's sales comes from non-food items, and Mr Roberts said: ""I want to make sure that the loopholes that are currently in place are closed for some of the businesses that aren't paying tax in the right way, so it's a level playing field for everybody."" In March, the boss of Next, Lord Wolfson, also called for the government to look at the import duty system. Shein, which was founded in China but has relocated to Singapore, has been laying the groundwork for a potential sale of shares on the stock market, prompting closer scrutiny of its practices. The BBC understands that the firm filed initial documents for a London listing earlier this year, after a potential New York listing came under fire from both Republican and Democrat politicians. US lawmakers were concerned over the company's ""deep ties to the People’s Republic of China"". It has also been accused of using forced labour in parts of its supply chains, which it denies. It told the BBC it has a ""zero tolerance for forced labour"". Shein says its ""test and repeat"" approach, producing items in small batches and then reordering according to customer demand, means there is less waste, compared to traditional retailers. But it has been criticised for encouraging shoppers to buy items to wear once and discard, through its low prices and ""gamified"" social media strategy. The US and the EU are already looking at whether to tighten tax policies to bring Shein and other direct-to-consumer businesses, like Chinese retailer Temu, into the net. Shein has previously argued its success was not down to tax exemptions but was due to providing customers with affordable fashion. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: “Our customs and tax regime balances reducing burdens for businesses and consumers buying lower-value goods from overseas with the interests of UK businesses."" VAT - value added tax - was charged at the same rate on all goods irrespective of their origin or value, they added. Mr Dunkerton founded Superdry more than 20 years ago. Its distinctive Japanese-style T-shirts were once worn by Hollywood actors and sports stars and, at its peak in 2018, the company was valued at £1.8bn. But the firm’s popularity has declined, and in July it de-listed from the London Stock Exchange after nearly 15 years. Its shares now trade on an alternative exchange and the company is valued at less than £10m. Mr Dunkerton says he is still working to turn the firm's fortunes around, and he confirmed he would try again to take the company private.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl23xlrzp2o,"A Ferrari, a Honolulu hideaway, salted duck - top NY official allegedly spied for China",US officials say China lavished Linda Sun with money and perks including meals prepared by a personal chef.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:15.872414,China News,BBC,China,"A top New York state government aide secretly helped the Chinese government access an official call about Covid-19 while enjoying a lavish lifestyle as an undercover agent for Beijing, according to a US indictment. Over a period of roughly 14 years, Linda Sun rose through the ranks to become deputy chief of staff to the governor. But according to federal prosecutors, the 41-year-old used her position to aid Chinese officials, including by blocking Taiwanese diplomats from contacting the state government and covertly sharing internal documents with Beijing. In return, China allegedly showered Ms Sun and her husband, Christopher Hu, with millions of dollars in kickbacks that helped them buy a $4.1m (£3.1m) house in New York and perks including special home deliveries of salted duck. They also bought a $2.1m ocean-view condominium in Honolulu, Hawaii, and luxury vehicles including a 2024 Ferrari Roma sports car, according to the indictment. The couple pleaded not guilty on Tuesday in a Brooklyn federal court to a range of charges, from failing to register as a foreign agent to visa fraud and money laundering. US law requires that individuals acting for or in the interests of foreign countries or political parties register as foreign agents. Ms Sun never did - and, according to prosecutors, the Chinese-born naturalised citizen ""actively concealed that she took actions at the order, request, or direction"" of Chinese government officials and representatives. In 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic spread through the state, Ms Sun allegedly found ways for Chinese consular officials to gain access to New York leaders. So brazen were her efforts that, in one instance, she surreptitiously added a Chinese official to a private state government call about the public health response to the virus, according to prosecutors. Former New York prosecutor Howard Master told the BBC the charges reflect a ""disturbing"" trend of senior public officials - including former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez - corruptly receiving gifts from foreign governments. ""How she got away with it for so long will be a matter for ongoing investigation, but it appears that she took numerous steps to avoid getting caught, allegedly lying to the FBI, the New York State Office of the Inspector General, and others when questioned and taking other steps to conceal her role,"" he said. The indictment against Ms Sun lists occasions in which she worked to prevent Taiwanese representatives from either communicating with or meeting high-ranking officials in the US government. ""It's all been taken care of satisfactorily,"" Ms Sun is said to have bragged in one 2016 message to a Chinese consular official after successfully diverting a top New York politician from an event hosted by Taiwan. And when the island's president travelled to New York City in 2019, she was even pictured joining a pro-Beijing protest against the visit. Up until January 2021, she worked behind the scenes to scrub mentions of Beijing's detention of Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group in Xinjiang Province. When Chinese officials asked if the governor could record a Lunar New Year video, Ms Sun asked what “talking points” they wanted. ""Mostly holiday wishes and hope for friendship and co-operation,” the Chinese officials wrote. ""Nothing too political.” Ms Sun later told another Chinese official that she had argued with Ms Hochul’s speechwriter to get a mention of the “Uyghur situation” removed from a draft of the governor’s remarks. In 2023, while working in the New York labour department, Ms Sun obtained a framed official Lunar New Year proclamation from Governor Kathy Hochul and presented it to a Chinese official. The proclamation was produced outside of ordinary channels and even without the permission of Ms Hochul's office. Ms Sun also drafted fraudulent invitation letters for Chinese politicians to travel to the US and wrote an unauthorised letter of employment to add a compatriot to the New York governor's Asian American advisory council. In return, Ms Sun and Mr Hu ""received substantial economic and other benefits from [Beijing] representatives”, prosecutors say. The gifts included all-expenses-paid travel to China; tickets to top shows, concerts and sporting events; employment in China for Ms Sun's cousin; and home deliveries of Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a Chinese government official's personal chef. According to the indictment, the duck delicacy was gifted to Ms Sun - and sent directly to her parents' home - on at least 16 different occasions. On Tuesday morning, federal agents entered the couple's Long Island home and detained them on 10 criminal counts. Her lawyer, Jarrod Schaeffer, was quoted by AP news agency as saying: “We’re looking forward to addressing these charges in court.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99v3397pdpo,Five takeaways from new filing in Trump election case,"Trump allegedly said it didn't matter if he won or lost 2020 election, he would still ""fight like hell"".",4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:15.981232,China News,BBC,China,"Donald Trump's alleged criminal efforts to overturn his 2020 US election defeat are described in detail across 165 pages of a new filing from the federal prosecutor investigating him. The filing, released by a judge on Wednesday, lays out in depth how Special Counsel Jack Smith would pursue his case if it ever comes to trial, which is uncertain. Since Trump is expected to end the prosecution if he returns to the White House, Mr Smith may never be able to make an opening statement or call a witness. The Supreme Court ruled this summer that Trump cannot be prosecuted for official acts carried out as president, forcing Mr Smith to change the historic case and argue that Trump committed crimes as a private citizen.  Trump denies any wrongdoing in trying to block Joe Biden's certification as the election winner and his campaign called the document ""falsehood-ridden"". The judge overseeing the case has given Trump's team until 7 November - two days after the presidential election - to make a response to the latest filing. Here are five key points detailed in the prosecutor's arguments and evidence released on Wednesday. “It doesn’t matter if you won or lost the election,"" Trump allegedly said at some point after the election. ""You still have to fight like hell.” The filing cites these comments - reported by an unnamed assistant who overheard Trump speaking to his family - as evidence he was trying to overturn the result. And the document says Trump laid the groundwork for challenging the election even before polling day. It alleges the Republican had been told that the results would not be known on the day that most Americans voted - but that he might have an early edge before rival Democrats benefited from mail-in voting, which took longer to count. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, many voters had voted by mail. Trump allegedly told advisers that he would ""simply declare victory before all the ballots were counted and any winner was projected"".  The former president's allies were clear on what that meant, according to the filing. ""He's going to declare victory. That doesn't mean he's the winner, he's just going to say he's the winner,"" a Trump adviser is quoted telling a private gathering of his supporters. The filing shows how Trump allegedly carried out his plan to claim victory in several battleground states before votes were fully tallied by spreading false claims of fraud. Yet he is said to have characterised fraud claims made by some of his allies as unbelievable. The filing quotes him telling aides that one unnamed lawyer - who appears to be Sidney Powell - was making ""crazy"" claims, which he likened to sci-fi series Star Trek. ""Nonetheless, the defendant continued to support and publicise"" such claims, the document says.  On another occasion, a White House official reportedly told Trump that his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, would not be able to prove his election fraud theories in court.  ""The details don't matter,""  he reportedly replied. The world has seen the deep rift between Pence and Trump that developed after the election. The filing includes new details on supposedly how their relationship deteriorated. Mr Smith argues that since they interacted as election running mates, Trump's communication with his vice-president did not count as an official act.  Pence, according to the filing, ""gradually and gently"" tried to convince Trump to accept the election results, ""even if it meant they lost"". As Trump continued spreading false fraud claims and filing legal challenges, Pence reportedly suggested on 12 November a “face-saving option”: ""Don’t concede but recognise the process is over."" Days later, he encouraged Trump to accept the loss and run again in four years, to which Trump supposedly responded: ""I don’t know, 2024 is so far off."" Eventually, on 1 January 2021, Trump allegedly told Pence that ''hundreds of thousands"" of people ""are gonna think you're stupid"" for wanting to acknowledge their loss. Less than a week later, Trump supporters called for Pence to be hanged as they stormed the US Capitol building in the 6 January riot, because he planned to sign off on Biden's election win. Pence fled to safety in a parking garage. The filing says that when Trump was informed Pence might be in danger, he allegedly asked: ""So what?"" Mr Smith's team alleges Trump's campaign sowed ""chaos"" in battleground states that risked triggering violence.  When a large batch of ballots in the Democratic stronghold of Detroit, Michigan, seemed to put Biden ahead, a Trump campaign operative allegedly told his colleague to ""find a reason"" that something was wrong with them. The colleague then suggested that could cause unrest. According to the filing, the operative answered: ""Make them riot."" Campaign officials in another swing state, Pennsylvania, allegedly provoked confrontations, which were then used to claim that observers were not given proper legal access to the vote counting. The prosecutors allege that Trump incited the 6 January Capitol riot by telling a crowd ""many of the same lies he had been telling for months"". In a speech in Washington that morning, Trump ""made clear that he expected his supporters to take action"", according to the filing. Mr Smith has made this allegation before, but he now contends that Trump fired up supporters as a political candidate, not president, and the speech was part of a rally. His team argues that Trump ""directed his supporters to go to the Capitol and suggested he would go with them"" to provoke further action. Then, Trump and his allies allegedly sought to ""exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol"" to try to delay the election certification. Trump watched the riot unfold on Twitter and Fox News, says the filing, citing information from his phone and former White House staff. He also allegedly used social media to target Pence and repeatedly ""refused""  advisers' requests to ""issue a calming message and make efforts to stop the riot"".

Businesses in Bawtry, near Doncaster, have also decorated their premises in pink as part of the fundraiser for Cancer Research UK during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Sarah Robinson, who runs events company Sisi, campaigns for charity in memory of a close friend who was in her 40s when she died of the disease. This is the first year she has partnered with the Bawtry Retail Association to run Pink Bawtry. She said: ""It just raises that awareness to another level, and it gets the community involved as well."" Speaking about the death of her friend Sharon Woodcock in 2020, Ms Robinson said: ""Until you're hit with that in your friendship circle, you never really question your own health.

The Grade II listed building at Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, has been transformed into a tea room and opened in April. The project has won the Re-use of a Georgian building category of the Georgian Group's 2024 Architectural Awards. Wentworth Woodhouse is one of the largest houses in Europe and is managed by a preservation trust who are working to turn it into a leading visitor attraction. The Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust acquired the 365-room stately home in 2017 for £7m. The regeneration of the Grade I listed house will take up to 20 years and will cost over £130m. Sarah McLeod OBE, from the trust, said the award from Georgian Group meant a great deal. ""Saving the Camellia House, removing it from the Heritage At Risk Register and giving it a new life is a huge achievement. “We have future-proofed our beautiful Georgian Camellia House and enabled it to become a tea house - the very thing it was originally created for."" The building was derelict for 50 years and had originally been built as a tea room in 1738 for Lady Mary Finch, the wife of the 1st Marquess of Rockingham. An orangery was added in the 19th Century, becoming home to a collection of camellias imported from China. The restoration work was paid for through a grant of over £4 million from The National Lottery Heritage Fund, a further £614,000 from Historic England and more than £450,000 from other donors. It saw the reinstatement of the glazed, opening roof, large windows remade in wood to the original pattern, strengthened by the addition of stainless steel and underfloor heating, a ground source heat pump and rainwater harvesting were also introduced. The majority of the contracting firms were from Yorkshire and 22 new local jobs were created. Historic England architect Giles Proctor said the work done on the estate had helped heritage trainees to learn their craft. ""This beautiful Grade II listed building had been on Historic England’s Heritage at Risk Register for many years but has now been saved, and we are delighted by its success in the Georgian Group Awards.” The Georgian Group is a charity which works to conserve historic buildings and planned landscapes.

In a statement, Nike said John Donahoe will retire on 13 October, staying on in an advisory role until early next year to ""ensure a smooth transition"". Demand for the company's trainers has been faltering in international markets like China and the company's stock price had slumped. Shares rose more than 9% in after-hours trading, however, following the announcement that Elliott Hill would return to the firm. Mr Donahoe was responsible for boosting Nike's online presence, as well as driving more sales directly from customers instead of partnering with other shops on High Streets or in shopping centres. He joined the company's board in 2014 before taking on the role of chief executive in 2020.  His tenure has been challenging with huge shifts in the retail landscape during the pandemic and as inflation spiked in the following years. The footwear firm has also faced tough competition from the likes of newer rivals On and Hoka, which some analysts have described as being more innovative and on top of current trends. Nike had been hoping that new products and a marketing campaign around the Olympic Games in Paris would help bring shoppers back to the brand. But in the announcement on Thursday, it said that the board and Mr Donahoe had ""decided he will retire from his role"".  “It became clear now was the time to make a leadership change,"" Mr Donahoe said, adding that Mr Hill was the right person for the job and he was looking forward to seeing his future success. His replacement, Mr Hill, retired from the company just four years ago after serving in a number of senior leadership roles in Europe and the US. He said he was ""eager to reconnect"" with employees he had worked with in the past. ""Together with our talented teams, I look forward to delivering bold, innovative products that set us apart in the marketplace and captivate consumers for years to come,"" he added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93pdlg4dlno,"Trump 'resorted to crimes' to overturn 2020 election, prosecutors say",A new filing presents the clearest view yet of how prosecutors would present their case against the former president at trial.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:26.185866,China News,BBC,China,"Donald Trump ""resorted to crimes"" while trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, and should not escape charges, prosecutors say. A new court filing challenges Trump's claim that he should avoid a trial thanks to a recent landmark US Supreme Court ruling. This said American presidents should be immune from prosecution when acting in an ""official"" capacity. Trump was president when the alleged offences were committed - but prosecutors say he was acting in a ""private"" capacity, not an official one. In response, Trump has repeated false claims that the 2020 vote was ""rigged"" and suggested the timing of the filing's release was designed to hurt his 2024 campaign. In an interview with NewsNation, he also criticised Special Counsel Jack Smith, the lead prosecutor in the election interference probe who submitted the filing. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan released the document - filed by Mr Smith last week - with redactions on Wednesday. This is one of four criminal cases Trump has faced since being voted out in 2020 - another of which led to a historic conviction in New York. He is accused of seeking to illegally block the certification of President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election, but denies wrongdoing. The new 165-page document presents the clearest view yet of how Mr Smith's team would pursue their case, having tweaked the wording of their charges after the Supreme Court's intervention. It gives details of Trump's alleged scheme, including his actions when his supporters rioted at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021. It also outlines the efforts of Mike Pence, the vice-president at the time, to talk him down.  The issue remains prominent in US politics almost four years later, ahead of the 2024 election in November, which will be contested by Trump and Kamala Harris. It came up in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate, during which JD Vance refused to answer whether Trump, his running mate for 2024, lost in 2020. The court filing may represent Mr Smith's last chance to set out his case against Trump.  The case has been frequently delayed since charges were filed by the Department of Justice (DoJ) more than a year ago.  Chutkan has given Trump's team until 7 November - two days after the presidential election - to respond to the latest filing. The filing means he will not face trial before November's election - and he could seek to have the case dropped if he wins. Trump's lawyers fought to keep the latest filing sealed. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung has called it ""falsehood-ridden"" and ""unconstitutional"". In the newly released document, Mr Smith and his team try to navigate the summer Supreme Court ruling - which dented their case - by narrowing their scope. The Supreme Court ruling did not apply immunity to unofficial acts. The prosecutors argue that although Trump was still in office when attempting to overturn the 2020 vote, his attempts related to his campaign and his life as a private citizen. They call it a ""private criminal effort"". The court should therefore ""determine that the defendant must stand trial for his private crimes as he would any other citizen,"" the filing says. The filing lays out several instances in which Pence expressed doubt about his boss's voter fraud claims and tried to persuade him to accept he lost the election. In the court document, prosecutors say Trump was not upset when he learned his vice-president had been rushed to a secure location as rioters stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021. ""So what?"" he allegedly said, when informed of the scenes. Pence would later go public about his falling out with Trump in the wake of the storming of Congress, when some rioters shouted ""hang Mike Pence"" because the vice-president refused to obstruct the certification of election results. The filing also alleges that Trump always planned to declare victory no matter the result, and laid the groundwork for this long before election day. It also accuses him of knowingly spreading false claims about the vote that he himself deemed ""crazy"". Mr Smith also provides several new details about the Trump campaign's alleged role in sowing chaos in battleground states, where a large number of mail-in ballots were being counted in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the Democratic stronghold of Detroit, Michigan, when a large batch of ballots seemed to be in favour of Biden, a Trump campaign operative allegedly told his colleague to ""find a reason"" that something was wrong with the ballots to give him ""options to file litigation"". The filing also claims that Trump and his allies, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, sought to ""exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol"" on 6 January 2021 to delay the election certification. They allegedly did this by calling senators and leaving voicemails that asked them to object to the state electors.  Trump said on Wednesday that the case would end with his ""complete victory"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglk3nj8xy6o,Alex Salmond: A politician who loved creating headlines,The former Scottish first minister was a politician who rarely missed a media opportunity.,24 hrs ago,2024-10-15 10:33:26.302178,China News,BBC,China,"Alex Salmond loved creating headlines. He would be disappointed if he gave an interview that was not sufficiently interesting to make the news. As a young radio journalist, I was sent to see him at a business breakfast event where at that time he was demanding the UK join the single European currency. When I suggested this was not new, that he’d said it many times before, he said: “Yes but I’m saying it more forcefully now because the case is more urgent.” Anything to make his contribution count. Spending time in his company could easily make you late. He tended not to limit interview duration and enjoyed further conversation, debate and showing off a bit after the microphones were off. I can remember interviewing him in his early days as first minister at his official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh. The interview was over and I needed to go - but he wanted to show me a collection of silverware that had been found in a cupboard, and share something of its history. While he could be charming and entertaining and always offered a sharp analysis of the politics of the day, there was also a less pleasant side to his character. I would wince when sometimes he would show impatience and irritation towards his staff. He could be very demanding of them. I can also remember bringing a senior BBC editor from the newsroom in London to see him, and was astonished when he asked my colleague if he was on a colonial visit. He had a love/hate relationship with the BBC. He loved when he was offered a prestigious spot on a network show like Question Time, especially when his political career was in decline. At other times, he would rage against output he did not like. He was not happy that I interviewed, anonymously, one of the women who had accused him of sexual offences in court, after he had been acquitted of all charges. It was not an attempt to re-try the case but a response to his claims of a political conspiracy. I am not sure he forgave me for that. I travelled with him to Europe, the United States and China. I remember him turning up uncharacteristically early at the Forbidden City in Beijing to meet China’s vice-premier and finding himself locked out. It would have made powerful TV footage but I don’t think we got it on camera. He thought we had captured this embarrassing moment and gave me a private briefing and a couple of scoops in the hope I wouldn’t use it. Alex Salmond lived and breathed politics and he seemed completely lost when he was ejected from parliament in 2017. I bumped into him in Edinburgh soon after and we shared a taxi to Waverley station. Naturally we talked politics and when it came time to part he just kept the conversation going. In recent years, we talked far less. He refused to take part in a podcast series I made about Nicola Sturgeon’s time in office - which would obviously have included the spectacular rift between them. That was not like him. In all my previous experience, he rarely missed a media opportunity. Better in his view to get out there and make his case rather than shy away and let others set the narrative."

Flori's Friends Rescue near Canterbury in Kent, which offers end-of-life care and a rehoming service, said it had raised £4,500. The cash has gone towards a prosthetic leg for a Romanian rescue dog which was hit by an HGV, and a leg brace for a border collie receiving end-of-life care after being abused. Natalia George, the charity's founder, said: ""People think we're the heroes... but it's actually the people who donate who save these dogs."" Elle was hit by an HGV and left on the side of a motorway for six days before being rescued at just 10-months-old, said Ms George. While she had previously been fitted with a prosthetic leg, the now three-year-old dog had outgrown it. Ms George, 34, said there a was a huge ""difference in how happy"" Elle was while going out for walks. ""It really makes a difference to their wellbeing,"" she added. Fern, an 18-month-old border collie, was rescued from within the UK after being abused a puppy. Due to debilitating paralysis and double-elbow dysplasia, she is receiving end-of-life care which involves pain management and physiotherapy. ""The brace will extend her life by nine months,"" said Ms George. ""Her pain levels have come right down and there's not so much stress on that joint"".  Flori's Friends, which has also rescued dogs from Oman, China, Greece and Gaza, is currently looking after 29 dogs and 60 cats. Ms George said those who had been paralysed came with huge care costs - averaging at about £5,500 from the point of rescue to the point of being able to be rehomed.

Typhoon Bebinca hit at about 07:30 local time (23:30 GMT) on Monday in the coastal area of Lingang New City in Shanghai’s east, the China Meteorological Administration said. It is the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in 75 years, according to Chinese state media. As a precaution, more than 400,000 people in the Shanghai Metropolitan area were relocated by Sunday evening, according to local officials.  A further 9,000 people were evacuated from the Chongming District, an island at the mouth of the Yangtze River that is also part of Shanghai. Hundreds of flights were cancelled as the city's two main airports grounded all flights. Train services were also cancelled and highways closed. A 40km/h (25mph) speed limit was imposed on roads inside the city.  Shanghai’s 25 million residents had been advised to stay home as the storm batters the city. Authorities have issued a red alert for Bebinca, the highest level, as wind speeds of up to 151km/h (94 mph) were recorded at the typhoon's eye. It is expected to weaken as it moves inland. Videos posted online showed large trees toppled and people dragging their bicycles and motorcycles through flooded streets. A clip shared by Shanghai Daily showed a bus braking abruptly along Huaihai Road in a major shopping district as billboards blown by fierce winds collapsed onto the ground. The storm was one of the most-discussed topics on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Monday, with some users sharing their fears that it would worsen. ""This is the kind of thing you'd only see on television,"" wrote one Weibo user, who posted a video of trees swaying violently in a car park. Another user advised others to make sure their doors and windows are properly locked and not to leave their homes unnecessarily. It is rare for Shanghai to get a direct hit from strong typhoons, which tend to make landfall further south in China. The city's flood control headquarters said they received dozens of reports of incidents related to the typhoon - mostly fallen trees and billboards. Resorts in Shanghai, including Shanghai Disney Resort, Jinjiang Amusement Park and Shanghai Wild Animal Park, have been temporarily closed and many ferries halted. Another typhoon, Yagi, killed at least four people and injured 95 when it passed through China's southern Hainan island this month, according to national weather authorities. Yagi also caused severe flooding in Southeast Asia, killing hundreds of people in Vietnam and Myanmar. Typhoon Bebinca also passed through Japan and the central and southern Philippines, where falling trees killed six people. Chinese state media said Bebinca was expected to move north-west, causing heavy rain and high winds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces.  With additional reporting by Kelly Ng, BBC News"

The Socceroos are now looking to appoint a permanent replacement before their next World Cup qualifier at home to China on 10 October. ""I said after our game against Indonesia that I had some decisions to make, and after deep reflection, my gut has told me it's time for change,"" Arnold said in a statement. ""I've made the decision to resign based upon whatâs best for the nation, the players and Football Australia.

Arnold led Australia to the last 16 of the World Cup in Qatar where they were knocked out of the tournament by winners Argentina, with Football Australia chief executive James Johnson recently backing the Australian to get back on track. The former Socceroos striker was appointed assistant coach of Australia in 2000 and then served as interim boss for a year after Dutchman Guus Hiddink left in 2006. He returned to the national side in 2018 as coach after a disappointing World Cup campaign in Russia saw Australia finish bottom of Group C. Despite initially backing Arnold, Johnson thought he had ""run out of gas"" and hopes the replacement can still guide Australia to the World Cup.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7xg870x88o,Brightening comet set to shine in autumn sky,A newly-spotted comet is set to appear in the autumn sky but it's not clear how bright it will become.,28 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:26.721574,China News,BBC,China,"Astronomy fans, get your telescopes and cameras ready - it's possible an unusually bright comet is set to grace the night skies. It should be visible in the northern hemisphere from about now, though it will be very low on the horizon before dawn. But the best views are expected in mid-October, when it may even become visible to  the naked eye. Soon after it was first spotted there was speculation it could be one of the brightest comets in years. That excitement is fading, but it should still be something worth seeing. The comet was first noticed in January 2023, by the Tsuchinshan Observatory in China, and later independently detected by Nasa's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). That helps explain its full name C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). People are calling it Comet A3 for short. Since then, astronomers have been tracking its progress, watching as it brightens and edges closer to its peak visibility. Unlike asteroids, which are entirely made of rock, comets are composed of ice, rock, and gas.  As they approach the Sun, the warmth causes their ice to change into gases and release dust particles trapped in the ice, which is what causes their beautiful tail. This latest comet has been visible in the Southern Hemisphere, and is now coming into view for the Northern Hemisphere too. But it is notoriously difficult to guess how bright each comet will become. Robert Massey, Deputy Executive Director of the Royal Astronomical Society, says:  ""Bright comets are quite rare, so if you do get a chance to see one, take a look, even if you have to use a pair of binoculars to pick out the tail and features. They're absolutely beautiful,"" Dr Massey remains sceptical about some of the expectations of this particular comet.  ""Is it going to be the brightest comet in 100 years? I really doubt that,"" he says. Dr Massey recommends looking for the comet during two periods. For the next week or so it should be visible in the northern hemisphere low in the eastern sky before dawn, though you may need binoculars or a telescope. There will be a better chance from around 12 October, this time after sunset in the western sky. With some luck, you might even then spot the comet with a naked eye.  ""You could go outside and say, 'Wow, there’s a comet!' without even needing binoculars,"" Dr Massey says. ""Comets are unpredictable, but we don’t know when the next one will appear, so don’t miss this chance,"" he adds. With clear skies and the right conditions, this comet could provide one of the most captivating astronomical events of the year. Although the comet may become as bright as Comet Neowise, which was a striking sight during the pandemic in 2020, scientists say it is unlikely to exceed that brightness."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23k4yyjxp3o,CrowdStrike boss apologises for global IT outage,"Adam Meyers, a senior vice president with the IT firm at the heart of July's mass outage, faced a grilling by US lawmakers.",25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:42.498283,China News,BBC,China,"Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike faced its biggest grilling yet over its role in July's mass global IT outage in Congress on Tuesday. Adam Meyers, a senior executive at the company, appeared before a US congressional committee to answer questions about its faulty software update that disabled millions of PCs on 19 July. The incident knocked payment services offline, grounded flights and forced some hospitals to cancel appointments and delay operations. Mr Meyers said the firm was ""deeply sorry"" for the outage that affected millions of people and is ""determined to prevent it from happening again"". CrowdStrike described the outage as the result of a “perfect storm”. Lawmakers on the House of Representatives cybersecurity subcommittee pressed Mr Meyers on how it occurred in the first place. ""A global IT outage that impacts every sector of the economy is a catastrophe that we would expect to see in a movie,"" said Mark Green, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, in his opening remarks. The Tennessee representative likened the widespread impact of CrowdStrike’s faulty content update to an attack “we would expect to be carefully executed by a malicious and sophisticated nation-state actor”. Instead “the largest IT outage in history was due to a mistake”, he said. Mr Meyers said the company would continue to act on and share ""lessons learned"" from the incident to make sure it would not happen again. Among the questions directed at Mr Meyers during the 90-minute hearing were  technical queries about whether the company's software should have access to core parts of device operating systems. But there were also more general questions about artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential impact on cybersecurity. Congressman Carlos Gimenez asked about the threat of AI writing malicious code.  Mr Meyers said he thought the tech was “not there yet"" but added that every day it ""gets better"". In response to one representative's line of questioning, Mr Meyers reiterated that AI - which the company leverages to detect threats to systems - was not responsible for pushing the erroneous update that crashed computers around the world.  He said CrowdStrike releases between 10 and 12 configuration updates each day. Lawmakers on the committee raised concerns about the impact of large-scale cyber events on national security, adding they could also be exploited by bad actors looking to capitalise on confusion or panic. But all in all, Mr Meyers did not face quite the level of scrutiny that other high-level technology executives have when called to testify in Congress over apparent failings.  Congressman Eric Swalwell said the committee had not gathered to “malign” the firm, while Mr Green said Mr Meyers showed an ""impressive"" degree of humility. Instead there was an emphasis on working together with the committee and government to prevent the possibility of any such further incidents in future.  The company still faces a number of lawsuits from people and businesses that were caught up in July's mass outage. Some of the people affected told BBC News it ""totally ruined"" their holidays, or caused them to lose out on business. The firm has been sued by its own shareholders, as well as by Delta Airlines passengers left stranded by thousands of flight cancellations. Delta said it lost $500m (£374m) due to CrowdStrike's ""negligence""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxr4732pxwo,Terminator creator James Cameron joins board of AI company,His role at Stable Diffusion creator StabilityAI will focus on AI's use in special effects.,25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:42.604722,China News,BBC,China,"Filmmaker James Cameron has joined the board of directors of artificial intelligence (AI) firm StabilityAI, 40 years after making a film about its risks. In 1984's The Terminator, which Cameron wrote and directed, a rogue AI called Skynet threatens the existence of mankind. But the creator of the fictional AI has not been hired to help avoid such tech being developed in real life. Instead, his role will centre around how the technology can be used in special effects, also known as computer-generated images (CGI).  “I’ve spent my career seeking out emerging technologies that push the very boundaries of what’s possible, all in the service of telling incredible stories,"" he said.  ""I was at the forefront of CGI over three decades ago, and I’ve stayed on the cutting edge since.  ""Now, the intersection of generative AI and CGI image creation is the next wave."" Amongst his long list of hit movies, Cameron is known for creating special effects-heavy Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all time. His new place of work, StabilityAI, is best known for making Stable Diffusion - which can generate images based on a user's text prompt. It is also branching out into video, with Stable Video Diffusion, which works in the same way. It is this tech that Cameron seems to have been brought on to help develop. Proponents of AI video generation say it will enable artists to quickly create complicated digital effects. But for many creatives - and Cameron's contemporaries - this use of the technology is considered controversial at best. Last week, Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro criticised AI-generated video during a talk at the British Film Institute in London, saying it could not generate much beyond ""semi-compelling screensavers"". Michael Bay said last year the tech ""will create a whole bunch of lazy people"" because ""it doesn't create, it just imitates"". And Hiyao Miyazaki, who wrote and directed animated classic Spirited Away, previously said he was ""disgusted"" by an AI-generated video and called it ""an insult to life itself"". Rashik Parmar, head of BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, told the BBC the filmmaker's appointment comes at a time when ""many of society’s fears about AI"" come from movies. ""We watch Terminator and we form the idea that AI has malicious intentions towards humanity and that it will destroy us in the near future,"" he said. ""Cameron has a real opportunity to change the narrative and build a positive view of AI, we’re very happy to work with him on that."" One of Cameron's first challenges in his new role will be to shore up StabilityAI's position in the wider generativeAI landscape, where it faces stiff competition. OpenAI's rival video generation tool Sora is the most high-profile name in the space, with Reuters reporting Hollywood executives have discussed with the firm how the film industry could use its tech. Meanwhile, Hunger Games and John Wick studio Lionsgate made a deal last week with AI firm Runway to create tools based on its massive archive of film and TV. And in recent weeks the video generation landscape has been shaken by the sudden emergence of MiniMax, created by China-based HailuoAI.  The tool became popular on social media this month thanks to its ability to quickly create high-quality video from just a few lines of text. In particular, a recent trend has seen people using the tool to make videos about chef Gordon Ramsay, with one such popular post seeing him skydiving while cooking spaghetti. Ramsay has not responded to a request for comment. And Cameron is joining the AI industry at a critical time for a different reason - copyright. The technology works by analysing human-made pictures, including images found online, and artists claim this means their work has been used without permission. Stability AI founder Emad Mostaque has previously told BBC News Stable Diffusion is trained using ""100,000 GB of images"" taken from the internet. Getty Images, which is working on its own AI image generator, is suing StabilityAI over this very thing."

About 500 fake airbags and an estimated £140,000 in cash were seized across three properties in east London by officers from the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU) at City of London Police. Dogs found £110,000 of cash wrapped in nappies and hidden inside a wall cavity at a residential property. The remaining £30,000 was found in wardrobes there. Three men, aged 34, 36 and 51, were arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to distribute counterfeit goods. Officers from PIPCU suspect the airbags were imported from China and then sold abroad. Det Ch Insp Emma Warbey, from PIPCU, said: “The fake airbags we seized today are sold at prices far below the cost of quality, genuine equipment. We know that the offer of a good deal can be enticing, but it’s always important to buy vehicle parts from a reputable seller."" She added: “This operation sends a clear message that we will work across borders to disrupt illegal activity and hold those involved to account for their actions.” A written price list found at a garage suggests that the airbags were sold for as little as £25.

Eden Dock, in partnership with the Eden Project, has been developed as the beginning of a ""green spine through the centre of Canary Wharf"". It is open to everybody and the aim is to improve the well-being of people who live or work there and those who visit. Floating islands and humanoid mossy sculptures have been introduced to increase biodiversity. Canary Wharf, which gets its name from ships bearing fruit from the Canary Islands, was developed on the site of the former West India Docks. Along with the City of London, it is considered the financial heart of the capital and is home to six of the UK's 10 tallest buildings - with One Canada Square being the tallest in the country at the time of its completion (it is now third tallest). Numerous banks and associated businesses have their world or European headquarters there, and about 105,000 people are employed at the site. The Eden Project, a charity and social enterprise based in Cornwall, is famous for its large ""biomes"" containing different ecosystems - including the world's largest indoor rainforest. It is located in a reclaimed china clay pit, and has nurtured thousands of plant species from across the world. Research has suggested exposure to green spaces helps reduce stress and increase employee productivity, as well as boost physical activity and social cohesion. Green spaces also help improve air quality and absorb carbon. Shobi Khan, from the Canary Wharf Group, said: “Our urbanising world cannot become sustainable until cities work for nature as well as people.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20dr33xjeo,Sadness and defiance in Trump-shooting town trying to heal,The town is undergoing its own healing process ahead of the former president's visit.,5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:42.925730,China News,BBC,China,"Butler County in Western Pennsylvania is rock-solid Trump country. In front yards, on the sides of roads and at filling stations, the messages on the billboards are blunt. ""Bulletproof"" is one, on a picture of the former president with his fist raised, moments after he was shot in this very town. Another, more overtly political, reads: ""Even my dog hates Biden."" The former president got twice as many votes as Joe Biden here in 2020, beating Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a similar margin. In fact, this county has only voted Democrat once in the past 150 years of presidential elections. Butler has always been proud to be known as the home of the American Jeep but this year it is better remembered for one thing - where a former Republican president was inches away from being assassinated. A bullet grazed his ear that day, on 13 July, and Butler is undergoing its own healing process as Donald Trump returns to the same spot, the Farm Show grounds, for a rally on Saturday evening. Trump's speech is expected to begin at about 17:00 local time (21:00 GMT), with the site reportedly already in lockdown ahead of his visit. For the first time since publicly endorsing the former president, Elon Musk - the boss of X, Tesla and SpaceX - has confirmed he will be in the audience.  Ahead of Trump's return to Butler, the BBC has spoken to some of the people who were just a few feet away from him as the gunfire rang out back in July.  There is sadness and guilt among local Republicans and resentment, too, that their county - so staunchly pro-Trump - was where this happened. ""That was the saddest moment of my life,"" said Jim Hulings, chairman of the Butler County Republican Party, who was 30ft away at the time and thought Trump had been killed. “I was horrified to think that somebody had the audacity to shoot a great man.” Jondavid Longo, the mayor of Slippery Rock, a small town just a few miles away, was on stage moments before the shooting, part of the warm-up act. When the gunman began to fire, he instinctively used his body to cover his pregnant wife. He says he replays the incident in his mind every day. ""It's a difficult thing for us to come to terms with,"" he said. There is guilt that somebody else did lose their life that day, he says, and two others were seriously injured. That person was Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former volunteer fire fighter, who died after throwing himself in front of the bullets to protect his wife and daughters. His widow Helen seems lost and distracted when I meet her. It’s clear she’s struggling. ""I think about it every day. I see it every time I close my eyes."" She and Corey were childhood sweethearts, married for 29 years. And both staunch supporters of Trump. They joked that day that the former president was going to invite Corey up on stage, she said. Days later, his fire chief’s jacket was taken to the Republican convention in Milwaukee and placed on stage as Trump made his acceptance speech for the nomination. ""I just cried because, you know, I said he got his moment on stage with Trump."" Like Helen, Trump supporters in Butler have dozens of questions about how it could have happened. While the motive of the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Crooks, remain obscure, what has become much clearer is the series of security blunders that led to him pulling the trigger. Two hours before he opened fire, he was able to fly a drone around the site without being detected because Secret Service counter-surveillance equipment was not working. Communications failures meant that suspicious sightings of Crooks an hour and a half before he shot at Trump were not passed on to all elements of the Secret Service. More than half an hour before the shooting, he was seen by police using a rangefinder pointed at the stage - a device often used by hunters pursuing their prey.  Yet a little over 25 minutes later, Crooks had managed to climb on to the roof of a local business and fire eight shots. Seconds later he was dead, a single shot to the head from a Secret Service sniper. Those few seconds are still haunting many of those who witnessed it. Lucie Roth can be seen in the VIP seats behind Trump in one of the most recognisable pictures of the shooting, taken by a Reuters photographer. She initially thought the gunfire was fireworks but then she heard screams to ""Get down!"" and dropped to the floor. ""I truly thought he was dead. I saw the Secret Service pile on top of him like he was the quarterback at a football game."" She was still down when she heard the crowd roar and cheer, and knew then he was OK. Renae Billow and her 11-year-old son and Trump impersonator, Gino Benford, were a few feet away from Lucie and Gino is clearly visible in the Reuters photo, complete with a blond wig and a dark suit. Speaking from the family home in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Gino says he was both scared and calm, ""half and half"", when the shots rang out. ""I thought, who would want to do this to such a great president?"" Reporting from just outside the rally that night, we began to interview people as they left. But one man stood out. He was wearing a Trump hat with fake orange hair sprouting out of it and holding a can of beer. Greg Smith’s words, in which he described how he had seen the gunman on the roof and tried to warn the Secret Service, reverberated around the world. It provided the first hint at the catastrophic security failure and a clip of the interview was viewed by tens of millions of people on social media. Meeting him again this week at his store, just yards from the scene of the shooting, he still feels angry. ""I was very frustrated when I talked to you, extremely frustrated because I think of the time frame. He was on that roof for minutes, crawling, and we were pointing and yelling."" ""I remember thinking 'Why? Why isn't someone doing something? How is this happening? How do I still hear President Trump talking as this is going on?'""  There is also pride in what he did in speaking out. People tell him he is part of history, the first person to tell the world what happened. As someone who usually shuns the limelight, he added: ""I jumped out of my comfort zone and did that. And I'm glad that it went like it did, that everything I told you that night has proven to be true."" Greg, who that day was listening to Trump from outside the rally, does not plan to go to Saturday’s event. He says his 12-year-old son has been traumatised by it, jumping whenever he hears fire works. Despite still feeling angry about the security lapses, Helen Comperatore and her daughters will go back. It's what Corey would have wanted, she says. ""I have tried to do that with everything I do, what would he want me to do? What would Corey do? And that's how I go."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j7x8lv7jgo,"Harris pushed on Ukraine, debt and if 'mistakes' were made at border",Harris defended Biden-Harris policies as she answered questions on CBS primetime programme 60 Minutes.,7 days ago,2024-10-15 10:33:43.030236,China News,BBC,China,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris was pressed on issues including the Middle East, Ukraine, gun ownership and immigration during a one-on-one interview with CBS News' 60 Minutes. The recorded interview comes as Harris ramps up media appearances on a series of podcasts and TV networks amid criticism that she has made very few. Donald Trump also was invited to 60 Minutes, but declined. There is less than a month to go before Election Day in the race for the White House between the Democrat and her Republican opponent. The interview on CBS News, the BBC's US partner, aired Monday night after both Harris and Trump appeared at events to commemorate one year since the 7 October attack on Israel. Harris declined to agree when asked by reporter Bill Whitaker whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a ""strong ally"" of the United States, after recent public disagreements between the White House and Jerusalem.  ""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" Harris said. ""I think, with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people,"" she continued. ""And the answer to that question is yes."" In a more tense moment, Harris also was pressed to defend her immigration record, which has been heavily attacked by Trump and Republicans. Mr Whitaker asked her whether it was a “mistake” to loosen border restrictions put in place during Trump's presidency, given that the Biden-Harris administration re-enacted restrictions three years after taking control of the White House. “It's a longstanding problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions,” she said, blaming Trump for pressuring Republicans in Congress to torpedo a border deal that would have increased immigration enforcement. The reporter responded: “What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place?” Harris replied that “the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem”. She said that she and Biden have “cut the flow of illegal immigration by half”. On Ukraine, Harris said she would not sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin unless Ukraine was also at the table.  She slammed Trump's position, saying: ""He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender,"" she said.  If Trump was still president, she said, ""Putin would be in Kyiv right now"". She also was asked about her economic plan and how her administration would fund its plans, which could add $3tr (£2.3tr) to the US national deficit over the next decade. ""My economic plan would strengthen America’s economy. His would weaken it,"" she said, adding that her plan relied on ""strengthening small businesses"".  Asked again how she would pay for it, Harris responded that she would raise taxes on ""the richest among us who can afford it"". On Monday, a new analysis by the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found Trump's proposals would increase the US national debt by double the amount of Harris'. Trump would add $7.5tn and Harris would add $3.5tn, the group said. The think tank warned that neither was addressing the country's growing $35.6tn debt. In her interview, Harris also discussed owning a firearm, revealing that her pistol is made by Austrian company Glock.  ""I've had it for quite some time,"" she said, noting that her ""background is in law enforcement"". Harris, a former district attorney in California, laughed when asked if she had ever fired it, saying, ""of course I have, at a shooting range."" Also speaking on the same programme, Harris's running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, criticised Trump for his comments on his opponents and migrants.  ""They're dehumanising, they go beyond weird because, I said this, it becomes almost dangerous. Let's try to debate policy in a real way and let's try to find objective truth again."" He also defended his record of making false statements about his military service and travels in Asia in the 1980s.  Walz described himself as a guy ""telling a story, getting a date wrong"", rather than a ""pathological liar"" like Trump.  ""I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word."" Trump also was invited to 60 Minutes. He accepted, but later changed his mind and declined, according to CBS.  Trump's campaign disputed that he ever agreed to be interviewed. His spokesman, Steven Cheung called it ""fake news"". During his 2020 presidential campaign, Trump walked out of his interview with CBS presenter Leslie Stahl after growing frustrated with questions about Covid-19.  Earlier on Monday, Harris commemorated those killed or taken hostage on 7 October by planting a pomegranate tree at the vice-president’s residence in Washington. “A symbol of hope and righteousness… to remind future vice-presidents of the United States not only of the horror of October 7th but the strength and endurance of the Jewish people,” Harris said. Former President Donald Trump donned a black yarmulke as he visited Ohel Chabad Lubavitch, the final resting place of Rabbi Schneerson in Queens, New York on Monday. The site is considered the holiest Jewish site in North America, according to some Orthodox Jews.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v5mng4z45o,Can families returning after centuries solve S Korea's population crisis?,"Ethnic Koreans, whose ancestors migrated to Russia, are returning, but the move can be difficult.",24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:43.129905,China News,BBC,China,"At first glance, Dunpo Elementary is no different from the thousands of elementary schools dotted across South Korea.  But look just beneath the surface and the differences are stark.  For one thing, most of the students in this school in Asan, an industrial city near the capital Seoul, may look ethnically Korean, but cannot speak the language. “If I don’t translate into Russian for them, the other kids won’t understand any of the lessons,” says 11-year-old Kim Yana. Yana speaks the best Korean in her class - but she and most of her 22 classmates are native Russian speakers. Nearly 80% of the pupils at Dunpo are categorised as “multicultural students”, meaning they are either foreigners or have a parent who is not a Korean citizen.  And while the school says it is difficult to know exactly what these students' nationalities are, most of them are believed to be Koryoins: ethnic Koreans typically hailing from countries in Central Asia. Amid a plummeting birth rate and associated labour shortages, South Korea is touting the settlement of Koryoins and other ethnic Koreans as a possible solution to the nation's population crisis. But discrimination, marginalisation, and the lack of a proper settlement programme are making it hard for many of them to integrate. Koryoins are descendants of ethnic Koreans who migrated to the far east of the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries - before many were forcibly transferred to Central Asia in the 1930s as part of Stalin’s “frontier-cleansing” policy.  They lived in former Soviet states such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and, over the generations, assimilated into those cultures and stopped speaking Korean, which was forbidden. South Korea started granting residency to Koryoins as well as ethnic Koreans in China after a landmark ruling by the country’s constitutional court in 2001. But the number of Koryoin migrants began growing rapidly from 2014 when they were allowed to bring their families into the country as well. Last year, about 760,000 ethnic Koreans from China and Russian-speaking countries were living in South Korea, making up about 30% of the country’s foreign population. Many have settled in cities like Asan, which have more factories and therefore greater job opportunities.  Ni Denis, who migrated to South Korea from Kazakhstan in 2018, is one of them.  “These days, I don’t see Koreans in the factory [where I work],” he says. “They think the job’s difficult, so they leave quickly. More than 80% of the people I work with are Koryoins.” It isn't only Koryoins, however, who are benefitting from the immigration boost. The influx of ethnic Koreans from abroad is also helping to address a severe labour shortage in a country whose population continues to shrink. South Korea has the world’s lowest fertility rate, which keeps dropping year on year. In 2023, the birth rate was 0.72 - far behind the 2.1 required to maintain a stable population in the absence of immigration. Estimates suggest that if this trend continues, South Korea’s population could halve by the year 2100. The country will need 894,000 more workers, especially in the service industry, to “achieve long-term economic growth projections” over the next decade, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Employment and Labour. Workers from overseas are helping to bridge the gap. “While the overseas Korean visa is often perceived as a form of support for ethnic Koreans, it has been primarily serving to provide stable labour for manufacturing,” says Choi Seori, a researcher at the Migration Research and Training Centre. Mr Lee, a recruiter in Asan who asked to be identified only by his surname, highlighted the workforce's dependence on immigration another way. ""Without Koryoins,"" he said. ""these factories wouldn’t run.""  Yet while immigration may be one solution to the country’s workforce problem, it comes with its own set of issues in this ethnically homogenous society. Language is one of them. “Korean kids only play with Koreans and Russian kids only play with Russians because they can’t communicate,” says 12-year-old student Kim Bobby. In an attempt to overcome the language barrier, Dunpo Elementary School runs a two-hour Korean class for foreign students every day. Even so, teacher Kim Eun-ju is worried that many children “hardly understand the lessons” as they move up grades. Academic competition in South Korea is notoriously rife and the school is losing local students, as parents worry their children’s education is being affected because lessons have to be conducted at a slower pace for Koryoins. The high school enrolment rate for multicultural students is already slightly lower than for locals, according to an official national survey conducted in 2021. Park Min-jung, a researcher at the Migration Research and Training Centre, worries that more Koryoin students will drop out of school if they don’t get the support they need. And language is not the only point of difference. Mr Ni says he has noticed that many of his Korean neighbours have moved out of their building. “Koreans seem to dislike having Koryoins as neighbours,” he says with an awkward laugh. “Sometimes Koreans ask us why we don't smile at them. It's just the way we are; it's not that we're angry.” He says there have been disputes between children in his neighbourhood, and he has heard of cases where Koryoin children have been “rough” during arguments. “After that, Korean parents tell their kids not to play with Koryoin kids. I think that’s how segregation happens.” “I am concerned about how Korea will be able to accept other immigrants,” says Seong Dong-gi, an expert of Koryoin at Inha University, explaining that there is already “significant resistance” to the influx of ethnic Koreans who “do not look different”. The population crisis should be a “catalyst for society to look at immigration differently”, says Ms Choi. “It’s time to think about how to integrate them”.  In 2023 there were roughly 2.5 million foreigners living in South Korea, which is also a popular destination for migrant workers from places such as Nepal, Cambodia and Vietnam. Most of them work in manual jobs, with only 13% in professional roles. “There is no clear plan for immigration at the national government level,"" says Lee Chang-won, the director of the Migration Research and Training Centre. ""Solving the country’s population problem with foreigners has been an afterthought."" Mr Lee adds that the current immigration policy is ""heavily weighted towards low-skilled workers"", leading to a “common view” that foreigners only work in South Korea for a while and then leave. As a result, he says, there has been little discussion about long-term settlement for all immigrants. According to current laws, the government is only required to provide support with things like vocational training for foreigners who marry locals. The same rights, however, are not extended to families entirely made up of foreigners.  Analysts say a new law for these families is urgently needed.  An Asan official, who requested anonymity, says it is difficult to secure funding for more supporting facilities for Koryoin families because there is no legal requirement to do so. But despite these challenges, Mr Ni says he has not regretted the decision to move to South Korea. He still gets a better living environment and higher wages here. “For my children, this is home,"" he says. ""When we visited Kazakhstan, they asked: ‘Why are we here? We want to go back to Korea.’”"

But with many having labelled the left-leaning politician as a strong frontrunner in the run-up to the poll, his win was not a massive surprise for Sri Lankans. The 55-year-old Dissanayake heads the National People’s Power (NPP) alliance, which includes his Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), or People's Liberation Front - a party that has traditionally backed strong state intervention and lower taxes, and campaigned for leftist economic policies. With his win, the island will see for the first time a government headed by a leader with a strong left-wing ideology. “It’s a vote for a change,” Harini Amarasuriya, a senior NPP leader and MP, told the BBC. “The result is a confirmation of what we have been campaigning for - like a drastic change from the existing political culture and the anti-corruption drive."" Dissanayake is expected to dissolve parliament and call parliamentary elections soon. It will be a challenge, however, for him to implement his coalition policies in a country that has adopted liberalisation and free-market principles from the late 1970s. The resounding victory of the NPP came following a wave of public anger over the devastating economic crisis in 2022, when Sri Lanka ground to a halt as inflation surged and its foreign reserves emptied. The country was unable to pay for imports of food, fuel and medicines and declared bankruptcy. An unprecedented public uprising against the government’s handling of the economy forced then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country in July 2022. Two months earlier, his elder brother and veteran leader Mahinda had been forced to resign as prime minister during the initial phase of the protest, known as “aragalaya” (struggle) in Sinhala. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over as president with the backing of the Rajapaksas' party. He stabilised the economy and negotiated a $2.9bn bailout package with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). For the millions of Sri Lankans who took to the streets, the political change was nothing but a transfer of power between established parties and political dynasties. The NPP and Dissanayake capitalised on this sentiment, as many in the country saw him as someone outside the old order. Though he was a minister briefly when the JVP became part of a coalition government during the presidency of Chandrika Kumaratunga in the early 2000s, Dissanayake's supporters say he is not tainted by corruption or cronyism charges. The question is how his presidency will tackle Sri Lanka's massive economic challenges. During his campaign he promised to lower taxes and utility bills. That means lower revenue for the government, and will go against some of the conditions set by the IMF loan. “We will work within the broad agreement that the IMF has reached within the current government,"" said Amarasuriya from the NPP. ""But we will negotiate certain details, particularly regarding the austerity measures.""  The election win is a remarkable turnaround for Dissanayake, who received just over 3% of votes in the 2019 presidential poll. But while he may have convinced a large section of voters this time, there are concerns over the political ideology of Dissanayake and his JVP, which is remembered for insurrections that led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people in the late 1980s. From 1987, the JVP spearheaded an armed revolt against the Sri Lankan government in what would come to be known as the ""season of terror"". The insurrectionist campaign, spurred by discontent among the youth of the rural lower and middle classes, precipitated a conflict marked by raids, assassinations and attacks against both political opponents and civilians. Dissanayake, who was elected to the JVP’s central committee in 1997 and became its leader in 2008, has since apologised for the party’s violence. But his victory at the polls raises questions as to what role the JVP might play in Sri Lankan politics going forward. “The JVP has a history of violence and there are concerns about the party’s position in a new government,” said Bhavani Fonseka, a senior researcher with the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) in Colombo. “I think Mr Dissanayake has softened the radical messaging during his public outreach. My question is, while he may have softened, what about the old guard of the JVP? Where do they situate themselves in a new government?” Another challenge for Dissanayake will be to reach out to the country’s Tamil minority, who have been seeking devolution of powers to the north and east and reconciliation since the end of a civil war in May 2009. That conflict, between the Tamil Tiger rebels and the Sri Lankan state, erupted in 1983. The Tigers eventually had vast areas under their control in their fight for an independent territory in the island's north and east, but were defeated and all but wiped out in a 2009 military offensive.  Fifteen years later, the Sri Lankan government's promises to share power and devolve their own political authority in Tamil-majority areas have largely failed to materialise. Though the votes for the NPP have increased in the north and the east, Tamils did not vote for Dissanayake overwhelmingly, reflecting concerns over the NPP’s policy towards their political demands. The UN Human Rights Commissioner’s office in Geneva has urged the new government to pursue an inclusive national vision for Sri Lanka that addresses the root causes of the ethnic conflict. The government “should undertake the fundamental constitutional and institutional reforms needed to strengthen democracy and the devolution of political authority and to advance accountability and reconciliation,” it said in its latest report. It’s not just about domestic policies, either. The rise of the NPP and JVP is being keenly watched in India and China, which are vying for influence in Sri Lanka. Both have loaned billions of dollars to Colombo. Dissanayake, with his Marxist leanings, is seen as ideologically closer to China. The JVP in the past had been critical of India’s policy towards Sri Lanka and opposed what it called Indian expansionism. During his campaign speech Dissanayake also promised to scrap a wind power project in the north funded by the Indian business tycoon Gautam Adani, who is believed to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Adani project’s costs should decrease, given its large scale, but it’s the opposite,"" Dissanayake said last week. ""This is clearly a corrupt deal, and we will definitely cancel it."" In any case, expectations are high among many ordinary Sri Lankans who have voted for change. “Whoever comes to power, they should reduce the prices of food, fuel and electricity. They also need to increase wages,"" said Colombo resident Sisira Padmasiri.  ""The new president should give some immediate relief to the public."" Experts point out that Sri Lanka will have to make further tough decisions on austerity measures to balance the books and meet its debt obligations. Once he takes over, Dissanayake will find out how far he can realistically fulfil the expectations of the people."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04n1kg1d4o,Trump and Harris are deadlocked - could an October surprise change the game?,"With one month to go, any unexpected event could help sway this close race for the White House.",6 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:59.395727,China News,BBC,China,"With one month to election day, the contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is the electoral equivalent of a bare-knuckle brawl. The race for the White House still appears deadlocked, both nationally and in battleground states, so victory will be decided by the slimmest of margins - every new voter engaged, every undecided voter swayed, could help land a knock-out punch. “In any super close race, where the electorate is divided down the middle, a difference of a percentage point or two could be decisive,” says David Greenberg, a presidential historian at Rutgers University. While party strategists are focused on how to earn that decisive edge, it could just as easily be an event out of their control, an unexpected twist, that upends the campaign in the final weeks. It’s already been a year of political shockwaves - from one candidate surviving two assassination attempts and being convicted of a crime, to another, President Joe Biden, dropping out of the race in favour of his much younger vice-president. However, when the surprises drop in October - think Trump’s Access Hollywood tape or Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2016 - there is scarcely time left to recover or regain momentum after a misstep or bad news cycle. This week alone, there were several new rumbles that could turn into political storms by 5 November. The first potential political storm was a literal one. Hurricane Helene tore through two key electoral battlegrounds last week, Georgia and North Carolina. Because of the intense focus on both states during this presidential race, a humanitarian disaster, with a death toll already over 200, has also become a political issue. Harris pledged long-term aid to the region at a stop in Georgia earlier this week, and visited those affected by the storm in North Carolina on Saturday. ""We're here for the long haul,"" she said in Georgia. Meanwhile, both states are essentially must-wins for Trump, and polls show a dead heat. While visiting Georgia, the former president claimed that Americans were losing out on emergency relief money because it had been spent on migrants. In fact, the two distinct programmes have separate budgets, and the Biden administration accused Republicans of spreading ""bold-faced lies"" about funding for the disaster response. When disaster strikes, it's not easy for the government to keep everyone happy. If Trump’s attacks land, any voter dissatisfaction with recovery efforts could potentially impact the result in two of the most closely-watched states in the country. Thousands of miles from the disaster-ravaged American southeast, a manmade crisis continues to inject itself into American politics. The Gaza war is in danger of expanding into a regional conflagration, as Israeli forces fought Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon and Iran launched hundreds of missiles at Israel earlier this week. While Harris has presented herself as a candidate of change, she put no distance between herself and the current administration when it comes to US-Israeli policies. That comes with risks. Hopes for any kind of pre-election ceasefire in Gaza appear firmly dashed, and the White House at this point is trying to ensure that the inevitable Israeli response to Tuesday’s Iranian strike doesn’t lead to all-out war. On Thursday night, Biden was not exactly reassuring. “I don’t believe there’s going to be an all-out war,” he said. “I think we can avoid it. But there’s a lot to do yet.” The war is also having consequences at home for Democrats, even if American voters usually don’t think directly about foreign policy when they cast their ballots. Harris’s commitment to continue supplying arms to Israel is a problem for two key segments of the Democratic base: Arab-Americans in the must-win state of Michigan, and young voters on campuses, where anti-war protests could start up again. The conflict in the Middle East has also fuelled pocketbook concerns. Biden’s mention of the possibility that Israel would target Iranian refineries caused the price of oil to jump more than 5% on Thursday. If there’s one thing that American consumers are particularly sensitive to, it's higher prices at the petrol pump. Across the board, public opinion surveys continue to show that the economy is the top issue for American voters. And Harris and the Democrats received some good news on that front on Friday, with the latest employment figures showing robust job growth over the past few months and an unemployment level that dropped to 4.1%. According to Mr Greenberg, however, voter concerns on the economy are about more than the latest job figures. “When people complain about the economy, what they’re really complaining about is the longer-term failure in certain parts of the country - rural America’s de-industrialised communities,” he says. “Those are parts of the country that are hurting even in a good economy.” For most of the election season, Trump has fared better than Harris when voters are asked who they think would do a better job with the economy, including in a recent CNN poll. But there are signs his lead may not be set in stone, such as a Cook Political Report survey of swing states that showed the two candidates tied on who would be best at dealing with inflation. One looming economic pitfall for Democrats also evaporated this week - the dockworkers strike, which had briefly shut down critical ports on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico for the first time in 50 years. Both parties agreed to return to the bargaining table in January, reopening the ports. If a work stoppage had continued, it could have disrupted supply chains and driven up consumer prices in the weeks before the election.  Meanwhile, undocumented crossings at the US-Mexico border have returned to pre-Covid pandemic levels, after hitting a record high of 249,741 last December. While the impact of that border surge is still being felt in many American cities, the urgency of the crisis may be diminishing. While much of this week’s news could spell trouble for Harris and the Democrats, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for Trump. His conduct during the 6 January attack on the US Capitol once again came into focus on Wednesday, when a federal judge released a document from special counsel Jack Smith outlining his case and evidence against Donald Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election result. The document, which argued that the former president should not be given presidential immunity from prosecution, contained new details about Trump’s words and actions leading up to the Capitol riot by his supporters. A recent CNN poll shows that voters favour Harris over Trump on issues of “protecting democracy” by 47% to 40% - so anything that renews attention on the chaotic final weeks of Trump’s presidency could be to the Democrat’s advantage. The term “October surprise” has been a fixture in American political lexicon for nearly 50 years. Campaigns dread the unexpected headline or crisis that pushes their candidates off message and changes the trajectory of a race. Even the smallest ripple in public opinion might deliver the White House in a year when the electoral margins in the swing states could be measured in only tens of thousands of votes. November’s balloting, says Mr Greenberg, is shaping up to be a nail-biter. “I don’t have any fingernails left,” he says. “I could totally imagine this election going either way with extremely significant consequences riding on that vote no matter where your loyalty is.” North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw5148zkzyo,Vance refuses to answer whether Trump lost 2020 election,The Republican dodged a question during the vice-presidential debate about the poll four years ago.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:59.497906,China News,BBC,China,"JD Vance has refused to say whether he thinks Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, and whether he would contest the 2024 vote if Democrats win next month. The Republican vice-presidential candidate - who has previously said he would have challenged the 2020 result if given the chance - avoided giving answers on both issues during Tuesday night's debate. In a head-to-head that was largely civilised in tone, he was accused by his Democratic opponent Tim Walz of ""a damning non-answer"" after sidestepping a question about that result and the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. Trump was seeking a second term then and has spent years making false claims about voter fraud during that poll. The exchange unfolded after the CBS News moderators asked Vance if he would try to challenge the results of November's election, even if every US state governor certified them - as was the case in 2020. Vance did not directly answer, instead saying he was ""focused on the future"". He sought to defend Trump over the riot during which President Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol building in an effort to stop Joe Biden becoming president. Vance said Trump had simply spoken of ""problems"" in 2020, and insisted that Trump had only said that ""protesters ought to protest peacefully"". Turning to the outcome of the 2024 vote, he said: ""If Tim Walz is the next vice-president, he'll have my prayers, he'll have my best wishes, and he'll have my help whenever he wants it."" But Walz persisted with the events of 2020 - challenging Vance to answer whether Trump had lost the poll. When Vance again sought to change the topic, Walz said: ""That is a damning non-answer."" Walz added that they were ""miles apart"" on the issue, despite agreeing on other things during their 90-minute debate. Other than one or two other tussles - including an exchange on immigration that led to the two men's microphones being muted - the debate was polite in tone.  Walz found himself under pressure from the moderators over past comments of his own - marking the latest occasion in which he has fallen foul of fact-checkers. He admitted that he ""misspoke"" when he claimed he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. News reports from the time show that he was actually in the US when the events took place in China. Tuesday's event in New York marked the first and only scheduled head-to-head between the pair. Polling by CBS News immediately afterwards suggested that 42% of viewers felt Vance won the debate, compared to 41% who thought Walz came out on top. Some 17% called the debate a tie.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2439n8mr31o,'I'm a capitalist' says Harris in economic pitch to voters,"Harris is seeking to chip away at Donald Trump's advantage with voters on the economy, a key election issue.",26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:59.597785,China News,BBC,China,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris, seeking to sharpen her economic message, pledged to usher in new investments in domestic manufacturing across a range of industries if elected to the White House in November. In a speech in the must-win state of Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Harris cast herself as ""a capitalist"" with a pragmatic approach to boosting the middle class. An hour before the speech, her Republican rival Donald Trump touted his own economic agenda - including a 15% made-in-America tax proposal - while visiting North Carolina.   Both candidates are campaigning in battleground states this week on their competing visions for the economy, a key issue that voters say is a top priority in casting a ballot. In a tacit rebuttal to Republican claims that she supports ""communist"" policies, Harris described herself as ""a capitalist"".  ""I promise you I will be pragmatic in my approach,"" she said at an event hosted by The Economic Club of Pittsburgh. Building on her vision for an ""opportunity economy"", Harris laid out new proposals to help young families, first time homebuyers and the elderly through $100bn worth in tax breaks and financial incentives. She vowed new investments in artifical intelligence, aerospace and energy development. Harris added, however, that tax rates for large corporations and the wealthiest Americans must rise so they ""pay their fair share"". She also promised to reform permitting to speed up building in the US, eliminate college degree requirements for federal jobs and increase union apprenticeships, if elected. “I intend to chart a new way forward and grow America’s middle class” she argued, while Trump has “no intention to grow our middle class — he’s only interested in making life better for himself and people like himself”. Later in her first major solo interview with MSNBC, Harris lambasted Trump, saying he ""isn't very serious"" on his tariff proposals and ""constantly got played by China"". “You don’t just throw around the idea of tariffs across the board,"" she said. ""He’s just not serious about very many of these issues."" Harris also pushed back for the first time on the Trump campaign's claim that she is lying about having worked at McDonald's as a university student. ""Part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald's is because there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family,"" she said. ""I worked there as a student."" Harris's remarks came as she is seeking to chip away at Trump's advantage with voters on his handling of the economy.  Though the race remains close, Harris has opened up a narrow lead in national polling since the two candidates met on a debate stage earlier this month. At a campaign event in Mint Hill, North Carolina, Trump defended his tariff proposals and suggested they were the reason ""people in [other] countries want to kill me"". “I’m imposing tariffs on your competition from foreign countries, all these foreign countries that have ripped us off, which stole all of your businesses and all of your jobs years ago,” he said. He reminded supporters that, as president, he had passed the largest corporate tax cut in US history, from 35% to 21%. The centrepiece of his second term, he said, would be a ""manufacturing renaissance"" ushered in by a 15% tax rate for products made in America. The economy routinely emerges as the top issue for voters this November and both candidates have touted populist policies, with Harris appearing to mirror a Trump proposal to end taxation on service workers' tips. In her sitdown with MSNBC, Harris said that ""Donald Trump has a history of taking care of rich people"". ""I'm not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share,"" she added, arguing that Trump advocates ""tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country"". ""My perspective on the economy is when you grow the middle class, America’s economy is stronger, and there’s empirical evidence to prove my point correct."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm29x5ke9jdo,Tesla shares slide after Cybercab robotaxi revealed,Elon Musk revealed a prototype of the long-awaited robotaxi at a Hollywood film studio - but investors aren't wowed.,4 days ago,2024-10-15 10:33:59.697928,China News,BBC,China,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has unveiled the firm's long-awaited robotaxi, the Cybercab, at the Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California. The futuristic-looking vehicle, featuring two wing-like doors - and no pedals or steering wheel - deposited Mr Musk in front of an audience eager to hear details about a project he considers key to Tesla's next chapter.    At the event, billed ""We, Robot,"" the multi-billionaire reiterated his view that fully self-driving vehicles will be safer than those operated by humans and could even earn owners money by being rented out for rides. However, investors have so far not shared his enthusiasm - Tesla's share price fell after markets opened in the US on Friday morning. The value of its stock was down more than eight percent, trading at around $219, at 11:45 Eastern Time (16:45 BST). Meanwhile shares in ride-hailing rivals Uber and Lyft - which have their own autonomous ambitions - were each trading up to 10% higher. Questions are being asked about Mr Musk's prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time ""before 2027"", given his track record of failing to meet his own deadlines. ""I tend to be optimistic with time frames,"" he quipped during the event. He said the Cybercab - which would compete with rivals including Alphabet-owned Waymo - would cost less than $30,000 (£23,000). However analysts have cast doubt on how realistic that plan is. ""It will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timescale,"" said Paul Miller, from research Forrester. ""Without external subsidies, or Tesla making a loss on every vehicle, it doesn't seem plausible to launch at anything close to that price this decade,"" he added. Mr Musk also said he expected to see ""fully autonomous unsupervised"" technology available in Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y in Texas and California next year ""with permission where ever regulators approve it."" But that approval is far from guaranteed. ""It is a big chunk of metal driving on roads at high speeds, so safety concerns are big,"" said Samitha Samaranayake, an associate professor in engineering at Cornell University. Tesla's self-driving ambitions rely on cameras that are cheaper than radar and Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors that are the technology backbone of many competitors' vehicles. By teaching its cars to drive, Tesla plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) trained by the raw data it collects from its millions of vehicles. But the research community ""is not sold on whether the Tesla style of doing things can give the safety guarantees that we would like,"" Mr Samaranayake said. The cybercab project has undergone delays, having originally been due for release in August. This summer, in a post on X , formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said the wait was due to design changes he felt were important. Meanwhile, competing robotaxis are already operating on some US roads. Tesla also seems poised to post its first ever decline in annual sales as competitors pile into the electric vehicle market, even as sales have softened. Despite that dour backdrop, Tuesday's event was heavy on spectacle - complete with Tesla's humanoid robots dancing and serving drinks to attendees. Mr Musk also unveiled another prototype for a ""Robovan"" which can ferry up to 20 passengers around at a time. The sleek shuttle ""could be a mode of transportation over the coming years that Tesla leverages,"" said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives who attended the event in person. Another analyst said the event felt like a step back into memory lane while also signalling the path ahead. ""Musk did a fantastic job of painting an ideal future for transportation that promises to both free up our time and increase safety,"" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds. But despite the showmanship, there are doubts about whether he can deliver the vision he sketched out. ""Many questions remain about how this will be achieved from a practical standpoint,"" Caldwell added. The deployment of robotaxis has encountered setbacks, with driverless cars operated by General Motors subsidiary Cruise being suspended in San Francisco after a pedestrian was knocked down. But the sector continues to expand.  Waymo said in early October it would add the Hyundai Ioniq 5 to its robotaxi fleet after the vehicles undergo on-road testing with the company's technology. Ride-hailing giant Uber also wants to add more autonomous vehicles to its fleet to expand on its delivery and ridesharing options for customers. It announced a multi-year alliance with driverless car developer Cruise in August. Chinese tech company Baidu is also reportedly looking to expand its robotaxi division, Apollo Go, beyond China - where the vehicles are active in several cities. Additional reporting by Liv McMahon"

Ranked 10th in the world junior rankings after progress to this season's US Open semi-finals, the early signs are promising for the 17-year-old Dundonian as he tells BBC Scotland: ""You have got to dream big."" Like many a talented young athlete, Robertson ""would do so many different sports"" - trying his hand at rugby, football and golf. More surprising perhaps is his revelation that: ""I actually did a bit of dancing when I was younger as well - street dance."" Fearnley set for top 100 after fourth title of 2024 'No idea if I would play' - how Kartal's success followed health scare Ideal preparation considering, from split-step to hops and slides, good footwork is one of the most important parts of the armoury of top tennis players. ""I love to dance and that is my personality,"" Robertson says. ""If music is on in the gym or whatever during tennis, I always like to dance."" However, like Murray, Robertson is leaving thoughts of Strictly Come Dancing to the former world number one's mother, Judy, and dedicating his life to hitting a tennis ball.  ""I think my first couple of classes were at Arbroath Tennis club,"" he recalls. ""I have a brother and sister, I am the youngest, and I just got brought to all their sports classes. ""I actually wasn't old enough for the tennis classes, but I was just brought along and I just started hitting off the tennis wall when I was really little."" Finally allowed into class, because he turned out to be ""pretty good"" despite still being ""too young"", he quickly caught the tennis bug. ""And seeing Andy at that point was doing so well also, winning Wimbledon and stuff like that, I just found it really exciting and have just loved it since then,"" he says. Robertson's profile soared earlier this month when he reached the semi-finals of the US Open Juniors in New York. He would lose in straight sets to top seed and beaten finalist Nicolai Budkov Kjaer of Norway, but it sparked the inevitable comparisons with Murray, who had won the event two decades earlier. ""Andy helps me,"" he reveals. ""We started our relationship from the grass season. He is just an amazing role model for me and he has been a great help to my game. ""He was still playing at that point, so I was hitting with him and felt I could ask him questions and he would give his honest advice, which was really helpful, and to hear it from Andy Murray means a lot."" Charlie Robertson also reached the semi-finals of Junior Wimbledon this year That close-up experience - and having watched Murray's Grand Slam successes from afar - has fuelled Robertson's belief that he can ""become as good as him if not better"". The Scot, who was raised in Forfar, will be aiming to further add to his own growing reputation at the ITF World Tennis Tour Junior Finals in China in the middle of October, by which time he will have turned 18. Then, from January, he will begin his professional journey in the senior ranks in which fellow Scotsman Jake Fearnley has just broken into the world top 100. ""I have to restart again in the men's circuit - my 10th in the world in the juniors will not mean anything anymore and I will have to restart again, which is exciting,"" Robertson says. ""The ultimate goal is to be a top 100 ATP player. Going into the pro circuit, now that is everyone's goal and I think, as soon as you get to that top 100, you want to push for even more. ""Everyone wants to be number one in the world - why not? You have got to dream big, so that is the goal."" While the ambition is clear, Robertson accepts that taking the first few big steps towards it will not be cheap on the Futures and Challengers tour merry-go-round. ""It is definitely not a cheap sport, tennis,"" he says. ""I guess it brings you to reality, but this is my decision to do it and I have just got to believe in myself that I can make a living out of tennis, which is what I dreamed about when I was a little kid. ""When you are playing these Futures and Challengers, you are giving out more than you are bringing in. It is going to be very challenging, but getting support is going to be key to reaching the top. ""I see it as an exciting journey now, but I know it is not going to be easy.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75n4v392wyo,Farmers and students star in China's viral new football league,The Guizhou Village Super League is a small football festival that has grown in popularity in China,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:33:59.918177,China News,BBC,China,"It is a hot night and thousands of fans have packed into Rongjiang’s football ground for the final of the Guizhou Village Super League. Dongmen village is up against Dangxiang village in the climax of this hyper rowdy, very local competition. This small, weekly, village football festival has become a viral sensation in China, as images have spread across social media of fans dressed in traditional ethnic costume, banging drums and cheering on the players who might be farmers, students or shopkeepers.  And these videos have inspired tens of thousands of people from across the country to experience it for themselves on any given weekend. Watching the matches in the village league is free but it is quite a hike to get here, a three-hour drive into the mountains from the provincial capital Guiyang. Yet millions of Chinese tourists have made the trek over the last 12 months, to soak up the atmosphere, boosting tourist industry revenue by nearly 75%, according to official figures quoted by state-run media. The accommodation available is basically small hotels which are often fully booked when the big games are on. It’s the ultimate underdog story. This is an area which was one of the last parts of China to be officially declared free of ""extreme poverty"".  Five years ago its average annual disposable income was just $1,350 in rural areas. Now, this newly organised league - only in its second year - has attracted so much fame it is transforming the place. The players can’t quite believe it. “We’re not professional footballers. We just love footy,” says Shen Yang.  “Even if there was no Village Super League, we’d play every week. Without football, I’d feel like life had lost its colour.” Shen is a 32-year-old hospital maintenance worker who’s just come off an all-night shift, but, on the field, he is one of the main attacking weapons for Dongmen village. He says his parents hated him playing football when he was a kid but now they’re total converts.  “They didn’t let me play. They threw away my trainers. But now they’ve set up a stall at the gate to the stadium selling ice creams,” he laughs. Shen’s parents are not the only small business owners who have benefited from the economic boost this competition has brought to the area. It is not as if everyone has suddenly become rich, but this sporting carnival has definitely brought earning opportunities for those running little family hotels, restaurants and street stalls. Dong Yongheng, a player whose Zhongcheng village was in the final last year, is among those who have benefited from the tournament way beyond his experience on the pitch. The former construction worker has turned footballing limelight into family business success. The 35-year-old once worked in his auntie’s modest shop preparing rice rolls, a famous Rongjiang street snack.  Now he has opened his own, multi-story restaurant. It even has a shop attached to it selling his team’s football jerseys and other memorabilia. “I think people like the authenticity of the village league,” he tells the BBC. “It is really not because of our sporting skills. They like seeing a genuine performance, whether it is by our cheerleading ethnic singers or our players. Tourists love real and original things.” The government says that more than 4,000 new businesses have registered in the region since the competition started last year, creating thousands of new jobs in the poor farming community. That some fans dress up in traditional clothing to cheer on their village team has definitely given this tournament a unique flavour. In the hours before the final, Pan Wenge’s silver headdress jingles and jangles as she speaks enthusiastically, preparing to cheer on Dongmen village. “When we watch the game, it’s so exciting. We’re really nervous, you feel your heart pumping. And, when we win, we’re so happy. We sing and dance.” But standing in Dongmen’s way is the younger, faster Dangxiang village team. Their star striker, Lu Jinfu, the son of itinerant labourers, has just finished high school. With a shy smile he acknowledges the attention of local kids wanting to take selfies with him. “When I started playing I didn’t expect it to be like this. I didn’t expect us to have such an amazing football atmosphere,” he says. On the night, his team are indeed too good for Dongmen. Lu scores twice and, after the full-time whistle, the winning team spray each other with soft drinks in celebration. But the losers don’t go home empty-handed. “We won two pigs. That’s not bad,” Shen Yang says with a cheeky smile. And, at their party afterwards, you would not think they were the runners-up. There is much eating and drinking in an outdoor banquet down the main street of Dongmen village. The players get hugs and kisses from their neighbours they refer to as ""aunties"". Win, lose, or draw, they’re still seen as heroes. And, after all, there is always next year."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gr0p1000go,How friends became foes in Africa's diamond state,"Why ex-President Ian Khama, son of the first head of state, is engaged in a row with the current leader.",6 days ago,2024-10-15 10:34:00.148912,China News,BBC,China,"Ian Khama’s well-mannered voice barely disguises the anger that he feels. In several interviews that Botswana’s former president has given since 2019, when he began to express dissatisfaction with his hand-picked successor, Mokgweetsi Masisi, he has talked about him in damning terms. Masisi was “drunk on power”, Khama told the BBC’s Focus on Africa programme five years ago. Since then the 71-year-old has gone into exile, spoken about a plot to poison him and been charged in Botswana with several crimes including money laundering and owning illegal firearms. Having previously dismissed the charges as being “fabricated”, last month he returned home and appeared in court for an initial hearing. The tension between Khama and Masisi is likely to colour the diamond-rich country's imminent general election - just three weeks away - as the former president is actively campaigning for an opposition party. At a further, brief, court appearance on Tuesday, Khama was all smiles. The authorities are now believed to be considering if the case should proceed. There is a strong possibility that things will come to a halt as Khama’s co-accused are no longer facing the charges. But the court will not reconvene until a month after the election. To the outsider, who might have the general feeling that Botswana is one of the continent’s most stable democracies with strong institutions, this dispute between the current and former presidents may seem surprising. The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has governed since independence from the UK in 1966. In a constituency-based system, it has dominated parliament for the last five decades though its share of the vote in recent elections has hovered around 50%. The country’s first president, and Khama’s father, Sir Seretse Khama, was descended from royalty and helped cement Botswana’s reputation for orderly government in the 14 years he was in power up to his death in 1980. His 1948 marriage to a white British woman, Ruth Williams, was controversial and led to his exile in the UK. Ian Khama, the couple’s second child, likened his own recent time in South Africa to that of his father’s period away from Botswana. After having been in the military, he went on to become president in 2008, serving for 10 years. Despite the dynastic appeal, the shine came off Khama’s government and in the 2014 election the BDP won less than 50% of the vote for the first time. Concerns about corruption, human rights and the state of the economy - with high levels of unemployment - all dented Khama’s popularity. In the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, funded by Sudanese telecoms mogul Mo Ibrahim, Botswana’s score dropped during his period in power. The country’s huge diamond reserves have proved lucrative and seen the economy grow, but not enough jobs were being created for the young population and the wealth was not being spread around. In 2018, Khama handed over the reins of power to his loyal vice-president, Masisi, perhaps hoping that he could still have some influence, but things soon went awry. One theory is that there was a gentleman’s agreement that Masisi would appoint Khama’s brother, Tshekedi, as vice-president, which he refused to do. Khama began complaining that his security detail was being cut and that democracy within the BDP was being undermined. Masisi also reversed some key policies such as a ban on trophy hunting and ended the scepticism towards having closer relations with China. A year after stepping down as president, Khama then joined the newly formed opposition Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) telling the BBC at the time that the “democracy that we’ve been proud of in this country is now in decline”. He then went into self-imposed exile in late 2021 alleging that there were threats to his life. Masisi has batted away the criticism and earlier this year described the poisoning allegation as “shocking”. “If you look at the history of either killings or murders in Botswana and the methods used, poisoning  is not one of the ones we know best, but of late he [Khama] seems to be an expert,” Masisi told France 24, adding that the former president had nothing to fear. Masisi also said that the arguments Khama has been using against the government and his leadership have been “a litany of inconsistencies”. There is absolutely no chance of reconciliation between the former allies, and Khama is hoping to end the 58 years in power of the BDP - the party his father helped found. There are opportunities to take votes from the government as the problems with the lack of jobs and the accusations of corruption have also dogged the current administration. Furthermore, the former president still commands a lot of respect in the country, especially among the older voters and in his home area around Serowe, where he is paramount chief and where the BPF launched its manifesto at the weekend. But Masisi and the BDP remain in a strong position, especially as the opposition is divided.  The 30 October poll offers an opportunity for the Khama dynasty to once again have an impact on the future of the country. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Federal investigators searched Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence, on Thursday morning, hours before prosecutors were expected to reveal details of the indictment.  Adams, 64, was elected to lead the most populous US city nearly three years ago on a promise to rein in crime. But he and a string of top officials in his orbit have faced growing scrutiny as part of multiple federal corruption probes, including whether his campaign received illegal foreign donations from Turkey.  The exact charges will not be known until the indictment is unsealed. Adams would become the first mayor in New York City's history to be charged while in office. He released a video statement late on Wednesday where he vowed to fight the charges and remain in office, asking New York residents for both ""prayers and patience"".  ""I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit,"" he says in the video, adding ""I am innocent"" and he plans to request an ""immediate trial so New Yorkers can hear the truth"".  He also took on the flurry of calls for him to resign.  ""Now, if I am charged many may say I should resign because I cannot manage the city while fighting the case.  ""I can also understand how everyday New Yorkers would be concerned that I cannot do my job while I face accusations, but I have been facing these lies for months.""  Federal prosecutors are expected to unseal the indictment on Thursday, when Adams will make an initial court appearance, CBS News reports. The reported charges come less than a year after federal agents seized Adams' electronic devices and searched the home of Brianna Suggs, his chief fundraiser. It was later revealed that the US attorney's office in Manhattan was looking into whether Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign team conspired with the government of Turkey to funnel illegal donations into the campaign. The New York Times reported on Monday that prosecutors subpoenaed the campaign and the mayor's office for information related to five other countries: Israel, China, Qatar, South Korea and Uzbekistan. Adams has remained steadfast that he would remain in office even as a growing list of officials have called for his resignation. Earlier Wednesday, US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - a popular figure in left-leaning New York - joined that list.

Ocasio-Cortez referenced a recent ""flood of resignations and vacancies"" that she said were threatening city government's ability to function.  Adams's reported indictment comes weeks after federal agents seized electronic devices belonging to three people closely affiliated with him - schools chancellor David Banks, his brother Deputy Mayor Phil Banks, and his fiancée Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright. In a surprise announcement on Tuesday, David Banks announced he would be stepping down from his role at the end of the year. The US attorney’s office in Manhattan is investigating another Banks brother, Terence, over a possible bribery scheme involving his consulting firm and city contracts. Prosecutors in that office are also looking into bribery claims against the twin brother of former New York Police Commissioner Edward Caban, who resigned earlier this month weeks after his phone was seized by federal agents. Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Donlon had his own homes searched last Friday. In the past two weeks, the mayor’s chief legal counsel and the city health commissioner have also stepped down. Adams, who is only the second black person to run New York City, is facing a growing list of Democratic challengers ahead of his re-election bid next year. New York’s Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, a close ally who has yet to comment on the indictment, has the power to remove Adams from office. If Adams’ tenure ends prematurely, Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, is next in line to become the city’s acting mayor."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lw0081e1yo,Sweden blames Iran for cyber-attack after Quran burnings,"Sweden's security service says 15,000 messages were sent after several Quran-burning incidents.",24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:11.362010,China News,BBC,China,"Sweden's security service Sapo has accused Iranian intelligence of hacking into a text messaging service to send 15,000 messages to Swedes. Sapo said the data breach in summer last year involved SMS messages calling for ""revenge against Quran-burners"", after several anti-Islam activists set fire to copies of the Islamic holy book. Iran's embassy in Stockholm has rejected the accusations, calling them ""baseless"" and harmful to the two countries' relations. But Sweden says investigators found a cyber group called Anzu, acting for Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), that had sought to create division in society and paint Sweden as an Islamophobic country. Sweden's government condemned the Quran burnings at the time and police tried to ban them, but they were allowed by the courts under freedom of expression laws. The incidents led to outrage in several Muslim-majority countries, and Sweden's embassy in Iraq was set alight by protesters. Last month, Swedish prosecutors charged an Iraqi activist and an accomplice with incitement against an ethnic group in connection with the book-burnings. Both men deny wrongdoing. According to a preliminary investigation led by prosecutors, the Anzu group were said to have hacked into a Swedish company's SMS-service and taken over passwords, usernames and other tools at the end of July 2023, before sending a message to private individuals on 1 August that ""those who insulted the Quran must be punished for their work"". Fredrik Hallstrom of Sapo told the Dagens Nyheter website that a number of people involved in the operation were linked to the Revolutionary Guards and that the text messages had partially succeeded in adding further fuel to the threat against Sweden. Prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said that investigators had succeeded in identifying the Iranian hackers' identities, but that there was no way they could be extradited and their preliminary inquiry had been shelved. The security service warned that foreign powers such as Iran were seizing on opportunities to create division and bolster their own regimes. Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said in a statement that it was very serious that a state actor such as Iran was aiming to ""destabilise Sweden or increase polarisation in our country"". This is not the first time that Sweden's security service has accused Iran's government of carrying out hostile acts on its territory. Last May Sapo said Tehran had used criminal networks in Sweden to carry out violent acts against other states, groups or individuals in Sweden that Iran considered a threat. It identified Iran, alongside Russia and China, as posing the greatest security threats to Sweden."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yjej0rvw0o,Putin proposes new rules for using nuclear weapons,Russia's leader says strikes by a non-nuclear state aided by a nuclear power can be considered a joint attack,26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:11.473144,China News,BBC,China,"Vladimir Putin says Russia would consider an attack from a non-nuclear state that was backed by a nuclear-armed one to be a ""joint attack"", in what could be construed as a threat to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. In key remarks on Wednesday night, the Russian president said his government was considering changing the rules and preconditions around which Russia would use its nuclear arsenal. Ukraine is a non-nuclear state that receives military support from the US and other nuclear-armed countries. His comments come as Kyiv seeks approval to use long-range Western missiles against military sites in Russia. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has travelled to the US this week and is due to meet US President Joe Biden in Washington on Thursday, where Kyiv's request is expected to be top of the agenda. Ukraine has pushed into Russian territory this year and wants to target bases inside Russia which it says are sending missiles into Ukraine. Responding to Putin's remarks, Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said Russia ""no longer has anything other than nuclear blackmail to intimidate the world"". Putin has threatened the use of nuclear weapons before. Ukraine has criticised it as  ""nuclear sabre-rattling"" to deter its allies from providing further support.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the comments as ""totally irresponsible"" in an MSNBC television interview. Russian ally China has also called for calm, with reports President Xi Jinping has warned Putin against using nuclear arms. But on Wednesday, after a meeting with his Security Council, Putin announced the proposed radical expansion. A new nuclear doctrine would ""clearly set the conditions for Russia to transition to using nuclear weapons,"" he warned - and said such scenarios included conventional missile strikes against Moscow. He said that Russia would consider such a ""possibility"" of using nuclear weapons if it detected the start of a massive launch of missiles, aircraft and drones into its territory, which presented a ""critical threat"" to the country's sovereignty. He added: ""It is proposed that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation."" The country's nuclear arms were ""the most important guarantee of security of our state and its citizens"", the Kremlin leader said. Since the end of World War Two, nuclear-armed states have engaged in a policy of deterrence, which is based on the idea that if warring states were to launch major nuclear strikes it would lead to mutually assured destruction. But there are also tactical nuclear weapons which are smaller warheads designed to destroy targets without widespread radioactive fallout. In June, Putin delivered a warning to European countries supporting Ukraine, saying Russia had “many more [tactical nuclear weapons] than there are on the European continent, even if the United States brings theirs over.” “Europe does not have a developed [early warning system],” he added. “In this sense they are more or less defenceless.” At the time he had hinted of changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine - the document which sets out the conditions under which Moscow would use nuclear weapons. The Kremlin said on Thursday that changes outlined by Putin should be considered a warning to the West. Elaborating on the move, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""It must be considered a specific signal - a signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they participate in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear."" Peskov said that Russia would make a decision on whether not to publish the updated nuclear documents, adding that adjustments to the document on state nuclear deterrence were being formulated."

To adapt to more destructive hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones, we need to know how they're changing.",6 days ago,2024-10-15 10:34:11.606327,China News,BBC,China,"The behaviour of the world's most powerful storms is evolving. To adapt to more destructive hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones, we need to know how they're changing. Fuelled by heat from ocean waters, hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones are sometimes known as nature's steam engines. As they barrel over the oceans, they turn its heat into brutal kinetic energy that flattens islands and inundates coastal cities, taking months of urgent repair work to heal. Ocean temperatures are now breaking all records, and these ""engines"" are responding accordingly, cutting different paths across the ocean, slowing down, and becoming less predictable and more dangerous.  Now there's a race to understand exactly how hurricanes are rewriting the rules and patterns we've seen before, in the hope of learning how we can adapt. There's a distinct seasonal cycle to hurricanes in the Atlantic, with very few or none at all in winter, and a peak in September. A strong, early start to the hurricane season is in line with what we would expect with climate change, says James Kossin, a climate and atmospheric scientist retired from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). Hurricane Milton Barely two weeks after major Hurricane Helene inundated the US, another major hurricane is poised to make landfall.  Hurricane Milton intensified ""explosively"", fuelled by warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, reaching category five strength on 7 October before weakening to a category four. The storm is due to make landfall along the west-central coast of Florida late Wednesday or early Thursday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. Follow BBC News' live coverage of the storm. ""Hurricanes themselves just respond to the environment that they're sitting in,"" Kossin says. ""And so if you make the environment in June look like the environment that would normally be in August or September, then the hurricanes will simply behave as though it's August or September. They don't have a calendar."" The extraordinarily warm ocean conditions we're seeing now are driven by climate change, though there are other factors that have made this an active season, such as the present transition from El Nino to La Nina, which tends to boost storm activity. ""In a warming climate, we would expect the waters to be at the warmth that we need for hurricane earlier in the year,"" says Kristen Corbosiero, associate professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany in New York. ""So it's certainly possible that we will see earlier seasons and longer hurricane seasons moving forward."" While the intense early start to the 2024 season with Hurricane Beryl is in line with what climate scientists might expect to see with climate change, it's too early to observe a consistent shift in the season. ""[It's] not something that appears clearly in the data yet,"" says Suzana Camargo, professor of ocean and climate physics at Columbia University. 'Shear is death'  One of the strongest storms to form recently in the Atlantic did so under conditions that ought to have prevented a hurricane from forming, says Hugh Willoughby, research professor in earth and environment at Florida International University. In September 2023, at the peak of the Atlantic season, Hurricane Lee rapidly intensified into a category five storm. At the time, an El Niño was in effect, which generally has a stifling effect on storms in the Atlantic due to greater wind shear and atmospheric stability. ""Shear is death for hurricanes,"" says Willoughby. Vertical wind shear is the change in wind speed and direction at different heights – high wind shear disturbs the structure of a hurricane. ""Imagine you've got a turbine engine – shear knocks some of the blades out,"" says Willoughby. So for a category five like Hurricane Lee to form despite considerable shear came as ""a nasty surprise"". The extraordinary ocean warmth in September 2023 may have somehow overwhelmed the influence of shear, says Willoughby, though it's not entirely clear why. ""We, the theoreticians, need to think about that."" The vast majority of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic don't reach their potential, says Willoughby. In the relatively tight constraints of the Atlantic Basin a storm will often make landfall before it reaches peak intensity, or it will run into high wind shear, which helps dissipate the storm. ""But when everything goes right it'll intensify rapidly and reach its maximum potential intensity, which is defined by the ocean surface temperature below the hurricane,"" says Willoughby. There is ""a heck of a lot of evidence"" that intensification rates are increasing as oceans get hotter, providing more fuel to the storms, says Kossin. ""It all comes down to the amount of fuel available,"" he says. ""It's kind of like changing the jets in a carburettor. You change the jets to allow for more fuel to come in and mix with the air, you're going to get more horsepower. You're going to be able to go from zero to 60 faster. And that's your intensification."" The peak intensity of hurricanes has also been rising with climate change. In a 2020 study, Kossin found the intensity of storms between 1979 and 2017 increased by about 6% per decade. Storms are now 25% more likely than they were 40 years ago to reach the threshold of 111 mph (180km/h) required to be classified as a major hurricane. Overall, the proportion of tropical cyclones of category three or more is likely increasing, according to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). ""The ocean temperature defines the maximum intensity the hurricane can reach,"" says Willoughby. In May 2024, a BBC analysis found the world's ocean temperatures had broken records every single day for the preceding year. Even as the wind speeds within a hurricane speed up, the movement of hurricanes along their paths over ocean and land is slowing down. In a 2018 study, Kossin found that hurricanes near the US have slowed by around 17% since the beginning of the 20th Century. Tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific slowed down by as much as 20%. It's thought that the reason for the slowdown is the uneven way that climate change is heating the globe, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the world. As a result, the difference in temperature between the Arctic and the tropics is narrowing. ""It's that temperature gradient that drives the winds,"" says Kossin. ""The stronger the gradient, the stronger the winds."" You can think of hurricanes like a cork in a stream, he says. ""They just go where the wind takes them."" And if you slow down the winds, you're going to slow down the storms as they move along their path.    A slow-moving hurricane has more time to dump rain in a given location – think of the difference between passing a garden hose quickly over a flowerbed or holding it in place for longer. One particularly slow-moving category one storm, Hurricane Debby, was forecast to bring as much as 30in (76cm) of rain and catastrophic flooding as it swept north from Florida's Gulf Coast on 5 August 2024 into Georgia and South Carolina. ""What really is going to give you a lot of rain is when you slow these [storms] down,"" says Kossin. ""When they stop, or what we call 'stall out', it's just devastating because you get inundated for days."" Typhoon Bebinca On the morning of 16 September, powerful Typhoon Bebinca made landfall near Shanghai, China. The typhoon was the most powerful storm the city has seen in 75 years, according to Chinese state media. Hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated in advance of the arrival of the storm. Read Nick Marsh's story for BBC News. The damage caused by wind, too, increases with its duration – the longer it blows against structures, the more likely it will knock them over. ""It's just bad having a hurricane stick around very long,"" Kossin says. ""You want it to get out of your neighbourhood."" There's also the fact that warmer air can hold more moisture – around 7% more per degree Celsius, which means hurricanes can become even wetter. As climate change increases temperatures, that extra moisture makes a difference – but the effect is small compared with the difference made by a hurricane that's stalling out, says Kossin. For this reason, Kossin says he sees this slowdown as the most dangerous of all the ways climate change is altering hurricanes. ""That's a really big deal."" As well as very high temperatures at the uppermost layer of the ocean, things get worse when the layers below start to warm up too. If the upper warm layer is shallow then as the hurricane passes over, cooler water from below gets churned up and mixes in, says Corbosiero, cooling the surface water down. ""But if that warm water extends to a deeper layer as the hurricane goes by and churns up the water, the [surface] water is still warm,"" says Corbosiero, allowing the storm to continue with force. These are conditions that we're seeing in the Atlantic. ""In addition to warm surface waters, we also have very deep warm waters right now,"" she says. ""So [hurricanes] are able to intensify faster and not stop intensifying because they're not encountering cold water."" There's a danger of getting tunnel vision when considering the ways hurricanes are changing, says Kossin, with the focus on strength and intensification. ""People don't talk about track enough,"" he says. ""And I think that it's by far more dangerous."" In a 2014 paper, Kossin and colleagues found that in the northern hemisphere, storms had moved north by 53km (33 miles) per decade. In the southern hemisphere, they had moved south at 62km (39 miles) per decade. In all, the hurricanes were moving about one degree of latitude away from the tropics per decade. This could expose communities to extreme storms in regions previously unused to them. Kossin points to the migration of tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific, where he has measured a slight decrease in risk around the Philippines, but an increase to the north near Japan. ""The Philippines experiences [cyclones] all the time, so they're somewhat adapted to it. Japan experiences them, but not all the time,"" says Kossin. ""So now we're saying that they're going to start seeing stronger storms reaching them than before. The effect that that has on risk is really substantial."" Climate change is also altering the patterns of wind shear over the Atlantic. ""There's a pattern of wind shear that is sort of like two bullseyes,"" says Kossin. One elongated bullseye sits in the Main Development Region (MDR), a strip of the tropics hurricanes move through and intensify in. The second bullseye is just off the east coast of Florida, extending up to the Carolinas. ""Those two have a kind of a seesawing effect,"" says Kossin. ""When the shear is high in the MDR it tends to be low off of the coast there, and vice versa."" The shear in the MDR is linked to sea surface temperatures – warmer waters here generally means less shear. In turn, that often means greater shear off the US coast – resulting in a shield of messy winds that acts as an ""intensification barrier"", as Kossin discovered in 2017. While this barrier unfortunately does nothing to weaken storms as they hit communities in the Caribbean, it does offer the US some protection. ""So when the conditions are conducive for lots of storms forming and intensifying in the MDR, as they approach the US, they run into this higher shear and it tends to weaken them,"" says Kossin. ""Fortunately, for now."" But this protective barrier does not appear to be a permanent fixture. In a paper authored by Kossin and Camargo and colleagues at Columbia University, the researchers looked at what the future might hold for this barrier.   ""Sure enough, it seems like the news is always bad, right?"" says Kossin. ""It's never good. It could have been good. We could have found that climate change increases the barrier. But it doesn't. It erodes it."" In addition to greenhouse gas levels rising, a decrease in air pollution in Europe and the US since the 1970s is thought to have had an unintended consequence – warming the air over the Atlantic further. Previously, high levels of sulphate pollutants from industry mixed over the Atlantic Basin, hindering sunlight from hitting the ocean, says Kossin. ""And that has a cooling effect."" Climate change has been well underway since the industrial revolution, ""but we've been suppressing that warming with this pollution"", says Kossin. After the remarkable success in reducing industrial pollution, that cooling effect reduced. More like this: There is debate over just how much industrial smog may have influenced temperatures. Willoughby believes the impact was small, with other factors playing a more important role on ocean temperatures. Some studies have found, however, that industrial smog's influence on ocean temperatures is underappreciated, with clean-up efforts in China potentially contributing to periodic warm ""warm blob"" events in the north-east Pacific. There are other ways too that hurricanes are becoming more extreme and bringing greater risk. ""Sea level rise is also happening underneath everything we're talking about, and since hurricanes become dangerous as they move onto a coast, you always have to add that on to the problem,"" says Kossin. One study found storm surge waves from hurricanes in the Caribbean, Mexico and the US had grown in area by 80% since 1979 – and globally, storm surge waves were also getting around 3% higher per decade. But technologies can help save lives in communities where hurricanes make landfall, while longer-term changes could also limit loss of life and property. ""One of the issues I would focus on is [limiting] further development of the coastal regions,"" says Carmargo. ""Policies that lead to huge real estate development in the coastal regions should not continue. The more people and more infrastructure in regions that are typically in the path of hurricanes lead to more impacts."" For those who do live in the paths of hurricanes, making broad adaptations to buildings and developments may help preserve homes and infrastructure. Reliable early-warning systems, meanwhile, can provide a life-saving head-start to safety. There could also be natural solutions to help bolster island and coastal areas, from planting grass that binds slopes together to replenishing lost oyster beds. ""Adaptation is so important, and you know, may ultimately turn out to be the most important thing,"" says Kossin. ""Because we can't suddenly turn off climate change and have everything go back to the way it was. There's an inertia to the system that we can't really get past. And so adaptation is going to be a big part of it."" -- Correction: This article was originally published on 15 July 2024.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30lz53y2y4o,O'Sullivan has no plan to stop playing snooker,"Despite his well-documented struggles, the seven-time world champion says he is loving the sport.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:11.714846,China News,BBC,China,"Ronnie O'Sullivan said he planned to continue competing at the top level of snooker, so long as he enjoyed it. The seven-time world champion from Chigwell, Essex, had previously threatened to quit the sport over a row with its governing body. He admitted there were times he would ""hate"" snooker, but later realised: ""Actually, I really love this."" Asked if he planned to continue playing professionally, O'Sullivan said: ""As long as I can pace myself."" The 48-year-old's struggles with snooker at times have been well-documented. O'Sullivan came under fire in November after he publicly criticised the World Snooker Tour. His comments related to five players being threatened with punishment for playing in an exhibition event in China, instead of the Northern Ireland Open. In that same month, a documentary showed ""The Rocket"" almost in tears having got stage fright in a World Championship final in 2022. Speaking to BBC Essex, the snooker great said he was back enjoying competing on the world tour. ""We all have moments where we hate what we do,"" he said. ""Then a few weeks later you wake up and you go, 'Actually, I really love this.' That's normal for everybody."" O'Sullivan went on to overcome his anxieties and won the World Championship in 2022, becoming the oldest winner in Crucible history. However, in the 2024 tournament he exited at the quarter final stage at the hands of fellow Englishman, Stuart Bingham. He said his new autobiography would lift the lid on his personal experience of competing at the top level. O'Sullivan told the BBC he had come to value the importance of enjoyment over heaping pressure on himself. ""There was a time where I didn't think I was ever going to win one World Championship, so to be sitting here on seven feels ridiculous,"" he said. ""I'm not going to get greedy and want the eighth. If you said I'm going to get one, I'd be happy with that. ""I'm not hungry to get titles. As long as I'm enjoying playing, that's the main thing.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr3l3w8353o,Backyard keepers brood over 'vital' bird register,Farmers say registration is crucial to protect the poultry population from outbreaks of bird flu.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:11.829084,China News,BBC,China,"People who keep pet chickens are being urged to register them ahead of a legal deadline designed to prevent fresh outbreaks of bird flu. Owners who fail to do so by Tuesday risk being fined or even imprisoned, though officials have stressed any punishment would be ""proportionate"". Farmers say registration is ""vital"" to protect the poultry population, but some backyard keepers have branded it ""bureaucracy gone crazy"". Jorge Martin-Almagro, the government’s deputy chief veterinary officer, warned against complacency about avian influenza, despite a lack of recent reported cases in captive birds. It follows the largest outbreak on record in the UK, with more than 360 cases confirmed and millions of birds culled between October 2021 and February this year. Ray Holmes has registered the six rescue hens he keeps on an allotment in Hessle, East Yorkshire.  But he objects to the prospect of backyard keepers being penalised should they fail to follow his example. ""We have got wildlife flying over,"" he said. ""There are geese flying over in a morning now. Who knows what is dropping from the sky?"" It is a sentiment shared by Derek Smith, a fellow allotment holder who owns four hens. ""I get four eggs a day,"" he said. ""It is not worth a potential £2,500 fine if I have filled the form in incorrectly. It's bureaucracy gone crazy."" However, James Porter, a Lincolnshire farmer who produces seven million chickens for Sainsbury's each year, said it was ""absolutely vital"" to register. Thanks to strict biosecurity measures, his flocks have never caught the disease, but he said he had watched fellow farmers suffer. About one million birds were culled in Lincolnshire following an outbreak in December 2021. Mr Porter, who has a flock of 880,000 birds, added: ""I know the effect these diseases can have on people's livelihoods. ""When their whole flock is taken out – most of them never come back from that.” In May this year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs declared the UK free from cases of avian influenza in kept birds. However, Mr Martin-Almagro confirmed bird flu was present in the wild bird population. He said ""mapping"" the location of all captive birds was a ""top priority"". The register has been designed to allow government vets to rapidly deal with any future outbreak, as opposed to wasting resources locating keepers. Officials have stressed advice and guidance will be provided to individuals who fail to register, with formal enforcement action being taken only in cases of repeated non-compliance. Avian influenza is caused by a virus that infects birds and sometimes other animals, such as foxes, seals and otters. The major strain is a type of the virus known as H5N1. It emerged in China in the late 1990s. The virus has, in very rare cases, infected humans and scientists say the current risk to people is low. However, earlier this year experts warned the virus was spreading to cattle and decimating wildlife around the world.

They became the joint most successful side in the football tournament's history, equalling powerhouse nations Germany and the United States. Choe Il-son's 15th minute winner capped a superb tournament for North Korea, who won every single game in Colombia. The 17-year-old forward finished as the competition's overall top scorer, winning the Golden Boot with six goals. ""It’s so hard to express ourselves right now - this has been a dream of so many of us for so long,"" said North Korea's captain, Chae Un-yong. ""The final match was tough, as we expected, and we had to remain calm and play according to the coach’s tactical instructions."" North Korea stormed their way through the tournament, despatching the likes of Argentina, the Netherlands and Brazil en route to the semis. A 1-0 victory over the United States set up an all-Asian final against Japan - who finished as runners-up in the previous tournament in 2022. Choe's goal - a slightly deflected left foot strike - was enough to secure a historic win for North Korea in the El Camin Stadium  She was named player of the match and won both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball, the latter being awarded to the World Cup's best overall player. North Korea's triumph is even more notable given the country withdrew from global sporting competition for several years due to the coronavirus pandemic. Having not played a match since 2018, the North Korean Women's U20 returned to the international stage in March this year to compete in the Asian Cup in Uzbekistan. Despite the six-year-break, they won that tournament, beating Japan 2-1 to secure their second title. “To firstly win the Asian Cup and now follow that with this success means that I’m so proud of the team,"" said the team coach, Ri Song-ho, following their World Cup triumph. ""We have shown that we are very dangerous in the way that we build up attacks, it’s all about the speed of how we go forward."" Unlike their male counterparts - who are ranked 111th in the world - North Korea's women are a genuine force in world football. The senior side is currently ninth in the Fifa world rankings, higher than countries such as France and Australia. To date, they have won three Asian Cups, three Asian Games and three East Asian Championships. North Koreans rarely get to see their national sides play at home, though. The country's limited transport connections with the outside world - as well as its poor diplomatic relations with many governments - mean that the vast majority of North Korea's ""home"" matches are played at a neutral venue, often in China or the Middle East."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7yz713806o,Super Mario plumber takes 'Olympic' medal,"With no student debt, Ruben Duggan is encouraging more youngsters to take up a trade.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:12.044215,China News,BBC,China,"With no student debt, Ruben Duggan is working in his dream job - and he has just won an ""Olympic"" medal for skills learnt training to be a plumber. The day job sees him fitting boilers around Caerphilly county, and jokingly referred to as Super Mario by customers because of his moustache.  He now wants to inspire others to take up a trade, after returning from the WorldSkills competition - known as ""the skills Olympics"" to many taking part - with a silver medal.  Ruben, 22, joined 1,500 other competitors from 69 nations in Lyon, France, and is the only Welsh competitor to return with a medal. The competition is for apprentices and students of vocational qualifications, and alongside plumbing and heating, participants display their talents in trades as diverse as carpentry, hairdressing and web design. Ruben had always wanted to follow in his father's footsteps, adding: “I’ve always wanted to be a plumber since helping carry my dad’s toolbox when I was six years of age. ""I was shaking when they called my name, It still hasn’t sunk in that I'm the second best plumber in the world.” Ruben carried out his apprenticeship at the family plumbing company, Powerserv Limited, in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, and trained at Coleg y Cymoedd in nearby Ystrad Mynach.  He missed out on gold to China - and jokes he is holding off putting his prices up until he checks with his dad, and just wants to focus on being the best. “I knew from a young age what I wanted to do, but in school I felt it was all about A-Levels, but that isn’t the road for everybody,"" he said.  ""I’m passionate about apprenticeships. It’s the best way to learn a trade and businesses need to see the rewards of training apprentices. ""I’m doing what I want to do and have no student debt and I'm earning money.”  Ruben continued: “I just hope I can inspire other people into the industry, and that will help the UK as a whole, because other countries have run away with it in recent years and it’s time for UK plumbing to come back with strength.” Team UK picked up 16 medals in Lyon, with WorldSkills UK Chief Executive Ben Blackledge describing the impact this will have. ""For Ruben to win a silver medal is a huge achievement,"" he said.  ""Knowing you're one of the best in the world is massive to what you can go on to do next.  ""It's been a real investment from the family business allowing Ruben time off to do training and competing, but they're already seeing rewards with Ruben's skill set and confidence levels benefitting the business.""  Ruben had to follow a complex set of drawings for installing pipe work to a boiler and cylinder, which had to be carefully followed, with around 150 points for the judges to mark. “To showcase your skills on a world stage there's nothing like it,"" he said.  ""After spending a week in Lyon, up against some of the best in the world and to come out second, I'll never ever forget it for rest of my life. ""I've had so many customers texting me after winning the silver medal, which is great to see they appreciate my passion."" He added: ""I just love plumbing day in and day out, my nan said to me, 'work a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life'."" Ruben and his brothers are installing a new boiler at the home of Lyn Hansford in Newbridge - she has been a customer for nearly 20 years. ""We're really proud of Ruben, these boys are replacing a system their dad installed in 2006 when they were all little boys,"" she said.  ""We're just really proud he's doing so well."" The 22-year-old, has not only returned from Lyon with a medal but also a moustache, and customers have been comparing him to another famous plumber.   ""He does look like Super Mario though with the moustache,"" Lyn joked.   Following Ruben’s success, the Welsh government announced Wales will host UK-wide finals next year, from which people can qualify for the WorldSkills competition in Japan in 2028. It is for apprentices and students of vocational qualifications. Skills Minister Jack Sargeant said: “As a former apprentice myself, earning whilst learning was a game-changer for me and apprentices like Ruben. I'm proud that Wales will host the WorldSkills Finals UK 2025. ""I’m sure Ruben’s achievement this year and welcoming the national competition here next year will inspire many potential Welsh apprentices of the future.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qv1nw302ro,Fresh faces in Mozambique's poll as independence era leaders bow out,A watershed poll will see a shift at the top with a new era of post-colonial leaders vying for power.,6 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:21.424622,China News,BBC,China,"Mozambique is set for a watershed election that will see a change of the presidential guard, with the era of leaders who forged their careers in the trenches of the independence war against Portuguese rule coming to an end. For the first time, the once all-powerful Frelimo party is fielding a presidential candidate who was born after independence - the charismatic 47-year-old Daniel Chapo, who it hopes will rally voters fed up with its 49-year rule. “In some places Frelimo campaign members have been booed and openly rejected,” political commentator Charles Mangwiro tells the BBC. Mozambique - strategically located along the southern African coast and rich in natural resources, but hit by an insurgency in the remote north - will hold presidential elections on Wednesday, along with parliamentary and gubernatorial elections. President Filipe Nyusi is stepping down at the end of his two terms and hopes to hand the reigns of power to Chapo. His government had to deal with the fallout of the ""tuna bond"" corruption scandal - which triggered the country's worst economic crisis. In comparison, Chapo is a breath of fresh air - and draws big crowds at rallies across the country as he distances himself from the corruption that has plagued Frelimo for much of its rule since independence in 1975. ""Brother Dan is honesty in person... He is the voice of hope we want to embrace... It's time for change,"" say the lyrics of one of his campaign songs. But human rights activist and journalist Mirna Chitsungo says she doubts whether Chapo can convince all voters that he can change Frelimo. ""If we have a degraded country, it is because of corruption. He faces the challenge of promising to fight this evil while belonging to a party that, on a large scale, has perpetuated corruption,"" she told the BBC. Counting in Chapo's favour is the fact that he is a relative newcomer in the political arena, having joined government only in 2011 as a district administrator, rising by 2019 to become governor of the southern Inhambane province until taking over as general secretary of Frelimo in May. But his critics say that to ensure victory, Frelimo has a back-up plan: fraud. A leading non-governmental organisation in Mozambique, Centro de Integridade Pública, says its research showed that around 5% of the names on the voters' roll are fake, or so-called ""ghost voters"" - that is a figure of nearly 900,000. “The simple fact is that data published by the CNE [Central National Elections Commission] itself shows that 878,868 more voters were registered than there are voting age adults in some provinces, and thus these are ghost voters on the voters roll,” Mozambique analyst Joe Hanlon told the BBC. Miguel de Brito, from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, notes that the ""ghost voters"" are not evenly distributed across the country - only seven key provinces out of 10 have registered more voters than people. For instance, one-third of all the people registered in Gaza Province, which usually votes overwhelmingly for Frelimo, are thought to be ""ghost voters"". It is also the area where large numbers of people leave every year for work in South Africa. “It’s gotten worse, this year we managed to register nationally almost 105% of the voting age population,” Mr De Brito told the BBC. Both the election commission and Frelimo deny any foul play, insisting that the elections will be free and fair. Chapo is facing a challenge from three other candidates: Of the three, Mondlane is the fresh face, vying for the presidency for the first time after breaking away from Renamo. With the slogan ""Save Mozambique - this country is ours"", the 50-year-old is proving to be a big hit, especially in the campaign to win the youth vote. ""He [Mondlane] uses this slogan everywhere and he tries to explain to young voters that they should take pride in being Mozambican because conditions are there for them not to be poor or unemployed,"" Mangwiro explains. ""He draws large numbers at his campaign rallies and people are not frog-marched to attend - come rain, cold or sun.” A former banker, Mondlane first made his mark when he ran for mayor of the capital, Maputo, in local elections last year. Many people believed that he won - alleging the result was then rigged in favour of Frelimo's candidate. Mondlane fought that election under the banner of Renamo, but quit the party after Momade, 60, refused to make way for him to take over. Momade became Renamo's leader following the death of its long-time leader Afonso Dhlakama in 2018. He is widely credited for signing a peace deal with Nyusi to end a civil war that had raged between Renamo fighters and government forces. Momade ran for the presidency in elections in 2019, and claimed that he was robbed of victory by Nyusi, but remained committed to the peace deal. Though he is confident of winning this time, his chances have been hampered by Mondlane's entry into the race - a point that Chitsungo, the human rights activist, made when she said that Mondlane is seen by many Renamo voters as a ""young man with the spirit of Dhlakama"". ""It is as if we are having elections with a resurrected Dhlakama, a rejuvenated Dhlakama. So, we have this novelty,"" she pointed out. Chapo is hoping that the Renamo vote will be split between the two men, improving his chances of clinching victory. In a sign of his determination to win, Chapo has travelled to next-door neighbour South Africa to raise funds for his campaign, hosting a banquet in an upmarket suburb of Johannesburg. He also addressed ordinary Mozambicans in the city, urging them to cast their ballots for him at the embassy where they were able to register to vote earlier in the year. ""This is a candidacy for renewal,"" he told the crowd. ""This is a unique opportunity I have to make a difference, almost 50 years after independence.” Mondlane also took his campaign to Johannesburg, visiting a fresh-produce market that Mozambicans run in the city. “I’ll sort out the problems that led you to abandon Mozambique,” he said. The violence in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, which has witnessed jihadist attacks since 2017 that have halted the lucrative liquefied natural gas projects there, has not been a major election issue. Rwandan and South Africans troops, deployed several years ago to deal with the insurgents, are still on the ground for now - though Ziyanda Stuurman, from political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, says there has been an “uptick in the frequency and severity of insurgent attacks since January”. Most analysts agree the biggest challenge for any new president will be creating economic opportunities and jobs in a country where 62% of the population live in extreme poverty, on less than $1.90 (£1.45) a day. But the election race is still wide open, with candidates and parties holding their final campaign rallies on Sunday. Refusing to bet on who will win on Wednesday, Mangwiro, the political analyst, says: ""It's too close to call."" Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9ypzq8qeo,N Korea releases rare photos of Kim at uranium facility,"Mr Kim called for the site to increase its production of nuclear warheads, state media said.",13 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:21.537673,China News,BBC,China,"North Korea has for the first time offered a glimpse into a uranium enrichment facility which produces material for its nuclear weapons. Photographs showed its leader Kim Jong Un, who had earlier vowed to ""exponentially"" increase the country's stash of nuclear weapons, inspecting the area.  The state's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a report on Friday that he had similarly called for the uranium facility to increase its production.   Enriched uranium is essential in the manufacturing of nuclear warheads.  The photograph shows Mr Kim walking past rows of centrifuges and talking to military officials. Their publication comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. ""[Mr Kim] went round the control room of the uranium enrichment base to learn about the overall operation of the production lines,"" KCNA reported, adding that he ""felt strong"" to see the site. The South Korean government has said it strongly condemns the North's plans to increase production.  North Korea did not reveal when Mr Kim made the visit, nor which facility he visited – whether this is part of its sprawling Yongbyon nuclear complex, or another undisclosed site. Experts have long suspected that North Korea is covertly running at least one uranium enrichment facility, in addition to its well-known Yongbyon site. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul said North Korea has disclosed the facility to ""boast of its nuclear development and signal that its weapons program is irreversible"". ""The Kim regime may also be flaunting that it still enjoys diplomatic and economic support from Russia and China, despite its nuclear buildup,"" Prof Easley told the BBC.  Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, had told news agency AFP that the photographs could be a ""message"" to the upcoming US presidential election, meant to show the next administration that it would be ""impossible to denuclearise North Korea"". ""It is also a message demanding other countries to acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear state,"" Mr Hong said. South Korea's Ministry of Unification has condemned the North for publicising the facility, adding that the illegal deployment of nuclear weapons violates several resolutions set by the UN Security Council. ""Any nuclear threat or provocation by North Korea will be met with an overwhelming and strong response from our government and military, based on the solid extended deterrence of the South Korea-US alliance,"" the unification ministry said. It is not known how many nuclear weapons North Korea has, but one recent estimate puts the number at 50, with sufficient material to produce another 40. "

Students and staff at New College Swindon have also had the opportunity to attend talks about the history of Hindu culture at the two-day event organised by the Swindon Hindu Samaj. The college has put on the event to broaden the students' awareness of different cultures. Siddharth Patel, chair of Swindon's Hindu Samaj, said they had ""underestimated"" the interest in the event, adding that it had been ""great to see"" people getting involved.  The first day took place at the college's Queens Drive Campus on Tuesday, and is due to continue Wednesday at the North Star Campus.  All week the canteen will serve traditional Indian food. Sushma Patel, vice chair of the Hindu charity organisation, which has operated in Swindon for 51 years, told the BBC:  ""We live in a diverse society and it's nice for everyone to know what part of our culture is. ""Everybody looks to be really enjoying themselves because they're getting an insight into something different. She said henna sessions at the event had proven ""so popular"" they ran out of supplies and had to go out for more. ""It's given us an opportunity to engage with them as well, which is brilliant,"" she said.  Student Miya said: ""I'm from China, it's kind of a close country [to India].  ""I can understand what their culture means to them compared to what mine means to me."" She said she felt ""connected"" by the event. Matt Butcher, vice principal of the college, said the display ""really makes you smile"". ""I'm really happy. I'm pleased to see the queue of students engaging.  ""I'm sure I will see henna tattoos throughout college for the next couple of weeks.  Siddharth Patel said: ""To be invited is an extreme pleasure. ""People are aware of Indian culture, they've seen outfits everywhere. But they don't really quite understand the details of it. ""Today is an opportunity to share that information.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy78ejg71exo,Chagossians criticise lack of say in UK deal to hand over islands,Chagossians claim they were repeatedly refused the chance to take part in negotiations behind the historic deal.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:21.737176,China News,BBC,China,"People with roots in the Chagos Islands have criticised what they called their ""exclusion"" from negotiations leading to the UK government's deal to give up its sovereignty of the region. The remote but strategically important cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean is set to be handed to Mauritius after more than half a century. Some Chagossians the BBC spoke to broadly welcomed the deal, but many said indigenous people had been repeatedly refused an opportunity to take part in talks. The Foreign Office said the interests of the Chagossian community had been ""an important part of the negotiations"". One of the largest islands on the tropical atoll, Diego Garcia, will remain a joint US-UK military base and is expected to remain so for 99 years with an option to renew.  Mauritius will be able to begin a programme of resettlement on the Chagos Islands, but not on Diego Garcia.  Pascalina Nellan, whose grandmother was born on the island before it turned into a home for navy ships and long-range bomber aircrafts, said the deal amounted to ""backstabbing"" by the UK government. In recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory.  The International Court of Justice previously ruled the UK's administration of the island, that some had called its ""last colony in Africa"", was ""unlawful"" and must end. The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968. Britain later apologised for forcibly removing more than 1,000 islanders from the entire archipelago between 1965 and 1973, and promised to hand the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for strategic purposes. Two years ago Ms Nellan moved to the UK, where she has been calling for Chagossian involvement in the deal over the territory. ""Every time we made a request to be heard we have been excluded,"" she said, claiming UK officials said the Chagossian community could not be involved in negotiations between the two countries. ""Today, again, we've been excluded,"" the 34-year-old postgraduate student told the BBC.  ""We need to respect the rights of indigenous people."" Ms Nellan said she would like to go back to the islands, but not under Mauritius' control. ""Our right to self-determination - whether we want to be British citizens or Mauritian citizens at all - has been stripped today,"" she said.  Frankie Bontemps, a second generation Chagossian in the UK, told the BBC that he felt ""betrayed"" and ""angry"" on Thursday because ""Chagossians have never been involved"" in the negotiations. ""We remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future"", he said and called for the full inclusion of Chagossians in drafting the treaty. Steeve Bancal, a trainee social worker from Sussex, was positive about the deal. He said Mauritius was more likely to put resettlement plans in place for Chagossians than the UK, which had ""done nothing"" for the community. He expressed hope to return to the islands with his mother, who was also removed from Diego Garcia. She resettled in Mauritius, where Mr Bancal was born. Mr Bancal said it would be a ""dream come true"" for his mother, 74, to return to Diego Garcia. However, he also criticised the negotiations, saying they happened ""behind closed doors"". ""None of us were told what was happening. It's unfair on us,"" he said.  ""It's our heritage - we should have had one or two people in the room. ""I don't think the UK government trusts us."" Isabelle Charlot was born in Mauritius to Chagossian parents, and has lived in the UK - where she is the chairperson of the Chagos Islanders Movement - for 19 years. She said she now hoped to return to the archipelago. ""That is what my family and I have been waiting for,"" Ms Charlot told the BBC. She said she welcomed the deal as a step toward ""reclaiming [her] identity, heritage and homeland"", all of which had been ""robbed"" from her.  ""I [knew] that the Labour government would want to right the historical wrongs and respect the international law,"" she said.  Some Conservative leadership candidates suggested the deal could undermine UK security. Robert Jenrick said: ""It's taken three months for Starmer to surrender Britain's strategic interests."" Former foreign secretary James Cleverly described the move as ""weak, weak, weak"", while former security minister Tom Tugendhat suggested it risked allowing China to gain a military foothold in the Indian Ocean. However Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's special envoy for negotiations between the UK and Mauritius, dismissed such criticism of the deal and said Mr Cleverly had previously been leading the talks. Human Rights Watch called for the Chagossians to be consulted on the deal.  Clive Baldwin, senior legal advisor at the organisation, said the deal did not ""guarantee that the Chagossians could return to their homeland"", and ""appears to explicitly ban them from the largest island, Diego Garcia, for another century"". He called for reparations for those who were displaced. Mr Baldwin called for meaningful consultations with the Chagossians.  He said unless this happened, the UK, US and now Mauritius would be responsible for ""a still ongoing colonial crime"".  Powell said on Thursday that Britain's past treatment of the Chagossians was ""shameful"". But he called the agreement, reached after 11 rounds of negotiations, ""genuinely historic"". He said he could not guarantee whether Chagossians would be able to return to the islands, since they were to become Mauritian territory, but that the UK was committed to ""help with resettlements if that's possible"". The UK government said it would also provide a package of financial support to Mauritius, including annual payments and infrastructure investment. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “This is a bilateral agreement between the UK and Mauritius. ""We are mindful that the future of the islands is an important issue for the Chagossian community. Their interests have been an important part of the negotiations.”"

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y37dvlr70o,How the world’s smelliest fruit is making coffee more expensive,"A ""perfect storm"" of economic and environmental factors in coffee-producing regions is pushing up prices.",15 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:21.968986,China News,BBC,China,"How much is too much for a caffeine fix? Prices like £5 in London or $7 in New York for a cup of coffee may be unthinkable for some - but could soon be a reality thanks to a ""perfect storm"" of economic and environmental factors in the world's top coffee-producing regions. The cost of unroasted beans traded in global markets is now at a ""historically high level"", says analyst Judy Ganes. Experts blame a mix of troubled crops, market forces, depleted stockpiles - and the world’s smelliest fruit. So how did we get here, and just how much will it impact your morning latte? In 2021, a freak frost wiped out coffee crops in Brazil, the world's largest producer of Arabica beans - those commonly used in barista-made coffee. This bean shortfall meant buyers turned to countries like Vietnam, the primary producer of Robusta beans, that are typically used in instant blends. But farmers there faced the region’s worst drought in nearly a decade. Climate change has been affecting the development of coffee plants, according to Will Frith, a coffee consultant based in Ho Chi Minh City, in turn impacting bean yields. And then Vietnamese farmers pivoted to a smelly, yellow fruit - the durian. The fruit - which is banned on public transport in Thailand, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong because of its odour - is proving popular in China. And Vietnamese farmers are replacing their coffee crops with durian to cash in on this emerging market. Vietnam's durian market share in China almost doubled between 2023 and 2024, and some estimate the crop is five times more lucrative than coffee. ""There’s a history of growers in Vietnam being fickle in response to market price fluctuations, overcommitting, and then flooding the market with quantities of their new crop,"" Mr Frith says. As they flooded China with durian, Robusta coffee exports were down 50% in June compared to the previous June, and stocks were now ""near depleted"", according to the International Coffee Organisation. Exporters in Colombia, Ethiopia, Peru and Uganda have stepped up, but have not produced enough to ease a tight market. ""Right at [the] time when things started to rev up for demand of Robusta, is right when the world was scrambling for more supply,"" explains Ms Ganes. This means Robusta and Arabica beans are now trading at near-record highs on commodity markets. Is the shifting global coffee economy actually impacting the price of your coffee on a high street? The short answer: potentially. Wholesaler Paul Armstrong believes coffee drinkers may soon face the ""crazy"" prospect of paying more than £5 in the UK for their caffeine fix. “It’s a perfect storm at the minute.” Mr Armstrong, who runs Carrara Coffee Roasters based in the East Midlands, imports beans from South America and Asia, which are then roasted and sent to cafés around the UK. He tells the BBC he recently increased his prices, hoping it would account for the higher asking prices - but says costs have “only intensified” since. He adds that with some of his contracts ending in the coming months, cafés he serves will soon have to decide whether to pass the higher costs on to their customers. Mr Frith says some segments of the industry will be more exposed than others, though. ""It’s really the commercial quantity coffee that will experience the most disuption. Instant coffee, supermarket coffee, stuff at the gas station - that's all going up."" Industry figures caution that a high market price for coffee may not necessarily translate into higher retail prices. Felipe Barretto Croce, CEO of FAFCoffees in Brazil, agrees that consumers are ""feeling the pinch"" as consumer prices have risen. But he argues that is ""mostly due to inflationary costs in general"", such as rent and labour, rather than the cost of beans. Consultancy Allegra Strategies estimates beans contribute less than 10% of the price of a cup of coffee. ""Coffee is still very cheap, as a luxury good, if you make it at home."" He also says that the cost of lower-quality beans rising means high-quality coffee may now be seen as better value. ""If you go into a speciality coffee shop in London and get a coffee, versus a coffee in Costa Coffee, the difference [in price] between that cup and the speciality coffee is much smaller than it used to be."" But there is hope of price relief on the horizon. The upcoming spring crop in Brazil, which produces a third of the world's coffee, is now ""crucial"", according to Mr Croce. ""What everyone is looking at is when the rains will return,"" he says. ""If they return early, the plants should be healthy enough and the flowering should be good."" But if the rains come as late as October, he adds, yield predictions for next year’s crop will fall and market stress will continue. In the long term, climate change poses serious challenges for the global coffee industry. A study from 2022 concluded that even if we drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the area most highly suited for growing coffee could decline by 50% by 2050. One measure to future-proof the industry that has the support of Mr Croce is a ""green premium"" - a small tax levied on coffee given to farmers to invest in regenerative agricultural practices, which help protect and sustain the viability of farmlands. So while smelly fruit is partly responsible for price rises now - a changing climate may ultimately strain the affordability of coffee in the years to come."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wj9qejrpwo,What the world thought of US debate,"How the Harris-Trump debate was seen from Putin's Kremlin, Ukraine's frontlines and Taliban-run Afghanistan.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:22.186691,China News,BBC,China,"The first showdown between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump was closely watched not only in the US but around the world. The debate in Philadelphia featured some tense exchanges on foreign policy between the two presidential candidates. From Beijing to Budapest, here's how the debate went down, according to BBC foreign correspondents. By Steve Rosenberg, Russia editor, Moscow Kamala Harris told Donald Trump that President Putin is “a dictator who would eat you for lunch.” The expression ""to eat someone for lunch"" (or breakfast, or any other meal) doesn’t exist in Russian. But one thing you will find in Moscow is the appetite for a US election result that benefits Russia. The Kremlin will have noted (with pleasure) that in the debate Trump sidestepped the question about whether he wants Ukraine to win the war. “I want the war to stop,” replied Trump. By contrast, Harris spoke of Ukraine’s “righteous defence” and accused Vladimir Putin of having “his eyes on the rest of Europe”. Later the Kremlin claimed to have been irked by all mentions of Putin in the debate. “Putin’s name is used as one of the instruments for the internal battle in the US,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told me. ""We don’t like this and hope they will keep our president’s name out of this.” Last week Putin claimed he was backing Harris in the election and praised her “infectious laugh.” Later a Russian state TV anchor clarified that Putin had been “slightly ironic” in his comments. The presenter was dismissive of Harris’ political skills and suggested she would be better off hosting a TV cooking show. I wonder: would it feature “dictators” eating US presidential candidates “for lunch""…? By Nick Beake, Europe correspondent, Kyiv Donald Trump’s failure, when asked on the debate stage to say if he wanted Ukraine to win the war, may not have surprised people here but it adds to their worry about what a second Trump term would bring. Trump has long boasted he could end in the conflict in 24 hours, a prospect many Ukrainians assume would mean an incredibly bad deal with Kyiv forced to give up huge swathes of the land Russia has seized over the past two and a half years. In contrast, Ukrainians will have been reassured by Kamala Harris’s responses, with no sign she would deviate from the current position of staunch American support. She took credit for the role she’s already played, arguing she shared important intelligence with President Zelensky in the days before the full-scale invasion. She then claimed Trump’s position would have been fatal for Ukraine had he still been in the White House. “If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.” Publicly, there has been a deafening silence from Ukraine’s current ministers and senior military in reaction to the debate. The figurative US electoral battle is one they need not weigh in to while they’re consumed by real fighting at home. It’s President Zelensky himself who so far has gone furthest in articulating, albeit somewhat euphemistically, what a Trump victory would mean for Ukrainians. Speaking to the BBC in July, he said it would mean “hard work, but we are hard workers”. By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent America’s longest war ended in August 2021 when it scrambled to pull out the last of its troops, and evacuate thousands of civilians, as the Taliban swept into Kabul with surprising speed. That debacle made it into the debate and, not surprisingly, the issues were dodged, dismissed, distorted. Harris veered away from the question “do you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?”. As a correspondent who followed the chaotic pullout closely, I never heard that the vice-president was in the room when decisions were taken in those final fateful weeks. But she made it clear she agreed with President Biden’s decision to leave. Trump boasted that he talked tough with “Abdul”, the “head of the Taliban” who is “still the head of the Taliban.” He seemed to be referring to Abdul Ghani Baradar, who signed the withdrawal deal with the US. But he never headed the Taliban, and has been sidelined since the Taliban takeover. The mention immediately prompted a wave of internet memes featuring “Abdul” with people named Abdul weighing in, and others asking “who is Abdul?” Both contenders focused on the flawed deal with the Taliban. The truth is that the Trump team negotiated this exit plan; the Biden team hastily enacted it. Trump said the deal was good because “we were getting out”. There were no good ways to go. But the departure turned into a disaster and all sides are to blame. By Laura Bicker, China correspondent, Beijing Kamala Harris was an unknown quantity to leaders here and she still is, even after the debate. She has no track record on China and on the debate stage she simply repeated her line that the US, not China, would win the competition for the 21st Century. The vice-president represents something China does not like - uncertainty. That is why President Xi recently used a visit by US officials to call for “stability” between the two superpowers, perhaps a message to the current vice-president. The prevailing view among Chinese academics is that she will not stray too far from President Biden’s slow and steady diplomatic approach. But on the debate stage she went on the attack and accused Donald Trump of “selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernise their military”. Donald Trump has made it clear he plans has to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This will add to the tariffs he imposed as president which started a trade war in 2018. China retaliated, and numerous studies suggest this caused economic pain for both sides. This is the last thing China wants right now as it is trying to manufacture and export goods to rescue its economy. For Chinese leaders, this debate will have done little to assuage beliefs that Trump represents something else they don’t like - unpredictability. But in truth, there is little hope here that US policy on China will change significantly, no matter who sits in the White House. By Paul Adams, international correspondent, Jerusalem The two candidates did not stray much from their previously stated positions last night, even if Trump did add, with characteristic hyperbole, that Israel wouldn’t exist in two years if his opponent becomes president. Here in the Middle East, the race for the White House is being keenly watched. With the war in Gaza raging and a ceasefire deal still elusive, some of Benjamin Netanyahu’s critics suspect that Israel’s prime minister is deliberately stalling until after the election, in the hope that Trump will be more sympathetic to Israel than Harris. There’s a whiff of history perhaps being about to repeat itself. In 1980, Ronald Reagan’s campaign team was suspected of urging Iran not to release American hostages held in Tehran until after he had beaten President Jimmy Carter, saying Reagan would give Iran a better deal. Could something similar be afoot now? Certainly Netanyahu’s opponents believe he is now the chief obstacle to a ceasefire deal. Harris has indicated that she might be tougher on Israel than Joe Biden, something Trump has seized on, saying last night that the vice-president “hates Israel”. Palestinians, deeply sceptical about Donald Trump but dismayed by the Biden administration’s inability to stop the war in Gaza, are possibly inclined to see Harris as the lesser of two evils. They’ve long since abandoned any notion of the US as an honest broker in the Middle East, but will have noticed that Harris, unlike Trump, says she’s committed to Palestinian statehood. By Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent, Budapest Donald Trump showered praise on the Hungarian prime minister. ""Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men, they call him a strong man. He's a tough person. Smart..."" Hungarian pro-government media picked up on the compliment. ""Huge recognition!"" ran the headline in Magyar Nemzet. But government-critical news portal 444 quoted Tim Walz, running mate of Harris. ""He [Trump] was asked to name one world leader who was with him, and he said Orban. Dear God. That's all we need to know.’ Viktor Orban backed Trump for president in 2016 and is strongly backing him again in November.  The two men met for the second time this year at Trump’s home in Florida on 12 July, after Orban visited Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in quick succession. The Orban government is banking both on Trump’s victory and his ability to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. ""Things are changing. If Trump comes back, there will be peace. It will be established by him without the Europeans,"" Balazs Orban, Viktor Orban’s political director, told the BBC in July."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr5j1q8wlno,Muted mics and politeness - six takeaways from VP debate,"Vance and Walz focused their attacks on Harris and Trump's plans on the economy, immigration and abortion.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:22.288761,China News,BBC,China,"On Tuesday night, JD Vance and Tim Walz launched attacks on their presidential opponents, sparring over international conflict, the US economy, immigration and abortion rights. Despite those heated moments - and at least one muted microphone - it was perhaps the most civil debate of the 2024 election campaign. There were even points of common ground between the two men. Here are some of the most memorable parts of the first and only scheduled TV showdown between the running mates of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.  Abortion rights, a top issue in the 2024 election, sparked one of the longest and most heated exchanges of the night. It's an issue Democrats have used to galvanize voters, regularly framing Trump as a threat to women's autonomy because of his role in appointing a conservative majority to the Supreme Court. The court later overturned Roe v Wade, the ruling that had protected abortion rights in the US for decades.  Walz cited the stories of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, two women from Georgia whose deaths were connected to abortion restrictions in their home state. Vance, meanwhile, said his opinion on the issue had changed. He previously supported some type of national restrictions on abortion, but said his position shifted when he saw the majority of Ohio voters supported access to abortion.  He also said his party had to do ""so much better... at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us"". Walz had his best moment of the night near the end when the focus shifted to the 6 January 2021 riot and election denialism. In a tense exchange, Vance refused to say that Trump had lost the 2020 election, prompting some disbelief from Walz who called it a ""damning non-answer"". The moderators also raised Vance's previous comments that he would not have certified the 2020 election results if he had been vice-president at the time. Vance maintained his support for Trump, saying the former president had asked demonstrators on the day of the Capitol riot to protest peacefully. He added that Walz would have his best wishes if the Democrats win the 5 November election, but said there were legitimate questions to raise about voting fraud and security.  Walz said he and his opponent were ""miles apart"" on the issue of 6 January and election integrity. Walz and Vance took the stage just hours after Iran launched a missile attack on Israel - whose prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed retaliation. The ongoing tensions in the Middle East formed the basis of the first question. Appearing nervous, Walz stumbled as he repeated Harris's promise of iron-clad support for Israel.  Vance, meanwhile, reiterated one of Trump's main talking points: that no new world conflicts broke out during the former president's time in office.  Neither man would say if they approved of a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran. Immigration was a key topic throughout the 90-minute head-to-head. Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, frequently returned to the issue of the US southern border and immigration - viewed by many voters as a weakness for his opponents.  Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, countered that Trump helped torpedo bipartisan legislation that would have enacted some of the toughest immigration policy in US history.  The discussion ultimately turned tense when Vance was asked about false claims he made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. Vance and Trump previously shared conspiracy theories that illegal migrants were eating pets in the small city. When a CBS News moderator tried to correct Vance, the Ohio senator spoke over the hosts - who went on to mute his microphone.  Just before the debate, a claim of Walz's collapsed under scrutiny - that he had been in Hong Kong when the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre occurred in Beijing.  ""I'm a knucklehead at times,"" Walz said when asked about it on Tuesday night.  The Minnesota governor clarified that he had misspoken, saying he was influenced by the events because he had arrived in China that summer.  Vance also was asked to answer for some past comments, including prior attacks on his running mate, Trump, who he once called ""America's Hitler"".  The Ohio senator said he, like many people, has made mistakes in the past. ""I was wrong about Donald Trump,"" he said.  The tone was in stark contrast to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump’s first encounter last month, when insults flew and interruptions were frequent. Starting off the night with a handshake, both Vance and Walz proceeded to address each other politely and with civility. The two even exchanged smiles periodically, agreeing from time to time with what their rival had said.  They did direct some fire at the top of the ticket, however - Vance taking aim at Harris and Walz at Trump.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3y79llndo,TikTok says US ban would have ‘staggering’ impact on free speech,The US government wants TikTok sold or divested because it says it is a threat to national security.,16 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:28.388627,China News,BBC,China,"TikTok argued in court on Monday that a US law - which would see it banned unless it is sold by ByteDance - would have a “staggering” impact on the free speech of its US users. The law was prompted by concerns that US users' data is vulnerable to exploitation by China's government. TikTok and ByteDance have repeatedly denied links to the Chinese authorities.  The companies sued to block the legislation in early May, calling it unconstitutional and an effective ban on the speech of its 170 million US users. A panel of three judges heard its arguments at an appeals court in Washington DC on Monday. ""This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,"" TikTok and ByteDance's lawyer Andrew Pincus told the court. Concerns around China came up early, with Mr Pincus stating that the firm ""is not owned"" by the country.  ""The owner of TikTok is ByteDance Limited, a Cayman Islands holding company,” he said. But Judge Sri Srinivasan responded that the firm was ""subject to Chinese control"". Mr Pincus said the US government does not allege any malfeasance has taken place - and the firm was being punished over the suggestion that there might be issues in the future. But he was challenged on his argument that the law would be an unprecedented ban on a single speaker - and his claim that it would be ""unfeasible"" to divest the US arm of the firm.  Judge Ginsberg argued the law is ""an absolute bar on the current arrangement of control"" of the company, not the company itself. He also said it targeted a group of companies controlled by a so-called foreign adversary, rather than TikTok alone. Jeffrey Fisher, representing creators concerned by the law, said it could impede their constitutional right to work with the editor and publisher of their choice – such as TikTok under its current ownership. TikTok creator Tiffany Cianci, who is not among the creators involved in the lawsuit, was livestreaming outside the hearing to update viewers on proceedings. She told the BBC that 65,000 people tuned into her TikTok Live. ""The American people care about this issue,"" she said. ""They're tuning in because they're worried about losing something."" Ms Cianci added that the platform's use by politicians in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election felt ""hypocritical"" and made her doubt the security concerns at the heart of the controversial law. ""If it were dangerous, they wouldn't be there,"" she said. Department of Justice lawyer Daniel Tenny argued against TikTok's defence that the code behind its platform is based in the United States. ""There’s really no dispute here that the recommendation engine is maintained, developed, and written by ByteDance rather than TikTok US,"" he said. ""It is not expression by Americans in America - it is expression by Chinese engineers in China."" Mr Fisher had claimed posts on the platform in the US were American speech that was ""at most curated by a foreign company"". In addition to data concerns, officials and lawmakers have expressed alarm at the prospect of TikTok being used by the Chinese government to spread propaganda to Americans. However, advocates of America's powerful free speech rights, enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution, have said upholding the divest-or-ban law would be a gift to authoritarian regimes everywhere. Xiangnong Wang, a staff attorney at Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute, said repressive regimes worldwide may use it to ""justify new restrictions on their own citizens’ right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad."" But according to James Lewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, the law was drafted to withstand judicial scrutiny. ""The substance of the case against TikTok is very strong,"" Mr Lewis said.  ""The key point is whether the court accepts that requiring divestiture does not regulate speech."" Mr Lewis added that the courts usually defer to the president on national security matters. Regardless of how the appeals court rules, most experts agree the case could drag on for months, if not longer. Gautam Hans, clinical professor of law at Cornell Law School, told the BBC he believes an appeal is likely either way. The government's ability to legislate and regulate where national security is concerned is ""paramount,"" he said.  ""They cannot have that limited by the courts."" But the issues are also ""existential"" for TikTok, he added, with the company saying it cannot divest and would as such have no choice but to shut down.  Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at analysis firm Forrester, added the ""high stakes"" case would likely progress to the US' highest court, the Supreme Court.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y35qz73n8o,UK to finish with coal power after 142 years,"The UK's last coal power station, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, is due to end operations on Monday.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:28.473384,China News,BBC,China,"The UK is about to stop producing any electricity from burning coal - ending its 142-year reliance on the fossil fuel. The country's last coal power station, at Ratcliffe-on-Soar, finishes operations on Monday after running since 1967. This marks a major milestone in the country's ambitions to reduce its contribution to climate change. Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel producing the most greenhouse gases when burnt. Minister for Energy Michael Shanks said: ""We owe generations a debt of gratitude as a country."" The UK was the birthplace of coal power, and from tomorrow it becomes the first major economy to give it up. ""It's a really remarkable day, because Britain, after all, built her whole strength on coal, that is the industrial revolution,"" said Lord Deben - the longest serving environment secretary. The first coal-fired power station in the world, the Holborn Viaduct power station, was built in 1882 in London by the inventor Thomas Edison  - bringing light to the streets of the capital.  From that point through the first half of the twentieth century, coal provided pretty much all of the UK’s electricity, powering homes and businesses. In the early 1990s, coal began to be forced out of the electricity mix by gas, but coal still remained a crucial component of the UK grid for the next two decades. In 2012, it still generated 39% of the UK’s power. But the science around climate change was growing - it was clear that the world's greenhouse gas emissions needed to be reduced and as the dirtiest fossil fuel, coal was a major target. In 2008, the UK established its first legally binding climate targets and in 2015 the then-energy and climate change secretary, Amber Rudd, told the world the UK would be ending its use of coal power within the next decade.  Dave Jones, director of global insights at Ember, an independent energy think tank, said this really helped to ""set in motion"" the end of coal by providing a clear direction of travel for the industry.  But it also showed leadership and set a benchmark for other countries to follow, according to Lord Deben. ""I think it's made a big difference, because you need someone to point to and say, 'There, they've done it. Why can't we do it?'"", he said. In 2010, renewables generated just 7% of the UK’s power. By the first half of 2024, this had grown to more than 50% - a new record. The rapid growth of green power meant that coal could even be switched off completely for short periods, with the first coal-free days in 2017. The growth of renewables has been so successful that the target date for ending coal power was brought forward a year, and on Monday, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, was set to close. Chris Smith has worked at the plant for 28 years in the environment and chemistry team. She said: ""It is a very momentous day. The plant has always been running and we've always been doing our best to keep it operating....It is a very sad moment."" Lord Deben served in former prime minister Margaret Thatcher's government when many of the UK's coal mines were closed and thousands of workers lost their jobs. He said lessons had to be learnt from that for current workers in the fossil fuel industry. ""I'm particularly keen on the way in which this Government, and indeed the previous Government, is trying to make sure that the new jobs, of which there are very many green jobs, go to the places which are being damaged by the changes. ""So in the North Sea oil areas, that's exactly where we should be doing carbon capture and storage, it's where we should be putting wind and solar power,"" he said. Although coal is a very polluting source of energy, its benefit has been in being available at all times - unlike wind and solar which are limited by weather conditions.  Kayte O'Neill, the chief operating officer at the Energy System Operator - the body overseeing the UK's electricity system - said: ""There is a whole load of innovation required to help us ensure the stability of the grid. Keeping the lights on in a secure way."" A crucial technology providing that stability Kayte O'Neill spoke of is battery technology.  Dr Sylwia Walus, research programme manager at the Faraday Institution, said that there has been significant progress in the science of batteries. ""There is always scope for a new technology, but more focus these days is really how to make it more sustainable and cheaper in production,"" she said.  To achieve this the UK needs to become more independent of China in producing its own batteries and bringing in skilled workers for this purpose, she explained.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq8v5ww11no,Why does Leeds need so much student accommodation?,"With more than 80,000 students calling Leeds home, can the city's accommodation supply meet demand.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:28.657250,China News,BBC,China,"Leeds plays home to tens of thousands of university students each year and providing accommodation for them is big business, with schemes for over 17,000 bedspaces approved in recent years. But is demand outpacing the supply, or are the often enormous, and sometimes quite luxurious, blocks of student flats surplus to requirement? The University of Leeds is one of the largest universities in the UK, with more than 38,000 students from over 170 different countries.  In addition Leeds Beckett University attracts more than 29,000 while Leeds Trinity has about 9,575 students. Add on the 2,245 people studying at Leeds Arts and 1,500 at Leeds Conservatoire and the city plays host to roughly 80,000 each year - enough to fill Elland Road more than twice.  And, according to research from student housing charity Unipol, the city centre, Hyde Park, Woodhouse and south Headingley remain the most popular places for those students to live. Demand for accommodation in Leeds has always been high and is growing all the time. Research from Unipol suggests that between 2014/15 and 2022/23 the number of full-time students at The University of Leeds and Leeds Beckett rose by about 9,500 and is predicted to go up by another 4,000 by 2027/28. There has also been a big rise in the number of international students. Council figures suggest that between 2018/19 and 2022/23 the number of students coming from China to study at the University of Leeds rose by 39%. Meanwhile at Leeds Beckett the number of students coming from India rose from 100 to 1,709 over the same period, while the number of people coming from Nigeria up from 17 to 677. A Unipol report found that while the short term supply of student housing in Leeds could currently be met, longer-term there may be a shortage. The stereotypical squalor of student life may have been partially replaced by high rise city centre apartment blocks, but traditional student areas of Leeds such as Hyde Park and Headingley are still home to plenty of students living in shared houses. Council data shows that in 2023 there were around 56,750 bed spaces available to students in Inner North-West Leeds and the city centre, and 137,000 bed spaces in other parts of Leeds. But with a growing demand for rented accommodation among those not in education and unable to buy property coupled with a ban on creating additional Houses Of Multiple Occupancy (HMOs)  in some parts of the city, that stock is being squeezed. The council say the city's universities cannot ""comfortably"" rely on the private rented market to absorb student demand if the amount of purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) falls short.  Callum Pattison, 20, from Birmingham is in his second year studying Quantity Surveying at Leeds Beckett University living in the newly-opened Tribeka building in Cookridge Street. During his first year he lived in university accommodation in Woodhouse - a 20-minute walk from the city centre - but said that as he watched the Tribeka being built he realised how convenient it was. His £185-a-week en-suite room also comes with access to a gym, a sky terrace, pool tables, and a gaming area. Callum, who had been paying £186 for the university accommodation, said he ""definitely didn't want to share a bathroom"" and with all the added extras he felt the price ""wasn't bad"". According to Unipol, in 2022, the average rent for a room in a traditional shared house, including bills, was £115.27. Leoni Miller, a customer service assistant at the site, said students' expectations were much higher than 20 years ago, partly, she thought, as a result of the impact of social media. ""Everything is broadcast on social media so they want to do their skincare routine in a nice bathroom, post work outs in the gym in nice environment,"" she said. ""When we were young, you'd take a few pictures on your camera and that was it, but now literally everyone can see what you're doing and you want it to look good.  Other similar sized cities are facing similar challenges when it comes to student accommodation.  Nottingham also has two universities and the city council said the number of students needing accommodation in the city had grown from 40,000 to 51,000 since 2016.  Last year the council announced plans to combat the impact of the growing number of students on the private rental market, including efforts to provide an additional 9,500 bedspaces Councillor Toby Neal said the strategy would help neighbourhoods from being ""overpowered by one group of people"". In short, yes. Unipol say although mathematically there is enough PBSA and shared housing to meet demand there are warning signs the ""stock doesn't meet the needs, budgets and preferences of students"".  Their report highlights several challenges facing the sector, including competition from young workers for housing in Inner North West Leeds. It also notes, despite the move from shared housing to PBSA, a lack of ""moderately priced"" PBSA, saying the most recently planned and built accommodation is high spec and high cost. With further concerns about the impact of the Renters Reform Bill, which could bring in changes that some say would ""decimate"" the student housing market, the rate of building in Leeds shows no sign of slowing down.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3d4rz922do,Sabina Shoal: The new flashpoint between China and the Philippines,Both countries blame each other for repeated boat collisions near the shoal in recent days.,30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:28.748292,China News,BBC,China,"A new flashpoint has emerged in the ongoing maritime dispute between China and the Philippines, with both countries clashing over yet another spot in the South China Sea. Both China and the Philippines have staked their claims on various islands and zones in the Sea - their dispute increasingly escalating over the years with more vessel collisions, scuffles, and allegations of armed threats. But last week, things came to a head when Beijing and Manila's vessels collided near the Sabina Shoal- both accusing the other of ramming them on purpose.  The shoal, claimed by China as Xianbin Jiao and as Escoda Shoal by the Philippines, is located some 75 nautical miles from the Philippines' west coast and 630 nautical miles from China.  On 19 August, several Chinese and Philippine vessels collided near the shoal in the disputed Spratly Islands - an area rich in oil and gas, which has been claimed by both countries for years.  The Chinese coast guard said that the Philippine vessel ""deliberately collided"" into them, while the Philippines said the Chinese vessels were conducting ""aggressive manoeuvres"". A second round of collisions took place on Sunday, with both sides once again blaming each other. Several other countries including the UK, Japan, Australia and South Korea, as well as the EU, have criticised China's actions. On Monday, the Philippines said 40 Chinese ships prevented two of their boats from conducting a ""humanitarian mission"" to restock the Teresa Magbuana, a Philippine coast guard ship deployed months earlier to the shoal. China has defended its actions saying it acted lawfully and its ""manoeuvres on the spot were professional and appropriate"". Filipino Authorities eventually sent over supplies by helicopter - the Teresa Magbuana is a modern naval vessel equipped with a helipad.  The Philippines suspects China is attempting to reclaim land at Sabina Shoal. It has pointed to underwater mounds of crushed coral on Sabina's sandbars, which its coast guard filmed, saying Beijing is using that material to expand the shoal.  China has repeatedly rejected these accusations, saying they are ""groundless"" and ""unscientific"". On Friday authorities released a paper based on research by Chinese scientists, saying the sandbars' formation and development were ""in line with natural laws"", according to state media. Philippine authorities sent the Teresa Magbuana to Sabina in April as part of a prolonged presence they plan to maintain at the shoal. Manila sees it as key to their efforts to explore the Spratlys for oil and gas. China meanwhile sees the presence of the Teresa Magbuana as evidence of the Philippines' intentions to occupy the shoal. A recent commentary by Chinese state news outlet Xinhua pointed to a decrepit World War Two era ship grounded by the Philippines in 1999 on the Second Thomas Shoal, known in Chinese as the Ren'ai Jiao.  A handful of soldiers are still stationed there and require regular rations. For years, the ship has been a source of constant friction between both countries, with China routinely attempting to block re-supply missions to the ship. ""25 years on, it is still there. Clearly, the Philippines is attempting to repeat this scenario at Xianbin Jiao,"" said the commentary.  ""China will never be deceived by the Philippines again."" There has been a string of dangerous encounters in recent months as the two sides sought to enforce their claims on disputed reefs and outcrops, including the Second Thomas Shoal and the Scarborough Shoal. The collisions usually arise from the cat-and-mouse games the boats engage in, as they attempt to chase the other side away. China has increasingly blasted powerful water cannon and lasers at Philippine ships, with the Filipinos also accusing the Chinese of boarding their boats, leading to scuffles, as well as confiscating items and puncturing their inflatable vessels. One of the latest accusations from Manila was that Chinese coast guard personnel armed with knives, spears and swords boarded one of their military ships and threatened their soldiers. ""We are struggling against a more powerful adversary,"" the Philippines defence chief Gilberto Teodoro said on Tuesday, while appealing to the international community to issue ""a strong call-out against China"". So far there have been no fatalities, though the Philippines says several of its soldiers have sustained injuries. But President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has warned that any Filipino deaths resulting from China's actions would be considered an ""act of war"". China has repeatedly blamed the Philippines and also its ally the US. On Thursday a defence ministry spokesperson said Washington was ""emboldening"" Manila to make ""reckless provocations"". Observers worry the dispute could eventually spark a larger confrontation in the South China Sea. A previous attempt by the Philippines to get an independent arbitral tribunal to rule on the matter ended with the decision that China had no lawful claims within its so-called nine dash line, the boundary it uses to claim a large swathe of the South China Sea. Beijing refused to participate in the proceedings, and has also refused to recognise the ruling. But in recent weeks both countries have made an attempt to de-escalate the immediate conflicts out at sea. Last month they agreed to allow the Philippines to restock the outpost in the Second Thomas Shoal with food, supplies and personnel. Since then this has taken place with no reported clashes. The incidents at Sabina Shoal however raise the question of whether such attempts at de-escalation are effective when the dispute can simply shift to a new site. Correction 13 September 2024: This article originally reported that the Philippines attempted to get the UN to arbitrate – it has been updated to reflect that an independent tribunal, in which China refused to participate, ruled on the South China Sea dispute.

An employment tribunal in August found that 3,500 shop staff, who are predominantly female, had been discriminated against because they were paid less than their mainly male colleagues in warehouses.  In half-year results, Next said ""inevitably some of our stores will no longer be viable if this ruling is upheld on appeal"". At the same time, Next lifted its profit forecast for the current year to nearly £1bn. On Thursday, the retailer confirmed plans to appeal against the ruling, which could force it to pay-out more than £30m to 3,500 current and former workers. It has argued that warehouse workers are paid more than shop staff in the wider labour market. Next said it was ""very confident"" of its grounds for appeal, but it warned that ""in the possible (but unlikely) event"" that it loses ""there will be a financial cost to the group and its ongoing future operating costs"".  It said: ""Each of our stores is treated as a business in its own right, and must remain individually profitable if they are to open in the first place and continue trading at lease renewal."" Meanwhile, Next set out its results for the first half of its financial year.  Overall, Next's sales rose by 8% to £2.9bn in the six months to 27 July while pre-tax profits increased by 7.1% to £452m. The retailer lifted its full-year profit guidance by £15m to £995m. The retailer said overseas sales had risen in the first half thanks to the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and TikTok, which are ""exposing"" people to international fashion trends. It said it performed better in more affluent countries geographically closer to the UK, but said it was expanding further afield to India and targeting customers in Japan, China and Australia among others. ""Global entertainment is exposing people to international fashion trends in a way they never have been before - think of the global reach of Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube and TikTok,"" it said.  Next said: ""It appears that international tastes in clothing are converging more rapidly. ""International media and global brands expose us to new ideas. They also make looks that might otherwise seem too radical more acceptable."" Next said sales were highest in mainland Europe. Although it said: ""There is a marked difference between different cultures and climates"", adding: ""We tend to do much better in Northern Europe than Southern Europe"". The fastest growing market was in the Americas, where sales jumped by 67%. Next's overseas sales were mainly made up of its own-branded goods but said fashion firms it has bought in recent years - including Friends Like These, Cath Kidston and Reiss - have also grown in popularity, making up 42% of online sales. The company is planning to lift its overseas marketing spending from £24m to £41m. In the UK, sales of its own-branded clothing fell by 0.9%, which it put down to a cooler summer than the previous year."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2n091v4m5o,Canada hits China-made electric cars with 100% tariff,"The move comes after similar announcements, including in the US and European Union.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:28.935585,China News,BBC,China,"Canada says it will impose a 100% tariff on imports of China-made electric vehicles (EV) after similar announcements by the US and European Union. The country also plans to impose a 25% duty on Chinese steel and aluminium. Canada and its Western allies accuse China of subsidising its EV industry, giving its car makers an unfair advantage. China has called the move ""trade protectionism"" which ""violates World Trade Organization rules"". ""We are transforming Canada's automotive sector to be a global leader in building the vehicles of tomorrow, but actors like China have chosen to give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace"", said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canada's duties on Chinese EVs are due to come into effect on 1 October, while those on steel and aluminium will be implemented from 15 October. A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said Canada's actions ""seriously undermine the global economic system, and economic and trade rules"". ""China urges the Canadian side to immediately correct its erroneous practices,"" they added. China is Canada's second-largest trading partner, behind the US. In May, the US said it would quadruple its tariffs on imports of Chinese EVs to 100%. That was followed by the EU, which announced plans to impose duties on China-made EVs of up to 36.3%. Canada's tariffs on Chinese EVs will include those made by Tesla at its Shanghai factory. ""Tesla will almost certainly be lobbying the Canadian government to get some leeway on these tariffs, as they have already with Europe,"" said Mark Rainford, a China-based car industry commentator. ""If they fail at mitigating the tariff enough, they'll likely look at switching their Canadian imports to either the US or European factories since Canada is their 6th largest market this year and thus not insignificant."" Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment from BBC News. Earlier this month, the EU cut its planned extra tariff on China-made Teslas by more than half, after further investigations requested by Elon Musk's car maker. Chinese car brands are still not a common sight in Canada but some, like BYD, have taken steps to enter the country's market. China is the world's largest manufacturer of EVs and its car makers have quickly gained a significant share of the global market. Meanwhile, Canada has struck deals worth billions of dollars with major European car makers, as it tries to become a key part of the global EV industry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98ynejg4l5o,UK will give sovereignty of Chagos Islands to Mauritius,"In a historic move, the UK gives up sovereignty of a strategic group of islands in the Indian Ocean.",3 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:29.023351,China News,BBC,China,"The UK has announced it is giving up sovereignty of a remote but strategically important cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean after more than half a century. The deal – reached after years of negotiations - will see the UK hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a historic move. This includes the tropical atoll of Diego Garcia, used by the US government as a military base for its navy ships and long-range bomber aircraft. The announcement, made in a joint statement by the UK and Mauritian Prime Ministers, ends decades of often fractious negotiations between the two countries. The US-UK base will remain on Diego Garcia – a key factor enabling the deal to go forward at a time of growing geopolitical rivalries in the region between Western countries, India, and China. The deal is still subject to finalisation of a treaty, but both sides have promised to complete it as quickly as possible. ""This is a seminal moment in our relationship and a demonstration of our enduring commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rule of law,"" the statement from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth read. The leaders also said they were committed ""to ensure the long-term, secure and effective operation of the existing base on Diego Garcia which plays a vital role in regional and global security"". The treaty will also ""address wrongs of the past and demonstrate the commitment of both parties to support the welfare of Chagossians"". UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the benefits of the deal included closing ""a potential illegal migration route"". Dozens of Sri Lankan Tamils have been held in a fenced camp on the island for three years as complex legal battles are waged over their fate. It is unclear what the announcement will mean for them. The UK will provide a package of financial support to Mauritius, including annual payments and infrastructure investment. Mauritius will also be able to begin a programme of resettlement on the Chagos Islands, but not on Diego Garcia.  There, the UK will ensure operation of the military base for ""an initial period"" of 99 years.  US President Joe Biden welcomed the ""historic agreement"", saying it was a ""clear demonstration that through diplomacy and partnership, countries can overcome long-standing historical challenges to reach peaceful and mutually beneficial outcomes"". He said it secured the future of a key military base which ""plays a vital role in national, regional, and global security."" The Chagos islanders themselves – some in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others living in Crawley in Sussex – do not speak with one voice on the fate of their homeland. Some are determined to return to live on the isolated islands, some are more focused on their rights and status in the UK, while others argue that the archipelago’s status should not be resolved by outsiders. Isabelle Charlot, speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, said the deal brought back hopes her family could return to her father's island ""roots"". Plans for the Mauritius government to arrange resettlement would mean a ""place that we can call home - where we will be free,"" she said. But Frankie Bontemps, a second generation Chagossian in the UK, told the BBC that he felt ""betrayed"" and ""angry"" at the news because ""Chagossians have never been involved"" in the negotiations. ""We remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future"", he said, and called for the full inclusion of Chagossians in drafting the treaty. In recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory, with various United Nations bodies, including its top court and general assembly, overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius and demanding the UK surrender what some have called its ""last colony in Africa"". The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968.  At the time, the British government had already negotiated a secret deal with the US, agreeing to lease it the largest atoll, Diego Garcia, for use as a military base. Britain later apologised for forcibly removing more than 1,000 islanders from the entire archipelago and promised to hand the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for strategic purposes. But until very recently, the UK insisted that Mauritius itself had no legitimate claim to the islands. For decades, the tiny island nation of Mauritius struggled to win any serious international support on the issue. A handful of Chagos islanders, who’d been forced to abandon their homes in the late 1960s and early 70s, repeatedly took the British government to court. But it was only recently that international opinion began to shift. African nations began to speak with one voice on the issue, pushing the UK hard on the issue of decolonialisation.  Then Brexit left many European nations reluctant to continue backing the UK’s stance in international forums.  The Mauritian government went on the attack, accusing the UK government of verbal threats. And the Mauritians began to wage an increasingly sophisticated campaign – at the UN, in courts, and in the media – even landing and planting a flag on the archipelago without British authorisation. The negotiations that brought about Thursday's deal began under the previous UK government. But the timing of this breakthrough reflects a growing sense of urgency in international affairs, not least regarding Ukraine, with the UK keen to remove the Chagos issue as an obstacle to winning more global support, particularly from African nations, with the prospect of a second Trump presidency looming. A backlash from some voices in the UK can be expected, even though successive Conservative and Labour prime ministers have been working towards the same broad goal. Tory leadership candidate Tom Tugendhat argued the deal had been ""negotiated against Britain's interest"" and it was ""disgraceful"" that such talks had begun under the previous Conservative government. He called it a ""shameful retreat"" that leaves ""allies exposed"", while the former foreign secretary James Cleverly called it a ""weak"" deal. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the deal will ""address the wrongs against the Chagossians of the past but it looks like it will continue the crimes long into the future”. There must be meaningful consultations with the Chagossians or the UK, US and now Mauritius will be responsible for ""a still-ongoing colonial crime"", Clive Baldwin, senior legal advisor at HRW said in a statement. But there can be no doubting the historic significance of this moment. Half a century or more after the UK relinquished control over almost all its global empire, it has finally agreed to hand over one of the very last pieces. It has done so reluctantly, perhaps, but also peacefully and legally. The remaining British overseas territories are: Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Pitcairn, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands. There are also two sovereign base areas on Cyprus under British jurisdiction. Following the Chagos announcement, the governor of the Falklands said the islands are safe in British hands. ""The UK’s unwavering commitment to defend UK sovereignty [of the Falklands] remains undiminished"", Alison Blake said in a statement posted to social media. You can get in touch via this link."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy89ez894rko,Japan's scandal-hit ruling party picks next PM,"Shigeru Ishiba has been elected leader of the LDP, positioning him to be Japan's next prime minister.",27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:36.085178,China News,BBC,China,"Japan’s scandal-hit ruling party has elected Shigeru Ishiba as its new leader, positioning the former defence chief as Japan's next leader. Ishiba, 67, said he would clean up his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), revitalise the economy and address security threats after winning Friday's party election. Since the LDP has a parliamentary majority, its party chief will become prime minister and Ishiba is expected to be appointed to the role on Tuesday. The change of guard comes at a turbulent time for the party, which has been rocked by scandals and internal conflicts that disbanded its once-powerful factions. Nine candidates contested for the party leadership after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced last month that he would not stand for re-election. Ishiba led in most opinion polls, with this being his fifth and, he said, final bid to lead the LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war era. It headed into a run-off between Ishiba and Sanae Takaichi, 63, who vied to become Japan’s first female leader. ""We ought to be a party that lets members discuss the truth in a free and open manner, a party that is fair and impartial on all matters and a party with humility,"" he told a press conference. Ishiba is in favour of allowing female emperors – a hugely controversial issue opposed by many LDP member and successive governments. His blunt candour and public criticism of Prime Minister Kishida – a rarity in Japanese politics – has rankled fellow party members while resonating with members of the public. Ishiba is well-versed on the machinations of party politics as well as security policies. He said Japan must strengthen its security in view of recent incursions from Russia and China into Japan's territory and North Korea's missile tests. At a moment of flux within the LDP, he offers a safe pair of hands and stability. What he doesn’t offer is a fresh face for an organisation desperate to reinvent itself and regain public trust amid a stagnant economy, struggling households and a series of political scandals. His economic strategy includes boosting wages to counter rising prices. He has said that he reads three books a day and that he prefers doing that instead of mingling with his party colleagues. Takaichi, on the other hand, was one of two women vying for the LDP leadership, but was also among the more conservative of the candidates. A close ally to late former prime minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi's positions on women's issues are in line with the LDP's policy of having women serve in their traditional roles of being good mothers and wives. She opposes legislation allowing women to retain their maiden name as well as allowing female emperors. Consistent among the frontrunners, however, was a pledge to overhaul the LDP - which has held power almost continuously since it was formed in 1955 - in the face of public fury and plummeting approval ratings. ""In the upcoming presidential election, it's necessary to show the people that the Liberal Democratic Party will change,"" Kishida said at a press conference last month, when announcing his decision not to run for another term. The LDP leadership contest is not just a race for the top job, but also an attempt to regain public trust that the party has haemorrhaged over the past few months amid a stagnant economy, struggling households and a series of political scandals. Chief among these scandals are revelations regarding the extent of influence that Japan’s controversial Unification Church wields within the LDP, as well as suspicions that party factions underreported political funding over the course of several years. The fallout from the political funding scandal led to the dissolution of five out of six factions in the LDP – factions that have long been the party’s backbone, and whose support is typically crucial to winning an LDP leadership election. Perhaps more salient in the minds of the Japanese public, however, are the country's deepening economic woes. In the wake of the Covid pandemic, average Japanese families have been feeling the pinch as they struggle with a weak yen, a stagnant economy and food prices that are soaring at the fastest rate in almost half a century. Meanwhile, data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows that wages in Japan have barely changed in 30 years. That drawn-out slump, coupled with 30-year-high inflation, is tightening the screws on Japanese households and prompting calls for government help. It's also damaging the LDP's historically favourable standing among voters. “People are tired of the LDP,” Mieko Nakabayashi, former opposition MP and political science professor at Tokyo’s Waseda University, told the BBC. “They’re frustrated with the inflation that they are facing currently and the so-called ‘lost 30 years’. The Japanese currency is low, lots of imports got expensive with inflation, and many people see it.” Another major agenda item is the issue of Japan’s ageing and shrinking population, which puts pressure on social and medical services and presents a real challenge for the country’s medium and long-term workforce. Whoever takes charge of the LDP, and in turn government, will have to rethink how Japan operates its labour market and whether it should shift its attitudes towards immigration. It’s a desperately needed recalibration in the lead-up to the Japanese general election, which is set to take place by October 2025 – or sooner, as some of the candidates have indicated. Koizumi, for example, has said that he would call a general election soon after the LDP contest. The last two weeks of campaigning for the LDP leadership are seen by experts as an audition for the general election. For that reason, candidates have been presenting themselves not only to fellow party members but also to the public, in an attempt to win over the electorate. “The public are changing,” Kunihiko Miyake, a visiting professor at Kyoto’s Ritsumeikan University who has worked closely with both Abe and Kishida, told the BBC. “It’s time for the conservative politics in this country to adapt to a new political environment and political battlefield.” The other seven candidates in the first round were 43-year-old Shinjiro Koizumi, the youngest candidate; Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, 71, who is the other female candidate; Digital Transformation Minister Taro Kono, 61; Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, 63; Toshimitsu Motegi, 68, the LDP's secretary-general; Takayuki Kobayashi, 49, a former economic security minister; and Katsunobu Kato, 68, a former chief cabinet secretary. Four of the nine have served as foreign minister; three as defence minister."

A Foreign Office spokesperson accused Russia of making ""malicious and completely baseless accusations"" against its staff, after Moscow claimed the diplomats were engaged in spying. A statement accused Russia of carrying out a ""malicious and deliberate public campaign of aggression against the UK"". Russia revoked the accreditation of the diplomats on 13 September, with the country's secret service, the FSB, saying it had received documents indicating Britain's involvement in inflicting ""a strategic defeat"" on Russia. In a statement, the Foreign Office spokesperson said the Kremlin was acting against an international treaty governing diplomatic relations. Russia was carrying out a ""deliberate campaign"" aimed at undermining and threatening the UK's security, as well as deterring its support for Ukraine, the spokesperson added. The Foreign Office said this campaign was being carried out through ""disinformation, acts of sabotage in Europe and direct harassment and restrictions against our diplomatic missions in Russia"". ""This campaign will not succeed. Russia must stop this activity immediately,"" the statement added.  A news crew stationed outside the Foreign Office building in London were told by police on Wednesday afternoon the ambassador, Andrei Kelin, had been and left a few hours earlier. Diplomatic accreditation is given by the host nation to recognise a person’s diplomatic status, as set out by the UN. Without it, a person does not have official diplomatic status. While the BBC understands the diplomats involved left Russia many weeks before being officially expelled, Moscow's announcement coincided with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to Washington, where he met US President Joe Biden. They were due to discuss whether to allow Ukraine to fire Western long-range missiles at targets inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested ahead of this trip that Moscow would regard this as a serious escalation in the war, which equates to the ""direct participation"" of Nato countries. The diplomats involved, who were were named and pictured on Russian state TV, were the latest in a serious of similar expulsions - which have become increasingly common since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Earlier this year, British diplomat Capt Adrian Coghill was given a week to leave Russia, days after the Russian defence attaché was expelled from London for alleged espionage as an ""undeclared military intelligence officer""."

David Bottomley, 53, and his son Clayton, 17, died when the platform fell 14 storeys at the Unity Building in Liverpool in May 2021. The inquest heard pinion shafts - two key parts of the platform - in both motors which moved it had cracked, meaning the brakes would not work. Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector Andrew Crouch told the inquest jury: ""The pinion shaft in both gear boxes had fractured and failed and that was the principal finding [of the HSE investigation]."" Mr Crouch said the pinion shaft failures had separated both brakes from the platform's drive mechanism so the brakes would have had no effect. He added the shafts must have failed at different times and it was impossible to say how long the first had failed before the second. The inspector said although there was no specific explanation for the fracture, a metallurgist at the HSE had determined that it was due to ""fatigue"". It was made in China and supplied by a company called Adastra. Questioned by barrister Richard Copnall, representing the Bottomley family, Mr Crouch agreed that a manual issued by the supplier recommended carrying out a brake test at least every day as a minimum, and before every ascent. Mr Crouch agreed such a test would have revealed that a brake had failed. He concurred with Mr Copnall the platform did not have a legally required system which monitored how much power each motor was using - alerting the platform users to a problem. ""If this system is in place, this accident would not have happened?"" asked Mr Copnall, to which Mr Crouch agreed. The inquest continues.

David McKeown took bronze not in the sporting world but in the WorldSkills 2024 competition - known as the ""skills Olympics"". The 20-year-old came third for Team UK in autobody repair at the competition in France. David McKeown joined 1,500 other competitors from 80 nations competing in a range of skills disciplines at the 'skills Olympics' in Lyon. He said he was ""overwhelmed"" when he heard his name being called out for the bronze accolade.  ""I was glad it paid off because it is easy for it to not pay off. It felt like it was finally worth the pain it took,"" Mr McKeown added. The bronze medal came after three years of success in regional and national competition, followed by squad selection and a period of intense training. He was inspired to get involved in autobody repair by his father's business in Broughshane, County Antrim. “My brother is a painter, so whenever I was in school he always said 'I’ll run the paint end and you run the panel end'.  ""He’s a really good painter and I wanted to be a good panel man.  ""But I wanted it proved that I was the best panel man."" He said his next dream is to travel across the world and start his own business, such as an autobody repair company. “You have to believe you will go to any length to make it come true, you have to always stick by that,"" he said. ""There’s a lot of late nights in training and a lot of early mornings. “Mindset is a massive part of the competition, to just show up and believe that you have what it takes.  ""Walking in on that Wednesday morning whenever we started competing, if you don’t have that you’re kind of beat already mentally.  ""Your mentality and adrenaline is the only friends you have in there to keep you going.” The idea of the competition is to showcase the wide variety of talents held by apprentices and young professionals in areas such as engineering, construction and computer coding. WorldSkills UK, a government funded charity, selects, trains and manages the team. Ben Blackledge, chief executive of WorldSkills UK, said he was delighted Team UK had finished in the top 10 of the medal table. ""High quality skills development is crucial to growing the economy, and Team UK’s medal-winning performance in front of a global audience sends a strong message that the UK is a world-class place to invest, develop talent and create jobs,"" he said, The next WorldSkills competition is to take place in Shanghai in China in 2026."

Zhao is entered to play in the WPBSA Q Tour event in Bulgaria, which starts on 20 September in Sofia. The 27-year-old was given a ban of one year and eight months, reduced from two and a half years after his early admissions and guilty plea. He had to pay Â£7,500 in costs.

Julian Trevelyan, from St Albans, entered the selection rounds earlier this year, but failed to win a place. A fortnight ago, he was on honeymoon in France when he got an email to say another contestant had dropped out due to visa issues - and could he take their place? ""I hadn't touched the piano for a few weeks,"" he tells BBC News. ""So I've only had two weeks to prepare four hours of music. But I feel wonderful to be here."" With so little time to rehearse, the 25-year-old said he was approaching the competition as a ""chance to play for a home audience"" and get some exposure, rather than an opportunity to win one of classical music's most prestigious awards. ""I want the audience enjoy what I'm doing and hopefully get some concerts from it,"" he says.  ""I really wasn't thinking that I would even get to semi-final, let alone have a chance at a prize."" ""For me, music is about touching people's hearts. As Beethoven said, the only wrong notes are those played without feeling.""  Over the years, the Leeds International Piano Competition has launched the careers of artists including Andras Schiff, Eric Lu and Murray Perahia; and comes with a £30,000 prize. Open to pianists under the age of 30 from around the world, it was established in 1961 by the renowned piano teacher Dame Fanny Waterman. Trevelyan says he has wanted to take part ever since he heard Russia's Sofya Gulyak become the contest's first female winner in 2009. ""I remember listening to the coverage and I said to my piano teacher, 'I would love to play in the finals one day',"" he says.  ""That was 15 years ago and it feels like a dream come true to be here now."" For this weekend's final, he goes up against the following contestants: Like his fellow finalists, Trevelyan is no stranger to international competitions.  In 2015, at the age of 16, he became the youngest prize-winner in the piano category of the Long-Thibaud-Crespin Competition in Paris. A year later, he was a finalist in the BBC's Young Musician. For his latest final, he will play Bartók’s Concerto No.3, accompanied by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.  ""It's always been one of my favourite pieces,"" says the musician. ""My dad gave me the score when I was eight and he said, 'I hope one day you'll play it', and I've been thinking about it ever since.  ""So when I was given only a few weeks to prepare for Leeds, it was the obvious choice."" Classical music fans may know that Bartók wrote the concerto during the final months of his life, as a surprise birthday present for his second wife Ditta Pásztory-Bartók. Did that backstory contribute to his decision to play it at Leeds, given that he had to cut short his honeymoon? ""Yes, somewhat,"" he laughs. ""Although hopefully I won't die like Bartok did before he got to play it."" And, he adds, his wife is behind him all the way. ""Luckily enough, the competition called two days before the end of the honeymoon,  so we'd already had a good time.  ""And there was an excitement that I'm going to Leeds, because I've been talking about it a lot to her. She's very happy that I'm here."" The finals of the piano competition take place on Friday 20 and Saturday 21 September, with highlights broadcast on BBC Radio 3. For the first time, the contest will be held at the historic St George’s Hall in Bradford, while Leeds Town Hall undergoes renovation."

The sale of the fruit at Harrods for £80 ($104) per box of three marks the first time peaches from Fukushima have been available in a European store.  The meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's reactors after a devastating tsunami caused a radiation leak that is still being dealt with to this day. Since 2011, farms in the region - which is the second-largest producer of peaches in Japan - have struggled to sell their produce because of contamination fears. The peaches' sale at Harrods is part of efforts by the power plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), to restore the region's reputation internationally. It comes two years after the UK lifted its last import restrictions on Fukushima food products and following trial sales at cultural events.  Harrods is due to also begin selling a variety of grape called the Shine Muscat from the region in October. Tepco has also staged similar campaigns in countries including the US and Thailand. All farm and fishery produce exported from the area now has to undergo radiation testing. However, anxiety about the lasting effects of radiation in Fukushima remains.  The Japanese government's announcement last year that it would release treated waste water from the nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean proved highly controversial, despite having the backing of a United Nations nuclear watchdog. China, which was the biggest buyer of seafood from Japan, responded by blocking imports. Russia also suspended imports, accusing Tokyo of not being transparent in its plans to release the treated water. The US military in Japan later began bulk buying the seafood. Meanwhile, efforts to clean up the Fukushima Daiichi power plant are continuing. An operation to remove a small amount of radioactive debris was restarted on Tuesday. It will be used to try to assess the conditions inside the nuclear reactors. The first trial to remove debris was suspended last month because problems arose with the equipment.  It is the first time that efforts to remove material have been made in the 13 years since the disaster. The levels of radiation inside the reactors are so high that specialised robots have had to be built to withstand the conditions. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g022m0kmro,Sudan army vows to fight on despite peace efforts,Fresh diplomatic attempts to negotiate a cessation of hostilities have failed to make progress.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:36.886810,China News,BBC,China,"A  top Sudanese general has said the army will press on with its offensive despite international efforts to broker a ceasefire in the 17-month civil war. “Peace talks can go on, but the army will not stop for that,” Assistant Commander-in-Chief Lt Gen Ibrahim Gabir told the BBC. He was speaking just days after the army launched an  operation to regain control of the capital, Khartoum, from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The two sides have been fighting since April last year, when their leaders fell out over the country's future. This has created a humanitarian catastrophe with more than half the country facing hunger and millions forced from their homes. The general also hinted in the wide-ranging interview that the Sudanese authorities had had weapons dealings with Iran, and denied there was famine in the country. “When the parties agree [to a ceasefire], the army can stop,” he said, repeating army demands that the RSF withdraw from areas that it has occupied. “Let the international community exert pressure on the militia to stop the fighting and leave the houses that it’s taken,” he said, adding he was “more confident” now that the army had the momentum. Fresh diplomatic attempts to negotiate a cessation of hostilities have failed to make progress, the US Sudan Envoy Tom Perriello acknowledged this week. ""The situation is extremely dire and those who are in the best position to stop it seem eager instead to accelerate it,” he told journalists in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. He did cite some improvement on humanitarian access, noting that a couple of hundred trucks carrying aid had been able to get through to areas that were previously blocked. “But we obviously need to be at a significantly different scale from that,” he said. For many months the army had prevented the shipment of aid via a crucial border post controlled by the RSF between Chad and Darfur. In August it agreed to allow them to resume, and the RSF promised to facilitate deliveries in the areas it holds. Gen Gabir denied allegations that the army was still dragging its feet in approving the necessary paperwork for humanitarian groups, reeling off the number of visas and permits issued. He emphasised that the RSF had looted humanitarian goods, and was still preventing aid from entering the besieged city of el-Fasher in North Darfur. And he repeated army denials that there was famine in the country, again blaming the RSF for the hunger crisis. In August, a group of UN-backed experts concluded there were famine conditions in the Zamzam camp for displaced people outside el-Fasher. It was able to make the determination because it had the data to do so, but said other parts of Sudan were also at risk. But the Sudanese government has not made an official declaration of famine, which could trigger a UN Security Council resolution empowering agencies to deliver relief across borders. The army is focused on Darfur’s border with Chad because it says this is a conduit for mercenaries, and weapons supplied in particular by the United Arab Emirates. The UAE’s alleged support for the RSF “makes a very big difference in the fighting of the war”, Gen Gabril said. “Because the RSF is a militia, and they are being supported with advanced hi-tech arms. But at the end of the day they won’t win the war, this is a militia.” The UAE denies such support for the RSF, but the UN says there is credible evidence. A recent investigation published in the New York Times presented extensive detail. And a report by the New York-based NGO Human Rights Watch has documented visual evidence of weapons from the UAE, as well as from China, Iran, Russia and Serbia, with manufacturing dates from last year. Gen Gabir suggested that the army had discussed weapons purchases with Iran. “You can find weapons if you have money and facilitation of payment,” he said. “Iran will not give you any weapons unless you pay in cash. And we don’t have cash… The most important thing is that we are a government, and we have a right to deal with everybody.” The general denied accusations of war crimes made in a recent UN report, which cited evidence of indiscriminate bombing, attacks on schools and hospitals, and arbitrary detention and torture. “The Sudanese army are not angels,” he said. “They can commit crimes, but it’s individuals I'm talking about.” He would not venture to predict how long the war might go on – another Sudanese defence official cited for comparison America’s 20-year-long battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan when asked. All previous Sudanese civil wars have lasted many years, says the Sudan War Monitor, a group of researchers tracking the conflict. “The main factor making this a protracted war is that Sudan is a huge country and both warring parties are large, making it impossible for any single battle to determine the outcome of the war,” it told the BBC in an email. For Gen Gabir, the end game was clear: “Sudan will conquer, and Sudan will be rebuilt.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

The 53-year-old fiction writer is a former winner of the Man Booker International Prize for her 2007 novel The Vegetarian. At the ceremony she was praised “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life”. The Nobel Prize committee has awarded the literary award since 1901 and this marks the 18th time a woman has won the prize. She has won 11m krona (£810,000) which is the amount awarded to each Nobel Prize winner this year.  Han is the first South Korean winner of the prize, who was described by the Nobel Prize board as someone who has ""devoted herself to music and art"". The statement also added that her work crosses boundaries by exploring a broad span of genres - these include violence, grief and patriarchy. A turning point for her career came in 2016, when she won the International Man Booker prize for The Vegetarian - a book which had been released nearly a decade before, but was first translated into English in 2015 by Deborah Smith. It depicts the violent consequences for a woman who refuses to submit to the norms of food intake. Han's other works include The White Book, Human Acts and Greek Lessons. Swedish Academy permanent secretary Mats Malm said at the ceremony that ""she wasn't really prepared"" to win the prize. Committee chair Anders Olsen also said she ""confronts historical traumas and invisible sets of rules and, in each of her works, exposes the fragility of human life"". He praised her ""poetic and experimental style"", and called her ""an innovator in contemporary prose"".  The chair added she has ""unique awareness of the connections between body and soul, the living and the dead"". Han is the first female recipient of the literature prize since 2022, when it was awarded to French writer Annie Ernaux. She is also the first female Nobel laureate this year. The prize is awarded for a body of work, rather than a single item - there is no shortlist and it is notoriously difficult to predict. Han is the daughter of novelist Han Seung-won and was born in the South Korean city of Gwangju. She moved to capital Seoul at a young age and studied Korean literature at a university in the city. Her first published works were five poems in 1993, and she made her debut in fiction the following year with a short story. Han, who has taught creative writing at the Seoul Institute of the Arts and is writing her sixth novel, has been published in more than 30 languages.  Last year's prize was won by Norwegian writer Jon Fosse, and previous winners include Toni Morrison, Doris Lessing, Kazuo Ishiguro, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Bob Dylan."

Hull-born Ms Johnson made history in 1930 when she became the first woman to fly her Gypsy Moth plane called Jason the 11,000-mile (18,000 km) route solo. The map, marked with distances and compass bearings, is one of several items donated to the collection at Sewerby Hall Museum near Bridlington by an Australian donor. Councillor Barbara Jefferson, East Riding of Yorkshire Council’s cabinet member for heritage and coastal, said the “generous donation has made a significant difference” to the collection. The items have been donated by Susan Robey. They were originally acquired by her mother, Sanja Robey, who was also a pilot, at an auction in 1994. They were previously part of a collection belonging to Australian pilot wing commander Ronald Gordon, who met Ms Johnson during her time down under. Included in the donation is Mr Gordon’s log book, which records a flight he took with Ms Johnson at Laverton, Victoria, three weeks after her record flight in 1930. The rolled map is the only known section of her Australia flight map to have survived.  Other items donated include: Ms Johnson died when her plane crashed into the sea off Herne Bay on 5 January 1941. Ms Jefferson added: “The new items help to paint a clearer picture of Amy Johnson’s extraordinary career as a pioneering pilot and navigator, bringing this piece of history to life.’’ Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ezre8xr4o,Japan firm says it stopped making walkie-talkies used in Lebanon blasts,A Japanese firm whose name was on devices that exploded says it discontinued them a decade ago.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:46.709581,China News,BBC,China,"A Japanese handheld radio manufacturer has distanced itself from walkie-talkies bearing its logo that exploded in Lebanon, saying it discontinued production of the devices a decade ago. At least 20 people were killed and 450 injured after hundreds of walkie-talkies, some reportedly used by the armed group Hezbollah, exploded across Lebanon on Wednesday. The devices, according to photos and video of the aftermath of the attack, appear to be IC-V82 transceivers made by Icom, an Osaka-based telecommunications manufacturer. But Icom says it hasn’t produced or exported IC-V82s, nor the batteries needed to operate them, for 10 years. It is the second Asian company to be embroiled in bombing incidents in Lebanon this week, after thousands of exploding pagers seemingly linked to Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo killed at least 12 people and injured more than 2,000. Gold Apollo's founder Hsu Ching-Kuang flatly denied his company had anything to do with the attacks, saying he licensed his trade mark to a company in Hungary called BAC Consulting, whom the BBC has been unable to contact.  Icom told the BBC it was aware of reports that two-way radio devices bearing its logo had exploded in Lebanon, and said it was investigating the matter. ""The IC-V82 is a handheld radio that was produced and exported, including to the Middle East, from 2004 to October 2014. It was discontinued about 10 years ago, and since then, it has not been shipped from our company,” Icom said in a statement. “The production of the batteries needed to operate the main unit has also been discontinued, and a hologram seal to distinguish counterfeit products was not attached, so it is not possible to confirm whether the product shipped from our company.” Icom further added that all its radios are manufactured at the same factory in Japan, and that it only sells products for overseas markets via authorised distributors. Earlier, a sales executive at the US subsidiary of Icom told The Associated Press news agency that the exploded radio devices in Lebanon appeared to be knockoff products that were not made by the company – adding that it was easy to find counterfeit versions online. The device is favoured by amateur radio operators and for use in social or emergency communications, including by people tracking tornadoes or hurricanes, he said. It took the BBC a matter of seconds to find Icom IC-V82s listed for sale in online marketplaces. It is unclear at which point in the supply chain these devices were compromised and how. It is also unclear if some of them were merely old Icom IC-V82s, or counterfeits as Mr Novak claimed.   Lebanon’s Annahar newspaper on Wednesday said the Icom walkie-talkies were old handsets. Reports suggest the walkie-talkies that exploded were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, according to a security source speaking to Reuters news agency. Icom produces walkie-talkies and radio devices for marine, aviation and land users, and considers itself a ""world leader in the amateur radio market"", according to its website. Asia is considered a global hub for telecoms and electronics, with countries like Japan, Taiwan and China being home to major tech producers that are often favoured as a benchmark of quality. BBC Verify investigated BAC Consulting, the company linked to the pagers involved in Tuesday's explosions, and found that the firm has a single shareholder and is registered to a building in the Hungarian capital Budapest's 14th district. As well as BAC, a further 13 companies and one person are registered at the same building. BBC Verify's search of a financial information database, however, does not reveal that BAC has any connections to other companies or people. Its CEO Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono said she knew nothing about the explosions. “I don’t make the pagers. I am just the intermediate. I think you got it wrong,"" she told NBC."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74jgk1kw87o,Chinese giant Chery could build cars in UK,"Chery is weighing up the possibility of building cars in the UK, according to a senior executive.",8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:46.810905,China News,BBC,China,"Chinese car giant Chery is weighing up the possibility of building cars in the UK, according to a senior executive. Its UK head Victor Zhang told the BBC it was a ""matter of time"" before the company made a final decision. He said Chery, which is already preparing to build cars in Spain, was determined to take a ""localised"" approach to the European market. Mr Zhang denied the company’s exports had benefitted from unfair subsidies. Chery, which was set up in 1997, is one of China’s largest car companies. It is already the country’s biggest exporter of vehicles, but has ambitious plans to expand further. To help take that plan forward, it has set up two new brands focused entirely on the international market, Omoda and Jaecoo. Last month, Omoda was officially launched in the UK. It has begun selling a mainstream SUV, the Omoda 5, in both electric and petrol-powered versions. It has built a network of 60 dealerships, and hopes to have more than 100 here by the end of the year. But it is far from the only Chinese manufacturer to see the British market as potentially lucrative.  BYD, which has been vying with Tesla for the title of the world's biggest manufacturer of electric cars, has also opened dozens of dealerships here.  SAIC is already well-established in the UK, selling cars under the classic British MG marque.  Cars for sale in Europe are currently built at Chery’s manufacturing HQ in Wuhu, in Eastern China. But that situation is expected to change. The company already has a deal with the Spanish firm EV Motors, which will allow Omoda and Jaecoo models to be built at a former Nissan factory in Barcelona. But it wants to establish other bases as well. Earlier this year, the company said the UK could also be a candidate for an assembly plant. That option remains on the table. “Barcelona, this is something we are already commited to”, explained Mr Zhang “For the UK, we are also evaluating. To be honest, we are open for all options and opportunities. “So I think it’s just a matter of time. If everything is ready, we will do it”. A spokesperson from the Department for Business described the UK's auto sector as ""thriving"". ""While we cannot speculate on commercial investment decisions, we welcome Chery International's Omoda launch in the UK and would positively view any new investment in the UK,"" they said.  But the UK is not the only country on Chery’s list. It has also been talking to the Italian government about setting up production in Italy, for example. Mr Zhang denied the decision would come down to whichever country was able to offer the best incentives. “For such a big investment project, it’s a combination of factors”, he said. “It’s not just government policy or incentives. You also need to look at the market itself; education, because you need good talented people such as engineers and factory workers; there’s also supply chain, logistics. ""So there will be many factors involved in our final decision”. The pressure to set up manufacturing bases in Europe has increased since July, when the EU imposed steep tariffs, or taxes, on imports of electric vehicles from China. This was done, Brussels said, because carmakers in China were benefitting from ""unfair subsidies"" which allowed their cars to be sold abroad very cheaply, undermining local manufacturers. China accused the EU of protectionism. By building its products in Europe, Chery would avoid paying those tariffs. But Mr Zhang insisted his company was always committed to local production. “We are not trying to use any unfair methods”, he insisted. “We want to be adaptable to the local market, and provide the best products, using the best dealerships. To be localised is the only strategy for the long term,"" he said. The UK has yet say whether it will take a similar approach with tariffs of its own. China's domestic car market is vast, with more than 30 million vehicles sold each year.  Its stake in the global market is also already significant, with roughly 5 million cars exported last year. That was a 64% increase on the year before.  In the UK, Chinese brands still account for a relatively small proportion of cars sold, around 5%. But established carmakers are concerned that figure could grow quickly, with the prices offered by Chinese brands expected to play a key role."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm280my1178o,Jane Austen fans enjoy afternoon tea in regency attire,Hundreds of literary enthusiasts took to the streets to pay homage to their literary hero.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:46.916294,China News,BBC,China,"Fans of one of England's most celebrated novelists have taken to the streets dressed in regency attire, to pay homage to their literary hero.  The annual Jane Austen Festival in Bath runs until 22 September. Around 3,500 people are expected to attend over the 10-day event. More than 100 people, dressed in period clothing, lined the platform at Bath Spa station to board a train to Trowbridge.  There, they enjoyed a guided tour of Wiltshire's Georgian buildings in the Heritage Quarter, before sitting down for afternoon tea at the historic Parade House. Jane Austen's novels, set amid the English middle and upper classes, are famous for their social observation and witty insights into the lives of early 19th century women. Her plots often explore women's dependence on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her most notable works include Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), Emma (1815), Persuasion and Northanger Abbey (both 1817).  The first Jane Austen Festival in 2001 took place over one weekend at The Jane Austen Centre in Bath, and has since grown into a 10-day programme. The festival is usually based in Bath but last year the organisers wanted to expand the popular event to the wider region. Guests enjoyed an afternoon tea with champagne at the Grade I Listed Parade House, before playing regency parlour games in the first floor ballroom.  Parade House was built for a wealthy clothier in 1720 and has been restored to its former glory by its current owners, boasting its original features, a selection of antiques, and a grand sweeping staircase. It is thought that the novelist herself would stop off at the venue on her journeys from Hampshire to Bath. The event holds the Guinness World Record for the ""largest gathering of people dressed in regency costumes"".  Full of bonnets, soldiers, and drummers, the backdrop of Georgian Bath transports visitors back to the time of Jane Austen. Follow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyznjz3d78o,Left-leaning leader wins Sri Lanka election in political paradigm shift,Anura Kumara Dissanayake beat his rivals after a historic second round of vote counting.,22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:47.021340,China News,BBC,China,"Left-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake has won Sri Lanka’s presidential election after a historic second round of counting. No candidate won more than 50% of the total votes in the first round, where Dissanayake got 42.31% while his closest rival, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, got 32.76%. But Dissanayake, who promised voters good governance and tough anti-corruption measures, emerged as winner after the second count, which tallied voters' second and third choice candidates. The election on Saturday was the first to be held since mass protests unseated the country's leader, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, in 2022 after Sri Lanka suffered its worst economic crisis. Dissanayake, 55, told Sri Lankans ""this victory belongs to us all"", in a message on the social media platform X. Once preferences had been tallied, the Election Commission said he had won a total of  5,740,179 votes to Premadasa's 4,530,902.  To revive the economy, Dissanayake has promised to develop the manufacturing, agriculture and IT sectors. He has also committed to continuing the deal struck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to bail Sri Lanka out of the economic crisis while reducing the impact of its austerity measures on the country’s poorest. Until this weekend's vote, all of Sri Lanka's eight presidential elections since 1982 have seen the winner emerge during the first round of counting. This poll has been described as one of the closest in the country's history. Seventeen million Sri Lankans were eligible to vote on Saturday and the country's elections commission said it was the most peaceful in the country's history. Still, police announced a curfew late Saturday night citing ""public safety"". It was lifted at noon local time (06:30 GMT). Dissanayake promised voters tough anti-corruption measures and good governance - messages that resonated strongly with voters who have been clamouring for systematic change since the crisis. This enabled him to overcome trepidation over the violent past of his political party, the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which carried out two armed insurrections against the Sri Lankan state in the 1970s and 80s. His alliance, the National People’s Power – of which the JVP is a part – rose to prominence during the 2022 protests, known as the Aragalaya – Sinhala for struggle. He has also sought to moderate the hard left stance of his party, in more recent years. Early results showed him rocketing to the lead, prompting several high-profile figures - including the country's foreign minister - to congratulate him. But he lost some ground to Premadasa as voting continued, prompting the need for the second round of counting. Incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe won 17% of the vote, putting him in third place in the polling. He was eliminated from the second count, which was only between the two frontrunners. Wickremesinghe congratulated his successor. ""With much love and respect for this beloved nation, I hand over its future to the new president,"" Wickremesinghe said in a statement.  The country's new president will be faced with the twin tasks of reviving the economy and lifting millions from crushing poverty. An economic meltdown fuelled the Aragalaya (struggle) uprising that unseated Rajapaksa from the presidential palace in 2022. At that time, Sri Lanka's foreign currency reserves had dried up, leaving the country unable to import essentials such as fuel. Public debt had ballooned to $83bn while inflation zoomed to 70%.   This made basics such as food and medicine unaffordable to ordinary people. The country's economic misery has been blamed on major policy errors, weak exports and years of under-taxation. This was exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which choked tourism, a key economic driver. But many people have also blamed corruption and mismanagement, stoking anger against Rajapaksa and his family, who collectively ruled Sri Lanka for more than 10 years.  ""The most serious challenge is how to restore this economy,"" Dr Athulasiri Samarakoon, a political scientist at the Open University of Sri Lanka, told the BBC Sinhala Service. During his term, Wickremesinghe had secured a $2.9bn lifeline from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is crucial to opening additional funding channels, but comes with strict economic and governance policy reforms. Sri Lanka is restructuring the terms of its debt payments with foreign and domestic lenders, as mandated by the IMF. The main focus has been the country's $36bn in foreign debt, of which $7bn is owed to China, its largest bilateral creditor. Like Dissanayake, Premadasa has also pushed for IT, as well as the establishment of 25 new industrial zones. He said tourism should be supported so that it becomes the country's top foreign currency earner. Wickremesinghe said during the campaign he would double tourist arrivals and establish a national wealth fund, as well as new economic zones to increase growth.   Additional reporting by BBC Sinhala"

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg58m308glro,Top-level meeting shows China - and Xi - still a priority for Biden,"Jake Sullivan is on his first visit to China as national security adviser, for talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:53.948545,China News,BBC,China,"Jake Sullivan has been welcomed to China on his first visit as US national security adviser. He will hold talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi as the two countries try to stabilise relations. Mr Sullivan and Mr Wang have met four times over 16 months in Vienna, Malta, Washington and Bangkok. Their last meeting in January was shortly after a high-stakes summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden that sought to reset frosty ties.  This week's talks - scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday - signal that China is still a priority for the Biden administration, even as the retiring president enters his final  months in office.  Both Mr Sullivan and Mr Wang have already acknowledged a need to find common ground after disagreements between their nations. Could another presidential summit be on the cards?  The White House is trying not to explicitly link Mr Sullivan's trip to the US presidential election. But it's hard to ignore the timing.  If Mr Sullivan is able to lay the groundwork for a final Biden-Xi summit, his trip would tie up the ends of the US president's most consequential - and fraught - foreign policy relationship.  US and Chinese diplomats always acknowledge that talks between Washington and Beijing are never easy. And there is a lot to talk about.  With the unexpected turn the US election has taken with Biden bowing out in favour of Kamala Harris, China is watching closely for what the next presidency might have in store. Donald Trump has made it clear he will raise tariffs further on Chinese goods, potentially deepening the trade war he kicked off in 2019.  While Mr Biden's administration saw merit in diplomacy, he didn't reverse Trump-era tariffs and has added more - in May he announced steep duties on Chinese-made electric cars, solar panels, and steel.   Mr Biden has also strengthened alliances across Asia to combat China’s rising influence and beefed up Washington’s military presence - which, in turn, has rattled Beijing.    So far, the Harris campaign has not given many clues about how she plans to manage the relationship with China.  And the White House has made clear that Mr Sullivan's visit is meant to continue the work of the Biden administration, rather than set the tone for the next president. But China is likely looking ahead anyway.  Beijing will use this opportunity with Mr Sullivan to clarify its own priorities. It will hope that all parties in America are listening - China's ministry of foreign affairs has described this as a “critical juncture” between the world’s two biggest economies. For China, the red line is and always will be Taiwan. It claims the self-governing island and has repeatedly said it will not tolerate any signs that Washington is encouraging Taiwanese independence.  High-profile diplomatic visits, such as a controversial one by then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2022, or recognition of Taiwan's elections or its elected leaders, fall into that category.   Chinese state media has said Beijing will focus on expressing grave concerns, stating its position, and making serious demands on matters such as the ""Taiwan question"". China will also have some strong words for Mr Sullivan on trade. Beijing has described US tariffs on Chinese goods as “unreasonable” and has urged Washington to ""stop politicising and securitising economic and trade issues"" and ""take more measures to facilitate people-to-people exchanges between the two countries"". When he came to power, Mr Biden wanted to set ties with China on an even keel after what he saw as the chaos and unpredictability of the Trump White House.  His administration has wanted to “responsibly manage” rivalry with Beijing; to demonstrate American power and competition with China through stealth not bravado. But that strategy has been upended amid the turbulence of events.  Last year, crisis engulfed the direct relationship when an American fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon over US territory.  The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have further sharpened the tone.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing in April with a warning -   Washington would act if China did not stop supplying Russia with microchips and machine parts to build weapons used in its war in Ukraine.  He accused his Chinese counterparts of ""helping to fuel the biggest threat"" to European security since the Cold War. His warning materialised with a raft of sanctions on Chinese firms over their alleged support of the Russian military.  This is a tricky subject that China keeps trying to bat away, but Washington is insistent, and Mr Sullivan is likely to bring it up again. China's increasing assertiveness in Asia has also made the US wary of the impact of those ties further afield - particularly with Iran, which allies itself with Moscow and also arms Israel’s adversaries.  Finally, in America, there is the devastating domestic impact of Chinese-manufactured ""pre-cursor"" chemicals to make synthetic opioids like fentanyl, overdoses of which are killing more Americans than ever and the crisis has laid waste to entire towns. Last year’s summit between Mr Biden and Mr Xi in San Fransisco was meant to make progress on these issues.  Since then, despite the tariffs and the stern rhetoric, Washington and Beijing have acknowledged their differences - and reports of the two sides striking a deal on curbing fentanyl production are a good sign. In April, when the BBC accompanied US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his visit to Shanghai and Beijing, the public elements of some of his meetings with senior Chinese officials felt like a steely stand-off.  It was a show of diplomatic strength meant for each side's domestic audience. And this will undoubtedly be a part of Mr Sullivan’s trip too, as he tries to bolster Mr Biden's diplomacy in the waning months of his presidency.  But these meetings serve another fundamental purpose - face-to-face time between two rival, inter-dependent economies as they battle mutual distrust and try to probe each other’s real intentions. It seems that Jake Sullivan's previous meetings with Wang Yi have quietly laid the groundwork for what both sides call “stable relations”. In a recent speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in Washington, Mr Sullivan said that he and Mr Wang had ""increasingly gotten to the point of setting aside the talking points and really having strategic conversations”. He described the character of those conversations as “direct”, including one on the war in Ukraine.  ""Both of us left feeling that we didn’t agree or see eye-to-eye on everything but that there was a lot of work to carry forward.”"

He was calling from a jail in Jehanabad, a poverty-stricken district and, at the time, a stronghold of left-wing extremism. The crumbling, red-brick, colonial-era prison overflowed with inmates. Spread across an acre, its 13 barracks and cells were described in official reports as ""dark, damp, and filthy"". Originally designed for around 230, it held up to 800 prisoners. The Maoist insurgency, which began in Naxalbari, a hamlet in West Bengal state in the late 1960s, had spread to large parts of India, including Bihar. For nearly 60 years, the guerrillas - also called Naxalites - have fought the Indian state to establish a communist society, the movement claiming at least 40,000 lives. The Jehanabad prison was a powder keg, housing Maoists alongside their class enemies - vigilantes from upper caste Hindu private armies. All awaited trial for mutual atrocities. Like many Indian prisons, some inmates had access to mobile phones, secured through bribing the guards. “The place is swarming with rebels. Many are simply walking out,"" the inmate - one of the 659 prisoners at the time - whispered to Mr Singh. On the night of 13 November 2005, 389 prisoners, including many rebels, escaped from Jehanabad prison in what became India's - and possibly Asia's - largest jailbreak. At least two people were killed in the prison shootout, and police rifles were looted amid the chaos. The United States Department of State's 2005 report on terrorism said the rebels had even ""abducted 30 inmates"" who were members of an anti-Maoist group.  In a tantalising twist, police said the “mastermind” of the jail break was Ajay Kanu, a fiery rebel leader who was among the prisoners. Security was so lax in the decrepit prison that Kanu stayed in contact with his outlawed group on the phone and through messages, helping them come in, police alleged. Kanu says this is not true. Hundreds of rebels wearing police uniforms had crossed a drying stream behind the prison, climbed up and down the tall walls using bamboo ladders and crawled in, opening fire from their rifles. The cells were open as food was being cooked late in the kitchen. The rebels walked to the main gates and opened them. Guards on duty looked on helplessly. Prisoners - only 30 of the escapees were convicts, while the rest were awaiting trial - escaped by simply walking out of the gates, and disappeared into the darkness. It was all over in less than an hour, eyewitnesses said.  The mass jail break exposed the crumbling law and order in Bihar and the intensifying Maoist insurgency in one of India’s most impoverished regions. The rebels had timed their plan perfectly: security was stretched thin due to the ongoing state elections. ___ Rajkumar Singh, the local journalist, remembers the night vividly. After getting the phone call, he rode his motorbike through a deserted town, trying to reach his office. He remembers the air was thick with gunshots ringing in the distance. The invading rebels were also trying to attack a neighbouring police station. As he turned onto the main road, dim streetlights revealed a chilling sight - dozens of armed men and women in police uniforms blocking the way, shouting through a megaphone. “We are Maoists,” they declared. “We’re not against the people, only the government. The jailbreak is part of our protest.” The rebels had planted bombs along the road. Some were already detonating, collapsing nearby shops and spreading fear through the town. Mr Singh says he pressed on, reaching his fourth-floor office, where he received a second call from the same prisoner. “Everyone’s running. What should I do?,” the inmate said. “If everyone’s escaping, you should too,” Mr Singh said. Then he rode to the prison through the eerily empty streets. When he reached, he found the gates open. Rice pudding was strewn all over the kitchen, the cell doors were ajar. There was no jailor or policeman in sight.  In a room, two wounded policemen lay on the floor. Mr Singh says he also saw the bloodied body of Bade Sharma, the leader of the feared upper caste vigilante army of landlords called Ranvir Sena and a prisoner himself, lying on the floor. The police later said the rebels had shot him while leaving. Lying on the floor and stuck to the walls were blood-stained handwritten pamphlets left behind by the rebels. “Through this symbolic action, we want to warn the state and central governments that if they arrest the revolutionaries and the struggling people and keep them in jail, then we also know how to free them from jail in a Marxist revolutionary way,” one pamphlet said. ___ A few months ago, I met Kanu, the 57-year-old rebel leader the police accuse of masterminding the jailbreak, in Patna, Bihar’s chaotic capital. At the time of the incident, media reports painted him as ""Bihar’s most wanted"", a figure commanding both fear and respect from the police. Officers recounted how the rebel “commander” instantly took control during the prison break once he was handed an AK-47 by his comrades.  In a dramatic turn, the reports said, he “expertly” handled the weapon, swiftly changing magazines before allegedly targeting and shooting Sharma. Fifteen months later, in February 2007, Kanu was arrested from a railway platform while he was travelling from Dhanbad in Bihar to the city of Kolkata. Almost two decades later, Kanu has been acquitted in all but six of the original 45 criminal cases against him. Most of the cases stem from the jailbreak, including that of the murder of Sharma. He has served seven years in prison for one of the cases. Despite his fearsome reputation, Kanu is unexpectedly talkative. He speaks in sharp, measured bursts, downplaying his role in the mass escape that made headlines. Now, this once-feared rebel is subtly shifting his gaze toward a different battle - a career in politics, “fighting for poor, backward castes”. As a child, Kanu spent his days and nights listening to stories from his lower-caste farmer father about Communist uprisings in Russia, China and Indonesia. By eighth grade, his father’s comrades were urging him to embrace revolutionary politics. He says his defiance took root early - after scoring a goal against the local landlord’s son in a football match, armed upper-caste men stormed their home. “I locked myself inside,” he recalls. “They came for me and my sister, ransacking the house, destroying everything. That’s how the upper castes kept us in check - through fear."" In college, while studying political science, Kanu ironically led the student wing of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has waged a war against Maoism. After graduation, he co-founded a school, only to be forced out by the owner of the building. Upon returning to his village, tensions with the local landlord escalated. When a local strongman was murdered, Kanu, just 23, was named in the police complaint - and he went into hiding. “Since then I have been on the run, most of my life. I left home early to mobilise workers and farmers, joined and went underground as a Maoist rebel,” he said. He joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), a radical communist group. “My profession was liberation - the liberation of the poor. It was about standing up against the atrocities of the upper castes. I fought for those enduring injustice and oppression.” ___ In August 2002, with a feared reputation as a rebel leader and a 3m-rupee ($36,000; £27,000) bounty on his head - an incentive for people to report his whereabouts if they spotted him - Kanu was on his way to meet underground leaders and plan new strategies. He was about to reach his destination in Patna when a car overtook him at a busy intersection. “Within moments, men in plainclothes jumped out, guns drawn, ordering me to surrender. I didn’t resist - I gave up,"" he said.  Over the next three years, Kanu was shuffled between jails as police feared his escape. “He had a remarkable reputation, the sharpest of them all,” a senior officer told me. In each jail, Kanu says he formed prisoner unions to protest against corruption - stolen rations, poor healthcare, bribery. In one prison, he led a three-day hunger strike. “There were clashes,” he says, “but I kept demanding better conditions"". Kanu paints a stark picture of the overcrowding in Indian prisons, describing Jehanabad, which held more than double its intended capacity. “There was no place to sleep. In my first barrack, 180 prisoners were crammed into a space meant for just 40. We devised a system to survive. Fifty of us would sleep for four hours while the others sat, waiting and chatting in the dark. When the four hours were up, another group would take their turn. That’s how we endured life inside those walls."" In 2005, Kanu escaped during the infamous jailbreak. “We were waiting for dinner when gunfire erupted. Bombs, bullets - it was chaos,"" he recalls. “The Maoists stormed in, yelling for us to flee. Everyone ran into the darkness. Should I have stayed behind and been killed?” Many doubt the simplicity of Kanu's claims. ""It wasn’t as simple as he makes it sound,"" said a police officer. ""Why was dinner being prepared late in the evening when it was usually cooked and served at dusk, with the cells locked up early? That alone raised suspicions of inside collusion."" Interestingly many  of the prisoners who escaped were back in jail by mid-December - some voluntarily, others not. None of the rebels returned. When I asked Kanu whether he masterminded the escape, he smiled. “The Maoists freed us - it’s their job to liberate,” he said. But when pressed again, Kanu fell silent. The irony deepened as he finally shared a story from prison. A police officer had once asked him if he was planning another escape. “Sir, does a thief ever tell you what he’s going to steal?” Kanu replied wryly. His words hung in the air, coming from a man who insists he had no part in planning the jailbreak."

The Great Britain team returned from the 2024 Paralympics in Paris on Monday having finished second in the medal table behind China with 124 medals, including 49 golds. Multiple gold medallists Dame Sarah Storey, Alice Tai and Maisie Summers-Newton were among those who arrived by Eurostar at St Pancras railway station. Earlier in the day, an open letter was sent to the UK Government by ParalympicsGB stating that only one in four disabled children regularly takes part in school sport. It followed the launch last week of the Equal Play campaign,, external calling on the government to ensure ""every child has the same access to PE at school, rather than leaving them sidelined"". ""There are 1.5 million disabled children - 15% of the school population - and it is shocking that such a large number of young people do not have the chance to participate in sport and develop and grow as a result,"" the letter read. ""As Paralympians, and as disabled people, we are more determined than ever to use this platform to do all we can to prevent the next generation of children being left on the sidelines in the birthplace of the Paralympic movement."" The letter called on the government to give teachers the necessary training, the right tools and the understanding to deliver ""truly inclusive physical education"". The overall goal is that by the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympic Games, ""no disabled child faces this discrimination"". In response, a Government spokesperson said: ""We have launched a review of the school curriculum which will consider how best to open up access to subjects such as PE and sport to more young people so we can nurture the Paralympians of the future."" Great Britain's SM8 200m individual medley champion Brock Whiston, who will soon return to her job as a teaching assistant for children with special needs, added: ""We will never be equal, because you can't possibly be equal, but you should always get the same opportunities."" Fellow Para-swimmer Alice Tai, who won five medals in Paris, including two golds, said exclusion from sport ""can have a massive impact"". ""I think the Paralympics proves that sport is accessible,"" said Tai. ""It just takes people to have open minds, listen to people with disabilities, advocate for us, and keep everything going after the Paralympics."" Great Britain's 49 gold medals was their highest tally since Rio 2016, with medals in 18 of the 19 sports they entered. GB's chef de mission Penny Briscoe told the BBC she was ""delighted"" with the incredible team performance and could not be ""happier"", praising the ""depth of talent across the sports"". ""The ambition is to remain a world leading national Paralympic committee,"" she added. BBC Sport has asked the government for comment. GB won medals in 18 of the 19 sports they entered, before returning to London by train Cyclist Sarah Storey won two golds in Paris, taking her overall Paralympics tally to 19 golds Swimmer Maisie Summers Newton won two gold medals and a bronze in Paris The BBC has teamed up with ParalympicsGB and the Premier League to launch Super Movers for Every Body - an educational initiative dedicated to getting more children into inclusive sport.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3w5449x9zo,Starmer-Biden talks were about second-guessing Putin,The war in Ukraine hung over talks between the UK prime minister and US president in Washington.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:54.258456,China News,BBC,China,"In the hours before the prime minister was taken by motorcade to the White House, he and his team were in a secure room at the nearby British Embassy. This is a room designed for conversations spies are not meant to hear, however sophisticated their techniques for eavesdropping and intercepting digital exchanges. The Downing Street team were talking to British government staff in Ukraine and Russia, assembling their briefing and approach for their forthcoming conversation with President Biden. They arrived at the White House in the late afternoon Washington time, the president showing Sir Keir Starmer around the Rose Garden before heading for the Blue Room. On each side of a long rectangular table, the two delegations, the prime minister and president with seven colleagues each alongside them. For just a few minutes, we reporters were invited in too. Warm words from the leaders followed by loud questions and prompt ejection for the journalists. What followed was about 90 minutes of conversation in private. Ukraine dominated, but not to the exclusion of other issues – not least the Middle East, China and Iran. Downing Street had sought in advance to portray this as an opportunity for a deeper conversation than the usual round of international summits often allow. But why bother when President Biden is soon to be yesterday’s man, out of office, power and influence in four months time? The urgency of the issues on the table, I am told. Take Ukraine: an ally of both the UK and the US, still in desperate need of ongoing help as its friends weigh up how best to provide it - and at what cost. The UK has been ""forward facing"" as it was put to me in making the case to others to agree to Kyiv’s request to be allowed to fire western missiles into Russia. President Biden is sceptical, fearful it could drag America and Europe into direct conflict with Moscow. That is just what Vladimir Putin has been hinting at in the last few days. Then again his sabre rattling in the past hasn’t come to much, so perhaps it wouldn’t again? But maybe, this time, it would. Diplomacy and intelligence turning to the psychology of a leader at war, attempting to second guess how he might react. Would he really contemplate a military attack on a Nato member state – with the frightening potential of hauling the whole western alliance into war with Russia? And, if not that, would Ukraine’s allies stomach lower level aggression in retaliation, such as cyber attacks or damaging sub-sea communication cables? There was little expectation this meeting would resolve the question about western missiles, not least because further conversations with others at the United Nations are expected shortly. Afterwards, the prime minister wouldn’t be drawn on whether he had persuaded the president to change his mind. This is a conflict without obvious end which presents too no end of thorny dilemmas based around a recurring theme: how to defeat Russia without provoking Moscow. What could be the consequences of action? And what could be the consequences of inaction? It is the essence of the West’s challenge since the full scale invasion of Ukraine two and a half years ago.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qvl3vlvlvo,Taiwan pager maker stunned by link to Lebanon attacks,The race to find the manufacturer of pagers that exploded in Lebanon leads to a Taiwanese company.,18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:34:54.365454,China News,BBC,China,"The race to find the maker of the pagers that exploded in Lebanon has taken an unexpected turn - towards a Taiwanese company few had heard of until this morning.  At least 12 people were killed and nearly 3,000 injured in Tuesday's explosions targeting members of the armed group Hezbollah, which set off a geopolitical storm in the Middle East.  Caught in the crisis, Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo's founder Hsu Ching-Kuang flatly denied his company had anything to do with the attacks. Instead, Mr Hsu has said he licensed his trade mark to a company in Hungary called BAC Consulting to use the Gold Apollo name on their own pagers. BBC attempts to contact BAC have so far been unsuccessful. “You look at the pictures from Lebanon,” Mr Hsu told reporters outside his firm's offices on Wednesday. ""They don’t have any mark saying Made in Taiwan on them, we did not make those pagers!” The offices of Gold Apollo are in a large new business park in a non-descript suburb of Taiwan's capital, Taipei.  They look the same as any of the thousands of small trading companies and manufacturers that make up a huge chunk of the island's economy - except for the two police officers posted at the entrance, ready to fend off the large gaggle of reporters and TV crews squatting outside. On the walls of Gold Apollo's office are posters of the company’s products – a montage of small boxy plastic devices with little grey LCD screens. They are all pagers.   Until this morning the company’s website had a page devoted to each, extolling its virtues and practicalities. But as soon as news broke that Gold Apollo was the alleged source of the devices used in the attacks in Lebanon,  the website went offline. Mr Hsu said it was pagers made by BAC Consulting that were used in the Lebanon attacks. He told reporters that his company had signed an agreement with BAC Consulting three years ago.  The money transfers from BAC had been ""very strange"", he added. There had been problems with the payments, which had come through the Middle East, he told reporters, but he did not go into detail. Initially, he said, BAC wanted to buy pagers from Gold Apollo to sell in Europe. But after about a year they came up with a new plan to make their own pagers and licensed Gold Apollo's name.  ""We only provide brand trademark authorisation and have no involvement in the design or manufacturing of this product,” a statement from Gold Apollo said. But the fact there is now a team from the Taipei investigation bureau inside his office – with large numbers of cardboard boxes - suggests the Taiwanese authorities are not entirely reassured.  Nevertheless, Mr Hsu’s statement that his company didn’t make the devices is plausible.   Taiwan’s manufacturing system is a complex maze of small companies, many of which do not actually make the products they sell. They may own the brand name, the intellectual property and have research and design departments. But most of the actual manufacturing is farmed out to factories in China or Southeast Asia. Pagers are also hardly cutting-edge technology – there are many companies across the world capable of making them. They are small radio receivers with LED screens that can receive and display messages.  In the 1980s and 1990s electronic pagers were considered to be the latest tech, used by tens of millions of people. Before mobile phones, companies used pagers to send short text messages to employees in the field.   But in the last two decades the rise of the smart phone has pushed pagers to the brink of extinction. They are now a niche device holding on in places like hospitals – where they remain a cheap and reliable method for messaging doctors and nurses, even when other communication lines are disrupted.  Starting in the late 2000s, Gold Apollo too started moving away from making electronic pagers and started manufacturing other short-range radio devices – particularly for restaurants. The company’s most successful product now is a round disc that is handed to customers in food courts and restaurants once they place an order - it lights up and vibrates when their order is ready.   It's likely that Gold Apollo's  brand name - as a reliable pager manufacturer - was useful in selling the pagers that ended up with Hezbollah.   But there are still more questions than answers in this extraordinary story.  We know almost nothing about BAC Consulting - who is or was behind it?  If Gold Apollo did not make the pagers used in the attack in Lebanon, then who did and where?"

Among the counterfeit games were popular titles from the 1980s and 90s, including Mario Bros., Street Fighter and Star Wars.  The pirated consoles were imitations of the iconic devices produced by Nintendo, Sega and Atari and did not meet strict safety standards. New versions of video games and gaming consoles that were released decades ago have recently soared in popularity and command high prices, in a cultural trend known as ""retrogaming"".  Around 12,000 consoles holding over 47 million pirated video games were seized by police, Alessandro Langella, head of the economic crime unit for Turin's financial police, told the AFP news agency. The haul had an estimated value of €47.5m, Mr Langella said, a figure which includes the value of the consoles and hundreds of licenses for the pirated programs. They were ""all from China"" and were imported to be sold in specialised shops or online, Mr Langella said. All the devices were fitted with non-certified batteries and electrical circuits and did not meet EU technical or safety standards. The seized games have been destroyed. Nine Italian nationals have been arrested and charged with trading in counterfeited goods. If found guilty, they face up to eight years in prison.  On TikTok, #retrogaming has amassed more than 170 million posts.  The phenomenon is ""experiencing a phase of strong popularity and commercial expansion,"" Mr Langella said. Old games and second-hand consoles are in high demand, with a working Super Nintendo system with games for sale online at between £100 ($131) - £275 depending on condition.  In 2021, a sealed copy of video game Super Mario 64 sold at auction for more than $1.5m, shattering records."

Jiangwei Liao, 26, is taking part in the clinical trial at the Kent and Canterbury Hospital.  Mr Liao, who is studying communications engineering, was diagnosed with MS earlier this year after suffering from double vision. He said: “My consultant mentioned the clinical trial and I was happy to be able to help contribute in finding better treatments."" NHS researchers are working with French pharmaceutical company Sanofi to test an experimental medicine to see if it reduces the number of relapses people have, which could ultimately slow the disease progression and delay the damage it causes to someone’s brain. Mr Liao said: “Most of my family work in hospitals so I am familiar with medical research, and I read a lot about it before making my final decision. “This is a phase three trial, so it has already proved effective in smaller studies, and I was able to feel confident it was safe."" The PhD student, from China, described how he was diagnosed with MS. He said: “It was very sudden, I woke up seeing double. Initially I wasn’t worried but my supervisor was and wanted me to speak to a doctor. “I then went to a painting class and the teacher was also worried and so I ended up going to the William Harvey Hospital, where tests confirmed it was MS. “For now it is just affecting my eyes, and they are getting better, but I know it can get worse.” More than two million people worldwide are affected by MS, which is a neurological disease with unpredictable symptoms that include vision problems, challenges with cognition, and difficulty with physical activity.  It is caused when the immune system attacks healthy tissues in the brain and spinal cord, and the disease can worsen over time. Sreedharan Harikrishnan, neurology consultant at East Kent Hospitals, is the study's lead researcher for the UK. Dr Harikrishnan said: “This is an exciting opportunity for our patients and could lead to a ground-breaking development in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. “We hope to continue to recruit many more patients into this very important study.” Mr Liao said: “The team said I was the first patient but I thought they meant the first in the hospital, not the first in Europe. “It is exciting, and I hope lots of other people sign up so the doctors can see whether the treatment works. “MS is much rarer in China, and my cousin had to wait many years and visit a lot of different hospitals before she was diagnosed.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz3rk71n7o,Strongest typhoon in a decade hits 'China's Hawaii',"About 400,000 in Hainan island evacuated to safe ground ahead of Yagi's arrival.",7 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:04.638230,China News,BBC,China,"A popular tourist island south of mainland China has been hit by the most powerful typhoon in a decade, leaving the area facing potentially catastrophic winds and torrential rain. Super typhoon Yagi slammed into Wenchang city in the north-east of Hainan island with winds of 223 km/h (138 mph) at 16:00 local time (09:00 BST) on Friday, according to state media. Yagi is the strongest to hit Hainan since Rammasun in 2014, which left 46 people dead. China's weather agency said it is the strongest typhoon to make landfall in the autumn. Some 400,000 people in Hainan island were evacuated to safe ground ahead of Yagi's arrival. Trains, boats and flights were suspended, while schools were shut.  Yagi - which has doubled in strength after wreaking havoc in northern Philippines early this week - is the second strongest typhoon so far this year. Meteorologists say Yagi may cause ""catastrophic"" damage in Hainan and  neighbouring Guangdong, which is also China's most populous province. Yagi is an ""extremely dangerous and powerful"" super typhoon which could make a ""potentially catastrophic"" landfall, the Indo-Pacific Tropical Cyclone Warning Center warned in an advisory on Thursday. A super typhoon is equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane. Shortly after it made landfall, Hainan saw widespread power outages, local media reported, with about 830,000 households affected. Emergency teams, consisting of about 7,000 people, said power was restored to 260,000 homes by Friday evening. All tourist attractions have been shut since Wednesday by order of authorities. who warned of ""massive and destructive winds"". With white sand beaches, luxury hotels and duty-free shops, Hainan has been dubbed ""China's Hawaii"". The world's longest sea crossing, the main bridge linking Hong Kong with Macau and Zhuhai in Guangdong, was also closed. The storm made landfall for a second time in Guangdong on Friday evening, with winds exceeding 200km/h.  Parts of the region have been experiencing heavy rainfall and strong gales since Thursday. China's weather authority expects rainfall to reach up to 500mm.  Hainan is no stranger to typhoons. But just nine of the106 typhoons which have landed in Hainan since 1949 were classified as super typhoons, news agency Reuters reported. Chinese authorities believe Yagi will be the strongest typhoon to hit its southern coast in a decade. Elsewhere, in Hong Kong, trading at the city's stock exchange was suspended and schools were closed. While five people were injured by extreme weather in the city, authorities said overall damage was limited.  After hitting China, Yagi is also expected to make landfall in northern Vietnam late on Saturday in a weakened state.  Tens of thousands in the provinces of Hai Phong and Thai Binh will be evacuated to safer ground by the end of Friday, AFP news agency reported, citing local authorities. The military has mobilised some 460,000 officers to help manage the storm's impact, Vietnamese media reported. Vietnam's deputy agriculture minister has warned that it could hit regions ""crucial to the socio-economic development"" of the region.  ""Carelessness could result in catastrophic damage,"" Nguyen Hoang Hiep said. Four airports in the country's north, including Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport, will be shut on Saturday in anticipation of the storm, Vietnam's civil aviation authority said. Earlier this week, floods and landslides brought by Yagi killed at least 13 people in northern Philippines, with thousands of people forced to evacuate to safer ground. Scientists say typhoons and hurricanes are becoming stronger and more frequent with climate change. Warmer ocean waters mean storms pick up more energy, which leads to higher wind speeds. A warmer atmosphere also holds more moisture, which can lead to more intense rainfall. Yagi comes a week after typhoon Shanshan hit Japan, killing at least six people and injuring hundreds. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq1e7k2j8o,EU facing existential risk without investment - report,The long-awaited report paints a bleak picture days ahead of the EU's new top team being confirmed.,9 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:04.745745,China News,BBC,China,"The EU faces an ""existential challenge"" unless it vastly increases investment and reforms its industrial policy, a report ordered by the European Commission has warned. The wide-ranging and long-awaited review, which was led by former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, said the bloc must increase spending by €800bn (£675bn) per year or face being left behind by the US and China. European leaders were told they would be “forced to choose” between climate, economic and foreign policy goals if the EU does not become more productive. The stark findings were published days before the make-up of the new Commission - the EU's equivalent of a cabinet - was due to be confirmed. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who was re-elected for a second five-year term in July, tasked Mr Draghi - a former Italian prime minister - with authoring the review last year. The report was drawn up by a small team in a secretive atmosphere, and anticipation for its publication grew in Brussels after its release was delayed by several months. The spending recommendations in the report are described as ""unprecedented"". They are equivalent to 5% of the bloc's GDP, and more than double the post-World War Two Marshall Plan. Without extra investment, the EU will be unable to finance its social model and will have to ""scale back some, if not all, of [its] ambitions"", the report warned. The report - which is non-binding - calls for an expansion of joint borrowing by EU states in order to fund the investment, a move which would be controversial and could be opposed by some member states. Speaking in Brussels following its publication, Mr Draghi said: ""For the first time since the Cold War, we must genuinely fear for our self-preservation and the reason for a unified response has never been so compelling."" The report highlighted productivity - the amount of goods and services produced from a given level of resources and labour - as a particular problem for the EU. Sluggish growth has left European households paying the price, with living standards rising much more slowly on this side of the Atlantic, it found. Mr Draghi also said Europe is not innovating fast enough, comparing it unfavourably to the US, which has become a home to several trillion-dollar tech giants. He said Europe “largely missed out on the digital revolution led by the internet” and has become “stuck” in a static industrial structure, with few new companies emerging. It said innovative companies favour moving abroad, enticed by better funding and less regulation. The report also said the EU is facing a stern threat from state-sponsored Chinese companies as it tries to establish itself in emerging industries like electric vehicles and green technology. It sets out 170 proposals on cutting regulation and improving decision-making, as well as increasing cooperation between national governments on a scale which has historically proved difficult for member states to agree to. Speaking to the BBC, Lorenzo Codogno, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and former head of the Italian treasury, warned that gathering the necessary political support to implement the recommendations of Mr Draghi’s “provocative and bold” report would be “extremely challenging”. Veiled criticism of the report emerged soon after its publication, with German Finance Minister Christian Lindner saying EU joint borrowing would not solve structural problems, and that the main problem was not a lack of subsidies, but bureaucracy and a planned economy."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq2xpxx81lo,"Labour's net zero quest will cost jobs, unions fear","The government needs to rethink green policies to avoid destroying working class communities, unions say.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:04.859405,China News,BBC,China,"Labour’s green policies are costing jobs and “hollowing out working class communities,” the leader of the GMB union has warned. Gary Smith told the BBC the government had to stop “decarbonisation through deindustrialisation” and called for an “honest debate” about the government’s plans for British industry. While the unions have welcomed Keir Starmer's new government, at the TUC conference in Brighton tensions between the political and industrial wings of the labour movement were transparent. The loss of jobs at Port Talbot steel works has highlighted wider concerns from some unions - in particular the GMB and Unite, two of the country's largest - about Labour's environmental policy, and the journey to net zero. The unions softened the blow in South Wales by arguing for improved redundancy terms and retraining for workers facing the loss of their jobs -  an argument accepted by Tata Steel. An environmentally-friendly ""electric arc"" furnace at Port Talbot is to be built and government funding guaranteed so steelmaking will not be put on the scrapheap.  Nonetheless, the second traditional coke-fuelled furnace will be closed soon and the company is in the process of shedding around 2,500 of the 4,000 jobs.  Gary Smith told the BBC: ""This was a mess created under the Tories...but let's be under no illusions.  ""Thousands of jobs are going to go, a community is going to be hollowed out. We're going to see huge reductions in our carbon emissions, but at what price?"" And his concerns are not limited to the community in South Wales. He fears for the future of more of British manufacturing - including  shipbuilding in Belfast, and the sole oil refinery in Scotland at Grangemouth. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds promised a steel strategy - and £2.5bn to help secure its future, a key demand of unions such as Unite, Community and the GMB.   But unions are concerned that not every plant will have a future.   The government's steel strategy is scheduled for next Spring but there is increasing  anxiety that Chinese-owned British Steel in Scunthorpe will not survive the winter. Some 2,500 jobs are under threat and, with them, the ability to produce steel from scratch, rather than from scrap metal.  Newport MP Jessica Morden raised the risks of ""deindustrialisation"" at Prime Minister's Questions and asked Sir Keir Starmer what was being done to safeguard jobs and communities.  He sounded reassuring: ""We need steel made in this country and our plans and our missions mean we'll need more steel not less. It's the duty of the government to ensure communities aren't ignored in the (green) transition."" Labour is also promising a wider industrial strategy, but the GMB and some other unions are worried that this and the transition to green energy are not - at least, yet - joined up. Gary Smith told me: ""We're not reducing our consumption of oil and gas, we'll still need lots of steel, we'll just be producing this stuff elsewhere and importing it. ""We're going to be producing more steel from countries like China who burn coal to produce it. This is bad for communities, not great for national security and it makes no sense in terms of the environment."" He is now calling for a debate on how the government intends to manage the transition to net zero - the flagship policy of Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband.  ""We're going to have to have an honest conversation about the way in which environmental policy is impacting jobs.  ""Our message to Ed Miliband is very clear: We are worried about a lot of promises that are not being delivered on jobs."" Those worries are shared by the Unite union when it comes to employment in the oil and gas industries.  Both unions - who don't always see eye-to-eye - joined forces successfully to push a motion through the TUC conference opposing the ending of new North Sea licences unless and until guarantees are delivered on jobs. I'm told talks with ministers will continue behind closed doors. Unite leader Sharon Graham has publicly set out her red lines.  She said: ""Right now there is talk of a 'just transition' but in reality 30,000 workers in the North sea are on a jobs cliff edge.  ""Labour's plans are lacking in cast iron guarantees.""  And in a reference to the coal mine closures of the 1980s, she added: ""Make no mistake - Unite will not stand by and watch those workers becoming the miners of our generation."" There were other differences on display this week between unions and government. The TUC opposed the withdrawal of winter fuel payments and called for the two child benefit limit in the welfare system to be lifted.  The conference also passed a motion calling for ""arbitary"" fiscal rules governing debt and borrowing to be relaxed. On these issues the government, bluntly, is unlikely to listen. But when it comes to members' jobs some of the big unions hope they can have more influence.  The GMB and Unite say they made the Port Talbot deal less damaging. But they could not convince Tata to keep its two blast furnaces open until the new electric furnace is built.   They know they face an uphill battle to prevent job losses in traditional industries before the promised green jobs become available. The government and trade unions want to reach net zero. but both the energy  security and net zero secretary, and the business secretary, will continue to be warned by some of the biggest unions the journey to that destination could come with economic and political costs."

The country's ruling junta has requested foreign aid to mitigate the impact, the state-run media report. The capital Naypyidaw is among the areas worst hit. The floods have killed at least 33 people, the country's military says. State-run daily New Light of Myanmar says some temporary relief camps have been set up for victims made homeless. Asia's most powerful storm this year, Typhoon Yagi, has already swept Vietnam, the Chinese island of Hainan and the Philippines.  Junta chief Gen Min Aung Hlaing and other Burmese officials have visited areas of heavy flooding and inspected the rescue and relief efforts, the state-run media say. Reports by Radio Free Asia suggest the death toll is much higher, with the US-backed broadcaster saying at least 160 people were killed in floods and landslides. A rescue worker in Taungoo told BBC Burmese on Saturday more than 300 people were trapped by flooding on the east bank of the Sittaung river. ""There aren't enough boats to rescue us,"" the rescue worker said.  Scientists say typhoons and hurricanes are becoming stronger and more frequent with climate change. Warmer ocean waters mean storms pick up more energy, which leads to higher wind speeds. A warmer atmosphere also holds more moisture, which can lead to more intense rainfall. Much of Myanmar's population has been suffering dislocation because of a three-year civil war that has killed thousands and displaced more than 2.6 million people, according to the UN. According to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), some 18.6 million people are now estimated to be in humanitarian need.  In an update on the ongoing humanitarian situation earlier this week, the International Red Cross (ICRC) said many families in Myanmar have limited access to clean water and sanitation, and are going without basic medicines and health care. ""They live with the fear of armed conflict and violence. The disruption of livelihoods is leaving countless people without the means to sustain themselves,"" the ICRC's president, Mirjana Spoljaric, said on Wednesday."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241004-the-puzzle-of-rising-early-onset-breast-and-colorectal-cancer-in-younger-people,The puzzling rise of cancer in younger people,"There are rising cases of breast, colorectal and other cancers in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. What is going on?",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:05.063739,China News,BBC,China,"There are rising cases of breast, colorectal and other cancers in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. What is going on? Over the past 10 years, rates of colorectal cancer among 25 to 49 year olds have increased in 24 different countries, including the UK, US, France, Australia, Canada, Norway and Argentina. The investigation's early findings, presented by an international team at the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) congress in Geneva in September 2024, were as eye-catching as they are concerning. The researchers, from the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the World Health Organization's (WHO's) International Agency for Research on Cancer, surveyed data from 50 countries to understand the trend. In 14 of these countries, the rising trend was only seen in younger adults, with older adult rates remaining stable. The results are the latest in a host of studies detailing a similar rise of a range of different cancers in the young.   Breast cancer is one form of cancer where the trend is apparent. A new report from the ACS found that while deaths from breast cancer in women have dropped by around 10% in the past decade, incidence rates are rising by 1% per year overall – and 1.4% per year for women under the age of 50. Based on epidemiological investigations, it seems that this trend first began in the 1990s. One study found that the global incidence of early-onset cancer had increased by 79% between 1990 and 2019, with the number of cancer-related deaths in younger people rising by 29%. Another report in The Lancet Public Health described how cancer incidence rates in the US have steadily risen between the generations across 17 different cancers, particularly in Generation Xers and Millennials. The issue of early-onset cancers has become such a matter of concern that major organisations such as the UICC are keen to raise awareness of the trend among general practitioners to ensure that warning signs are being picked up among younger patients. ""A doctor listening to somebody above 60 who's talking about difficulty passing stool, feeling tired and bloated, is going to take those symptoms a lot more seriously than a young person in their 30s who's active and doesn't fit the typical profile of a person with cancer,"" says Sonali Johnson, head of advocacy at the UICC. ""They might put it down to irritable bowel syndrome or work stress, so there's plenty of cases where people's symptoms are dismissed instead of being referred for blood work or a colonoscopy."" Cancer specialists say that patients presenting with diseases like pancreatic cancer, an illness where most people are diagnosed in their early 70s, are sometimes decades younger than would usually be expected. ""It's not uncommon for me to see someone under the age of 40 with pancreatic cancer,"" says Eileen O'Reilly, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York. ""It's almost every week, which is a scary thought. These are people in the prime of life, who are starting families and have everything to live for. The implications for society are profound."" While oncologists have typically thought of cancers in younger people as being primarily a consequence of heritable risk factors, such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations in the case of breast cancer, more and more patients have no obvious genetic predisposition. O'Reilly says that in the majority of the young-onset cases she sees, there is no obvious genetic explanation, and when studied in the lab, the tumours carried by patients in their 20s, 30s or 40s appear to be more aggressive compared with a typical pancreatic cancer patient in their 70s. She says that this often makes their prognosis very poor, even though the patient themselves is often in otherwise good health. ""They're younger, fitter and can often handle treatment intensity better, but some have this highly aggressive form of pancreatic cancer, which causes an accelerated decline in front of your eyes,"" she says. ""To them and us it's often beyond comprehension, because who could imagine that a healthy 40 year old would develop this kind of malignancy?"" As well as recognising the trend, cancer specialists are feeling an increasing sense of urgency to try and get to the bottom of the factors driving it. The authors of the Lancet study commented that if this pattern continued, it could ultimately increase the burden of disease in future, halting and even reversing decades of public health progress in combating cancer. So what is going on? Perhaps the most obvious explanation points to the role of obesity and metabolic syndrome, conditions which have been associated with driving cancer risk through increasing inflammation throughout the body and causing the dysregulation of key hormonal pathways. A recent study found that accumulating excess body weight between the ages of 18 and 40 is associated with a greater risk of up to 18 different cancers, while the Lancet report found that 10 of the 17 cancers which are growing in prevalence among the young in the US are obesity-related malignancies such as kidney, ovarian, liver, pancreatic and gallbladder cancers as well as myeloma. ""The overall evidence points to lifestyle change,"" says Shuji Ogino, professor of pathology and epidemiology at Harvard University who has been investigating the rise of early-onset cancers. ""Every one of us has thousands of genetic variants, some of which give a very small increased risk of cancer, which rises when combined with some environmental changes. We know that eating too much sugar and processed food, having consistently high blood glucose and becoming insulin resistant not only raises your risk of diabetes but also cancer.""  But obesity alone doesn't represent the full story. O'Reilly says that many of the younger pancreatic cancer patients she sees are fit and apparently healthy, with no clear explanations for why they should have fallen unwell. ""It certainly always strikes me that the traditional things we think about mostly don't apply to these people,"" she says. ""They appear often healthy, vibrant and extremely physically fit."" Ogino believes that this may reflect the emergence of some different carcinogens, ones which have previously drawn less attention. While epidemiologists have long focused on the link between smoking and cancer, smoking prevalence has declined markedly in recent decades with the WHO finding that globally just one-in-five adults consume tobacco products now, compared with one-in-three in 2000. Instead, Ogino feels that a heavily overlooked connection is the marked change in sleep patterns around the world which has occurred in 50-100 years. One study found that the average sleep duration of children and adolescents declined by 60 minutes per night between 1905 and 2008, while shift work has become increasingly prevalent in recent decades in Australia, China, Japan, Europe and North and South America. A 2021 study using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a database which contains information from more than 10,000 people over the age of 50, found an association between poor sleep quality and greater risk of cancer. Some scientists have even argued that our near permanent exposure to artificial light, either through streetlights or mobile phones and tablets, represents a novel carcinogen through triggering disruptions in the body's biological clock, something that has been linked to breast, colon, ovarian and prostate cancer. Studies have even suggested that continued light exposure during nighttime hours through shift work may facilitate cancer growth through lowering levels of the hormone melatonin. ""We are exposed a lot to artificial light at night, even from when we are babies,"" says Ogino. ""And in Japan, for instance, a substantial fraction of the population stay up to midnight every night. Shift work has become more common with things like 24-hour convenience stores."" At the same time, Ogino says that there is unlikely to be a single risk factor involved in many of these cases of early-onset cancer, but instead a confluence of factors converging to drive disease. Combined with shifts in lifestyle, many cancer scientists believe that a key driving force for these illnesses is the consequences of various toxic changes within the gut. In June 2023, Frank Frizelle, a colorectal surgeon at Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, issued something of a call-to-arms for colorectal cancer specialists around the world, calling for greater investigation of the potential link between ingesting high amounts of microplastics and developing premature bowel cancer. His provocatively titled paper, ""Could microplastics be a driver for early-onset colorectal cancer?"", argued that the emergence of colorectal cancer as an increasingly problematic disease in the under 50s matches the timeframe over which microplastics have become exponentially more present in the environment. His suggestion is that the presence of these tiny plastic particles may disrupt the colonic mucus layer, which protects the lining of the bowel from various pathogens and toxins from our food. ""Micro and nanoplastics may allow the mucus layer to be permeated in some way, like putting a series of pin holes in a condom,"" he says. ""If we can prove this to be true, it might be size related, like carbon particles and lung disease."" At present, this is still mostly speculative, but Frizelle is far from the only scientist to have linked toxic changes within the gut to potentially carcinogenic processes. Other researchers have suggested that certain components within ultra-processed foods may play a role in driving inflammation and DNA damage within the colon, from food colourants to emulsifiers, although, as with microplastics, the evidence still remains relatively limited.  Because the colon is connected to the stomach and the wider gastrointestinal tract as well as the immune system, marked changes within the gut are not only associated with colorectal cancer, but also a range of solid tumours including breast cancer as well as blood cancers. Researchers are probing whether use of antibiotics could be a factor. As for microplastic exposure, antibiotic use around the world has risen in recent decades. In particular, the doses of antibiotics consumed by children under the age of five increased from 9.8 per 1,000 people in 2000 to 14.3 in 2018. Overall, the global per-capita consumption of antibiotics grew across all age groups between 2000 and 2015, something which O'Reilly believes is a key cause for concern. Given the ability of antibiotics to wipe out large swathes of bacterial species and thus drastically reshape the gut microbiome in potentially harmful ways, greater antibiotic exposure has previously been linked to lung cancer, lymphomas, pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma and multiple myeloma. More like this: • Why belief in cancer fatalism can harm your health • Why age matters when it comes to cancer • The mystery of microbes that live inside tumours ""The bacteria that live in the gut have been selected by some sort of Darwinian process and they're part of the immune surveillance which allows our immune system to recognise abnormal cells, foreign particles, and prevent the genesis of malignancies in the first place,"" says O'Reilly. ""It's still not known, but the idea is that greater antibiotic exposure could mean that immune surveillance is not working as effectively as it should."" One of the potential consequences of excessive antibiotics is that wiping out so-called commensal bacteria, species which are native to the gut, creates a chasm which can then be filled by more malevolent microbes. In the last 10 years, Ogino and his collaborators around the world have published numerous studies on certain opportunistic pathogens which seem to be capable of invading the gut and driving cellular changes which increase the risk of cancer progression.  In particular, Ogino and others have found that a bacterium called Fusobacterium nucleatum seems to be capable of driving pre-cancerous intestinal growths as well as the development of more aggressive tumours. Other studies have shown that certain species of E. coli appear to be capable of driving cancer development and simultaneously suppressing the body's immune response. As with sleep and obesity, Ogino says, the factors driving early-onset cancer are multifactorial from childhood to adulthood and likely combine synergistically to gradually increase disease risk in early adulthood. He points out that while most of us carry some form of E. coli, his research has shown that these bacteria tend to flourish most when we're also consuming a so-called ""Western diet"", high in ultra-processed foods, indicating that diet will also play a key role. We are still some way from being able to pin down exactly why different groups of people have ended up developing early-onset cancers. But O'Reilly says that it is vital for scientists to try and study them in greater detail, to try and avoid a global health catastrophe in years to come. ""There's an enormous need for research to try and understand what's going on and what's inciting these diseases at a much earlier stage,"" she says. ""I find it an incredibly scary observation that we're seeing incidence of pancreatic cancer and other solid organ cancers going up in the young. To me, it's a looming public health crisis."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.   For more science, technology and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6x1ql1yelo,China scam run from Isle of Man,A seaside hotel and office block were used by scam artists who tricked people out of millions of dollars.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:05.197312,China News,BBC,China,"A seaside hotel and former bank offices on the Isle of Man have been used by scammers conning victims in China out of millions of dollars, a BBC World Service investigation has found. The dining room and lounge at the Seaview Hotel in Douglas were packed with dozens of Chinese workers, we have been told, on computers hooked up to fast broadband. A specialist wok hob had also been delivered to the hotel’s kitchen. The deception, which happened between January 2022 and January 2023 according to Chinese court documents, used a method known as ""pig-butchering"". It is so-called because the process of “fattening the pig” - gaining the victim’s trust - is vital to its success. The BBC spent nearly a year establishing how the investment scam was carried out from the island, which is a British Crown dependency with an independent government. We also uncovered other details, such as how bosses had big ambitions to build a state-of-the-art office complex overlooking the Irish Sea. As well as obtaining court papers, we have accessed leaked documents and spoken to company insiders. One former member of staff, Jordan [not his real name], told us he had no idea of the murky world he was entering when he arrived on the Isle of Man. He says he was relieved to have found what he thought was a stable administrative job. He did notice, however, that his new employer seemed quite secretive - for example, he and his colleagues were forbidden from taking photos at company social events. What he says he didn’t realise was that many of his Chinese colleagues were actually scam artists. In late 2021, nearly 100 people had been transferred to the Isle of Man to work for a company which Chinese court documents refer to as ""MIC"". They had come from the Philippines where they had worked for another scamming firm. The BBC has discovered that MIC stands for Manx Internet Commerce. On the Isle of Man, MIC was part of a group of associated companies - all with the same owner. An online casino, run by King Gaming Ltd, was the most prominent. In mainland China, gambling is illegal. Setting up halfway around the world meant the group's founders could target Chinese customers, but also take advantage of the Isle of Man’s low gambling taxes. A few months after being based at the Seaview Hotel in Douglas, the MIC workers were moved to former bank offices on the east side of town. And this is where Jordan says he would hear sporadic cheering from his new colleagues - who worked in groups of four. He now believes they were celebrating moments when they had successfully scammed another victim, some 5,000 miles away. Six people who worked for MIC in Douglas have now been convicted - upon their return home to China - of carrying out investment scams against Chinese citizens. The cases, heard in late 2023, detail the illicit money stream. Victims were lured by the defendants and their accomplices from bases on the Isle of Man and in the Philippines, according to the Chinese court papers. They say the defendants would work in teams to pull Chinese investors into chat groups on QQ - a popular Chinese instant messaging service similar to WhatsApp. One scammer would play the role of an investment ""teacher"", and others would pretend to be fellow investors. The BBC has seen evidence - including in the court papers - that many of those who arrived in Douglas from the Philippines were engaged in the scams. All used the same computer equipment, depended on QQ for their work and, with the exception of a few managers, all held the same job title. The fake investors would build an atmosphere of hype and excitement around the money-making skills of the ""teacher"", who would then tell the victim to put money into a particular investment platform, the Chinese court found. Dazzled by the hype, the victim would comply, only for their funds to be syphoned off by the scammers, who actually controlled these platforms and could manipulate them from behind the scenes. The Chinese court said it was difficult to verify the victims' total losses - but it said 38.87m renminbi (£4.17m/$5.3m) had been taken from at least 12 victims. Relying on evidence including the defendants’ own confessions, as well as travel and financial records and chat logs, the court found the six defendants guilty. This was not only a profitable but also a sophisticated scam, say the court documents, requiring front line teams to deploy the ""pig-butchering"" techniques with persuasiveness and skill. The BBC has discovered the identity of the companies' sole beneficiary. His name was hidden behind layers of administrative paperwork. MIC and its affiliate companies were all held by a trust set up by an individual named ""Bill Morgan"" who, documents show, was also known as Liang Lingfei. Employees called him ""Boss Liang"", says Jordan. The Chinese court papers refer to a man called Liang Lingfei being the co-founder of MIC on the Isle of Man - which it described as ""a fairly stable criminal organisation established in order to carry out scam activities"". Mr Liang was not one of those prosecuted or represented at the hearings. The court stated that Mr Liang was also co-founder of the scamming organisation in the Philippines. The BBC has seen evidence that many MIC employees worked there before being transferred to the Isle of Man. Our investigation has also found that Mr Liang obtained an Isle of Man investment visa and attended multiple company events on the island. His wife also owns a home in the town of Ballasalla, near the island’s airport. The group of companies on the Isle of Man was ambitious, having signed a planning agreement late last year for a glitzy ""parkland campus"" headquarters on the site of a former naval training base. A spokesperson for the developers described it as the ""largest single private investment in the Isle of Man"". Architects’ images show office buildings set on a hill above the seafront in Douglas. Inside would have been penthouse apartments, a spa, multiple bars and a karaoke lounge. The campus was to be used by MIC staff and those working for MIC's ""affiliate"" companies, including those involved in online gambling, planning documents state. Conservative estimates put the global annual revenues of the ""pig-butchering"" industry at more than $60bn (£46.5bn). ""This is the first such case we've seen of one of these [pig-butchering] scam operations setting up in a Western country,"" says Masood Karimipour, South East Asia representative at the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Trying to stop the scams is like a ""game of whack-a-mole"", he says, and it is a battle that ""organised crime is currently winning"" as criminals engage in what he calls ""jurisdiction shopping"" where they perceive there to be legal loopholes and little oversight. Any ambitions the group of companies may have had on the Isle of Man - legitimate or otherwise - appear to have come to an end. In April, police raided the former bank offices. They also targeted an address next to the island's Courts of Justice building - using a ladder to enter through a first-floor window in the early hours of the morning. In a statement released shortly afterwards, police said the raids had been in connection with a wider fraud and money laundering investigation in relation to King Gaming Ltd IOM. Seven people had been arrested and released on bail, they added. Since then, a further three people are known to have been arrested. Receivers were appointed earlier this month for companies in the group - including MIC and King Gaming Ltd IOM - at the request of the Isle of Man's attorney general. The island's gambling regulator has stripped MIC's gambling affiliate companies of their licences. The parkland campus site was cleared of trees and signage went up - but the redevelopment is now on hold indefinitely. The BBC has made repeated attempts, via several methods of communication, to contact the companies involved - as well as Bill Morgan/Liang Langfei and company directors - but has received no replies. We have also attempted to contact the Seaview Hotel, but have received no response, though there is no suggestion that anyone there was aware of any illegal activities taking place on the premises.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vpywnepv4o,PM to 'end gloom' and donor 'breaks cover',Many of Tuesday's front pages look ahead to the speech by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at the Labour conference.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:05.307468,China News,BBC,China,"""Light at the end of this tunnel, PM tells Britain"" is the Daily Telegraph's headline. The paper says Sir Keir Starmer will use his conference speech to warn that he can't lower taxes yet, but can ""bring joy"" back to people's lives over the next five years. The Times focuses on Sir Keir's plans to give investigators new powers to access information about people's bank accounts, as part of measures to tackle benefit fraud. The Mirror leads with a different pledge set to be included in the prime minister's speech. It says he will today confirm a Hillsborough Law will be introduced by April to stop state bodies misleading investigations.  The Financial Times reports on Rachel Reeves's speech at the conference in Liverpool yesterday, telling readers it struck an ""optimistic note"". The Daily Express leads on the winter fuel debate. The paper says dozens of retired union members gathered yesterday to oppose the decision to means-test the payments. It highlights booing in the venue when it was announced that a debate on the matter would be delayed. The Daily Mail reports on what it describes as a ""chilling threat"" from the leader of the RMT union, Mick Lynch. The paper says that, during a speech at a fringe event in Liverpool, Mr Lynch said the goal of union chiefs was the ""complete organisation of the UK economy"". The Mail says that unions have been ""flexing their muscles"" at the Labour conference, with the Royal College of Nursing leaving the chancellor ""red-faced"" when it rejected a government pay offer. The Guardian leads on claims that six water companies in England have overcharged customers by up to £1.5bn. Lawyers at the first environmental competition class action against water companies are said to have argued, at a tribunal, that the firms underreported the true scale of their sewage pollution of rivers and waterways. As a result, it is claimed they were able to charge customers higher bills. The report carries a statement from the industry body, Water UK, which describes the allegation as ""highly speculative"" and ""without merit"". The Times says Chinese internet users are mourning a retired British petroleum engineer, known to them as ""Old Dry Keith"". Keith Brown's wife began posting social media videos of him preparing his daily ham and tomato sandwich, which the paper says attracted criticism from millions of people for its ""Anglo"" blandness.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxrv97djw9o,What's the point of buying the latest smartphone?,"It is the time of year when new handsets are unveiled, but they may offer only small improvements.",19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:05.412483,China News,BBC,China,"Happy new smartphone season to all who celebrate. It’s that time of year again, when the tech giants pull out all the stops to persuade you to upgrade your gadgets. Recently we’ve seen Google launch the latest Pixel 9 handsets, followed by Apple unveiling the iPhone 16. In July, Samsung released the latest versions of its foldable phones, the Z Flip6 and Z Fold6, and Huawei has just upped the ante in that department by unveiling a handset called the Mate XT, in China, which contains two folds, folding the screen into thirds. With smartphone sales slowing worldwide, the marketing messages getting pushed out are increasingly dazzling. Apple boss Tim Cook promised that the iPhone16 would “redefine what a smartphone would do”, whatever that means. Google product management vice president Brian Rakowski waxed lyrical about the “stunning” design of the “gorgeous” Pixel 9 (whisper it: it still looks a lot like a black rectangle to me). Huawei now has its own consumer brand song, it says in its press material, which “powerfully expresses the pursuit of dreams, highlighting that every breakthrough and success the company has achieved stems from a belief in dreams”. Yes, we are still talking about phones. Both Apple and Google have gone big on baked-in AI features. Google’s new Magic Editor can add AI generated content into existing photos, as well as remove the bits you don’t want (with varying degrees of success, in my experience). Apple Intelligence on the iPhone16 includes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s tech being embedded into the digital assistant Siri – which many argue has long been in need of an update. But has anyone actually said that they want all of this stuff? Mobile phone expert Ben Wood, from research firm CCS Insight, said that while AI features aim to make digital life easier, they’re not necessarily on top of everybody’s wish list. “I think that most people now know what they want from a phone, with one of the most important things being the camera,” he says. The phone designers also know this. The tech spec of every new handset camera is usually an improvement on the previous generation. But even this isn’t a guaranteed sales generator any more. “What is definitely happening is that people are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2013 there were 30 million phones sold annually,” adds Mr Wood. “This year it will be around 13.5 million.” There is of course an ongoing cost of living crisis affecting people’s spending decisions. And there’s also an environmental price tag attached to every handset, all of which contain rare elements and precious metals. In addition, there is a growing trend, especially among parents and young people, to try to step away from smartphones entirely. A number of UK schools are reviewing their smartphone policies, and a few have already opted for an outright ban. Pupils starting at the public school Eton this term were issued feature phones (sometimes, rather unpopularly known as dumb phones), and I have heard of several other institutions, both in the private and state sectors, which are considering following suit. The mobile phone network EE recommends that children below the age of 11 shouldn’t have smartphones at all. Nova Eden leads the north and west London branch of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, which urges parents and schools to collaborate to delay the age at which children are given the devices. “We are not anti-tech, we are just pro-childhood,” she says. “We would like to see tech companies develop a child friendly phone, offering only essential features such as calls, messaging, music, and maps, without any additional functionalities.” Dr Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at the AI firm Hugging Face, says that so far, this message does not seem to be getting through. “There’s increased talk of ‘digital sobriety’ in the way we build and use technology – but it sounds like smartphone designers are going in the exact opposite direction,” she says. I put this to Apple, Google and Samsung. The latter said: ""Samsung users can choose how they use their Galaxy phones that best fits their needs. For example, digital wellbeing features allow users to select what features they use, when they use them and for how long, such as setting a screen time limit on specific apps they want to restrict."" One company that is listening to the growing calls for reduced phone functionality is the Finnish firm HMD – which still makes basic Nokia handsets. Last month it launched a Barbie-themed phone in collaboration with toymaker Mattel, and I tried it out. The two words I would use to describe it are: functional. And pink. Like most feature phones, it has no apps, no app store, no selfie camera, and only one game. If you want to listen to music there’s an FM radio. CCS Insight forecasts that around 400,000 feature phones are likely to be sold in the UK this year – nowhere near enough to knock the iPhone off the top of the list of the world’s most-sold handsets any time soon, but not a bad market space. I just checked my own screentime over the past seven days, and I averaged around five hours per day, This is admittedly a sobering statistic – but it wasn’t all doomscrolling (honest). My phone is a work tool, it’s also what I use for banking, shopping, directions, health tracking and keeping track of family plans, as well as, yes, gaming and social media. “I think the thing we always forget is that there's a tremendous amount of benefits from using smartphones,” says Pete Etchells, professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa university, who has written extensively about the issue of screen time. “We tend to focus a lot more on the negatives. It's always worth bearing in mind that these are technologies of convenience. They help us. There are some good aspects to them as well.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjvel0pynqo,Why is the Pope doing a long tour when he's so frail?,His packed trip to Asia involves three countries in which Catholics are a minority.,8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:05.522450,China News,BBC,China,"Pope Francis, who has often appeared to revel in confounding and surprising others, is at it again. Many times over the years, he has seemed to suggest he is slowing down, only to ramp up his activities again. At nearly 88 years old, he has a knee ailment that impairs mobility, abdominal problems caused by diverticulitis and is vulnerable to respiratory issues owing to the removal of most of one of his lungs. Last autumn, the Pope said his health problems meant that foreign travel had become difficult. Soon after, when he cancelled a trip to the UAE, it led to heightened speculation about the extent of his medical difficulties. But that was then. Now, he is in the middle of the longest foreign visit of his 11-and-a-half year papacy. It has been one packed with engagements, and as well as Timor-Leste it involves three countries – Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Singapore – in which Catholics are a minority. So why is the Pope travelling so extensively and so far from home? His supporters say his passion drives him. “He obviously has an enormous amount of stamina and that is driven by his absolute passion for mission,” says Father Anthony Chantry, the UK director of the Pope’s mission charity Missio, who has just been appointed to the Vatican administration’s evangelisation department. “He talks about all of us having a tireless mission to reach out to others, to set an example.” Christian “mission” is something that has evolved over the centuries. It is still about spreading the gospel but now the stated aim is focused on social justice and charitable endeavours. Throughout his trip Pope Francis will meet missionaries, including a group from Argentina now based in Papua New Guinea. But on numerous trips around Asia including this one, he also skirts close to China, a country with deep suspicions about the Church, its mission and its motives. The Pope has frequently emphasised the importance of evangelisation for every Catholic. Yet in many parts of the world, it is still hard to separate ideas of “missionaries” and “evangelisation” from notions of European colonisation. As the number of Catholics in Europe declines, is “mission” and “evangelising” in Asia and Africa now about Church expansion in those parts of the world? “I think what he is preaching is the Gospel of love that will do no one any harm. He's not trying to drum up support for the Church, that's not what evangelisation is about,” says Father Anthony. “It isn't to be equated with proselytising, that is not what we have done for a long time. That is not the agenda of the Holy Father and not the agenda of the Church. What we do is we share and we help people in any way we can, regardless of their faith or not having any faith.” Father Anthony says being a Christian missionary in the modern day, for which Pope Francis is setting an example, is about doing good work and listening, but sometimes, “where necessary”, also challenging ideas. “We believe God will do the rest, and if that leads to people accepting Jesus Christ, that's great. And if it helps people to appreciate their own spirituality – their own culture – more, then I think that is another success.” Certainly the Pope has long talked of interfaith harmony and respect for other faiths. One of the most enduring images of his current trip will be his kissing the hand of the Grand Imam of the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta and holding it to his cheek. He was warmly welcomed by people coming out to see him in the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world. Pope and top Indonesian imam make joint call for peace Pope Francis will end his marathon trip in Singapore, a country where around three-quarters of the population is ethnic Chinese, but also where the Catholic minority is heavily involved in missionary work in poorer areas. For centuries now, Singapore has been something of a strategic regional hub for the Catholic Church, and what Pope Francis says and does there is likely to be closely watched in China, not least by the Catholics living there. It is hard to get a true picture of numbers, but estimates suggest around 12 million. The lack of clarity over numbers is partly because China’s Catholics have been split between the official Catholic Church in China and an underground church loyal to the Vatican that evolved under communism. In trying to unite the two groups, Pope Francis has been accused of appeasing Beijing and letting down Catholics in the underground movement who had not accepted the Chinese government’s interference, and who face the continued threat of persecution. Deals struck between the Vatican and Beijing in recent years appear to have left a situation where the Chinese government appoints Catholic bishops, and the Pope gives in and recognises them. China says it’s a matter of sovereignty, while Pope Francis insists he has the final say – though that is not the way it has looked. “He won't be pleasing everyone all the time, but I think what the Holy Father really wants to indicate is that the Church is not a threat to the state,” says Father Anthony Chantry. “He is treading a very careful path and it's fraught with difficulties, but I think what he's trying to do is just to build up a respectful relationship with the government in China.” Rightly or wrongly, it is all in the name of bringing more people into the fold. Some of Pope Francis’ predecessors have been more uncompromising in many ways, seeming to be more accepting of a smaller, “purer” global Catholic community, rather than make concessions in either foreign relations or in the way the Church views, for example, divorce or homosexuality. While some popes have also clearly been more comfortable in study and theology than travel and being surrounded by huge crowds, some have leaned into the politics of their position. It is very clear when travelling with Pope Francis that while he can often look tired and subdued during diplomatic events, he is quickly rejuvenated by the masses who come out to see him, and energised by the non-dignitaries he meets, particularly young people. This is certainly not a pope who shuns the limelight – it is being among people, some would say mission, that appears to be his lifeblood. Father Anthony Chantry says this latest, longest papal trip is just a continued display of how the Pope feels the Church should engage with both Catholics and non-Catholics. “The whole thrust is that we have got to reach out to others. We have to make everyone feel welcome. I think he (Pope Francis) does that really well, but I don't think he's trying to score any points there, it's just him.” There is very little the Pope has done since his election in 2013 that has not rankled Catholic traditionalists, who often feel that his spirit of outreach is taken too far. His actions on this trip are unlikely to change that. BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240925-the-summer-that-tourism-fell-apart,The summer that tourism fell apart,"After a summer of protests in some of Europe's most popular travel destinations, what might your summer holiday look like in 2025 - and beyond?",26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:16.662990,China News,BBC,China,"After a summer of protests in some of Europe's most popular travel destinations, what might your summer holiday look like in 2025 – and beyond? The message has been clear this year: travel is back. But while European tourism has hit new heights in 2024, not everybody has been happy about it. In April, tens of thousands of people came together in the Canary Islands to protest the negative impacts of mass tourism, and separate anti-tourism rallies took place across Europe this summer. Locals sprayed tourists with water pistols in Barcelona; while in Mallorca, residents crammed onto beach towels to show how they feel about their beaches being overrun by tourists. Travellers have been subject to a slew of new regulations, including rules on where they can and can't take selfies, fees to visit cities, fines on hiking in flip-flops and even mayors of popular holiday destinations asking travellers to stay away. As the peak summer tourism season draws to an end, it's clear that the issue isn't over. Last month in Rovaniemi, the capital of Lapland in northern Finland, a tourism protest sought to draw attention to the impact mass tourism has on winter destinations too. Unless something significant changes, a repeat of this summer's problems is likely to continue next year. Spanish tourism alone is set to grow by 5% in 2025, with more than 90 million visits expected from overseas tourists; while France looks to remain the most-visited country in the world in 2025.   Jeremy Sampson, CEO of The Travel Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that tourism has a positive impact on destinations, has been working since 2003 to move the industry towards a more balanced model that benefits locals and the environment alike. ""This isn't the first time overtourism has arisen,"" he tells the BBC. ""Just before Covid in 2019, the issue was starting to crescendo. Communities were starting to get frustrated with tourism and destinations had lost control."" However, he doesn't believe that overtourism is the real issue. Instead, he says, we need to address the root cause, which is ""bad, unbalanced planning. Tourism is complicated to regulate, and it has to be an aligned ecosystem of people; that comes initially from the destination."" Thoughtful Travel Want to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more. Indeed, this is something that many cities and countries are working on. Barcelona just updated its tourism campaign slogan from ""Visit Barcelona"" to ""This is Barcelona"" in a bid to temper the call to visit; while Visit Norway has pulled a proposed campaign that promotes the country as a destination for outdoor activities to address questions around tourism management in vulnerable environments. Other places are looking to better manage the tourists who arrive, hoping to find a mutual win for travellers, locals and destinations alike. Copenhagen has announced that the city's pilot CopenPay project, which offered free entry to cultural centres and museums to travellers who exhibited sustainable behaviours, will be extended in 2025. The pioneering scheme has had a ripple effect, too, according to Rikke Holm Petersen, director of communication at Visit Copenhagen: ""As a result of CopenPay, we have held meetings and had approaches from a wide range of tourism organisations worldwide, including, among others, the EU Commission, VisitBerlin, the government of Zurich, the Tokyo municipal government and Tourisme Montreal."" Another way that cities and countries are regulating numbers is through tourism taxes, and travellers are going to see more and more of it, if this summer's pilot projects are anything to go by. The Venice tourist tax, which trialled this year, requiring day trippers to register and pay €5 to enter, will be rolled out in a second trial phase next year, potentially with higher fees and a longer duration. Elsewhere in Italy, Rome's deputy mayor of tourism, Alessandro Onorato, wants to introduce a ticketing system for the Trevi Fountain, with tourists paying a €2 fee that will go towards protecting the iconic monument. While these cities are only adding a handful of euros to the cost of holidays, elsewhere in the world, more hefty fees are being used as a barrier to entry. Bhutan is considering increasing its daily fee to up to $200 in response to a growth in tourism demand, with the fee going towards sustainable tourism development. In New Zealand, meanwhile, the entry tax for foreign tourists is set to nearly triple from NZ$35 to NZ$100 on 1 October, while cruise-related fees in the country are also set to dramatically increase. Both are part of New Zealand's strategy to attract ""high-value"" travellers and deter those on a lower budget. Elsewhere in the cruise industry, Greece has been mooting a €20 per passenger cruise fee for ships docking at its most popular islands, Santorini and Mykonos. Santorini has previously welcomed upwards of 10,000 passengers per day; the additional fee may act as a deterrent to large cruise liners, which have been criticised for their role in ""hit and run"" tourism. Accommodation choices are narrowing for holidaymakers too. Locals in holiday hotspots have been vocal in their feelings around the short-term rental industry, which they feel is negatively affecting the housing market and housing supply overall. And authorities are taking note, with destinations including central Athens and Mallorca planning to reduce the number available. More like this:  • 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024  • Why it's time to rethink what it means to be a tourist  • Seeking tourists: Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers With New York outlawing short-term lets already, Barcelona banning them by 2029 and Edinburgh's new regulatory system limiting them, it looks more likely that, moving forward, more of us will be staying in hotels than central short-term lets – typically paying more too. If we want to stay in local-style accommodation, it will most likely be outside city centres. While some parts of Europe have been creaking under the strain of tourism, other areas are open for business and are happily welcoming travellers. Second cities, third cities and lesser-visited destinations are getting more attention – and it's all good news for travellers.   This year, instead of sending out a list of hyped destinations where people should go, thereby fuelling overtourism, tour operator Intrepid instituted a ""Not Hot"" List, highlighting less-popular destinations that deserve a spotlight. Their aim is to shift the positive benefits of tourism to places that need it. It's a good signpost for anyone planning their travel next year: instead of Argentina, South America's most-visited country, they suggest the natural wonders and cultural experiences of Guyana, its least-visited country; rather than better-known Stockholm, it champions Oslo as one of the underdogs of the Scandinavian travel scene. The question is, do people want to ditch their travel dreams – the classic travel destinations – to go somewhere new? Place development and destination marketing specialist Samira Holma works with destinations from Brazil to Spain, with a particular focus on sustainable tourism, and considers this a complicated issue. ""For now, more people who've already been and are well-travelled will start to explore beyond, but many first-time visitors continue to go to the hotspots,"" she says. ""As slow travel becomes more common, people will add other stops to the itinerary that may be lesser known. But I still think it will take time until we see many first-time visitors skip the most iconic places."" She also notes that different cultures have different travel habits and patterns. While European travellers show more openness to explore underrated places, she cites reports showing that travellers from markets like China and the UAE tend to be drawn to the classic bucket list experiences. So, what should you do when planning your next holiday? Sampson has one piece of advice for individuals who want to be part of the solution, not the problem. ""I would encourage people to do some research and dig beneath the surface,"" he says. ""Gen-Z has a values-based decision-making process that is a good approach to copy. And think about it: if a place is choked with people, is it going to be a good experience for locals? Is it going to be a good experience for you?""   -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04p5rrvgqro,Lacrosse Olympics return 'huge' for Manchester,"As attention turns to the 2028 Olympics, what does lacrosse returning to the Games mean for Manchester?",5 days ago,2024-10-15 10:35:16.774689,China News,BBC,China,"As Paris handed over the Olympic torch to Los Angeles earlier this year, it marked the countdown to lacrosse's return to the Games in 2028, ending what will be a 120-year wait. For England and Nottingham University coach Michael Armstrong, originally from Altrincham, its return to the Olympic programme is not only monumental for the game but for Manchester, which he described as a ""hot bed"" for lacrosse. ""For a sport that not many people have heard of, to have this opportunity on a global platform is huge, it's something that World Lacrosse have been working on for a long, long time now,"" he told the BBC. ""It's super exciting for what it could mean for the sport after the Olympics in terms of the legacy, it will no doubt go on to inspire and change many more young people's lives in the area - as it has done mine."" The sport's roots in the city are believed to date back to 1875 when an exhibition match promoting the game was held at Old Trafford cricket ground. The following year Stockport Lacrosse Club was established making it the oldest in the country. In total, there are about 15 clubs across Greater Manchester and the English Lacrosse headquarters are based at the Etihad Campus. Lacrosse was discovered being played by native Americans in the 15th Century as a way of settling disputes between tribes. A modern six-on-six version of the sport will be played at the Olympics which, due to its fast-paced nature, Mr Armstrong likens to basketball. ""It's on a shorter field and more end to end than traditional lacrosse with some of the more unusual rules being removed to try and make it a bit more of a spectacle,"" he said. ""There's also a big emphasis on trying to blend the men's and the women's games closer together so it doesn't feel like two separate versions of the sport."" Beyond 2028, due to limited places, a sport's inclusion in the Olympics is highly competitive and there are no guarantees lacrosse will be chosen again for future Games. However, Mr Armstrong believed there was a ""real opportunity"" it would return for the Brisbane Olympics in 2032 due to the sport's popularity in Australia. Preparations for the Olympic Games continue from Friday over the weekend as both British men's and women's teams compete in the inaugural USA Lacrosse Experience in Indianapolis. The squad includes Tommy Kirkland, 33, from Cheadle, who said although Great Britain's Olympic qualification is currently unknown, both squads were working hard to give themselves the best chance of being there. ""The Olympics is the pinnacle of sport, so to have the opportunity to compete in one is unbelievable for a sport like ours,"" he told the BBC. ""Personally, age isn't on my side, but if I can continue to positively impact the team and help some of the newer, younger players in the squad adapt to the sixes format then that is something I'm looking forward to.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7488w85n00o,Why hundreds of Samsung workers are protesting in India,About 1500 workers in Tamil Nadu state have been striking work for the past 11 days.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:16.984837,China News,BBC,China,"For the past 11 days, about 1,500 workers of South Korean technology giant Samsung Electronics have been striking work in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, leading to major disruptions in production. The plant in Chennai city, one of Samsung's two factories in India, employs nearly 2,000 workers and produces home appliances, contributing about a third to the company's annual $12bn (£9bn) revenue in India. The striking workers gather at a plot of land near the 17-year-old factory daily, demanding that Samsung recognise their newly-formed labour union - the Samsung India Labour Welfare Union (SILWU). They say that only a union can help them negotiate better wages and working hours with the management. The protest, one of the largest Samsung has seen in recent years, comes even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been courting foreign investment by positioning India as a viable alternative to China for manufacturing activities. Samsung India has released a statement saying that the welfare of its workers was its top priority. ""We have initiated discussions with our workers at the Chennai plant to resolve all issues at the earliest,” it said. Hours earlier, the police had detained around 104 workers for undertaking a protest march without permission. The protesters were released in the evening. ""The workers have decided to strike work indefinitely till their demands are met,” said A Soundararajan, member of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu), backed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Citu has backed the new union in the factory. The workers have three key demands: Samsung must recognise the new union, allow collective bargaining, and reject competing unions as about 90% of the workforce belongs to SILWU, said Mr Soundararajan. Workers, earning an average of 25,000 rupees ($298; £226) a month, are demanding staggered raises totalling a 50% increase over the next three years, according to Citu. Citu also alleged that workers at the plant were being ""pressurised to finish each product - like a refrigerator, washing machine, or TV - within 10-15 seconds"", work non-stop for four to five hours at a stretch, and do their jobs in unsafe conditions. “We categorically deny that workers are made to work for four hours at a stretch. All workers get suitable breaks in between,"" Samsung India said in an official statement. ""Also, employees work on their given task of the manufacturing process as products are passed through the conveyor line. They are not required to 'finish' a product in such a time frame, which is not realistic. We reiterate that we are in compliance with all laws and regulations,"" the statement added. Mr Soundararajan also alleged that workers were pressurised by the management to leave the new union and that their families were threatened as well. Samsung India said the firm ""categorically denies all the allegations and that it maintains absolute compliance with all the existing labour laws"". Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu's Labour Welfare Minister CV Ganesan said he had assured union officials that talks were under way to resolve their issues. ""We will fulfil the demands of the workers,"" he said. Sijo*, a protester, said that he arrives at the protest site daily at 08:00 IST (02:30 GMT) and stays until 17:00, joining hundreds of workers in their blue Samsung India uniforms. The union arranges for lunch and water for the protesters, while a makeshift cloth tent protects them from the elements. There are no washroom facilities, so the workers use the outdoors. ""Since the factory was set up, employees have been working without complaints or a union. But things have been getting bad over the past couple of years, and now, we need the support of a union,"" Sijo said.  He added that his pay doesn't keep pace with the cost of living and that this has put a strain of his family's finances. Up until 2020, the Samsung Group was known for not allowing unions to represent its workers. But things changed after the company came under intense public scrutiny after its chairman was prosecuted for market manipulation and bribery. Millions of Indian workers join trade unions - often backed by leftist parties - who use their political clout to enforce labour laws and negotiate better conditions. ""Foreign companies set up in India but resist following local laws on workers' rights to association and collective bargaining,"" alleged Mr Soundararajan. Many prominent multinational companies, including Apple and Amazon, have set up factories in India. But labour rights activists allege that many of them underpay and overwork their Indian employees and collude with state governments to clamp down on workers' rights. Shyam Sundar, a labour economist, said multinational corporations use various ""human resource strategies"" to prevent workers from forming unions in developing countries like India.  For one, they fiercely oppose workers joining external, politically-backed unions and encourage them to form ""worker-led"" internal ones. ""This ensures that the management has some control over the union's activities,"" Mr Sundar said. Mr Soundararajan alleged that management at the Chennai plant had also approached workers with this solution, which they refused. A source in Samsung India told the BBC that the organisation ""fully supports unions but not ones backed by a third-party"". Later the company said in an official statement that it ""is ready to communicate with the work council comprised of a majority of employees on matters including wages, benefits and working conditions"". Mr Sundar said firms also hire young, unskilled workers, especially from rural areas, by attracting them with a good starting salary. ""These 'trainees' are promised to be made permanent employees after a couple of months, but this doesn't happen. The salaries too stay stagnant or have very low increments."" The rapid growth of ""flexible workers"" - employees hired on contract - has become a key strategy of multinational corporations to stop unionising by ensuring a pliant workforce, he added.  According to the latest government statistics, every two in five workers employed in factories in India in 2022 were contractual labourers, making up about 40% of the workforce in industrial establishments. ""Companies use the threat of re-location or non-expansion to discourage state governments from enforcing labour laws,"" Mr Sundar said. ""But workers can leverage global labour unions to pressure companies to abide by international labour laws,"" he added. *Name changed to protect the worker's identity This story has been updated with official statements from Samsung India With inputs from Vijayanand Arumugam from BBC Tamil and Nikhil Inamdar from BBC News "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ejye39434o,Volvo gives up plan to sell only EVs by 2030,The car maker's decision comes as industry faces slowing demand in some major markets for electric vehicles.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:17.101709,China News,BBC,China,"Car company Volvo has abandoned its target to produce only fully electric cars by 2030, saying it now expects to be selling some hybrid vehicles by that date. The carmaker blamed changing market conditions for its decision to give up a target it had announced only three years ago. It comes as the industry faces a slowdown in demand in some major markets for electric vehicles (EVs) and uncertainty due to the imposition of trade tariffs on EVs made in China. Volvo, which has traditionally flaunted its environmental credentials, joins other major carmakers General Motors and Ford in rowing back on EV ambitions. Volvo now expects at least 90% of its output to be made up of both electric cars and plug-in hybrids by 2030.  The Swedish company may also sell a small number of so-called mild hybrids, which are more conventional vehicles with limited electrical assistance. ""We are resolute in our belief that our future is electric,"" said Jim Rowan, chief executive of Volvo. ""However, it is clear that the transition to electrification will not be linear, and customers and markets are moving at different speeds."" The company also said the business climate for EVs had changed, due to factors such as a slow rollout of charging infrastructure and the withdrawal of consumer incentives. Independent equity analyst Anna McDonald said consumers still had concerns about switching to EVs. “Some of the subsidies that governments had put in place to encourage electric car purchases have ended and also there’s just that ongoing lack of demand because consumers are worried about charging,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. “It still remains the case that electric cars remain more expensive. ""While the EU and the US are putting tariffs on Chinese cars that are imported to stop them kind of swamping the market, that just means that vehicles have to be made outside China which is more expensive in themselves. ""Car manufacturers are not keen to start making a loss on these vehicles,"" Ms McDonald added.  Registrations of EVs across the European Union dropped by nearly 11% in July, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Volvo is majority-owned by Chinese car giant Geely and because it uses factories in China, it will also be affected by tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs in Europe and North America. Last week, Canada announced it was imposing a 100% tariff on imports of China-made electric vehicles, after similar announcements by the US and the EU. Western countries have accused China of subsidising its EV industry, giving its car makers an unfair advantage. China has rejected those allegations and criticised the tariffs as ""discriminatory"". Ford has also been scaling back on its EV ambitions. Just last month, the US car giant announced it was scrapping plans for a large, three-row, all-electric sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and postponing the launch of its next electric pick-up truck. Its rival General Motors has also been cutting EV production goals in the last year."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg5m13v9r2o,A rare behind the scenes look at the Pacific power tussle,"As the US, China and UK try to woo Pacific Islands for geopolitical reasons, nations are more concerned about climate.",5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:17.213537,China News,BBC,China,"Tonga’s sleepy capital Nuku’alofa was buzzing last week as leaders from across the Pacific region descended upon it for the annual Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) meeting. Every so often, a police escort would speed through its streets, sirens blaring. On the bonnet of the cars, small flags identified the foreign delegations. China and Taiwan were visible, as well as the Union Jack and the United Nations. All of them only participated as dialogue partners or observers. But they made a lot of noise. Their security detail was bigger than those of most of the 18 PIF members, save perhaps New Zealand and Australia. Tonga’s Royal Palace looked understated in comparison with only a sole guard looking after the King, according to sources. Throughout the week, diplomats called the meeting fascinating - but the underlying concern is that the interest by these delegations is not necessarily in line with what PIF leaders or its people want. The PIF is made up of 18 members - mostly Pacific Island nations as well as Australia and New Zealand -  but delegations from across the world also attend, keen to play a role in the region, which is assuming greater geopolitical significance. The big players are no longer just Australia and the US. China is a rising power in the Pacific and one that causes ructions. Nuku’alofa has almost buckled under the pressure of all this interest. Outside one of its top hotels, where the big delegations were staying, there was a billboard looking for staff - declaring ""no experience necessary - all positions"".  Inside the hotel, another notice warned that Tonga was facing a scarcity of skilled workers and therefore couldn’t service the general public during the forum. It was a pertinent reminder of the ""brain drain"" that many Pacific nations face as their people head to Australia and New Zealand for a better future. At the forum itself, Australia scored a victory quite early on when it announced a A$400m ($268m; £204m) Pacific Policing Initiative that aims to set up a police training facility in Brisbane and four centres across the Pacific. It will also train regional officers to be deployed across the region for major disasters or big events. No sooner than the plan had been announced, it was eclipsed by a ""hot mic"" moment. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was caught on camera calling the deal ""a cracker"" in a conversation with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell. In a conversation he didn’t think was being filmed, he even joked with Mr Campbell about going ""halfsies on the cost"". It was an awkward gaffe that made it pretty clear that the policing initiative was a ""win"" against China’s growing influence in the region - 1-0 to Australia and its friends. That Mr Albanese’s remarks were made in the auditorium that was built by the Chinese makes the competition all the more relevant. Chinese influence on the island is clear. Next to the auditorium is a large patch of land that holds the Royal Tombs, which has now been boarded up with big signs on the outside saying a renovation is being carried out with the help of China Aid. It’s a similar story across the Pacific. But the conversation also backed up reservations made by Vanuatu’s Prime Minister and the head of the Melanesian Spearhead Group that the policing initiative could be seen more about cutting out China than focusing on the benefits for the Pacific Islands. Mr Albanese’s ""cracker"" comments weren’t the only controversy last week. In the final communique issued by PIF leaders on Friday afternoon, there was a reaffirmation of a 1992 agreement allowing Taiwan to play a role in forum leaders’ meetings. The communique was then removed and put up again, removing the reference to Taiwan. That then led to accusations that PIF leaders had given in to pressure from China although they suggested it was in fact an administrative error. Of the 18 countries in the Pacific Islands Forum, just three have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. While China is a ""dialogue partner’"" Taiwan is a ""development partner"", which is a step down in importance. What all these arguments show is the very real competition that is hotting up in the Pacific. Everyone wants to come to the PIF because everyone wants a piece of the region. The thing is, while superpowers fight it out for relevance, so too do the Pacific Islands. There’s a real emphasis on making sure that those who participate in this forum do so in the Pacific way – and for the benefit of people in the Pacific. A recent report by the Lowy Institute found that strategic rivalry can at times forget the needs of people. “Many of these economies are struggling to meet basic development needs,” according to the report entitled ‘The Great Game in the Pacific islands’.  “Larger powers often prioritise projects that deliver strategic gains such as telecommunications, ports and military facilities, or political dividends such as stadiums and convention centres, over less visibly impressive projects.” On the penultimate day, leaders went on a retreat on the island of Vava’u. Meanwhile in Nuku’alofa, side events carried on. One was on the Pacific Resilience Facility, the first Pacific-led climate and disaster resilience financing fund whose headquarters will be in Tonga. Attending the event were ministers and diplomats from members including Tonga, Tuvalu and Australia. There was great pride in the fund with expectations that this could be the answer to supporting climate change concerns across the region. Australia has been the biggest donor so far, with A$100m. The US, China and Saudi Arabia have also contributed but the fund still only has US$137m in total - that's a long way from their target of US$500m by 2026 and a long-term goal of US$1.5bn.  “I think it’s harder to get funding for climate change,” Paulson Panapa, Tuvalu’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Labour and Trade told the BBC. “We want all donors to treat both as very important just like it’s important to us. The Pacific Islands are small but in many ways they are mighty. These nations sit in an ocean that accounts for a third of the world’s surface area – what happens in their waters – politically, economically, diplomatically will shape the future of the world – both for good and bad."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20241004-the-simple-formula-that-made-duolingo-a-daily-habit-for-millions,How Duolingo became so addicting,"Perhaps no app has mastered user loyalty quite like Duolingo, the gamified language-learning platform 34 million people a day can't put down.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:17.319805,China News,BBC,China,"Perhaps no app has mastered user loyalty quite like Duolingo, the gamified language-learning platform 34 million people a day can't put down. Here, CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn tells the BBC why their insistent owl works so well. The day I started working on this story about Duolingo it seemed to be everywhere. I heard from a friend who was celebrating her 800-day Spanish practice streak on the app. I read about a journalist from The Guardian who became addicted to learning Italian. A Sri Lankan waitress in Brooklyn switched from English to Spanish when she heard my mother and I speaking, crediting Duolingo for her skills. But my deep interest in the world's most downloaded language-learning app truly began last year when I saw first-hand its significant impact on new migrants to the US, a country undergoing one of the largest migration waves of the decade. At some point in their long journeys, Duolingo becomes an essential tool for these people on the move. John Jairo Ocampo, a former bus driver from Colombia, recalls struggling to find work in his first days in the US in 2023, when a boss at a construction site in New York City explained simply, ""More English, more money."" He used Duolingo to learn. Now, the family lives in Indianapolis, and John’s wife is using the app to get along better at her job in an elementary school kitchen; she says her boss is using it, too, to learn Spanish. The migrant experience is not foreign to Duolingo's CEO and co-founder, Luis von Ahn, who was born and raised in Guatemala, a Central American country with over 55% of its population living in poverty. EXECUTIVE LOUNGE The BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business – and paving the path for other leaders to thrive. Read more conversations here. ""In a Latin American country, and in Guatemala in particular, if you have money, you can buy a very good education, but if you don't have money, sometimes you don't even learn how to read and write,"" Von Ahn told the BBC in a recent interview at Duolingo's brand new office in downtown New York. ""That made a big impression on me."" So when non-native English speakers Von Ahn and Severin Hacker, Duolingo's CTO and co-founder, started their company in 2012, they knew that learning languages, and in particular learning English, has the potential to change people's lives. ""This is why we've worked really hard to keep Duolingo free, because we want to give access to education to everybody."" To maintain the promise of an open and free app, Von Ahn and Hacker developed a hybrid business model that combines ad-supported access and ""freemium"" elements, while also offering a paid subscription with extra benefits, like an ad-free experience and a family plan. And it worked. ""The main way in which we grow is by word of mouth, so people tell their friends,"" he says. One such word of mouth moment came from Bill Gates, who said in a Reddit chat back in 2015 that he regretted not speaking more languages and had tried Duolingo. In the intervening years the app has found its way onto many, many screens. According to Duolingo's shareholders letter, in 2023 the company's revenue was $531m and the forecast for the full-year 2024 is $731m. Roughly 8% of Duolingo users pay for a subscription, contributing to 80% of the company’s revenue. Meanwhile, the vast majority, 90%, use the free version and see ads, which account for only 8% of the earnings. The app combines short, engaging lessons and game-like elements to help users develop speaking, reading, writing and listening skills in 41 languages. Around half of users are practicing English, and Duolingo can be used to learn other major world languages like Spanish and Chinese, as well as some lesser-spoken languages, such as Esperanto, Navajo and even High Valyrian, a fictional language developed for HBO's Game of Thrones. There was some controversy last year when Duolingo paused its Welsh language course. The app now offers maths and music courses, as well. To keep people coming back daily, Duolingo created a streak system and fashioned characters with strong personalities, such as the infamous green owl, Duo, and a goth purple-haired teen, Lilly. These characters send daily practice reminders and, based on social media posts, are magnetic to users. More like this: • Eslei! How a new generation is reinventing Spanglish (bbc.com) • How Float used 'customer obsession' to build the right products • 'A wonderful opportunity': The adventure of raising bilingual children The brand has taken advantage of Duo's popularity as evidenced by its TikTok videos, where it does ""very strange stuff"", as Von Ahn described. ""At first it was just this owl, then I think it started getting a life of its own when the notifications from the phone started coming from the owl. People started ascribing it a personality, and then I think people started memes for the owl, because the owl is very insistent,"" he added. Still, he sees the appeal. ""I cannot speak French to another person, but I can speak French to her,"" Von Ahn says of Lilly, opening his phone to demonstrate Duolingo's new product released at Duocon this summer, which allows conversational practice. The CEO, who claims he is shy when speaking new languages, talks enthusiastically with the app in good French with a bumpy accent (he says he spends 30 minutes a day in the app and is also learning Swedish and Japanese). ""Most people are like me,"" he says, explaining why this is his favourite feature. ""When they're not very good at a language, they just don't want to speak to another person. So it's going to let people actually practice."" Today, Duolingo serves 34 million daily users worldwide and employs 850 people across six cities: Detroit, Seattle, Berlin, Beijing, New York, and their headquarters in Pittsburgh, where you can discover the company's culinary spin-off, Duo's Taqueria. This global presence affirms the company's accelerated growth. In October 2024, Duolingo's market capitalisation was $12.27bn, a significant rise from 2022, when its market cap was $2.85bn. The CEO's journey to becoming a tech-founder billionaire began when he was an eight-year-old boy in Guatemala City, where his single mother, a doctor, gifted him a computer instead of the Nintendo he had wanted. He left Guatemala in 1996 to study mathematics at Duke University. He went on to pursue a PhD in computer science, and it was during his first year at Carnegie Mellon University, in 2000, when a pivotal moment occurred.   The young doctoral student attended a talk in which Yahoo!'s head scientist shared 10 problems the company couldn't solve. ""At the time [Yahoo!] was the biggest internet company, it was huge. Yahoo! gave free email accounts to people, and there were malicious people that were writing programs to obtain millions of email accounts, and they didn't know how to stop them. I went home, I thought about it, and came up – along with my PhD advisor – with the idea of a Captcha, that is the distorted characters that people have to see online [to prove that you’re a human],"" he reveals. Captcha, an acronym for ""Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"", served as the foundation for ReCaptcha – best known today as Google's I am not a robot verification system. It was not only a technological improvement, but also a company founded and solely owned by Von Ahn. In 2009, Google acquired it for an undisclosed eight-figure sum, along with a game that helped improve the accuracy of Google Image Search. By his early-30s, von Ahn had become a millionaire. Although Luis von Ahn didn't become the mathematics teacher he dreamt of being as a teenager in Guatemala City, these milestones, and the awards he has won along the way, allowed him to create an educational platform that now lives in the pockets of millions worldwide. Here, he tells the BBC more about his un-put-downable app and how a self-proclaimed ""people-pleaser"" gets by in the C-suite. What do you think sets Duolingo apart from its competitors? Duolingo's free version is really good, and I think that matters. And the second one is that we early on understood that the hardest thing about learning something by yourself is staying motivated, so we have spent a lot of time making Duolingo fun. With Duolingo it feels like you're playing a game as opposed to education apps which are just trying to teach you something without engaging you. How does Duolingo keep users engaged and coming back?  Gamification is probably the most important thing. We try to turn the whole thing into a game, but we try to use storytelling. From the beginning, I wanted to have a mascot. I thought that it would make the whole thing more accessible. And having it doing weird things online really helps. But it's not like it started in one day. This is an evolution. It all works together to create a brand that people love. Most of the [features] we have now, we got to by trial and error. We've tried too many things that didn't work. The ones that are now there is because we tried them, and they did work. How do you create habituation?  It really depends. People who are learning English, which are half of the users, generally actually want to learn English. They really care. The others, it's more of a hobby. If you take a user in the US and you ask them, ""why are you using Duolingo?"" Very common answers [are]:""I used to play a lot of Candy Crush"" or ""I used to look at a lot of Instagram and now I'm doing Duolingo instead, and at least I'm learning a little bit of Spanish or a little bit of German or whatever"". So it's kind of like a productive use of time. Even when apps and screen time can be seen as problematic, is your hope is that Duolingo is creating a positive habit? We want it to be positive. When we decided to start teaching maths and music, these are two things that we thought are just positive. We may expand to other subjects, but we're going to try to continue doing things that are positive. We're unlikely to [teach] the Pokemon characters, for example. Maybe people want to learn that, but we just want to do things that are good for the world, and we want parents to feel good about giving their kids this app. We want it to be the case that after you use the app, you feel like you did something good. Duolingo's website claims to have a diverse workforce from more than 30 countries, why is that important for a platform like yours?  We have a lot of international employees and that's been really good. Sometimes you don't know what's going on in a certain country, and then an employee from the country tells us: ""the reason this is not working is because you translated that word wrong"".  Do you see strange sentences often? Can you share an example? Most of our sentences are useful sentences, like ""where is the bathroom"", but some of them are just strange, and that has helped our virality. One that always stuck with me, I think it was in the Danish course. The sentence said: ""Over there, behind the bed, lies the body of her husband"". And it's like, what is that? What is that sentence? DUOLINGO BY THE NUMBERS • 100 million active users (users that have done a lesson in the last month) • 34 million daily app users • Six global offices • 850 employees around the world (Source: Duolingo / Luis von Ahn) What is the most challenging part of being a CEO of a large company?  I don't think we're very large, we are 850 people. Two things for me. When we were smaller, when we were like 50 people, everybody trusted me because they spent time with me directly, and they're like ""OK, he's a nice guy"". Once I have more than, I don't know, 300 people, I can't spend time with everybody. And so, it’s much harder for trust to happen. And a lot of times I have to make decisions that are not popular. When you are very close to somebody else and they make an unpopular decision, you understand them because you're like, ""OK, ultimately I know they are a good person"". And the other one that's been hard, but this is a very personal thing, I'm very conflict avoidant and sometimes I have to tell people something they don't like. And that's hard for me. Is it hard for you to tell people something that will hurt them? I am a people pleaser and it's good and bad. I married a Swedish woman and, let me tell you, she's direct. In our culture, in Latin America, you're so indirect. In Guatemala we just go around the subject and around the subject, to try to make them understand, but never tell them. Whereas Swedish people are just like: ""I don't like you"". And it's just like, ""wait, why are you saying that?"" We would never say that in Latin American culture. It must be difficult for you to fire someone. Oh, my God! Yes! It's horrible. The first person I fired, when we were a very small company, it was a woman. I fired her at the end of the day one day. And then the next day I came into the office, and she was still here. And it turned out she didn't understand that I had fired her because I never said ""you're fired"". I just went around it, and I thought she understood. And then we hugged, and I thought that was the end of it. Then I came in and I'm like ""Why are you here?"" She said ""we had a really good conversation yesterday; I will do a better job"". And I'm like ""No"". And then I had to fire her again. I've learned that the wrong way to fire somebody is to build up to it. You [have to] start by saying ""I am so sorry. I'm going to have to let you go"". You say it first, so that it's super clear. Where are you looking to grow; are you focused on particular emerging markets or new demographics? Markets matter. Right now, we have users in every country in the world. The ones that are our big focus are the US, UK, Germany, France, Japan, China, Brazil, Spanish-speaking Latin America, India, Italy and Turkey. I may have missed one, but these are the countries where we have people on the ground and where we're spending. Do you think that an app like Duolingo could be becoming an alternative method for education or other skills more broadly? Yeah, I think you can learn other skills, but I don't think that an app will replace schools or universities. That's because schools and universities serve other purposes. Schools, for example, serve the purpose of childcare. And universities, you get to learn how to be an adult. But I do think you'll be able to learn almost everything in an app. Also, from a global standpoint, [many] people don't have access to a good teacher or a good education. So hopefully they'll be able to learn with this. Do you see Duolingo occupying that space? I would like that. I don't know if we'll be able to teach everything, but I would like that. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gz4re394o,World order 'under threat not seen since Cold War',"The MI6 and CIA chiefs, who made their first public appearance together, warn of challenges such as the war in Ukraine, Islamic State, Israel-Gaza conflict and the rise of China.",7 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:17.444462,China News,BBC,China,"The international world order is ""under threat in a way we haven’t seen since the Cold War"", the heads of the UK and US foreign intelligence services have warned. The chiefs of MI6 and the CIA also said both countries stand together in ""resisting an assertive Russia and Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine"". In a first-ever joint article, Sir Richard Moore and William Burns wrote in the Financial Times that they saw the war in Ukraine coming ""and were able to warn the international community"", in part by declassifying secrets to help Kyiv. And they said there was work being done to ""disrupt the reckless campaign of sabotage"" across Europe by Russia, push for de-escalation in the Israel-Gaza war, and counterterrorism to thwart the resurgent Islamic State (IS). In the FT op-ed, they wrote: ""There is no question that the international world order – the balanced system that has led to relative peace and stability and delivered rising living standards, opportunities and prosperity – is under threat in a way we haven’t seen since the Cold War."" ""Successfully combating this risk"" is at the foundation of the special relationship between the UK and US, they added. One of the ""unprecedented array of threats"" faced by both countries is the war in Ukraine, which is in its third year after Russia's invasion in February 2022. The security services chiefs made their first public speaking appearance together at the FT Weekend Festival at London's Kenwood House on Saturday.  Details of the speakers were kept under wraps until just minutes before they arrived on stage. They appeared relaxed together and stressed the close working partnership between their agencies. Mr Burns told attendees that Ukraine's recent seizure of Russian territory in the Kursk region was a ""significant tactical victory"", but he saw no evidence that  Russian President Vladimir Putin's grip on power was weakening. There have been calls from Ukraine for the West to supply more weapons and lift restrictions on their use inside Russia.   The failure to do so has sometimes been put down to fears over how Moscow might react. But the spy chiefs suggested that should not deter support for Ukraine. ""None of us should take lightly the risks of escalation,"" Mr Burns said.  He described a moment in late 2022 when there was, he said, a ""genuine risk"" of the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia in response to setbacks on the battlefield.  Mr Burns passed messages to Russian officials warning of the consequences of their use. ""I’ve never thought, however - and this is the view of my agency - that we should be unnecessarily intimidated by that,"" the CIA Director continued.  ""Putin’s a bully. He’s going to continue to sabre rattle from time to time."" Asked about an apparent increased willingness of Russian intelligence services to carry out covert operations like sabotage and arson in Europe, Sir Richard Moore said their use of criminals to carry out attacks suggested a degree of desperation. ""Russian intelligence services have gone a bit feral in some of their behaviour,"" he said.  Mr Burns added that even if plots sometimes appeared amateurish, they could still be ""reckless and dangerous"". In their joint piece for the FT newspaper, both men said ""staying the course is more vital than ever"" when it comes to supporting Ukraine, adding that Mr Putin ""will not succeed"". The conflict has shown how technology can alter the course of war, and highlighted the need to ""adapt, experiment and innovate"", they said. They continued: ""Beyond Ukraine, we continue to work together to disrupt the reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe being waged by Russian intelligence, and its cynical use of technology to spread lies and disinformation designed to drive wedges between us."" Both foreign intelligence services see the rise of China as the main intelligence and geopolitical challenge of the century.  They have reorganised their services ""to reflect that priority"", the pair wrote. They also said they have pushed ""hard"" for restraint and de-escalation in the Middle East, and have been working ""ceaselessly"" to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal. Mr Burns, who has been central to ceasefire efforts, indicated at the FT event that there may be a more detailed proposal in the coming days. ""This is ultimately a question of political will,"" he said, adding that he ""profoundly"" hopes leaders on both sides will do a deal. It is 11 months since Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then in Israel's ongoing military campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8dpz8l07do,Alarming rise in abandoned pets sparks 'crisis point',Animal centres are struggling to stay afloat amid a rise in bills and surrendered animals.,9 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:17.545759,China News,BBC,China,"Animal rescue centres have hit ""crisis point"" amid an alarming rise in abandoned pets in ""desperate need of care"", charity bosses have said. In the aftermath of a global pandemic and the midst of a cost of living crisis, more pets are being deserted than ever before.  Many animal centres across the west of England have warned that they are struggling to stay afloat, due to a manifold of increasing costs. ""Unsociable pandemic pups with behavioural problems"" have resulted in one shelter refurbishing new accommodation, as lots of these animals are not being adopted.    Rescue centres are now pleading with owners to research responsibly before buying a pet, and to seek early treatment to prevent chronic illnesses escalating. Bristol Animal Rescue Centre (ARC) has taken in almost 380 animals since January, and bosses say they have reached ""crisis point"".  The shelter have been caring for Bristol's pets and wildlife since 1887, making it the city's largest and longest-standing animal charity. However, they say the pressure on their resources has never been more taxing, with a 24% increase in animal uptake since last year, when about 300 pets were abandoned. “The need for support has never been greater. ""We are facing unprecedented challenges, as more and more animals arrive at our doors in desperate need of care,""  said Rosie El-Tibi, head of fundraising. The centre has seen a ""huge increase"" in uptake of animals with complex medical needs, she added.  This year, 10 French Bulldogs have been abandoned compared to two during the same period in 2023. These animals have required several surgeries including palate, facial fold, nares (enlarging nostrils) and knee caps. ""The extensive health and vet care required can be extremely costly, leading to them being abandoned because people are unable to afford the vet fees,"" Ms El-Tibi added. Although Bristol ARC is affiliated with the RSPCA, it is a self-funded branch which relies entirely on donations. Phil Hobbins-White, who has two rescue dogs of his own, is running a marathon for every month of the year to raise money for the centre and support the animals. He has just completed his seventh marathon in 2024, and said: ""Every marathon I run, and every pound I raise, feels quite personal and hopefully goes towards giving animals a better chance in life."" Elsewhere in Somerset, Bath Cats and Dogs Home (BCDH) has also seen an influx of animals requiring emergency treatment or surgery upon arrival.  ""By the time those animals come to us the problems have become more chronic. ""We have to put those dogs back together- medically, emotionally and behaviourally- and that takes time,"" said head of animal operations Julie Stone. BCDH have taken in 513 animals in total since January, and on average take in one stray animal per day.  Their veterinary team conducted more than 300 operations and 2,000 medical consultations between August 2023 and August 2024. Ms Stone added that the Covid pandemic drastically ""changed the landscape of rescue"", with impulsive purchases leading to a surge in unsocialised 'pandemic pups' with behavioural issues, making adoption more difficult.  To cope with the crisis, the shelter are refurbishing an existing building on site to provide extra accommodation, surgical theatres, adoption rooms and recovery suites.  To reduce pressure on services, the rescue centre also offers support to help keep pets with their families, including paying for vet care and donating food.  ""If people love their pets and want to provide for them, we'll do all we can to help you keep them,"" said CEO Rachel Jones.  ""Please don't get to the point where you feel you have to abandon them. If you do reach that point, get in touch with us.  ""It's much better if we know about a pet's history and the kind of environment they've come from, so we can provide medical treatment quickly or match them up with a good home,"" she added. Also offering a hardship fund for cash-strapped owners is Cheltenham Animal Shelter, in Gloucestershire. Last year, they saved 69 pets from neglect by financing their medical treatment. However, their annual running costs exceed £1m and are on the rise, taking in more animals than ever before and struggling to find them a ""forever home"".  Energy costs are projected to be £52,000 in 2024, which is a 49% increase compared to 2023. Meanwhile, veterinary bills are projected to be about £75,000. ""This year, we have had over 560 requests to take pets into our care from members of the public, which far exceeds our capacity. ""An increase in unwanted animals, fewer people willing to adopt, rising costs and less disposable income have come together to create a challenging environment,"" said head of fundraising Alison Jarvis."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly55p8y5yxo,'This should be a jewel of the world heritage site',The future of the Derwent Valley Mills is in the spotlight following criticism from Unesco.,25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:29.725141,China News,BBC,China,"""This building is in a dire strait."" The gloomy assessment of Derek Latham, chairman of the Derbyshire Historic Buildings Trust, as he stands and surveys Belper Mills, a historic site dating back to 1804. It forms part of the Derwent Valley Mills - a world heritage site situated along a 15-mile stretch of river between Cromford and Derby. These historic buildings were awarded world heritage status in 2001 but that could now be at risk after the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) said it had ""grave concern"" about the area's future. World heritage status places the area on a similar footing to the Taj Mahal in India, the pyramids of Giza in Egypt and the Great Wall of China. But Unesco has cited repeated ""inappropriate"" developments in the area as cause for concern, and highlighted the ""poor condition of the Belper Mills complex"". Most of the site - which campaign group Our Belper Mills says lays claim to being the first iron-framed building in the world - is disused.  The main buildings appear to be in a state of disrepair with broken windows and weeds growing through the brickwork. Mr Latham says he is shocked at the potential risk of the site losing its Unesco status.  ""It really is the cradle of the industrial revolution, along with Ironbridge in Telford,"" he said. Looking at Belper Mills, he said he thought Unesco must have questioned, ""how on Earth could it still be in this state?"" Mr Latham is urging the current owner of the building, First Investments Real Estate Management, to sell it to Derbyshire County Council. Alternatively, he would like the authority to enforce an urgent works notice, to force the owner to carry out repairs. ""It can be part of a major regeneration of this part of Belper, not only to rescue it, but to turn it into a jewel of the world heritage site, which it deserves to be,"" he said. A council spokesperson said the authority was ""not in a financial position"" to buy and restore Belper Mills, but would work with ""all partners to see how we can best support"" their preservation. Barry Lewis, leader of the county council, is also chairman of the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership. He said: ""It's vitally important that we continue to protect the world heritage site and we will make every effort to address the concerns of Unesco. ""But the Derwent Valley Mills are in a position whereby they are split across a number of different local authority areas along the River Derwent and into the city of Derby, and the concerns raised do highlight the competing needs of sensitive heritage redevelopment and housing and business development in an urban setting.  ""With many of the buildings in private ownership, which are outside the control of the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership, maintaining and developing the site is a complex enterprise which relies on the collaboration and co-operation of many different organisations. ""We welcome the guidance from Unesco and we are now consulting with partner organisations to agree how the partnership can best respond to the world heritage committee's recommendations for the future benefit of this unique site."" The results of a consultation, commissioned by the county council on behalf of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site (DVMWHS) Partnership in February 2023, suggested the Belper Mills site could be saved and become a mix of residential and commercial use. The BBC has contacted First Investments Real Estate Management for comment, but so far the company has not responded. Belper Mills was not the only location cited as a cause for concern. Unesco also wants the government to reconsider approval of The Landmark development on a former car park in Derby. The site sits just 150m (500ft) from the former Silk Mill site, considered to be the world's first mechanised factory. If built, the 17-storey tower, with more than 200 apartments, would be one of Derby's tallest buildings. At the moment, the site is fenced off with no sign of activity. The Godwin Group, which owns the site, said: ""While recent market conditions have slowed progress on The Landmark, development of the scheme continues, and we are actively exploring options for delivery, either independently or through a partnership.  ""We will provide further updates as soon as they become available."" Cromford Mills in Matlock - built in 1771 by Sir Richard Arkwright - was the world's first successful water-powered cotton spinning mill. It also forms part of the Derwent Valley heritage site and was praised in Unesco's report for the mixed-use redevelopment of the mill. Sarah Wheatley, who runs a shop called WeaveKnitit at the site, is worried about the potential impact if the area's world heritage status was revoked. ""We have a lot of tourists that come because of the status, to see what it is and what people are doing with the buildings now,"" she said. One visitor - Linda Walker, from Long Eaton in Derbyshire - said: ""I don’t think people would necessarily come here if it wasn't a Unesco site."" Meanwhile, Arkwright Society chief executive Eilis Scott welcomed Unesco's feedback and said the heritage status ""recognises just how special this place is"". ""There are a number of recommendations that recognises the good work that we've been doing and the importance of Cromford Mills and the Derwent Valley,"" she said. ""It also recognises that we need continued support.  ""We have a number of mill buildings that we need to transform into new uses and income-generating uses."" So how likely is it the Derwent Valley Mills could lose its Unesco endorsement? Liverpool was stripped of its world heritage status in 2021 after a UN committee found developments had threatened the value of the city's waterfront. But Mr Lewis does not think the world heritage site is close to suffering a similar fate. He does, however, agree with Unesco's criticism of the Belper Mills site, which he said was in ""an astonishingly poor condition"". He said there was millions of pounds of ""conservative deficit in that building, meaning it would cost tens of millions of pounds more to put it right because it is a conservation listed building"". Mr Lewis thinks the area's local authorities - including the county council he leads - need to work together to ensure any development is as appropriate as possible. Similarly, Nadine Peatfield, leader of Derby City Council, says the authority will ""continue to liaise"" with Unesco. ""We take the Unesco report very seriously and we have reviewed that report,"" she said. ""We treasure our world heritage site and we want to do everything we can to protect that, of course, but at the same time it is in conflict with some of the demands we have within the city on housing, redevelopment and regeneration."" The Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Steering Group will write a response to Unesco, which will be put forward through the UK government by February 2025.

Philippine authorities have been pursuing Alice Guo across four countries since she disappeared in July following an investigation into her alleged criminal activities. She has been accused of protecting online casinos, which were a front for scam centres and human trafficking syndicates in her sleepy pig farming town, Bamban. Ms Guo denies the allegations. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said she would be flown back to the Philippines as early as Wednesday. She said she grew up on the family farm with her Chinese father and Filipina mother, but MPs who investigated the scam centre operations said her fingerprints matched a Chinese national named Guo Hua Ping and accused her of being a spy who provided cover for criminal gangs. The dramatic nature of her case, which has since seen her sister arrested and questioned by the Philippine Senate, sparked fury in the country and drew international attention. Ms Guo's case has played out as the Philippines and China continue to spar over reefs and outcrops in the South China Sea. China has not commented on the allegations against her. Authorities believe that Ms Guo slipped past border checks in July and took several boats, crossing neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore, on her way to Indonesia, where she was arrested on Tuesday on the western border of the capital Jakarta. Mr Marcos said her arrest is ""a warning to those who attempt to evade justice"". ""Such is an exercise in futility. The arm of the law is long and it will reach you,"" he wrote on Facebook. Photos showed Ms Guo wearing light pink pyjamas and a white coat when she was arrested.  Ms Guo was thrust under the national spotlight after authorities in March uncovered a sprawling scam centre in Bamban that were hiding under online casinos, known locally as Philippine Online Gaming Operations (Pogo). Pogos cater to clients in the Chinese mainland, where gambling is illegal. Ms Guo's case confirmed suspicions that Pogos were being used as a front for organised crime and led to Mr Marcos outlawing them in response to public anger. Pogos flourished under his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose presidency was marked by close ties with China. But Mr Marcos reversed the country's foreign policy direction and has cracked down on Pogo-linked crimes since assuming office in 2022. During the raid in Ms Guo's town, police rescued close to 700 scam centre workers, including 202 Chinese nationals and 73 other foreigners who were forced to pose as online lovers. A Senate investigation that followed centred on her inability to detect the eight-hectare scam centre despite its location near her office. Senators also grilled her on her parentage. A relative unknown in local politics, she was elected mayor on her first run for public office, which is rare in areas ruled by political families. Ms Guo's opaque answers on questions regarding her roots, led some senators to accuse her of being a Chinese ""asset"" or spy. She gave a television interview where she attributed her low profile to being her father's illegitimate child with her mum, who is also his maid. She said this forced her to lead a sheltered life in the family farm, until she was elected mayor of Bamban. But the controversy did not subside and after she refused to appear in subsequent hearings, senators in July ordered her arrest. By that time, however, she had fallen from public view. Soon after, an anti-graft body removed her from office. In August, Filipino authorities said she had fled the country undetected and passed through Singapore and Malaysia on her way to Indonesia. One official said she could be headed for the Golden Triangle, a border region in mainland South East Asia that is a known hideout of organised crime groups. A furious Mr Marcos then ordered her Philippine passport cancelled and warned then that ""heads will roll"". He said Ms Guo's escape ""laid bare the corruption that undermines our justice system and erodes the people's trust"". "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy343z53l1o,What are Harris and Trump's policies?,"Economy, immigration, abortion and other top issues - here is where the two candidates stand.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:30.091297,China News,BBC,China,"American voters will face a clear choice for president on election day, between Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policies compare on different issues. Harris has said her day-one priority would be trying to reduce food and housing costs for working families. She promises to ban price-gouging on groceries, help first-time home buyers and provide incentives to increase housing supply. Trump has promised to “end inflation and make America affordable again”.  He has promised to deliver lower interest rates, something the president does not control, and he says deporting undocumented immigrants will ease pressure on housing. Harris has made abortion rights central to her campaign, and she continues to advocate for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide. Trump has struggled to find a consistent message in recent weeks.  The three judges he appointed to the Supreme Court while president were pivotal in overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, a 1973 ruling known as Roe v Wade. Harris was tasked with tackling the root causes of the southern border crisis and helped raise billions of dollars of private money to make regional investments aimed at stemming the flow north. Record numbers of people crossed from Mexico at the end of 2023 but the numbers have fallen since. In this campaign, she has toughened her stance and emphasised her experience as a prosecutor in California taking on human traffickers. Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the construction of a wall and increasing enforcement. But he urged Republicans to ditch a hardline, cross-party border bill, backed by Harris. He has also promised the biggest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in US history. Experts told the BBC this would face legal challenges. Harris wants to raise taxes on big businesses and Americans making $400,000 (£305,000) a year. But she has also unveiled a number of measures that would ease the tax burden on families, including an expansion of child tax credits. Trump proposes a number of tax cuts worth trillions, including an extension of his 2017 cuts which mostly helped the wealthy. He says he will pay for them through higher growth and tariffs on imports. Analysts say both tax plans will add to the ballooning deficit, but Trump’s by more. Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. She has pledged, if elected, to ensure the US and not China wins ""the competition for the 21st Century"". She has been a longtime advocate for a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, and has called for an end to the war in Gaza. Trump has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world. He has said he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel but said little on how he would end the war in Gaza. Harris has criticised Trump’s sweeping plan to put tariffs on imports, calling it a national tax on working families which will cost each household $4,000 a year. She is expected to have a more targeted approach to taxing imports. Trump has made tariffs a central pledge in this campaign. He has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods, and much higher ones on those from China. Harris, as vice-president, helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has funnelled hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy, and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programmes.  But she has dropped her opposition to fracking, a technique for recovering gas and oil opposed by environmentalists. Trump, while in the White House, rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles.  In this campaign he has vowed to expand Arctic drilling and attacked electric cars. Harris has been part of a White House administration which has reduced prescription drug costs and capped insulin prices at $35. Trump has said he will not renew his attempts while president to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions more people.  He has called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but that could be opposed by Republicans in Congress. Harris has tried to contrast her experience as a prosecutor with the fact Trump has been convicted of a crime.  Trump has vowed to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime. Harris has made preventing gun violence a key pledge, and she and Tim Walz - both gun owners - often advocate for tighter laws. But they will find that moves like expanding background checks or banning assault weapons will need the help of Congress. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, the constitutional right to bear arms. Addressing the National Rifle Association in May, he said he was their best friend."

More than 20 others were injured after the blast in South Khorasan province. It is reported to have been caused by a methane gas explosion in two blocks of the mine in Tabas, 540 km (335 miles) southeast of the capital Tehran. The explosion occurred at 21:00 local time (17:30 GMT) on Saturday, state media said. South Khorasan's governor Javad Ghenaatzadeh said there were 69 workers in the blocks at the time of the explosion. According to the AP news agency, he said: ""There was an explosion and unfortunately 69 people were working in the B and C blocks of Madanjoo mine.  ""In block C there were 22 people and in block B there were 47 people."" It remains unclear how many people are still alive and trapped inside the mine. State media has now revised its earlier toll of 30 dead. ""The number of dead workers increased to 51 and the number of injured increased to 20,"" the official IRNA news agency reported. Citing the head of Iran's Red Crescent, state TV said earlier on Sunday that 24 people were missing. According to Reuters news agency, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed condolences to the victims' families.  ""I spoke with ministers and we will do our best to follow up,"" Pezeshkian said in televised comments. The Tabas mine covers an area of more than 30,000 square kilometres (nearly 11,600 square miles) and holds mass reserves of coking and thermal coal, according to IRNA. It is ""considered the richest and largest coal area in Iran,"" IRNA said. Local prosecutor Ali Nesaei was quoted by state media as saying ""gas accumulation in the mine"" has made search operations difficult. ""Currently, the priority is to provide aid to the injured and pull people from under the rubble,"" Nesaei said. He added that ""the negligence and fault of the relevant agents will be dealt with"" at a later date.  Last year, an explosion at a coal mine in the northern city of Damghan killed six people, also likely the result of methane leak according to local media. In May 2021, two miners died in a collapse at the same site, local media reported at the time. A blast in 2017 killed 43 miners in Azad Shahr city in northern Iran, triggering anger towards Iranian authorities."

By Wednesday, flood waters from the swollen river reached a metre high in parts of the city, forcing some residents to navigate their neighbourhoods by boat. Power has been cut to some districts because of safety concerns, while 10 of Hanoi's 30 administrative districts are on ""flood alert"", state media reported. Vietnam is suffering the aftermath of Typhoon Yagi, which battered the north, killing at least 179 people. Floods and landslides across northern Vietnam have been the main causes of death, the government said.  ""This is the worst flood I have seen,"" Hanoi resident Tran Le Quyen told Reuters news agency. ""It was dry yesterday morning. Now the entire street is flooded. We couldn't sleep last night.""  Yagi, which was initially categorised as a super typhoon - the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane - but later downgraded to a tropical depression, has continued to wreak havoc in Vietnam since making landfall on Saturday. It has been described as Asia's most powerful typhoon this year. ""My home is now part of the river,"" Nguyen Van Hung, who lives in a neighbourhood on the banks of the Red River, told Reuters.  An entire village, Lang Nu in the northern Lao Cai province, was swept away on Tuesday amid flash floods. At least 30 people have been confirmed dead, while hundreds of soldiers have been deployed to the village in search of those still missing. Hoang Thi Bay, one of 63 survivors in the remote mountain community, told the AFP news agency that she avoided being swept away by holding on to a pillar. ""I looked out of the window and saw a huge amount of land coming towards me,"" she said. ""I ran out to our kitchen, and clung tightly to a concrete pole. Our wooden stilt house was destroyed."" Authorities are also paying careful attention on a hydropower plant in the northwestern Yen Bai province, as a huge inflow of water into the reservoir surrounding the dam raises concerns that it may collapse.  Deputy Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyen Hoang Hiep said on Wednesday that the hydropower plant is ""safe"", but urged residents in the area to stay under shelter, as it may take up to two days for the water to recede to an ""allowable level"". Yagi has left a trail of destruction in the country's northern region over the past four days. On Monday, it collapsed a busy bridge, plunging ten cars and two scooters into the Red River.  It also tore roofs from buildings, uprooted trees, and left widespread damage to infrastructure and factories in the north. Before hitting Vietnam, the typhoon left 24 people dead across southern China and the Philippines. Scientists have warned that as the world warms, typhoons can bring higher wind speeds and more intense rainfall, although the influence of climate change on individual storms is complicated.

Thousands of people were seen stranded on rooftops in some northern provinces, while others posted desperate pleas for help on social media on Tuesday. Typhoon Yagi - Vietnam's most powerful storm in 30 years - has wreaked havoc across the north of the country, leaving 1.5 million people without power. On Monday, dashcam footage showed the moment the Phong Chau bridge in Phu Tho province gave way, plunging several vehicles into the water below. Although it has now weakened into a tropical depression, authorities have warned Yagi will create more disruption as it moves westwards. Phan Thi Tuyet, 50, who lives close to the river, told the AFP news agency that she had never experienced such high water. ""I have lost everything, all gone,"" she said, clutching her two dogs. ""I had to come to higher ground to save our lives. We could not bring any of the furniture with us. Everything is under water now."" The storm - which brought winds of nearly 150km/h (92mph) - has damaged bridges, torn roofs off buildings, damaged factories and triggered widespread flooding and landslides, leaving 64 people still missing. Authorities have now issued flood and landslide warnings for 401 communes across 18 northern provinces. One-storey homes in parts of Thai Nguyen and Yen Bai provinces were almost completely submerged in the early hours of Tuesday, with residents waiting on the roofs for help. As well as the dead and missing, flooding and landslides have also injured at least 752 people, officials at the ministry of agriculture said on Tuesday. Before hitting Vietnam, Yagi left 24 people dead across southern China and the Philippines. Meteorologists say that as the world warms typhoons can bring higher wind speeds and more intense rainfall, although the influence of climate change on individual storms is complicated."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qk9p2elo,China's mission to win African hearts with satellite TV,"China pledged to install satellite dishes in some 10,000 villages across Africa, aiming to generate goodwill.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:30.604795,China News,BBC,China,"As African leaders gather in Beijing this week for the triennial China-Africa summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping may have one thing under his belt to boast about - satellite TV. Almost nine years ago, President Xi promised the heads of state attending the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Johannesburg that China would provide over 10,000 remote villages in 23 African countries with digital TV access. With over 9,600 villages having received satellite infrastructure, the project is now nearing completion. The ambitious pledge, revealed during a period of warm China-Africa relations and funded by China’s aid budget, was entrusted to StarTimes, a private Chinese company already operating in several African countries. It was an apparent show of goodwill and an opportunity for China to flex its soft power in a strategically important region.  As China's economy struggles and Beijing re-calibrates its Africa strategy, the BBC World Service visited four villages in Kenya to find out if this ""soft power"" initiative had paid off. In the village of Olasiti, about three hours’ drive west of the capital, Nairobi, Nicholas Nguku gathered his friends and family to watch Kenyan athletes running at the Paris Olympics on television. “I’m very happy to see the Olympics, which for many years we had not been able to see before we got StarTimes,” he said, speaking of the company’s installation of satellite dishes about four years ago. He is far from the only beneficiary of StarTimes’ presence across Africa. First introduced to the continent in 2008, StarTimes is now one of the largest private digital TV providers in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 16 million subscribers. Analysts say that low pricing initially helped to secure its foothold.  In Kenya, monthly digital TV packages range from 329 shillings ($2.50; £2) to 1,799 shillings ($14; £10.50).  In comparison, a monthly package for DStv, owned by MultiChoice, another major player in the African digital TV market, costs between 700 and 10,500 shillings. While StarTimes partly relies on subscriptions for its core revenue, the “10,000 Villages Project” is funded by China's state–run South-South Assistance Fund. The satellite dishes all feature the StarTimes logo, Kenya’s Ministry of Information emblem, and a red “China Aid” logo. During the installation of these dishes, StarTimes representatives said that this was a ""gift"" from China, several villagers recalled. According to Dr Angela Lewis, an academic who has written extensively on StarTimes in Africa, the project had the potential to leave a positive image of China for African audiences. Villagers under the project ostensibly received everything for free, including the infrastructure, such as a satellite dish, battery, and installation, as well as a subscription to StarTimes’ content. This was a “game-changer,” according to Dr Lewis, as remote villages in Africa previously mostly had access to choppy and unreliable analogue TV. For many, this was their first access to satellite dishes, altering the way villagers interacted with the outside world, she said. For community centres like hospitals and schools in Ainomoi village in western Kenya, subscriptions remain free. At the local clinic a digital TV in the waiting room helps patients pass the time. And at a primary school, pupils enjoy watching cartoons after school. “After we finish schoolwork, we’ll all watch cartoons together and it’s a very enjoyable and bonding experience,” said Ruth Chelang’at, an eighth-grade student at the school. However, several Kenyan households interviewed by the BBC say the free trial unexpectedly lasted only a limited amount of time.  Despite its relatively cheap price, extending subscriptions was considered a significant financial burden for many. With that, the initial excitement has waned among some of the project’s beneficiaries, putting a dent in China’s push to build up goodwill. “We were all very happy when we first got the satellite dish, but it was only free for a few months, and after that we had to pay,” said Rose Chepkemoi, from Chemori village in Kericho county. “It was too much so we stopped using it.” Without a subscription, only certain free-to-air channels, such as the Kenyan Broadcasting Cooperation, are available, according to those who no longer subscribe to StarTimes packages. During the BBC’s visit to four different villages that received StarTimes dishes from 2018 to 2020, many villagers reported stopping their use of StarTimes after the free trial ended. The chief of Ainamoi village said that many of the original 25 households who received the satellite dishes in his village opted not to subscribe. The BBC contacted StarTimes for comment on the free trials but did not receive a reply. China’s influence extends to the content broadcast on StarTimes channels, with mixed results. Even the cheapest packages include channels like Kung Fu and Sino Drama, showcasing predominantly Chinese movies and series. In 2023, over 1,000 Chinese movies and TV shows were dubbed into local languages, Ma Shaoyong, StarTimes’ head of public relations, told local media. In Kenya’s case, in 2014, the company launched a channel called ST Swahili, dedicated to Swahili content. Among villagers who have watched Chinese shows, many said they found the programming outdated, portraying Chinese characters in a one-dimensional way, with shows often centred around stereotypical themes. A quick flick through the guide shows a plethora of dating or romance-centric shows, including a popular reality show called Hello, Mr. Right, where contestants seek to find their perfect match. The format was modelled on a similar show in China called If You Are the One. For some at least, that content is a reason to continue the subscription. Ariana Nation Ngotiek, a 21-year-old from Olasiti village, is “obsessed” with certain shows, like the Chinese series Eternal Love, which is dubbed into English. “I won’t go to sleep without watching it,” she said. But football remains the ultimate attraction for African audiences. In 2023, for example, the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) had a record number of nearly two billion viewers globally, according to the Confederation of African Football. Aware of this business opportunity, StarTimes has heavily invested in securing broadcasting rights for football matches, including Afcon, Spain's La Liga and Germany's Bundesliga. “Sports broadcasting is where StarTimes made its name,” explained Dr Lewis. Competition is fierce, however, and SuperSport, a subsidiary of MultiChoice, reportedly pays over $200m (£152m) annually for rights to broadcast the coveted English Premier League. After French football megastar Kylian Mbappé announced he was joining Spain's Real Madrid, StarTimes seized the opportunity and erected huge billboards in Nairobi that read “Feel the full thrill of La Liga”, followed by the StarTimes logo. However, this does not work for everyone. One football fan told the BBC he would “rather enjoy the thrill of Premier League.” “The majority of Kenyans are not into La Liga, it's the English Premier League that draws the audience,” explained Levi Obonyo, a professor at Nairobi’s Daystar University. While China’s international-facing state broadcaster CGTN, is included in its cheapest package, unlike the BBC and CNN, it does not draw in the viewers. “Yes, we also have Chinese news, but I don’t watch it,” said Lily Ruto, a retired teacher in Kericho county. “What’s it called again? C something N? T something N?” she laughed as she shrugged her shoulders. Dr Dani Madrid-Morales, a lecturer at the University of Sheffield, echoes that StarTimes has not revolutionised the [African] news environment. Most villagers say they prefer local news channels. StarTimes understands that. In fact, with over 95% of its 5,000-strong African staff being local, according to a company spokesperson, it aims to present itself as prioritising African voices. One consultant to Chinese media companies in Africa said that StarTimes was trying to avoid a repeat of what has happened to the likes of TikTok or Huawei, whose overt Chinese-ness have attracted a high level of scrutiny in the West. Dr Lewis’ study of news stories from 2015 to 2019 reinforces this, noting that most news stories mentioning StarTimes did not reference China or China-Africa relations. The company appears careful not to overtly showcase its Chinese roots. StarTimes as a private company has seen substantial success over the years, and the ""10,000 Villages Project"" has pushed the company to a new level of fame. However, as Beijing hosts yet another FOCAC, the image-building effect of the project that China had hoped for has failed to materialise. ""There was an attempt for the government to rebalance the information flow that would put China under a positive light, but that has not materialised,"" said Dr Madrid-Morales. ""The amount of money that has gone into this hasn’t really benefitted the Chinese government all that much."" Many villagers the BBC spoke to were mostly concerned about content and costs. As rusty as several of the satellite dishes themselves, the project, once the talk of the town, has seemingly been relegated to a footnote in China's soft-power outreach. “Yes, we know it comes from China, but it makes no difference if no-one is using it,” said Ms Chepkemoi, who has cancelled her StarTimes subscription."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c785q0l03d1o,Chinese artist detained for 'insulting' Mao sculptures,Gao Zhen and his brother are known for their provocative depictions of the former Communist leader.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:30.736980,China News,BBC,China,"Dissident Chinese artist Gao Zhen has been detained on suspicion of ""insulting revolutionary heroes and martyrs,"" his brother and artistic partner Gao Qiang has said. The Gao Brothers are known for their provocative sculptures, which critique the founder of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong, and his regime. Gao Zhen left China two years ago to live permanently in the United States, but had been visiting family when he was taken by authorities in Hebei province, his brother said in a post on Facebook. Chinese authorities have not responded to the allegations by Gao Qiang, who said about 30 police officers stormed the brothers’ art studio in Sanhe City on 26 August. He added that they had confiscated several artworks in addition to detaining Mr Gao.  Since the 1980s, the brothers have been drawing international acclaim for works such as Mao’s Guilt, a bronze statue of the former Communist dictator kneeling remorsefully. Other works include The Execution of Christ, a statue depicting Jesus facing down a firing squad of Maos, and Miss Mao, a collection of statues of Mao with large breasts and protruding noses. Mao Zedong, often called Chairman Mao, helped found Communist China in 1949 and led it through a tumultuous period in the 1960s and 1970s known as the Cultural Revolution, in which more than a million people are believed to have died. During this period, the Gao Brothers' father was labelled a class enemy and dragged off to a place that was “not a prison, not a police station, but something else”, where he died, Gao Zhen told The New York Times in 2009. Spoofing or insulting China's revolutionary ""heroes and martyrs"" was made a crime in 2021, as part of a newly amended criminal code, under a campaign by China’s leader, Xi Jinping. It carries a penalty of up to three years' imprisonment. For most of his career Mr Gao had been able to escape serious punishment from the Chinese authorities - often by choosing to hold secret or invite-only exhibitions. However in 2022, Gao Zhen decided to emigrate to New York, where he held permanent residency. This was because his son, who is an American citizen, was reaching school age and also because of the “deteriorating environment in China”, according to his brother Gao Qiang. Several prominent Chinese artists and creatives have written an open letter calling on authorities to release Mr Gao. ""Today, the Sanhe police department seems to see Gao Zhen's artistic works as evidence of crime, repeating the persecution of the Cultural Revolution,"" the letter said. The Sanhe public security bureau has so far declined to comment."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvy45y9g47o,Inmate awarded $100m in default judgement against Sean 'Diddy' Combs,The inmate had accused the rapper of drugging and sexually assaulting him nearly 30 years ago.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:36.031678,China News,BBC,China,"A man that sued American rapper Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs over an alleged sexual assault has won $100m (£76.6m) by default after Combs failed to respond. Derrick Lee Cardello-Smith, 51, accused Combs of drugging him and sexually assaulting him at a party in Detroit, Michigan, in 1997. Lawyers for Combs have denied the allegations. Cardello-Smith is a convicted felon currently serving a prison sentence and is known for his long history of filing civil lawsuits, according to a local newspaper. Lawyers for Combs said Cardello-Smith was committing ""fraud on the court"" and told the BBC that the rapper will fight the ruling.  Courts issue default judgements against people when they do not respond to a lawsuit.   Combs and his lawyers told the BBC they had not been aware of the lawsuit because Combs was not properly served notice of it, and that they will be seeking to vacate Monday's judgment. The lawsuit is among a string of sexual assault allegations that have been recently made against Combs, one of the most successful moguls in the history of rap music. The award to Cardello-Smith was issued on Monday by Judge Anna Marie Anzalone of the Lenawee County Circuit Court, after Combs failed to appear for a 9 September hearing over the lawsuit. According to the local newspaper, the Detroit Metro Times, Cardello-Smith crossed paths with Combs in the 1990s while he was working in the restaurant and hospitality industry in Detroit. He told the court that Combs recently offered him $2.3m to drop the lawsuit, but he rejected that offer. He also said that he continues to know Combs, and had produced documents showing Combs's name in a prison visitation log. Combs’s lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, denied that the rapper ever knew Cardello-Smith in a statement to the BBC. Cardello-Smith is serving time for unrelated convictions of sexual misconduct and kidnapping, according to court documents. The Detroit Metro Times reported that he taught himself criminal and civil law during his time in prison, and had since developed “a long history of challenging the judicial system” by filing multiple lawsuits. Others have sued Combs for sexual and physical abuse, including his long-time partner Casandra ""Cassie"" Ventura. Combs paid Ventura an undisclosed sum of money, which settled the matter outside of court. The rapper had repeatedly denied the allegations, but later apologised after CCTV footage from 2016 was released in May appearing to show Combs throwing and kicking Ventura in a hotel hallway. In March, federal agents raided two houses owned by the star “as part of an ongoing investigation” into sex trafficking. At the time, Combs’ lawyer had called the raid an “unprecedented ambush” and said his client was innocent."

Retired military officers bribed active duty soldiers with as much as 700,000 Taiwan dollars ($21,900; £16,700) to join a spy network, the court found. One of the men, who was believed to be key to recruiting soldiers, got a 13-year sentence, the longest in the group. One of the recruits, a lieutenant-colonel, was handed nine years for planning to defect to China by flying a helicopter, while another shot an instructional video about surrendering to China in the event of war. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under its control, and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island. The two sides have been spying on each other since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Ten people in total were indicted for spying last year, and eight were sentenced on Thursday. The court acquitted one, while another - a retired officer - remains at large. ""They were seduced by money,"" the court said. ""Their actions violated their official duties of being loyal to the country, defending the country and the people... to seriously endanger national security and the well-being of the people of Taiwan."" Taiwan recently flagged Beijing's growing espionage efforts, with the sentencing on Thursday the latest in a string of cases. Last month, a sergeant who worked at a navy training centre was indicted for allegedly photographing and leaking confidential defence data to China. Taipei has also raised concern over the growing frequency of Chinese fighter jet flights around the island. On Friday, Taiwan's President William Lai said the island's people ""must unite as one"" and ""defend national sovereignty and safeguard democracy"". He was speaking at an event to commemorate the 66th anniversary of China's assault on Taiwan's Kinmen islands."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qk9p2elo,China's mission to win African hearts with satellite TV,"China pledged to install satellite dishes in some 10,000 villages across Africa, aiming to generate goodwill.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:36.261532,China News,BBC,China,"As African leaders gather in Beijing this week for the triennial China-Africa summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping may have one thing under his belt to boast about - satellite TV. Almost nine years ago, President Xi promised the heads of state attending the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Johannesburg that China would provide over 10,000 remote villages in 23 African countries with digital TV access. With over 9,600 villages having received satellite infrastructure, the project is now nearing completion. The ambitious pledge, revealed during a period of warm China-Africa relations and funded by China’s aid budget, was entrusted to StarTimes, a private Chinese company already operating in several African countries. It was an apparent show of goodwill and an opportunity for China to flex its soft power in a strategically important region.  As China's economy struggles and Beijing re-calibrates its Africa strategy, the BBC World Service visited four villages in Kenya to find out if this ""soft power"" initiative had paid off. In the village of Olasiti, about three hours’ drive west of the capital, Nairobi, Nicholas Nguku gathered his friends and family to watch Kenyan athletes running at the Paris Olympics on television. “I’m very happy to see the Olympics, which for many years we had not been able to see before we got StarTimes,” he said, speaking of the company’s installation of satellite dishes about four years ago. He is far from the only beneficiary of StarTimes’ presence across Africa. First introduced to the continent in 2008, StarTimes is now one of the largest private digital TV providers in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 16 million subscribers. Analysts say that low pricing initially helped to secure its foothold.  In Kenya, monthly digital TV packages range from 329 shillings ($2.50; £2) to 1,799 shillings ($14; £10.50).  In comparison, a monthly package for DStv, owned by MultiChoice, another major player in the African digital TV market, costs between 700 and 10,500 shillings. While StarTimes partly relies on subscriptions for its core revenue, the “10,000 Villages Project” is funded by China's state–run South-South Assistance Fund. The satellite dishes all feature the StarTimes logo, Kenya’s Ministry of Information emblem, and a red “China Aid” logo. During the installation of these dishes, StarTimes representatives said that this was a ""gift"" from China, several villagers recalled. According to Dr Angela Lewis, an academic who has written extensively on StarTimes in Africa, the project had the potential to leave a positive image of China for African audiences. Villagers under the project ostensibly received everything for free, including the infrastructure, such as a satellite dish, battery, and installation, as well as a subscription to StarTimes’ content. This was a “game-changer,” according to Dr Lewis, as remote villages in Africa previously mostly had access to choppy and unreliable analogue TV. For many, this was their first access to satellite dishes, altering the way villagers interacted with the outside world, she said. For community centres like hospitals and schools in Ainomoi village in western Kenya, subscriptions remain free. At the local clinic a digital TV in the waiting room helps patients pass the time. And at a primary school, pupils enjoy watching cartoons after school. “After we finish schoolwork, we’ll all watch cartoons together and it’s a very enjoyable and bonding experience,” said Ruth Chelang’at, an eighth-grade student at the school.

The Times quotes some of a statement he made on X - before President Joe Biden and Sir Keir Starmer's meeting in Washington - expressing what it describes as his ""frustration"" at the time it's taking them to make a decision. The Mail says he is accusing the west of ""dithering"", while Russian forces burn down cities and villages in Ukraine. The Guardian reports that the Ormiston Academies Trust will become the first in England to phase out access to smartphones for pupils at all of its 44 state schools. The paper quotes the Trust's chief executive Tom Rees as saying that schools have a ""responsibility"" to make it harder for children to access inappropriate content through the school day and to restrict ""the draw of social media.” The Telegraph's lead features detail from the autobiography of Sir Graham Brady, the former chairman of the Conservative 1922 committee, which runs the selection process for new Tory leaders.  He oversaw the departure of five prime ministers during his 14 year tenure. The paper says his book, Kingmaker,  details his private conversations with them as they were being forced from power. The Telegraph says the book also reveals that Rishi Sunak was not facing a confidence vote when he called the election; that Lord Cameron and George Osborne had contempt for people who did not share their backgrounds; and that Boris Johnson was fed up with backbenchers criticising his adviser Dominic Cummings during the pandemic. A Tear for Sven is the headline in the Mirror. It carries photos of the funeral of the former England football manager Sven Goran Eriksson, where an emotional David Beckham was among the mourners yesterday in Sweden. The pictures show him wiping his eyes, laying a hand on the coffin of his former boss and comforting Mr Eriksson's former partner Nancy Dell'Olio. The paper says the celebrations of his life included a New Orleans-style procession with a brass band. The i paper reports that more of us are using private healthcare than ever before because of the length of NHS waiting lists, with the number of admissions to private hospitals hitting a record high so far this year. But as a result, it claims, insurers are ""cashing in"" by raising prices.  It says that chemotherapy is among the most ""in-demand"" services that people are paying for, and that cataract surgery, colonoscopies and hip replacements are in the top five. Drinking water has little or no effect on your ability to cope with a hangover, according to the Mail. It says scientists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands have looked at three different studies, involving hundreds of party-going students, and recorded the hangover symptoms of those who drank water before going to bed, and those who didn't. The results, published in the journal Alcohol, showed that while those who drank water felt less dehydrated, they still had the same degree of nausea, exhaustion and pain as the students who skipped it.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c756ll1r5g2o,"Still reeling from crisis, Sri Lanka holds pivotal election",It’s Sri Lanka's first election since it saw mass protests that triggered its worst economic crisis.,18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:36.594205,China News,BBC,China,"“I thought I’d spend my whole life here, fighting a corrupt government - but the younger generation did something.” Samadhi Paramitha Brahmananayake is looking at the field where she spent months camped out with thousands of other demonstrators in Sri Lanka’s capital in 2022. She can’t quite believe that luscious green grass has replaced the hundreds of protester tents that filled the field opposite the presidential secretariat. “I feel we’re now more energetic, more powerful,” says Ms Brahmananayake, a 33-year-old banker based in Colombo. Two years ago, huge crowds forced the country’s deeply unpopular leader from office – now voters are just days away from choosing who they want for president.  It’s the first election since the mass protests - called the “aragalaya”, Sinhalese for struggle – which were sparked by Sri Lanka’s worst economic crisis. Inflation was at 70%. Basics like food, cooking gas and medicine were scarce. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the president at the time, and his government were blamed for the mess. He fled the country just before crowds stormed his residence. Euphoric protesters leapt into the presidential pool, taking victory laps. Mithun Jayawardana, 28, was one of those swimmers. “It was awesome,” he said thinking back. Jobless, with no gas or electricity at home, he says he joined the aragalaya for a lark. Today, he recognises how crucial the elections on Saturday are: “We need a president who is elected by the people. The people didn’t elect the current president.” Ranil Wickremesinghe, the man who currently holds the job, was appointed to the position after Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned. Mr Wickremesinghe, who’s been tasked with steering Sri Lanka through a period of painful economic reform, is running for re-election as an independent.  He's stood for president twice before but never succeeded, and his political future appears uncertain.  Many associate Wickremesinghe with the Rajapaksas, a political dynasty who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for decades. Many blame them for the years of financial mismanagement that led to Sri Lanka’s economic woes. Even the country’s top court ruled that Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother Mahinda, another former president, were among 13 former leaders responsible for the financial crisis. Despite the political baggage that comes with the name, a Rajapaksa has entered the political fray in these elections - there are still places the family enjoys a lot of support. One such district is just over an hour outside Colombo. Music, fireworks and the cheers of supporters greeted Namal Rajapaksa as he approached the podium to address the hundreds that had come to hear him speak on Monday in the town of Minuwangoda. Even his father, Mahinda joined him on stage. Namal Rajapaksa denied his family’s role in Sri Lanka’s economic collapse. “We know our hands are clean, we know we have not done anything wrong to the people or this country,” he told the BBC. “We are willing to face the people, let the public decide what they want and who to vote for.” In all, a record 38 candidates are contesting the 21 September election, none of them women. In 2019, Sajith Premadasa, leader of the country's main opposition party, won 42% of the popular vote, losing to Gotabaya Rajapaksa. This time around he is thought to be in with a chance too. For people looking for change, many are looking to Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The candidate of the leftist National People’s Party alliance has emerged as an unlikely frontrunner. Thousands of people flocked to a field in the small town of Mirigama, two hours north-west from Colombo, to hear Mr Dissanayake speak last Saturday, many wearing bright pink hats or T-shirts with his face. “Yes 100% sure, okay,” he tells the BBC, when asked if he can win. Campaigning as the voice of the working class, he is hoping to disrupt Sri Lanka’s political establishment. Unlike past elections in Sri Lanka, the economy is front and centre in this one. Holding her four-year-old son Nehan, Rangika Munasinghe laments the higher taxes she now pays. “It’s very difficult. Salaries are being reduced, taxes on products and food are high. Kids meals, milk powder, all more expensive. Taxes are so high, we can’t manage it,” the 35-year-old told the BBC at a busy market in Colombo. Sri Lanka was able to stave off bankruptcy in 2022 thanks to loans from the International Monetary Fund, and countries like China and India. But now everyone is feeling the pressure from the country’s enormous $92bn (£69bn) debt burden, which includes both foreign and national debt. “I’m doing two jobs,” says Mohamed Rajabdeen, who’s in his 70s. He is selling spoons from a stall off a busy street. Once this is done, he will travel to his second job, working in security. “We should get good salaries, university students should get jobs, and people should be able to live in peace and harmony. We expect our government to fulfil all of that.” Being that vocal about their expectations from elected officials is something new for many people in Sri Lanka. That change has been brought about by the protest movement, says Buwanaka Perera, a youth political activist. “People are more gutsy in confronting the state or in confronting what’s wrong,” the 28-year-old said. “It’s not just the state, it’s trickled down to everyday things - it can be in your household, it can be in your streets. To make a stand to voice out and to look out for one another.” Ms Brahmananayake agrees, calling it a lasting impact of her efforts and the thousands of others who participated in the uprising two years ago. “People are talking about politics now. They are asking questions. I think people have the power in their hands. They can vote.” Like her, climate and political activist Melani Gunathilaka, 37, knows the path forward will not be easy for Sri Lanka, but they have hope. “There hasn’t been a change in the political and economic culture - but there has been a massive change in terms of society,” she says. “For the first time people took charge, people exercised their democratic rights to do what’s right for the country.” Ranil Wickremesinghe, a six-time former prime minister, was appointed president after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ousted in 2022.  The 75-year-old, who faced the monumental task of trying to lead Sri Lanka out of economic collapse, has been accused of protecting the Rajapaksa family, allowing them to regroup, while shielding them from prosecution - allegations he has denied. Anura Kumara Dissanayake is the candidate of the leftist National People’s Party alliance. His promises of tough anti-corruption measures and good governance have boosted his candidacy, positioning the 55-year-old as a serious contender. Sajith Premadasa, the runner-up last time, is the leader of the country's main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). Earlier this week, he told news agency AP that he would ensure that the rich would pay more taxes and the poor would see their conditions improve if he won.  Namal Rajapaksa comes from a powerful political clan that produced two presidents. The 38-year-old's campaign has centred around the legacy of his father, who is still seen as a hero by some Sri Lankans for presiding over the bloody end to the civil war against Tamil Tiger rebels. But he needs to win over voters who blame the Rajapaksas for the economic crisis."

Henshaw, 37, won her second gold medal in as many days during the KL2 womenâs 200m kayak singles, with Emma Wiggs taking the silver medal. Meanwhile, Sugar, 33, won the same event in the KL3 category. Both she and Henshaw set new Paralympic records as they successfully defended their respective titles from Tokyo. Great Britainâs final medal of the day came in the menâs VL3 Vaâa 200m singles final, with Jack Eyers winning silver. ParalympicsGB ended their 2024 Paralympics with a total of 124 medals, including those 49 golds. Only China, with 94 golds and 219 total medals, won more during the 11-day event. Alice Tai won five of Great Britain's medals in the 2024 Paralympics in Para-swimming Great Britainâs ParalympicsGB squad can feel incredibly proud of their achievements in Paris. They will return to home soil as one of only three nations to win more than 100 medals and, with 49 golds, have their second best haul of golds since the 1996 Games. Only 2016âs total of 64 golds in Rio de Janeiro eclipses this summerâs success in Paris. ParalympicsGB won at least one gold medal on all 11 days, including 12 on âSuper Sundayâ a week ago. Of those 124 medals for Great Britain, 54 came from a combination of Para-swimming and Para-cycling events, with 18 more added in Para-athletics. The second-place finish - behind China and ahead of the USA for a seventh straight Paralympics - represents another Games to remember. And as well as the haul of medals, the 11-day event has created countless memories for ParalympicsGB. Charlotte Henshaw and Emma Wiggs (left) won medals on each of the final two days in Paris It has been a successful weekend at Vaires-sur-Marne Stadium for Great Britain, who won seven medals across Para-canoeing events on Saturday and Sunday. Four of those came on Sunday and, for Henshaw, it was a second in the space of 24 hours, having won gold in Saturdayâs womenâs 200m Vaâa singles final. In the same event, Wiggs picked up her second medal of the weekend. The 44-year-old finished two and a half seconds behind Henshaw in a ParalympicsGB gold-silver double. After winning his heat with a new Paralympic record, debutant Eyers, who in 2017 became the first amputee to be named Mr England, won the final of GBâs 124 medals of the Paralympics on Sunday. Jeanette Chippington featured in the first final of the day, finishing seventh in the womenâs KL1 kayak singles 200m final. Edward Clifton was also in final action. He finished seventh in the menâs VL2 Vaâa 200m singles final.

Mary Jacobs, 77, from Newmarket, Suffolk, bought her first bedpan in 1984 in a jumble sale. She ended up with 163. She appealed for someone to buy the collection and was pleased when a pottery collector from Peterborough showed interest. Julie Stevenson, 53, bought two bedpans made by Shelley - a renowned Staffordshire pottery that closed in 1966 - and now intends to show them to fellow collectors at Peterborough Cathedral. Mrs Stevenson collects Shelley and, despite only starting a year ago, already has nearly 800 items.  Mrs Jacobs said: ""In the process of sorting through, I found two Shelley ones and I got in touch with [Mrs Stevenson] and she came and bought them from me. ""It was nice and at least I've made somebody happy."" Mrs Stevenson, a Peterborough councillor, will be showing her collection - including the bedpans - to the pottery group's members in March 2025. ""Not only has Mary been able to pass her beloved bedpans to a collector who will value them, they're actually going to be appearing at the cathedral, which is an extraordinary extension of their life considering what they were made for,"" Mrs Stevenson said. ""It's an amazing story - who knows what will happen to them next?"" she added. Mrs Stevenson believed the Shelley bedpans were made for the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, the year it was founded. ""They don't often pop on the market, but when they do they're generally not in very good condition because they're porcelain - they're often chipped or cracked. ""These are perfect, so I feel as though I have found a real treasure here."" Mrs Jacobs said she had since had some interest in the rest of her bedpan collection and she was keeping her ""fingers and toes crossed"" it would result in a sale.

BBC Sport takes a look at the league's new bosses and what you can expect from them. Women's Football Weekly: WSL preview Ten new signings to watch in the Women's Super League How to watch and follow 2024-25 WSL season on the BBC Robert de Pauw spent two seasons at Bayer Leverkusen Robert de Pauw wants to unify the playing style's of Aston Villa's men's and women's teams - it was something he did at his last club, creating synergy with Xabi Alonso's menâs side while in charge of Bayer Leverkusen's women. He replaces Carla Ward, who stepped down at the end of the season, as Villa manager. The 43-year-old De Pauw guided Leverkusen to a sixth-placed finish last term and also has experience of managing in his native Netherlands. he won a league and cup double while in charge of FC Twente in 2022. De Pauw has signed a three-year deal with the club and says his immediate aim is to get them to finish in the top six - one place above last year's seventh-place finish. ""You have to be realistic,"" he said of his ambitions. ""[Manchester] United are there. Spurs are there. Brighton is bringing good players, and Leicester is bringing good players in. ""That makes the competition so interesting. They are really investing, all. So there's a lot of competition, but we want to be in the top six, and we'll aim for that."" Dario Vidosic represented Australia as a player After another season in which they changed their manager, Brighton will hope Dario Vidosic can provide the consistency they desire. Brighton implemented significant investments off the pitch and have now recruited Vidosic from Australian side Melbourne City in a bid to perform better in the WSL. Croatia-born Vidosic, 37, joins after a successful season with Melbourne City in which they won the A-League premiership, although they lost to Sydney FC in the grand final. His father, Rado, was a player and manager in Australia and was in charge of Melbourne City's women's and men's teams before Dario. Vidosic followed in his father's footsteps and became a professional player, representing Australia and having spells in leagues in Australia, Germany, Switzerland and China. He takes over from interim boss Mikey Harris, who led Brighton to finish ninth after Melissa Phillips was sacked in February. Sonia Bompastor spent three years as Lyon manager Emma Hayes' silverware-laden era as Chelsea manager is a tough act to follow, but Sonia Bompastor will hope she's well placed to do so. The 44-year-old Frenchwoman joins Chelsea with an excellent managerial record, having led Lyon to three league titles and one Champions League. Chelsea have never won Europe's top competition but Bompastor has. She said she wants to take Chelsea ""to the next level"". Her managerial career came after an illustrious spell as a player, becoming one of France's all-time greats and twice lifting the Champions League before retiring. ""Being able to win the Champions League will be a big challenge because there are a lot of really competitive clubs in Europe, but I think we have all the talent in the squad to go to the final and have a chance to win it,"" she said. Bompastor spent time as head of Lyonâs academy, so she may also be the right person to bring Chelseaâs wealth of young talent to the top level. âSome other coaches will probably be able to do the same but from my experience I would say it's always good for the young players to get someone [specialised],â she added. Bompastor has 'clear vision' to win Champions League 'I have a different vision and philosophy to Hayes' - Bompastor  'The planets aligned' - who is new Chelsea boss Bompastor? Crystal Palace finished the 2023-24 Championship season a point ahead of Charlton to seal promotion Laura Kaminski only embarked on her first season of senior management in the summer of 2023, but now she's reached the top flight. Kaminski took Crystal Palace to the Championship title last term, guiding them through a closely-fought battle at the top to earn their spot in the WSL. It was a demanding title race, but Kaminski kept her cool. She said she never looked at the table and trusted that performances would pay off. ""I am a thorough believer that the performances will speak for themselves, and if you perform well each week, then the proof's in the pudding."" Kaminski, who was previously an assistant at Tottenham when they were promoted to the WSL, also spent five years with England's under-19 team. Life in the top division of English football will be a big change for Palace, but Kaminski said she hopes her team will relish it and show why they are here. ""They put themselves in a position where they all deserve to be there, so now go and show the world what you're capable of doing at the top level, because there's eyes all over it and you deserve to be seen,"" she added. 'No-one expected this' - Crystal Palace reach WSL Amandine Miquel has taken on her first managerial job outside of France Amandine Miquel's life has taken her from France to Mexico, to Chelsea's academy, to the Indian ocean island of Reunion - and now, to Leicester. She joins from Reims in France's top flight and has vowed to deliver a Leicester team who provide ""fun"". The 40-year-old played for Chelsea as a youth player and ended up at Reims after pivoting to management, spending seven years there and guiding them back to the top tier. Reims reached three Coupe de France quarter-finals in the past five years despite having one of the division's smaller budgets. What might Miquel's Leicester team look like? ""It's a game so we expect it to be nice to watch,"" she said. ""Offensive - we will defend a little bit because we don't want to take too many goals, but as offensive as you can be. ""For us it's about scoring one more goal than the opponent and thatâs it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230711-why-we-keep-discovering-new-species-of-sharks,The sharks emerging from the deep,More and more new species of sharks are being discovered as humanity peers deeper into the oceans.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:44.046065,China News,BBC,China,"More and more new species of sharks are being discovered as humanity peers deeper into the oceans. It was a mystery that began with an egg. In 1989, scientists in Australia found a curious kind of ""mermaid's purse"" – a leathery egg case, which some species of sharks lay instead of giving birth to live young. The empty egg cases had one almost unique feature – a row of prominent ridges along the top. The eggs had been found off the Rowley Shoals, a group of atolls on the edge of a continental shelf in the East Timor Sea, a few hundred kilometres off the north-eastern coast of Australia. They offered up more questions than they did answers. What had laid them? Where did it live? And why did its egg cases have such a distinctive appearance? It would be more than 30 years before scientists would finally find out the most basic of these questions – and in doing so discover a completely new shark species. More than two decades into the 21st Century, humanity is still finding new species of the ocean's most impressive hunters. As recently as the mid-1980s, science had settled on around 360 species of shark, ranging from deep sea featherweights like the 20cm (8in)-long dwarf lanternshark to the enormous plankton-feeding whale shark, the largest species of fish in the oceans. But in little more than 40 years this number has jumped by nearly 40%. There are more than 500 known species, and the numbers of new species show no signs of dropping off. In September 2024, a new species of ghost shark – a primitive cartilaginous fish closely related to sharks – was identified thanks to the discovery of a specimen fished from the deep ocean off the east coast of New Zealand. You might also like: This new wave of discovery rivals that of the golden ages of exploration. It is as much a by-product of painstaking work in the archives of museum collections as it is peering into the deep waters of the world's oceans. Take the shark that laid the mysterious ridged egg cases, for instance. Will White, the senior curator of Australian National Fish Collection at CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) in Hobart, Australia, was part of the team that connected the dots. After being discovered during a survey at Rowley Shoals, the egg cases had been disseminated to museum archives without anyone looking much further into the cases' strange ridges. In 2011, a researcher called Brett Human was volunteering at the Western Australian Museum in Perth, when he came across the ridged shark egg case. While it was similar to eggs laid by another species of shark, that animal had never been found in Australian waters. Human linked the egg case to other eggs which had been found off Australia, and narrowed down the species to possibly being a member of the catshark family. But he could not determine the exact species. ""He first described the case and did a very good effort of trying to narrow down… he did a lot better than what a lot of people would have, actually,"" says White. ""Nothing happened on that until we started looking at a case with a colleague Helen O'Neill. Even then I was like, 'I think I'm barking up the wrong tree, looking at cases. No one's really done it, there's probably a reason why'."" It turned out that CSIRO had also been sent examples of the egg cases in the 1980s – and no-one had done further research. ""It wasn't until I started looking at the collection data that I realised they're actually from the same surveys. It was collected from the same location on the same day."" White and his colleagues knew the eggs recovered in the 1980s had come from a certain depth – between 410m (1,345ft) and 504m (1,640ft) – and started looking for sharks which had been caught at the same depth. The CSIRO collection had what was thought to have been a South China catshark, which turned out to have been pregnant when it was caught. The scientists dissected it and found a developing embryo inside an egg case with the same tell-tale ridges as the ones discovered years before in Rowley Shoals. The detective work proved it was a completely new species, and the mystery that Australian shark scientists had been scratching their heads over for the last 30 years was finally solved. ""It took us, like, two days to work it out,"" says White. ""The thing is, you've got to be looking specifically for it. The adults of that group, in particular, are very subtly different,"" he says. The species now has a scientific name (a common name is due to follow), and was unveiled in the Journal of Fish Biology in April 2023. This new variety of demon catshark, otherwise known as Apristurus ovicorrugatus, is thought to dwell around 700m (2,297ft) beneath the surface, laying its egg cases over coral in water too deep for sunlight to penetrate. White says this family of sharks is particularly hard to research because they are so elusive and because the differences between species can be so subtle. ""With this group, in particular, we're actually down into looking at aspects of the digestive tract and liver shape and stuff like that. You're definitely getting desperate when you start getting into characters like that,"" White says.   He says the current experts on this group of sharks all ""liaise with each other and talk with each other"" because identifying new species can be such a challenge. ""The other thing, unfortunately, is you do get some specimens in collections that all you got is the fixed [preserved] specimen, you don't actually have a fresh photo; that demon catshark we described was lucky because we had a fresh photo as well."" The demon catshark was not the only discovery White had a part in identifying recently. Another species, a type of horn shark, was caught in surprisingly deep waters off Western Australia in a survey last year. Horn sharks tend to like living in shallow waters, often sitting on the seafloor in kelp forests, but this new species was found at 150m (500ft). But that's nothing compared to what may lie ahead, White says. The demon catshark is not the only new catshark species to have turned up. ""We've actually found another new species of that same genus, also with ridged egg cases, but different ridged egg cases off Queensland. So we're working on that now,"" he says.   ""I've got a feeling there's another one from Queensland, it's new, from the same genus. And I think there's another one in Western Australia, it's either new or it's a new record of a species poorly known from elsewhere in the world,"" says White. The waters around Australia aren't the only ones offering up new shark species. On the other side of the Indian Ocean, German shark scientist Simon Weigmann of the Elasmobranch Research Laboratory in Hamburg helped to discover two new species of saw shark – bizarre-looking creatures armed with long snouts, or rostrums, studded with sharp teeth – off the south-eastern coast of Africa. The saw sharks were found with the help of a colleague Ruth Leeney from the Anderson Cabot Centre for Ocean Life, who had been researching new species of the related sawfish off the coast of Madagascar (sawfish are a type of ray, distantly related to sharks.) One of her colleagues called her because fisherman had preserved for her two rostra, of what they thought were sawfish,"" Weigmann says. ""And when she saw the photos, she immediately recognised, these were not sawfish, but saw-sharks, which is also very interesting finding because saw-sharks are not caught all day long."" The saw-sharks had some interesting details: instead of the five gill slits most sharks possess, they had six – an evolutionary echo from much older shark species that lived millions of years ago. They also had small fleshy tendrils known as barbels far closer to the tip of the rostrum than is found in other species of saw-sharks. To confirm his hunch this might be a new species, Weigmann travelled to London's Natural History Museum, which has a saw shark caught more than 100 years ago which is in remarkably good condition. ""It was quite clear that the barbels are close to the mouth, as had been described for that species,"" says Weigmann, referring to the Natural History Museum's example. Whatever Lenney's colleague had photographed in a fish market in Madagascar, it looked like it was a new species. Further research from specimens in other collections in South Africa also seemed to support this. Then another shark researcher – Andrew Temple from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia – got in touch. ""We had found a saw shark off Zanzibar in Tanzania, where they made a survey for the local fisherman's landings, even different from the ones that we had just found,"" says Weigmann. ""So we said, 'Okay, maybe it's just an unusual specimen. Or maybe it's even a second new species,'"" he says. ""It's very special because saw sharks are not common and you only have few species."" Weigmann adds another relevant point: ""They look very cool."" It was not scientists like Weigmann who had first noticed there was something different, however – it was the Madagascan fishermen who had caught them. ""It was really important that we had the local fishermen providing this material. If they had not collected the rostra, or later landed the specimens that were picked up in Zanzibar, we would not have noticed. I would not have tried to examine all the other museum materials, I would just have not noticed that there is something different."" Many of the saw sharks that have been discovered so far live relatively far down in the ocean – as deep as 300m (1,000ft) – but the species off Zanzibar was caught less than 30m (100ft) from the surface. ""We think that they might have come to shallower depth for the night, which is typical for many groups of marine organisms,"" says Weigmann. ""I think it's the biggest movement of animals in the word, this vertical movement that you have in the oceans at night. There are also many sharks known to exhibit vertical movements. So I think during day they might occur deeper, but we do not know because we only have them from this depth. And that makes them even more vulnerable to [commercial] fishery,"" says Weigmann. There is much more to this discovery than an addition to the known species in a reference book, or a new display in a museum. Weigmann uses the example of the blue skate, a type of ray from the North Atlantic that was relatively common until commercial fishing decimated its numbers. ""The populations collapsed,"" he says. ""And then, about 10 years ago, some scientists even noticed that there were two species lumped under this name. So all the fisheries statistics that you had population status, you could not work with anymore because you could not know was it the one species or the other species. And that makes taxonomic research and describing new species so important,"" he says. More sharks may yet be waiting to be discovered in the deep, and not all of them may be as small as the metre-long catsharks awaiting classification. In 2021, scientists discovered three new species of deep-sea sharks that glow in the dark, including one that can grow up to 1.8m (5.9ft). It is also less than 50 years since researchers discovered a strange shark tangled in the sea anchor of a US Navy ship off Hawaii. The shark in question was nearly 15ft-long (4.5m) and a species that had never been seen before – a filter-feeder that swam with its jaws agape. A shark scientist called Leighton Taylor dubbed it the ""megamouth"" shark; the species is now considered to be one of the largest-growing species to be found today. What else may be waiting for shark scientists, far below the ocean surface? * This article was originally published on 12 July 2023.

Linda Sun, 41, ""acted at the order, direction, or request"" of Beijing in return for millions of dollars in kickbacks, special home deliveries of salted duck and other perks, according to a federal indictment. Prosecutors say she and Christopher Hu, her husband and co-defendant, used their ill-gotten gains to purchase real estate and luxury vehicles. The couple pleaded not guilty to the charges against them in a Brooklyn federal court on Tuesday. Ms Sun was sacked nearly two years ago after the office of Ms Hochul, who became governor in 2021, discovered ""evidence of misconduct"" and reported it to the authorities. She and Mr Hu now face charges including violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, bringing in four illegal immigrants and money laundering conspiracy. Prosecutors say that Ms Sun acted as ""an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government"", while her husband ""facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars in kickbacks for personal gain"". She is alleged to have blocked representatives of Taiwan's government from speaking to New York officials, provided unauthorised invitation letters to the US for Chinese officials, unilaterally changed state officials' messaging about China and even added a Chinese official on to a private state government conference call about the Covid-19 public health response. Christie Curtis, the acting assistant director of the FBI, said Ms Sun ""wielded her position... to covertly promote"" the Chinese agenda, ""directly threatening our country's national security"".  In return, prosecutors say Ms Sun was given rewards totalling millions of dollars. They were also given show tickets, travel perks and food including, according to the indictment, at least 16 meals of Nanjing-style salted duck prepared by a Chinese government representative's personal chef and delivered to the home of Ms Sun's parents. The couple laundered large amounts of money to buy luxuries including a Ferrari and property in Hawaii and New York, the indictment adds. ""The illicit scheme enriched the defendant's family to the tune of millions of dollars,"" said US Attorney Breon Peace. According to the indictment, Mr Hu operated several businesses in New York, including a seafood exporter, a wine store and a financial consultancy, and frequently relied on the services of an authorised freight agent of the Chinese government. Ms Sun, a naturalised US citizen born in China, had held multiple high-ranking posts in the state's executive branch and state agencies since 2012, and served as Ms Hochul's deputy chief of staff for almost a year before she was sacked in 2023.  The governor's office said Ms Sun had been originally employed by the previous  administration of Andrew Cuomo, who quit in August 2021 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. ""This individual was hired by the executive chamber more than a decade ago,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""We terminated her employment in March 2023 after discovering evidence of misconduct, immediately reported her actions to law enforcement and have assisted law enforcement throughout this process."" In an appearance on WNYC local radio, Ms Hochul said she was ""outraged"" by the ""betrayal of trust"" but added that Ms Sun ""primarily worked for Andrew Cuomo"". ""She was with me just a short time, about 15 months,” she said. But a spokesperson for Mr Cuomo pushed back, telling WNYC that Ms Sun ""had little to no interaction"" with the then-governor during his tenure, only to be promoted by the Hochul administration. Ms Sun and Mr Hu were arrested on Tuesday morning at their $3.5m (£2.7m) Long Island gated-community home, roughly six weeks after the residence was raided as part of an FBI investigation. Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy, cautioned in a statement to the New York Times that ""in recent years, the US government and media have frequently hyped up the so-called ‘Chinese agents’ narratives, many of which have later been proven untrue"". ""China requires its citizens overseas to comply with the laws and regulations of the host country, and we firmly oppose the groundlessly slandering and smearing targeting China,” he wrote. In court on Tuesday afternoon, Ms Sun was ordered to have no contact with the Chinese consulate and mission in New York. Judge Brian Cogan also ruled that the pair will have their travel limited to New York City, the Long Island borough, and the states of Maine and New Hampshire. He released Ms Sun on a $1.5m bond and Mr Hu on a $500,000 bond. Both will report back to the judge later this month."

Owner Eileen Lam, from Ipswich, Suffolk, said she briefly took off the hat and placed it on the floor while visiting the sale in Marks Tey, Essex. But when she took a phone call, someone picked up the hat, took it to a nearby stall holder - and promptly bought it for £2.   ""It's old now and faded, but I love it,"" Ms Lam told the BBC, adding that the colourful hat held sentimental value. Ms Lam, who regularly attended the boot sale, said she had returned every week since the hat was sold on 21 August, and had put up posters appealing for help. The hat, which was made by Italian designer Missoni, was given to her by her children. ""I know it's ridiculous - I felt guilty for being so attached to a hat,"" Ms Lam said, adding that she accepted it had been sold by mistake. ""The people at the boot sale have been so good, they've stuck [posters] up on their vans."" Ms Lam says the hat features in many of her reels on Instagram, where her Dolly Treasures account has three quarters of a million followers. She says she has offered a reward of £100 but has still not had any joy tracking down the buyer. “It's an old hat now so they wouldn't get £100 for it, so I'm willing to pay as it just means something to me,"" Ms Lam added.

Caballero’s picture was chosen from more than 15,000 images submitted by professional and amateur photographers. The competition, presented by Oceanographic Magazine and Blancpain, aims to  reveal the wonder of the ocean and the many plights it faces. Jade Hoksbergen was named runner-up with a mesmerising image of a northern gannet, one of the largest seabirds in British waters, diving to catch its prey in waters near Isle of Noss, Shetland Islands, Scotland. Third place was awarded to Thien Nguyen Ngoc for an aerial shot of a fishing boat in Hon Yen, Vietnam.   Its long trail of smoke perfectly aligns with the shape of the green nets under the surface. The recipient of this year’s Female Fifty Fathoms Award was Malaysian photographer Ipah Uid Lynn.  Her winning portfolio included shots of a tiny goby, a skeletal shrimp, fishermen, divers, and a school of batfish swimming in unison in Koh Tao, Thailand. The Female Fifty Fathoms Award was created in 2021 by Oceanographic Magazine and Blancpain to celebrate pioneering and boundary pushing women in ocean photography. ""It's a recognition that goes beyond personal achievement,"" said Lynn. ""It highlights the importance of storytelling through photography and the voices of women in this field. I'm truly humbled and inspired to continue pushing the boundaries of what I can capture and share with the world.” Jacob Guy was named Young Ocean Photographer of the Year for a compelling image of an elusive algae octopus showing off its fluorescence under ultraviolet light in waters off North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Manuel Castellanos Raboso was the Wildlife category winner with a picture of a mahimahi (common dolphinfish) displaying its catch amid a feeding frenzy in Baja California Sur, Mexico. “The bait ball was semi-static, allowing us to spend some time in the water with these fish, moving like torpedoes in front of us,"" said Castellanos Raboso. ""This scene captures the essence of the hunt and the energy of Baja's marine life."" The Ocean Fine Art Photographer of the Year award went to Henley Spiers for an image of juvenile Munk’s devil rays attracted by a green light, taken in Baja California Sur, Mexico. ""At night we hung a green light from the back of our boat, [and] as plankton gathered around it the rays gratefully swooped in for a microscopic buffet,"" explained Spiers.  Tobias Friedrich triumphed in the Adventure category with an impressive image of a scuba diver dwarfed by a shipwreck in the Bahamas. The Ocean Conservation Photographer of the Year (Hope) award went to Shane Gross for his image of a green sea turtle being released by a researcher in the Seychelles.  Researchers took measurements and tagged the turtle before releasing it back into the water. The Ocean Conservation Photographer of the Year (Impact) award went to Frederik Brogaard. A fin whale lies waiting for its turn to be butchered at a whaling plant in Iceland before being sent to Japan. ""The picture might induce a feeling of hopelessness, but public uproar throughout the last two years has resulted in the cancellation of last year's whaling season in Iceland,"" said Brogaard. The Human Connection Award: People and Planet Ocean, went to  Zhang Xiang for a delightful shot of a beach bathed in the golden haze of sunset while a fisherman wades through the water. Shane Gross scooped the Ocean Portfolio Award with work that included images of a crested sculpin, endangered chupare stingray and baby plainfin midshipman fish, still attached to their yolk sacs. An exhibition of all the winners will open at the Australian National Maritime Museum, Sydney, on 28 November 2024."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjy8yxxwlo,Fury as suspected China spy flees the Philippines,"Former mayor Alice Guo left the country undetected last month, invoking the fury of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.",21 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:44.496001,China News,BBC,China,"An ex-mayor accused of spying for China and having ties with criminal syndicates has fled the Philippines, stirring fury. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said Wednesday that ""heads will roll"" after officials admitted Alice Guo had left the country undetected one month ago and travelled to Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Mr Marcos said her departure ""laid bare the corruption that undermines our justice system and erodes the people's trust"". Ms Guo has been out of public view since July when a Senate panel investigating her alleged links to scam centres and online casinos ordered her arrest for refusing to testify in its enquiry. She is accused of allowing human trafficking syndicates and scam centres to operate in her town by masquerading as online casinos. Senators have also accused her of being an operative or spy for China, citing her ""opaque"" answers to questions about her Chinese parentage. Police have filed criminal complaints against her, while the Philippines' anti-graft body recently dismissed her from office citing ""grave misconduct"". She has denied all the allegations. Ms Guo left the Philippines ""illegally"" and skipped border checks, according to the country's Bureau of Immigration, which said it found out about her travels abroad through intelligence sources. Mr Marcos said he would ""expose the culprits who have betrayed the people's trust and aided in her flight.""  He also ordered the cancellation of Ms Guo's Philippine passport. Senator Risa Hontiveros, who has been leading the investigation on the Philippines' scam centres since May, said it is unacceptable for Ms Guo to slip past immigration checks. ""The nerve of this fake Filipino, using a Philippine passport to escape,"" she said. Ms Guo came under scrutiny in March after authorities uncovered a huge scam centre and human trafficking operation in her sleepy town of Bamban, north of Manila. The illegal operations were hidden in Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators, or ""Pogo"" firms, that stood on land owned by Ms Guo's family. Prior to that, Ms Guo was relatively unknown and had not held public office before being elected mayor in 2022. She claims she grew up sheltered in the family's pig farm in Bamban. While Pogos are not illegal, they are increasingly being exposed as cover for other crimes. The firms, which mostly cater to mainland Chinese clients, flourished under former president Rodrigo Duterte, who sought close economic and political ties with Beijing. But Mr Duterte's successor, Mr Marcos, reversed the country's foreign policy direction and has cracked down on Pogo-linked crimes since assuming office in 2022. Nationalist sentiment is also growing in the Philippines, as its dispute with China over reefs and outcrops in the South China Sea continue to fester. Earlier this week, Manila and Beijing traded fresh allegations of ship ramming in the resource-rich waters."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/clynm8r2pmdo,Britain 'looking to bright future' in post-Murray era,"With British tennis now in the post-Andy Murray era, BBC Sport analyses the mood as the next generation look to take over.",16 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:44.598883,China News,BBC,China,"Jack Draper (right) has been the centre of British attention after his run to the US Open semi-finals For so long, Andy Murray has been the epicentre of British tennis. It goes without saying the sport will not be the same without a superstar who brought unparalleled success, shifted the dial of expectation and raised standards across the board. Strong showings by Britain's next generation at the recent US Open, though, provided optimism for anyone worrying how the void might be filled. With New York semi-finalist Jack Draper receiving a hero's welcome on his return home, the Davis Cup event in Manchester presented the opportunity to gauge the mood without the talismanic Murray. Even though the men's team were ultimately unable to progress to the quarter-finals stage in front of a record 15,700 crowd, the feelgood factor was not diminished. ""We've moved on from Andy Murray. We're not looking back to the past. We're looking to the future,"" said Jan Harris, a long-time member of the British Association of Tennis Supporters (BATS). Emma Raducanu, who is the only Briton other than Murray to win a Grand Slam singles title in the past 20 years, drew criticism for saying tennis ""moves on quickly"", external in the wake of his retirement. In truth, it was a pragmatic assessment which has been echoed by many at the Manchester Arena over the past week. ""Andy was a once-in-a-lifetime player and an incredible asset for our sport, in terms of raising visibility and bringing new fans into tennis,"" said LTA chief executive Scott Lloyd. ""But the future is also looking bright."" British number one Draper arrived in Manchester fresh from his exploits in New York, receiving an ebullient ovation from the proud home supporters who recognised the perfect timing of his success. Long considered as the heir to Murray, Draper's breakout Grand Slam performance came in the first major since the former world number one's retirement. Leading the hopes of the nation, in the Davis Cup at least, is a responsibility which has already been bestowed upon Draper. ""I think he will handle it well. We can't shy away from it - he will be a focal point,"" said Leon Smith, head of British men's tennis and Davis Cup captain. ""But that is why it is important to have other players up to shoulder some of that."" Draper is the only British player aged 22 or under currently in the men's top 250, although 23-year-old Jacob Fearnley has entered the conversation after soaring to a career-high 129th by sweeping up his third ATP Challenger title of the year. Fearnley has made incredible strides in the professional ranks since graduating from college in the United States just four months ago On the women's side, 21-year-old Raducanu - back inside the top 75 after seeing her progress derailed by injuries - is the obvious choice when predicting who might challenge at the very top. Sonay Kartal is the only other Briton aged 22 or under inside the women's top 200. A childhood rival of 2021 US Open champion Raducanu, she crowned her recent acceleration with a maiden WTA title on Sunday. And what about the even younger talent coming through? The eye-catching performances of the British juniors at the US Open bode well. Mika Stojsavljevic, 15, provided the perfect pick-me-up from Draper's exit by winning the girls' singles a day later, while 16-year-old Mimi Xu and 17-year-old Charlie Robertson showed their huge potential by reaching the last four. Henry Searle, 18, is continuing his development after becoming the first Briton to win the Wimbledon boys' singles last year. Then there is Hannah Klugman, a 15-year-old who won the prestigious Orange Bowl title last year. ""There is a feelgood factor at the moment, there is no doubt,"" said veteran Dan Evans, who became Britain's second most capped Davis Cup player last week. ""There are some good stories but there is a big difference between the stories and putting it out there on the court."" Murray has been the main protagonist in British tennis for the past two decades, but there has been support from others who have created storylines. Only Raducanu has managed to win a Grand Slam singles title, however, following her fairytale of New York as a teenage qualifier. Johanna Konta reached three major semi-finals between 2016 and 2019, with Kyle Edmund and Cameron Norrie matching that feat at the 2018 Australian Open and 2022 Wimbledon. But Murray and Raducanu have ensured Britain is one of only five nations - along with Serbia, Spain, Russia and Italy - to claim Grand Slam success in both menâs and womenâs singles in the past 20 years. Murray's three major triumphs put Britain joint 11th on the list Six victories by Virgina Wade, Ann Jones, Sue Barker and Raducanu leave Britain ninth on the list Added to that, Jamie Murray, Joe Salisbury, Neal Skupski and Henry Patten have all lifted Grand Slam doubles trophies since 2016. Britain is the only nation to have won menâs singles, womenâs singles, doubles and mixed titles at the majors in the past 20 years. So what constitutes success for British tennis - now and in future years? It is a point which has been debated for most of the past two decades. Is it more Grand Slam singles champions like Murray and Raducanu? Is it more players ranked inside the world's top 100? Or is it attaining larger participation figures across the nation? ""Of course, the answer is we strive towards all of these,"" said Lloyd.  ""Having Grand Slam champions is no mean feat but of course having players go deep in the biggest events brings visibility and inspiration for all our tennis fans and player base, and helps to encourage youngsters to pick up a racquet.  ""The more players we have competing in the top 200 in the world helps push and pull all our players to the best they can be."" Currently there are six players - Draper, 28-year-old Katie Boulter, 29-year-old Norrie, 28-year-old Harriet Dart, Raducanu and new entrant Kartal - in the singles top 100s. Billy Harris, who made his Davis Cup debut aged 29 last week, and 34-year-old Evans are among another eight Britons ranked inside the top 200. ""When you look back at the fact that at some points Andy was our only male player in top 200 of the rankings, we certainly have far more depth these days,"" said Lloyd. However, that pales in comparison to the numbers produced by Australia, France and the United States - who, like Britain, have the benefit of being a cash-rich Grand Slam nation. All three nations have strong numbers in the ATP top 100, although Australia only have one player in the WTA top 100. Argentina, who beat Britain in the Davis Cup on Friday, and Italy also have strength in depth on the ATP side, while Russia and the Czech Republic have produced talented pools in the WTA. ""We would love to have what Argentina have but I keep saying time and time again, we don't have the numbers or ecosystem yet to allow that to happen,"" added Smith. As some fans already look to the future, it will be fascinating to see the post-Murray effect on British interest in the sport. Put simply, Murray has stuck bums on seats. The signs, though, have been encouraging. The opening Davis Cup tie against Finland - played on a midweek afternoon during school term-time - was watched by about 6,500 fans. Crowds built steadily throughout the week-long event and culminated in a sell-out  15,700 attendance on Sunday. ""Whether you like it or not, Andy Murray sold the tickets before - that's the bottom line. That's how we got people through the door,"" said Evans. ""So without him, getting over 15,000 is an exceptional effort."" Setting a new British Davis Cup record - even when the chances of Smith's squad earning a clean sweep of Canada to progress looked slim - was quite the statement. So how can the mood of the immediate post-Murray landscape be summed up?  While observing in a city which loves to trade on its musical heritage, a line from seminal Manchester indie band, the Stone Roses, succinctly does the job. 'The past was yours.

The British athlete was penalised a point by umpire Darek Mikita in the fifth game after Bayley was judged to have kicked the ball in frustration due to missing a shot. The 36-year-old says he often uses his feet to retrieve balls due to difficulties moving his limbs, and that he has never been penalised for this previously. Bayley went on to lose a thrilling final to Yan Shuo of China 11-8 12-14 11-7 7-11 11-9. ""I'm just devastated, it hasn't really sunk in 100%,"" said Bayley. ""I felt I was the better player today without sounding bitter, I felt good today."" What's happening and when at the Paris Paralympics? Paris 2024 Paralympics medal table All you need to know about the Paris Paralympics On using his feet to help retrieve balls between points, he said: ""Especially when I'm tired, my legs aren't that good so I kick the ball into the barrier to pick it up, it's a lot easier. ""I automatically do it, I was still doing it after I got red-carded - then I started running after the ball because I didn't want him to fault me. I wasn't doing it with thinking, I do it in training, I'm on autopilot. I have never had an umpire say anything about it in my life."" On whether the penalty affected him, Bayley added: ""Big time. I was 3-1 up in that [fifth] game, another and it's 4-1. I felt it was important - it's a game to 11, it's quick. But somehow I have to find a way to accept that.  ""I have to look at the video [of the match] as well, I don't know what he was talking about for a lot of the issues."" Bayley had been initially yellow-carded in the second game by Mikita for misbehaviour on court. International Table Tennis Federation rules state if the player gets a second yellow for an infringement, their opponent is awarded a point. That proved to be key in deciding the outcome as Shuo defeated Bayley in the S7 singles final for the second successive Paralympics. Bayley has reached the final of the previous four Games, but only won one - at Rio 2016 - while now having to settle for three silvers. Bayley looked devastated as he sat courtside following the conclusion of the final Sport-by-sport guide to Paris 2024 Paralympics Paralympics 2024: What you need to know about classification Paralympics 2024: Who has been selected for the GB team? After being penalised a point, Bayley engaged in a long debate with Mikita and also spoke to an off-court official before having to accept the penalty. He also spoke to the umpire afterwards. Asked what he told Mikita, Bayley said: ""I said, I've never seen anything like it. It's the Paralympic final. It's difficult to take, I'm gutted and I'm emotional, it's difficult to talk logically."" Bayley resolved to return for the next Paralympics and go for gold in Los Angeles in 2028. ""I'm good enough to win a Paralympic Games - 100% [will go for LA 2028], I just need to get over this loss, I'm sure I will in a few weeks,"" he added. Earlier on Friday, Rob Davies claimed silver in the men's singles MS1. The Welshman, 40, won gold at Rio 2016 but was unable to defend his title in Tokyo five years later because of a shoulder injury. In Friday's final, Cuba's Yunier Fernandez won a close first game before wrapping up a 14-12 11-7 11-4 victory. Medals won by Bayley and Davies added to the three bronze medals won by ParalympicsGB in Para-table tennis earlier in the Games - those for Felicity Pickard and Bly Twomey in the women's doubles WD14, Billy Shilton and Paul Karabardak in the men's doubles MD14 and Twomey in the women's singles WS7.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1k3x8mllryo,"Hymns, volunteers and sleepless nights: Singapore readies for Pope visit",The city's grandest arena has welcomed Taylor Swift and Madonna - now for Pope Francis.,12 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:44.836572,China News,BBC,China,"Singapore's grandest arena, which has hosted Taylor Swift and Madonna, is getting ready to welcome an arguably bigger icon - Pope Francis. The pontiff will celebrate Mass with 50,000 people at the National Stadium on Thursday evening, packing the venue as his 12-day Asia-Pacific tour draws to a close. The 87-year-old has been to Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea - the visit to the Pacific Island was the furthest he has travelled to meet devotees.  He arrived in Singapore, where less than 10% of the population - around 400,000 people - identify as Catholic, on Wednesday afternoon. The three-day visit includes meetings with government officials, religious leaders and students. This has been the longest foreign visit of his papacy and given his frail health, volunteers say the visit was unimaginable just a year ago. A spell of illness at the time had made overseas travel difficult, forcing him to cancel a trip to the UAE.  ""Since we were told that he was coming [to Singapore], we've been praying,"" says Karen Cheah, one of 5,000 volunteers who have been recruited for duties ranging from singing in the choir during Mass to protecting the Pope. ""Once he got on the plane and visited the other countries, the reality hit that it's coming up: we are next.""  Hosting the Pope for even a single evening - as the stadium will - is no small feat.    It is a hive of activity the day before Mass. The pitch is covered with rubber flooring. The rows of chairs are growing as workers unload more of them.  At the other end of the arena, the choir is rehearsing hymns at full volume under the close watch of directors, the sound clashing with the routines being practised by the hosts of the event.  One volunteer is going through the sequences for Mass while manoeuvring an empty wheelchair. Pope Francis is expected to use a wheelchair for most engagements because of a knee ailment.  Meanwhile security volunteers are working with the police to secure an area around the Pope and guard where he is staying in Singapore. These volunteers have completed weeks of training, where they learned skills including how to disengage from a tight grip and respond to a knife attack. ""Because of the current heightened sense of security, the police have been very active in working with us,"" says Kevin Ho, who heads the security volunteer team. ""Our volunteers have been having sleepless nights, doing the operational work. We are trying to make the visit as safe and successful as it can be."" The precautions have also increased because of a recent threat. Seven people were detained in Indonesia last week over a failed plot to attack the Pope. Police said they had confiscated bows, arrows, a drone and leaflets purportedly linked to the Islamic State militant group. The Pope, born in Buenos Aires as Jorge Mario Bergoglio, is known to be unafraid to address issues including LGBT+ inclusion and inter-religious tensions. On this trip, he made a joint call for peace in Jakarta alongside the grand imam of Southeast Asia's largest mosque and met other religious leaders.  He praised Indonesians for choosing to have large families over pets, a seeming comment on plummeting birth rates in China, South Korea and Japan. But his figures that Indonesian parents are having up to five children were decades out of date, commentators pointed out. Indonesian women now have on average only slightly more than two children in their lifetime, UN data shows. In resource-rich Papua New Guinea, which has been drawing international companies and investors, the Pope called for workers to be treated fairly. And in Timor-Leste, he said young people should be protected from abuse, after a prominent local bishop was accused of sexually abusing young boys there during the 1980s and 90s. ""Of course, the Pope has a message. But at the same time, he is also the message,"" says Monsignor Stephen Yim, co-chair of the organising committee at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore.  This is Singapore's second papal visit.  The late Pope John Paul II spent just five hours in the city state in 1986, which included officiating Mass at the old National Stadium. Mr Ho, who was a student then, remembers that day well. He says the crowd roared as the pontiff made a lap of the venue in the popemobile, undeterred by the rain. ""The old stadium had no roof and we all got rained on,"" Mr Ho recalls. ""The only emotion I remember was that palpable sense of excitement when the Pope came around. It was electric. I will never forget that."" Demand for Thursday's Mass was also high - almost half of those who tried to get a seat were unsuccessful. Those who were unlucky received a reply with an emoji and verse from the Bible. ""Seeing the Pope in person feels like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" says Stephanie Yuen, who managed to get a seat at the stadium. ""As a Catholic, that's something I don't want to miss, especially in my own country."" The Mass will be ""a very profound spiritual experience that I will get to share with thousands of my fellow Catholics in Singapore"", says Sherilyn Choo, another thrilled attendee.    The visit has also touched non-Catholics, such as carpenter Govindharaj Muthiah, who built two chairs for the Pope's use in Singapore.  ""Tensions around the globe are quite high. It's heartwarming that he made trips to countries with many different religions,"" Mr Muthiah says. ""Unity is the message he is putting across."" "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78580wl23vo,The challenges of changing Scotland's economy,Great natural resources and a strong industrial record may not be enough for cautious investors.,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:44.954372,China News,BBC,China,"The great energy transition is taking place all over the world. But there can be few countries which present as many opportunities, challenges and dilemmas as Scotland. On one hand, there are “natural resources that are the envy of the world” offering “a golden ticket for UK growth”. That was the viewpoint of Rain Newton-Smith, director-general of the CBI business umbrella organisation, speaking at its annual Scottish dinner in Glasgow on Thursday night. While the rest of the economy flatlined last year, the net zero portion of it grew by 9%, she claimed, adding that Scotland can offer investors the added lure of a relatively highly-skilled workforce, the research strengths of its universities and financial skills to make projects work. On the other hand, the fossil fuel industries appear to be declining faster than the green ones can rise. And the industries that ought to be gaining from the transition from fossil fuels are suffering from a gap in demand while that potential remains out of reach. In recent days, Mitsubishi Electric announced plans to cut 440 jobs from its Livingston workforce making air source heat pumps. While it retains many more to continue making equipment, that market remains far from mature. It requires sticks and carrots to help homeowners make the transition from fossil fuels and to build the skills base to install and maintain pumps. These are roles for government. Alexander Dennis, the long-established bus builder in Larbert and Falkirk which is now controlled from Canada, has announced 160 job losses. The company still employs 1,800 people around the UK but says government policies at Westminster and Holyrood are making it hard to compete. Public funds are being poured into renewal of low-carbon bus fleets, with strings attached to contracts that add to labour costs. The same is not expected of workers’ pay and conditions on imported buses. There is a 10% tariff, raising the price of an electric bus as it arrives in Britain - a lower import tax, points out Alexander Dennis’ boss, than diesel buses. And then there’s the Grangemouth refinery. Government policies are directed at reducing demand for refined oil, so the refinery’s owner, Petroineos, sees little prospect they can turn around repeated annual losses. New, more efficient, refineries can send us refined product and that is what PetroIneos is pledged to provide.  If they can ensure the road tankers keep rolling out of Grangemouth with sufficient petrol, diesel, heating and aviation fuel, then the impact on the Scottish economy should be limited to the loss of 400 jobs there and – let’s not forget – a source of earnings for some of the 2,000 to 5,000 contractors on the Grangemouth complex on weekdays. But there is a symbolic significance to dismantling the plant at the centre of Scotland’s economy which, for 100 years, has been fuelling and lubricating every aspect of that economy. Especially when it’s unclear what will replace it.  With its location, history, pipelines and transport links by sea, rail and road, the Grangemouth site is well placed to become a hub for bio-fuels, using grain to propel aircraft or forestry and food waste for other fuel uses, or as a centre for cracking water with renewable power to isolate hydrogen. That much has been established in phase one of Project Willow, with phase two of this, where the stakeholders consider their options, now under way.  But for workers losing their jobs at Grangemouth, that thinking about how to offer a ""just"" transition from fossil fuels could have been under way years ago, with those plants designed, approved and under construction. Other countries are building these hydrogen plants and moving ahead with Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Huge subsidies are going into green manufacturing in the USA and China. According to Ms Newton-Smith at the CBI, Britain has moved down the table for green investment, also being overtaken by France and Germany. It has lost ""first mover"" advantage in developing new technologies and industries. Investors are restless to get going, she says. The CBI has identified £57bn of “green growth opportunities” this decade. But, as she also points out, “this stuff is complicated”. It’s also risky.  So while Scotland is a world leader in setting targets, it’s not enough to set out visions which the climate change watchdog describes as stalled, with targets which have ceased to be credible.  Investors are looking for detail and action which joins up and confronts hard choices. As with the heat pump market and electric buses, governments have a vital role in shaping markets and can do so in ways that reduce investors’ risk. One example of special interest to Petroineos is the market for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The pace at which airlines are required to switch to low-carbon fuel will determine demand.  Can airlines be incentivised to co-invest with SAF manufacturers, or should government step in with mechanisms to put a floor under the price of fuel? To no-one’s surprise, the CBI boss highlighted the case of her organisation’s members in the oil and gas sector – five tax changes in two years and another one looming when the Treasury sets the limits on investment allowances. Questioned later about this in front of the CBI audience, Iain Murray, Scotland secretary in the UK cabinet, hinted there could be a softening of the stance on the industry’s tax incentives to keep investing in remaining offshore oil and gas assets. Even if Grangemouth won’t be refining that crude oil, a lot of the high-emissions black stuff will still be required to keep the economy moving.  Fierce lobbying by the industry may be getting through. The CBI leadership was boasting of how many meetings it has had with the new team in charge in Whitehall. Not everyone will be reassured by that. Ministers have been reminded that if growth is their key mission, then international investors want to see consistency in policy - and they have other places they can invest.  “To put it simply,” said Ms Newton-Smith, “it’s very hard to make the case to global boardrooms for more investment in renewable energy in the UK when current revenues aren’t profitable.  ""And while we get the need (for more tax revenue), it’s not going to work to take with one hand without encouraging with the other”. Nor, she added, does it help to have the air of gloom emerging from Downing Street.  Business likes to think positively, and it’s looking for more hope and optimism."

Please Do Not Touch tells the story of Mason, a social justice activist, who works to uncover the true stories behind artefacts displayed in museums and stately homes. The drama by Casey Bailey explores themes of colonialism, ownership, the criminal justice system and contested items. It premiers at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry on Wednesday and runs until 21 September. “The inspiration came from me visiting art galleries, museums, heritage houses and they’re covered in the signs that say 'please do not touch',” Mr Bailey told BBC Radio WM. “I started thinking these things shouldn’t be here, there were items that were taken from Ghana, India and China and you’re telling me 'please do not touch', but why did you touch it in the first place? “So then I started delving into some of the hypocrisy of that, but also some of the interesting stories of these things.” The playwright and teacher first published a collection of poems in 2021 with the same title, which focused on a similar theme and the impact on the lives of young black men who grew up in the city. He added: “When we pick up something and take it then we’re criminals and crooks. But 200 years ago, people who picked up and took things became admirals, generals, legends and heroes so it was about picking apart that difference.” “All these layers of society stack up and basically do the same job which is lift up some people and push down other people.” Directed by Gail Babb, the play unfolds as the protagonist finds himself in a young offender facility after an incident with an artefact and he uses poetry as a tool to survive the ordeal.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7r79l88jeo,Royal Observatory's photographer of the year won with eclipse image,"Baily's beads, a galaxy shot from Namibia and a nebula that took 260 hours to capture are among winners.",13 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:55.777425,China News,BBC,China,"Ryan Imperio has been named the Royal Observatory Greenwich’s Astronomy Photographer of the Year for a photograph that captures the progression of Baily’s beads during the 2023 annular eclipse. Baily’s beads are formed when sunlight shines through the valleys and craters of the Moon’s surface, and are only briefly visible when an eclipse is beginning or ending. Kerry-Ann Lecky Hepburn, one of the judges and a meteorologist, said the winning image was an ""impressive dissection of the fleeting few seconds"" when Baily's beads can be seen. ""This image left me captivated and amazed,"" she added. Mr Imperio, who won £10,000 for winning the competition overall, said he ""never expected to be selected"" and was ""both thrilled and honoured"" with the award. For the 2024 competition there were over 3,500 entries from 58 countries.  Mr Imperio's entry was also among the winners selected for the Our Sun category of the competition. The Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year award was won by Daniel Borsari for his image ""NGC NGC 1499, A Dusty California"".  This image features the California Nebula - also known as NGC 1499 - an emission nebula in the constellation of Perseus.  The image was created by taking lots of pictures of the nebula and combining them into one. It’s located about 1,000 light years from Earth and it’s visible thanks to the ionization of gases by the blue giant star Persei. Neal White, a prize judge and an artist, said Mr Borsari's image showed ""the future of astronomy photography being fearlessly, and openly, taken forward by a new generation"". Bence Tóth and Péter Feltót from Hungary were the winners in the Galaxies category. Their picture shows the galaxy NGC 5128 and its relativistic jet - beams of radiation and particles travelling close to the speed of light. The galaxy can only be seen from the southern hemisphere, so the photographers travelled to Namibia to capture the image. Larryn Rae triumphed in the Aurorae category with a picture of the aurora australis over Queenstown, New Zealand. The image is a panorama composed of 19 pictures, capturing the pink beams of solar radiation that lit up the sky in February 2023. ""Shadow peaks of Sinus Iridum"" by Gábor Balázs, from Hungary, took the top spot in the Our Moon category. The photograph captures Sinus Iridum - also known as the Bay of Rainbows - a massive crater 260km across. Part of the crater's wall has effectively been destroyed, giving it the appearance of a bay.  The photographer used a monochrome camera with a filter to capture the area. Tom Williams from the UK was first in the People and Space category with his image which captured the silhouette of the International Space Station (ISS) on a backdrop of the Sun. Crossing the field-of-view in just 0.2 seconds, ISS transits of the Sun are particularly rare to see on Earth.  Mr Williams was also selected as the winner in the Planets, Comets and Asteroids category. His composite shows the phases of Venus, using ultra-violet and infrared filters that reveal the cloud structure within the upper atmosphere of the planet.  Tom Rae captured this image of peaks of the Tasman Valley in New Zealand set against the night sky of the southern hemisphere during summer. It includes the hydrogen clouds of the Gum Nebula - the red blob near the centre - as well as a band of the Milky Way. This impressive photograph is the result of 3,559 frames, 260 hours of exposure time and telescopes located on three continents.  The team worked to explore and photograph a previously unknown gigantic supernova remnant (SNR) in the centre of the famous constellation Cassiopeia. ""SNR G107.5-5.2, The Nereides Nebula in Cassiopeia"" was created by Marcel Drechsler in Germany, Bray Falls in the USA, and Yann Sainty, Nicolas Martino and Richard Galli in France. The Sir Patrick Moore Prize for Best Newcomer award went to Xin Feng and Miao Gong from China. Their image is of SH2-308, the Dolphin Head Nebula, which appears low in the northern hemisphere and can only be seen for five hours a day. Their image comprises a total of ten days of shooting. Sergio Díaz Ruiz from Spain was awarded the Annie Maunder Prize for Image Innovation for his image of Earth. This image was created by mixing the 16 bands monitored by the GOES-18 weather satellite to encode land masses, oceans and atmospheric features as different colours. The winning and highly commended images will be on display in exhibition at the National Maritime Museum, London from 13 September 2024."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rd512v77qo,"'Grim' September ahead with 6,000 steel and oil jobs to go",The BBC understands the government is bracing itself for a tough month as workers face losing their jobs,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:55.893089,China News,BBC,China,"The government is warning of a ""grim"" September with up to 6,000 jobs set to be cut across the steel and oil refining industries, the BBC understands. A total of 2,800 jobs are set to go at Port Talbot in Wales, while up to 3,000 jobs are expected to be axed at British Steel in Scunthorpe. A further 400 will be cut at Scotland's Grangemouth oil refinery. Unions' hopes that investment from a new Labour government could help limit job losses have largely been dashed, according to sources. The government said it was facing ""tough decisions"" but added: ""The solution isn’t writing a blank cheque to bail out the past, or to put taxpayers on the hook for the industrial challenges we’ve inherited."" Labour's manifesto promised a kitty of £2.5bn to revitalise the UK steel industry. But the new government has taken a similar line to its predecessor by insisting that public money is only available to invest in new greener steel production facilities, rather than to subsidise large ongoing losses at carbon-intensive plants. Both Tata, the Indian firm which owns Port Talbot and Jingye of China, which owns Scunthorpe, insist the plants are losing £1m a day. The government is in talks to finalise a grant to Tata of £500m towards the £1.25bn cost of building an electric arc furnace which will eventually replace the last remaining blast furnace at Port Talbot. Blast furnaces use coke in the process of creating ""virgin"" steel but the process generates carbon dioxide while electric arc furnaces are mostly used to melt down and repurpose scrap steel.  This process cannot replicate all grades of steel that are produced in blast furnaces, including some types used in construction and rail.  At Port Talbot, the GMB and Community unions have presented members with a redundancy deal struck with Tata which would see workers receive 2.8 weeks of earnings for every year of service up to a maximum of 25 years. Workers can also sign up to a one-year skills and re-training scheme during which they will be paid £27,000. Union officials hope the number of immediate compulsory redundancies at the UK’s biggest steel works will end up being far lower than 2,800 as many workers who left recently have not been replaced. There have been more than 2,000 expressions of interest in the redundancy and re-training package being offered. In Scunthorpe, prospects for workers have deteriorated more suddenly. Unions had hoped that a government support package of up to £600m to Jingye would see one of its remaining blast furnaces remain open during the three years it took to build a new electric arc furnace. That prospect has faded, according to union and government sources, meaning that up to 3,000 jobs could go. Asked how the government felt about the next few weeks, a senior source said: ""It's going to feel grim."" Unions have told the BBC that the closure of blast furnaces at both Port Talbot and Scunthorpe would leave the UK without the ability to make virgin steel. But other industry voices have downplayed such vulnerabilities, pointing out that the coking coal and iron ore used in blast furnaces are imported from abroad, so importing some virgin steel would make little difference. Meanwhile, an announcement is expected this month to confirm that Scotland’s only remaining oil refinery at Grangemouth will shut down early next year to become a less labour-intensive oil and gas import terminal. Government promises to explore a sustainable future for the site based on the planned expansion of renewable energy in Scotland are not expected to come soon enough to save up to 400 jobs. A government spokesman said: ""Decarbonisation does not mean deindustrialisation and government will continue working in partnership with trade unions and business to support good, stable jobs and deliver economic growth."" A spokesperson for British Steel in Scunthorpe said bosses were in ""ongoing discussions"" with the government over its future operations. ""While progress continues, no final decisions have been made,"" they added."

On a thrilling Thursday Great Britain's youngest athlete at the Games, Iona Winnifrith, won silver in Para-swimming, while 14-year-old Bly Twomey claimed bronze in Para-table tennis. GB's Dan Pembroke twice broke the F13 javelin world record on his way to successfully defending his Paralympic title. Plus, there were two further gold medals for GB on day eight thanks to Para-swimmers Becky Redfern and Alice Tai. In total GB claimed 10 medals on Thursday, with three of them gold. It means Great Britain's total stands at 83 medals, including 36 gold. Only China, who have 74 golds and 166 in total, have more. This video can not be played Bly Twomey: 'I dream about table tennis, it makes all my worries go away' If you're good enough, you're old enough. Born in 2011 and aged just 13 years and 148 days, teenager Winnifrith stormed to silver with a personal best swim on Thursday, only beaten by Neutral Paralympic athlete Mariia Pavlova's world-record time in the SB7 100m breaststroke final. She told Channel 4 ""it's mad and pretty cool"" to even be competing in Paris.  Winnifrith returns to action in the SB7 50m breaststroke on Saturday and, should she podium, would join fellow teenager Twomey as a two-time GB Paralympic medallist. Para-table tennis star Twomey, 349 days older, finished with a bronze after a hard-fought WS7 semi-final defeat by Turkeyâs Kubra Korkut, who is 30 and more than twice her age. Earlier in the Games Twomey won bronze in the WD14 womenâs doubles, alongside Felicity Pickard. The future is bright for the two Brits. Pembroke, 33, successfully defended his Paralympic title from Tokyo 2020 Great Britain's Pembroke beat the world record with his third throw. With his fourth he smashed it. Before Thursday the global best was 71.01m, but defending champion Pembroke soon beat it with a 71.15m effort and then, with his very next throw, chucked a huge 74.49m. None of his competitors came close. Earlier, Sammi Kinghorn ended her Paralympics with a fourth medal by winning silver in the T53 400m. The 28-year-old finished second behind Switzerland's Catherine Debrunner for the third time at Paris, having pipped her to gold in Wednesday's 100m final. GB's Pembroke wins javelin gold with new world record 'Spine-tingling' silver as Kinghorn extends Paralympic medal haul You would think most athletes would know when they have won gold, right? Well British Para-swimmer Tai admitted she was unaware she had won her S8 50m freestyle final, and had to be told by one of her rivals that she had pipped them to gold. The 25-year-old, who had her leg amputated just two years ago, now has two golds, one silver and a bronze at Paris - but never expected to compete over her shortest distance. ""I'm not usually lost for words but my brain is going 'woo-woo',"" she told Channel 4. ""My 50m has been a bit hard, my stroke has not been as balanced just because of the loss of my leg. I did not expect to win."" Earlier, GB's Redfern triumphed in the SB13 100m breaststroke final, finally getting gold after finishing second at the past two Games. Great Britain now have 16 Paralympic golds in the pool at Paris 2024, more than any other nation.  Tai and Redfern land Paralympic gold medals Olivia Broome was the only participant in the women's -50kg powerlifting final to complete three lifts of more than 110kg GB's Olivia Broome said she will ""treat herself to some pizza"" after securing powerlifting bronze in the women's -50kg category. Compatriot Mark Swan said ""this is just the start"" after he won silver in the men's -65kg Para-powerlifting final on his Paralympics debut. Anna Nicholson won Great Britain's first medal of the day by claiming bronze in the womenâs F35 shot put final. Great Britain collected silver in the wheelchair fencing men's team foil, losing their gold-medal match with China 45-34. GB's men's wheelchair basketball team guaranteed themselves at least a silver medal after a 71-43 semi-final win over Germany. They will face the USA in their final on Saturday.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynexz6l1eo,US plans to block Nippon Steel takeover of US Steel - US media,The controversial move comes during a heated election year in the US.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:56.125914,China News,BBC,China,"President Joe Biden is preparing to block the takeover of a storied US steel-maker by a Japanese company, a controversial move that critics say would lead to job losses and could chill foreign investment in the US, according to US media reports. The $15bn deal was announced by Japan's Nippon Steel and US Steel last year. It would have created one of the world's biggest steel companies outside of China and had been hailed by investors as an answer to the company's financial woes.  But it soon ran into resistance from politicians and the US Steelworkers union, which said it did not want to see the 123-year-old firm fall into foreign hands.  US Steel shares fell nearly 20% after reports of the decision, which involves a company headquartered Pennsylvania, a swing state, during a heated campaign season.  Mr Biden had already moved to have the deal probed on national security grounds and voiced opposition to the takeover earlier this year. Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, rivals in the race for president, have also come out against the merger. US Steel said it had not received any update about a formal decision and said it stood by the deal, noting that Japan was one of America's ""most staunch allies"".  ""We fully expect to pursue all possible options under the law to ensure this transaction, which is [the] best future for Pennsylvania, American steelmaking, and all of our stakeholders, closes,"" a spokesman said.  Earlier on Wednesday, the company held a rally to show support for the merger.  It warned that blocking the deal would put ""thousands of jobs"" at risk, prompting it to shut factories and potentially move its headquarters from Pennsylvania. ""We want elected leaders and other key decision makers to recognise the benefits of the deal as well as the unavoidable consequences if the deal fails,"" chief executive David Burrit said in a statement announcing a rally in favour of the plans. The deal has been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a group led by the Treasury Department that looks at national security concerns.  Treasury declined to comment on the president's decision, which was first reported by the Washington Post and Financial Times. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US had not yet given a recommendation to the president.  Speaking to the BBC, a White House official did not deny reports of that the president planned to block the deal, saying only that receiving the CFIUS recommendation would be the ""next step in this process"". As of 2020, the US had formally blocked just five foreign investments via CFIUS, deals that involved Chinese firms.  Nippon Steel is based in Japan, a US ally.  Earlier this year, the US Chamber of Commerce warned against politicising such reviews, saying officials risked sending a ""chilling signal"" to firms abroad.  Though the involvement of CFIUS makes this case unusual, political intervention in the steel industry is not, said Alan Wolff, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former trade lawyer who has worked with firms, including US Steel. More than 20 years ago, George W Bush, ""otherwise a free-trader"", put in place protections for steel, he noted.   Donald Trump's administration was also marked by a trade fight over tariffs put in place to protect US steelmakers. Biden modified those protections, easing tensions with allies, but still kept in place some guards. The economic stature of US steel, founded by Andrew Carnegie, may have shrunk, but it still plays a big role in our national psyche, Mr Wolff said. ""It has a big part in our view of where manufacturing has gone and the threat to manufacturing jobs,"" he said. ""That's a big part of the Biden administration and it's a big part of this election,"" he said. "

The patient, in the state of Missouri, was treated in hospital and has since recovered, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. It is the 14th human case of bird flu in the US in 2024 and the first without a known occupational exposure to  infected animals, according to the CDC.  The agency said that, based on their current data, the risk to the general public remains low. Bird flu is a viral disease that primarily affects birds and other animals. Human infections are rare. Previous US cases have been traced back to exposure to infected poultry or cattle, but the Missouri patient marks ""the first case of H5 without a known occupational exposure to sick or infected animals,"" the CDC said in a statement on Friday.  The Missouri case was detected through routine flu season surveillance. The patient had underlying medical conditions, and received flu antiviral medications.  Bird flu has been on the rise among cows in the US this year. An outbreak was first reported in March, and cattle in 14 states had been affected as of 3 September, according to the CDC. While outbreaks of bird flu have not been reported in Missouri's cattle, it has been reported in poultry this year and in wild birds in the past, health officials said. US health officials discovered a human case of bird flu in March 2024, which was identified after an exposure to dairy cows that were potentially infected. Bird flu was first detected in China in the 1990s, and has since spread across every continent including Antarctica. World health officials believe the current risk to humans is low, but have actively monitored the disease for years. It has disease has affected wildlife worldwide, infecting species as varied as sea lions, seals and bears."

Here, Australian climber and photographer Simon Carter picks five of the best. Maybe it was Tom Cruise clambering up the red rock of Utah's Dead Horse Point in Mission: Impossible II that made people want to test their mettle, or the Oscar-winning film Free Solo that documented Alex Honnold's inspirational ascent of the 3,000ft-high rock face of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park without ropes or safety gear. Whatever the reason, climbing has boomed in popularity around the world.  ""I've seen so many people getting into outdoor climbing over the last 20 years,"" says Australian climber and photographer Simon Carter. ""A lot of that's down to films, and to the proliferation of indoor climbing gyms, as well as sport climbing finally making it into the Olympics in 2020 in Japan."" MEET THE EXPERT (Image credit: Coco Carter) Australian rock climber and photographer Simon Carter established Onsight Photography in 1994. Since then, he has travelled widely and built an extensive body of work capturing many of the world's best climbing destinations. Carter is the recipient of several photography accolades and the author of four previous coffee-table books, including Images from the Edge (2005), which won the Mountain Image award at the Banff Mountain Book Festival. From Madagascar to China, the world is filled with towers, cliffs, caves and other astounding formations for intrepid souls who want to see what they're made of, whether they're sport climbing, bouldering, top-roping or free soloing. Many of the greatest climbing locations are gathered in Carter's new book The Art of Climbing. ""The physical and mental challenge of climbing"" was what first attracted Carter, who's been climbing for 40 years. ""But as I got more into it, it was about the places I was exploring and the people I was hanging out with. What I love about climbing is you get to experience random places on the planet, which are so interesting – it gives you a slice of a place you'd rarely explore as a tourist. The connection to nature is one of the most powerful things. You spend long periods of time in the most spectacular locations. You end up awed and fascinated by these places."" Here are five of Carter's favourite climbing locations around the world to push your limits or just enjoy the sheer beauty of wild, rugged nature. For an edge-of-the-world feel, few places can match the Tasman Peninsula in south-east Tasmania, Australia. The peninsula's known for Port Arthur, a famous convict colony from the 1800s when Australia was first settled by Europeans. But for climbers, it's the rugged coastline's giant sea columns of Jurassic dolerite, protruding up to 300m from the sea, that call to them.  About an hour's drive from Hobart, Tasmania's capital, the Tasman Peninsula is home to a famous ""trilogy"" of iconic pillars. ""The Totem Pole, The Moai and Pole Dancer [pictured above] are adventurous outings for experienced climbers only,"" explains Carter. ""They all require at least two hours of hiking and an abseil to get to the pillars. The Moai (22m) is a moderately adventurous outing. In the case of Pole Dancer, it is a full-on adventure that takes at least five hours of hiking, two abseils and several pitches of climbing just to reach the start of Pole Dancer (40m) itself. The Totem Pole, 65m metres high in total and only about 4m wide at the base, is quite a technically challenging rock climb for harder rock climbers. ""It's like a big matchstick – an incredible thing jutting out of the ocean. This is technical climbing in the most mind-blowing location you can imagine."" Tasmania can be reached with direct flights from Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane to Hobart and Launceston, or by the Spirit of Tasmania car ferry, which crosses between Geelong on mainland Australia to Devonport – having your own vehicle makes it easier to reach the island's remote parts. Crete, Corfu, Santorini, Mykonos… some of the names of the 6,000 Greek Islands are incredibly well-known to holidaymakers. Kalymnos, between the islands of Kos and Leros in the Dodecanese chain, is far less famous, but among climbers, it's legendary. ""Kalymnos could not be more famous amongst climbers,"" Carter says. ""It's a rocky island and it's not aesthetically the most beautiful Greek island. But for climbers it's a paradise, with cliffs and crags and caves all over it. It's probably the most popular single rock-climbing destination in the world right now. There must be well over 4,000 individual climbs on the limestone crags scattered all over Kalymnos and the neighbouring Telendos Island. The range of difficulty covers every grade, from easiest climbs to incredibly difficult – there really is something for everyone."" ""EQUAL OPPORTUNITY"" Carter describes climbing as an ""equal opportunity"" space; in recent years, Australia's Monique Forestier (Carter's ex-wife), United States' Lynn Hill, France's Catherine Destivelle, and the UK's Hazel Findlay have all been inspiring more women to get into the sport. ""Climbing's one of those sports that doesn't discriminate against sex,"" he says. ""It's about power, agility, finesse and the mental side. The percentage of female climbers is ever growing – it's probably around 50% now. You can feel it: women climbers are on the rise."" Travellers can take a direct flight from Athens to Kalymnos or catch ferries from other islands, such as Rhodes. Among the most remarkable and challenging climbing experiences is Crystal Cave (pictured above) on Telendos, reachable via a 30-minute ferry or water taxi from Kalymnos and then a 1.5km hike (or ask the boat to drop you closer to Crystal Cave, which they're often happy to do). ""Crystal Cave is a long, hard, technical endurance climb – a very physical, gymnastic route,"" Carter adds. ""You need a 100m rope to do it because the cave is so high; when you get to the top of the cave, you need enough rope to lower off and get back to the ground. It's an extraordinary place."" Smith Rocks State Park in Oregon is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern American sport climbing. Carter explains that climbing started becoming popular here in the 1960s and 1970s, then really took off in the '80s, when climbers looking for harder challenges turned their attention to the blank-looking walls.  ""The steep clean walls had no cracks or features, so climbers started equipping the routes with permanently fixed safety bolts, which enabled climbers to concentrate on pushing the physical, gymnastic side of climbing, which became known as 'sport climbing' and took off around the country,"" he says. Reached via a 200-mile drive from Portland, Smith Rock State Park is located in central Oregon's high desert. ""Smith Rocks is an awe-inspiring place,"" says Carter. ""The state park has the Crooked River running through it. It's a little oasis in the middle of the countryside. You have ranches and farmland, and then, boom, this state park pops up out of nowhere with these cool orange welded tuff rock formations for climbing, including The Smith Rock Group (in the background of the photo above), The Christian Brothers, The Dihedrals, Aggro Gully and the Monkey Face. The area has a Wild West feel to me. It's a place where you really feel you should be getting around on a horse. It has a slightly desolate feel, with these confronting walls of blankness.""  More that 2,000 routes line the park's rocky landscapes. Most visitors go for one of the many easy or moderate routes, but hardcore climbers might attempt time-tested classics, such as To Bolt Or Not To Be, which is ""a stunning, blank-looking 41m-high wall in the Dihedrals area"", according to Carter. ""It requires consistent, hard climbing. When it was first climbed by French climber Jean Baptiste Tribout in 1986, it was the hardest route in North America. The cheeky name he gave the route made a point – soon after, sport climbing took off in the US. Years later, the route remains a coveted test-piece for top climbers today."" There's a whole lot of limestone with abundant climbing opportunities along France's south coast, but Calanques National Park, outside Marseilles, is the epicentre that draws in adventurers from around the world. ""The Calanques is a very historically significant area for rock climbers. French mountaineers in the early 1900s would go there when the weather was bad in the mountains to hone their technical skills, so there are amazing traditional rock climbs, like Arête de Marseille, a classic, easy route for experienced climbers on La Grande Candelle formation overlooking the Mediterranean, which was first climbed in 1927, as well as more modern climbing."" More like this: • Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms • The UK's five most beautiful national parks • The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world There are 26 calanques (or, roughly, ""rocky inlets"") in the national park, a 520-sq-km area that's popular with hikers, boaters, yachters, swimmers and nature lovers, as well as climbers. Marseille makes a good base, a 30-minute bus or car journey from the national park, or climbers can stay in one of the little port towns, such as Les Goudes. ""Climbers can choose from some of the long, old traditional climbs, or hard modern sport climbs on overhangs and caves,"" says Carter. ""The climbing is easy-to-moderate, with some harder stuff. There's something for everyone. The limestone here is so beautiful. Some of the climbs start from little beaches. What's also special about the Calanques is that you're climbing above the lovely sparkling Mediterranean ocean."" There's a sedate pace to the junk boat cruises that carry travellers around Hạ Long Bay, a gorgeous area in north-east Vietnam with more than 2,000 limestone karsts soaring out of the ocean, some as high as 400m. But the Unesco World Heritage Site is also an adventure playground, with fantastic opportunities for sea kayaking, scuba diving, hiking and rock climbing. ""Hạ Long Bay is a crazily beautiful place,"" says Carter. ""When you cruise around the area, you're transfixed by what you're seeing. It's one of those places where you feel you've really travelled somewhere unique and adventurous."" Cát Bà, the largest island in the bay, is the main hub for climbers, with the rugged mountains of Cát Bà National Park and the popular cliff Butterfly Wall. But to really experience the best of the Bay, you need to explore by boat. ""Although many of the karsts are too sharp, low-angled and vegetated to be of interest to most modern rock climbers, there are specks of gold for adventurous explorers,"" says Carter. ""You could get lost in this area, exploring for days by boat."" The Bay's climbs are not ideal for novices. ""You can't get a lot done as a beginner there – it's for adventurous, experienced climbers,"" Carter says. He picks out The Face and Turtle Cave as two favourite climbs within easy reach of Cát Bà. ""The Face is a huge wall of limestone, which looks like candlewax has dripped down the rock face. To climb it is an unusual experience. There are also plenty of climbs in the area where, once you've finished, you can abseil back down to a beach. But the greatest benefit of the area comes with the 'deep-water soloing' challenges, where you can just step off the boat and climb without a rope – just you, the rock and the ocean as your 'crash pad'."" Turtle Cave is a perfect example of that, where climbers aim to climb to the lip of a cave 10m above the ocean – without using a rope. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."

Sandilands, 21, put in a storming last lap in the T20 race for athletes with intellectual impairments to finish in three minutes 45.40 seconds - beating the old mark held by American Mikey Brannigan by 0.10secs. It is Britain's fifth gold of the Para-athletics programme in Paris. Broom-Edwards, who finished fifth in his T64 event with 1.89m, revealed after his T64 competition he had sustained a fractured ankle and torn ligaments in training six weeks ago, which needed surgery and he had intense rehab to be able to compete. ""Just to be on the start line, to be amongst it all, to be amongst the crowd, I'm truly blessed,"" he said.  ""It's been the hardest I've had to work in my life."" There was a silver for wheelchair racer Marcus Perrineau-Daley in the T52 100m event on his Paralympic debut. The 35-year-old Londoner, who was paralysed in a motorbike accident in 2014, led Belgian Maxime Carabin at the halfway mark before the world-record holder came through strongly to win. Two more medals followed for ParalympicsGB in Friday's evening session at Stade de France. Hollie Arnold took bronze in the women's F46 javelin before the 4x100m universal relay team of Jonnie Peacock, Sammi Kinghorn, Ali Smith and Zac Shaw finished second behind China.

""It's an amazing feeling,"" he said after becoming the second consecutive British winner of the race following fellow Fife AC club-mate Owen Miller, who triumphed in Tokyo in 2021. ""I've put in so much hard work and I want to thank my family and friends, and my coach Steve Doig. ""I knew I had the speed in me at the end from my training. ""The timing has to be perfect and I went for it, and the world record means a lot. It's incredible."" Broom-Edwards already has Paralympic gold and silver medals to his name Broom-Edwards had first-time clearances at 1.80m and 1.89m - well below his season's best of 2.04m. He twice failed to clear 1.97m and opted to pass on his third effort before missing with his only attempt at 2m.  He admitted it was only two days before competition that his participation was confirmed. ""The surgeon said that I had a 1% chance of competing and I went into some dark places, but I made it here and I'm truly proud of what I've been able to achieve,"" he said. ""I'm a winner at heart because I made it - and against all odds. ""Monday was the first time I jumped over a bar off a short approach and I was able to do it, but it was uncomfortable.  ""On Wednesday, once we got out here, I did a full run-up session and then it was like 'it was OK, we'll see what we can do'.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxjn3w9228o,Cars plunge into river as super typhoon destroys Vietnam bridge,"Typhoon Yagi, the most powerful to hit Asia this year, kills 60 and destroys homes across north of country.",10 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:35:56.577105,China News,BBC,China,"A busy bridge in northern Vietnam collapsed after being hit by Super Typhoon Yagi, which has killed more than 60 people since making landfall on Saturday. Dashcam footage showed the moment the Phong Chau bridge in Phu Tho province gave way on Monday, plunging several vehicles into the water below. Searches were under way for 13 people.  Vietnam's most powerful storm in 30 years has wreaked havoc across the north of the country, leaving 1.5 million people without power. Although it has now weakened into a tropical depression, authorities have warned Yagi will create more disruption as it moves westwards. More than 240 people have been injured by the typhoon, which brought winds of up to 203 km/h (126 mph) and is Asia’s most powerful storm so far this year. Ten cars and two scooters fell into the Red River following the collapse of the Phong Chau bridge, Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc said. The moment a lorry plummeted into the water as the bridge decking ahead fell away before the driver had time to stop was captured on camera. At least three people have been rescued from the river so far. Nguyen Minh Hai said he was riding across the bridge on his motorcycle when it collapsed. ""I was so scared when I fell down,"" he said, speaking from hospital.  ""I feel like I’ve just escaped death. I can’t swim and I thought I would have died."" Part of the 375-m (1230-ft) structure is still standing, and the military has been instructed to build a pontoon bridge across the gap as soon as possible. At least 44 of those who died in Vietnam were killed in landslides and flash floods, according to the ministry of agriculture and rural development. Among them were a 68-year-old woman, a one-year-old boy, and a newborn baby. The typhoon tore roofs from buildings, uprooted trees, and left widespread damage to infrastructure and factories in the north. Photos by Reuters news agency show that the walls of an LG Electronics factory in Hai Phong city have collapsed. In the Yen Bai province, flood waters reached a metre high on Monday, with 2,400 families evacuated to higher ground as levels rose, AFP news agency reported. Nearly 50,000 people have been evacuated from coastal towns in Vietnam, with authorities issuing a warning to remain indoors. Schools were temporarily closed in 12 northern provinces, including Hanoi. Nguyen Thi Thom, who owns a restaurant in Ha Long Bay on the north-east coast, said she and many other people had lost everything in the storm.  ""There is nothing left. When I look around, people have also lost all they had, just like me,"" she said.  ""I can only try to recover from this."" Before hitting Vietnam, Yagi left 24 people dead across southern China and the Philippines. As the world warms, typhoons can bring higher wind speeds and more intense rainfall, although the influence of climate change on individual storms is complicated.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn024xe9gq5o,Crowded market shelled in Sudan killing more than 20,Dozens were wounded in the attack which a doctors' union is blaming on the paramilitary RSF.,9 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:03.341245,China News,BBC,China,"At least 21 people have been killed and more than 70 others wounded by shelling at a busy market in south-eastern Sudan, a doctors' union says. The Sudan Doctors Network said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were responsible for the attack in the city of Sennar on Sunday, condemning it as a ""massacre"" of civilians. It happened a day after Sudan's military rejected a proposal by UN experts to send in an international force to protect civilians. Thousands of people have been killed and more than 10 million have fled their homes since civil war broke out between the army and the RSF last April, making it one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. Several rounds of peace talks brokered by Saudi Arabia and the US have failed to end the conflict. The RSF controls most of the capital, Khartoum, much of Kordofan state and most of Darfur - where it is accused of using rape as a weapon of war, and targeting the Masalit people and other non-Arab communities in a campaign of ethnic cleansing. It has not succeeded in capturing Sennar city from the army. In June, it seized most of the wider state of Sennar, which analysts say is strategically important because of its position close to Ethiopia and South Sudan and its rich agricultural production. Both sides in Sudan's conflict - the army and the RSF - are accused of committing atrocities against civilians. ""Harrowing"" discoveries made by the UN in a fact-finding mission ""may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity"" by both sides, it said last week. This was angrily rebuked on Saturday by the foreign ministry which is loyal to army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. ""The Sudanese government rejects in their entirety the recommendations of the UN mission,"" it said, calling the UN Human Rights Council behind the fact-finding mission ""a political and illegal body"". The RSF has not commented. A UN arms embargo in Darfur has not stopped new weapons pouring into the hands of Sudan's warring parties, says Human Rights Watch. The campaign group says it has seen footage which appears to prove that fighters are using recently acquired armed drones, anti-tank guided missiles, truck-mounted rocket launchers and more - originating from China, Iran, Russia, Serbia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Sudan's ongoing power struggle, the army counts Egypt and Saudi Arabia among its supporters whereas the UAE is said to back the RSF - although it strongly denies this. Led by Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemedti"" Dagalo, the RSF emerged from the Janjaweed militia which was accused of genocide against non-Arab communities in Darfur in 2003. In recent months it has sought to boost its international profile and seek legitimacy as a political player by sending delegates to peace talks in Switzerland that were snubbed by the army.

Para-athlete Hannah Cockroft stormed to her ninth Paralympic title in a British one-two in the T34 800m. Para-canoers Emma Wiggs and Charlotte Henshaw also won golds, while cyclist Finlay Graham triumphed in the menâs C1-3 road race. There was also a gold in the pool for Stephen Clegg after a tightly-contested men's S12 100m butterfly final. Elsewhere, Alfie Hewett and Great Britain's men's wheelchair basketball team won silvers after agonising final defeats. Great Britain ended day 10 with a total of 120 medals at the Paralympics, including 47 golds. Only China, with 94 golds and 216 total medals, have more.  Hannah Cockroft has won nine Paralympic gold medals in her career Cockroft further cemented her reputation as one of the all-time Para-athletics greats, finishing almost eight seconds ahead of team-mate Kare Adenegan. The 31-year-old has won gold in the 100m and 800m at every Paralympics since London 2012, and took the 400m title at Rio 2016. Cockroft's latest title comes three weeks and five days before she is due to get married. ""[My fiance's] voice was the last one I heard,"" she told Channel 4 after her dominant win.  ""It means so much. He understands what goes into that performance. I'll go home, have an amazing wedding and have a great life.""

GB's Cockroft wins 800m for ninth Paralympic gold Emma Wiggs was emotional when receiving her gold medal on Saturday Four of Great Britain's 20 medals on Saturday came in Para-canoeing. First, defending champion Wiggs won the womenâs VL2 200m Va'a Single final by more than a second. Henshaw then doubled Britainâs Para-canoe gold tally winning the womenâs VL3 200m Va'a Single final ahead of fellow Briton Hope Gordon, who won silver. In the men's KL2 Single final, David Phillipson finished in second, meaning no nation claimed more Para-canoeing medals in Paris than GB.

As the pair approached the final kilometres, the 24-year-old Brit - who clinched C3 individual pursuit silver last week - made a late surge to win his second medal in Paris by less than a second. There was a similar close finish in the pool where world record holder Clegg was pushed all the way to the line and touched home first by just half a body length. The 100m backstroke champion dedicated his win to his mother Moira - who was celebrating her birthday, as well as her son's victory, on Saturday. There was a bronze for GB swimmer Alice Tai in the women's S8 100m butterfly final.

Great Britain's basketball team were also on the wrong end of a narrow final defeat. Hunting their first gold they trailed defending champions USA by 10 at the end of the third quarter. But they fought back to cut the deficit to just three with seconds to go. Ultimately though USA held out to win 73-69 and win a third consecutive Paralympics title.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3611zjjnd2o,"Who is suspect in Trump assassination attempt, Ryan Routh?",He appears to have mixed politics and a history of support for Ukraine - as well as a number of legal issues.,17 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:03.579581,China News,BBC,China,"The suspect in an apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump is a staunch supporter of Ukraine who was rejected by the country's armed forces and failed to make much of a contribution to the war effort. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, who appeared in court on Monday, is from North Carolina and spent most of his life there, but most recently lived in Hawaii. He voted for Trump in 2016 but later turned against him, and made statements of support and contributions to other politicians.  Here are some of the other things we know about him.  He is suspected of going to the Trump International Golf Course in Florida on Sunday, armed with an SKS-style rifle. The FBI recovered the weapon and scope, two backpacks and a GoPro camera from an area heavy with bush cover. Law enforcement allege that Routh fled the area when a Secret Service agent fired in his direction after spotting a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes.  He is not believed to have fired his own weapon during the incident, and is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point.  Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said two officers spotted Routh's vehicle, a black Nissan, and followed it for 45 minutes. Routh was stopped on Interstate 95, a major highway, and arrested. He has been initially charged with federal firearms offences. The affidavit states that Routh's phone was in the ""vicinity"" of the covered area for 12 hours. The car, a Nissan SUV, was later determined to have number plates which belonged to a 2012 Ford which had been reported as stolen.  BBC Verify found a number of social media profiles matching Routh's name. Routh repeatedly touted his work in encouraging foreign fighters to go to Ukraine to battle against Russia. However, most of his organising appears to have happened while he was in the US, not in Ukraine, where in 2022 he was rejected by the country's International Legion due to his lack of combat experience. The FBI is still investigating his links to Ukraine and has sent out multiple requests to companies for returns on his phone and social media accounts.  There are also pro-Palestinian, pro-Taiwan and anti-China messages on his profile, including allegations about Chinese ""biological warfare"" and references to the Covid-19 virus as an ""attack"". On an X post from 2020, Routh suggested he voted for Trump in 2016 but became disillusioned, writing: ""I will be glad when you [are] gone."" Routh also posted online urging President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris to meet victims of the attempt on Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. Routh was registered as an unaffiliated voter in North Carolina, but appears to have voted in the most recent Democratic primary in March, according to state records. In 2019 and 2020, he gave a number of small donations totalling around $140 (£106) to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising organisation, according to online federal elections records. An Associated Press photo of a truck outside Routh's Hawaii home displayed a Biden-Harris campaign sticker on the back. In the past Routh also backed candidates such as Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat who has since left the party and swung behind Trump, and also declared his support for former Republican presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley. Routh described himself as a ""volunteer co-ordinator"" and his ambitions to join combat were not realised. The International Legion told the BBC that Routh had ""never been part of, associated with, or linked"" with the legion ... in any capacity"". A volunteer for the legion described Routh to the BBC as a chaotic presence who kept trying to ""sneak around"" officials and was ""doing more harm than good"".  The volunteer said that Routh was in Ukraine in April 2022. ""He was not part of any unit and his activities were essentially causing chaos,"" the volunteer said. ""He was also trying to pose as some sort of official entity for all volunteers, which, again, he was not,"" she said. Routh told The New York Times in 2023 that he wanted to recruit Afghan soldiers who had fled the Taliban. One Facebook post from July of this year read: ""Soldiers, please do not call me. We are still trying to get Ukraine to accept Afghan soldiers and hope to have some answers in the coming months... please have patience."" In a book self-published in February 2023, Routh grumbled about how his efforts were received in Ukraine. ""I have yet to see... the smallest amount of appreciation or respect,"" he wrote. In the book, Routh said he spent five months in Ukraine and worked on various projects including a drone-building programme. He claims his efforts ended in failure or were shut down by the authorities. The book also contains a passage where he encourages Iranian officials, that they were ""free to assassinate Trump"". A conspiracy theory that claims Routh appeared in a promotional video for the investment company BlackRock - which manages $10 trillion in assets - has gone viral. One post that has more than three million views mentions the man who tried to kill Donald Trump at a rally in July and claims: “Ryan Routh also appeared in a Blackrock Commercial just like Thomas Crooks. That means both featured in Global Wealth management firm’s Commercial. These aren’t coincidences.” Crooks did appear briefly in BlackRock promotional video that profiled one of his teachers, but there is no evidence that Routh did. ""This is completely false,"" a BlackRock spokesperson said of the claim. ""Ryan Routh has never been an employee of BlackRock nor has he appeared in any BlackRock ads. The video circulating on social media has been manipulated to falsely link Routh to BlackRock."" The post featured a short video clip containing Routh, and claims it is from a Blackrock commercial. BBC Verify searched key frames from the video for previous versions online and confirmed that it comes from a political rally in Kyiv which was posted in May 2022. Visible in the video are several banners of the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian military unit. Routh supported Ukraine’s fight against Russia and was known to have visited the country in recent years. Records show Routh’s legal issues go back to the 1990s, including a variety of felonies and misdemeanours, including numerous charges for stolen goods. He was charged and convicted of numerous felony offences in Guilford County in North Carolina between 2002 and 2010, according to online records. In 2002, he was charged for possession of a fully automatic machine gun, which was referred to in court filings as a ""weapon of mass destruction"".  A local newspaper report from the time noted that he barricaded himself in a business and had a three-hour stand-off with police officers in the town of Greensboro before being taken into custody.  In another incident, records show him being charged with misdemeanours including a hit-and-run, resisting arrest, and a concealed weapons violation. His alleged offences also include driving with a revoked licence and possession of stolen property. In 2019, the FBI also received a tip that Routh was a felon in possession of a firearm. The unverified tip was passed on to local law enforcement in Honolulu. Former neighbour Kim Mungo describes Routh as a ""sweetheart"" and said federal agents once raided Routh's property. She alleged that he used to keep ""loads of stolen property and stuff"" at his home, and said she saw Routh and his family firing guns in the open. Routh's eldest son, Oran, described his father as ""a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man"". He told CNN: ""I don't know what's happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I've heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent."" Friends and family members are being sought for interviews by the FBI, including in North Carolina and Hawaii.  Routh appeared in front of a judge on Monday at the Palm Beach County court near Mar-a-Lago, charged with firearms offences.  The charges against him did not include any references to trying to kill Trump, though the FBI has said it is investigating Sunday's incident as an assassination attempt. Law enforcement stated after the court appearance that the suspect did not fire a weapon and did not have a line of sight on Trump. Secret Service and Homeland Security agents have searched Routh's former home in Greensboro, North Carolina. A hearing is scheduled for next Monday to determine whether he should remain in custody.  Prosecutors say he is a flight risk and a danger to the community."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c3d9gy81l42o,Harris produces 'one of best' Davis Cup debuts to clinch GB win,"Billy Harris produced one of the ""best Davis Cup debuts you'll have seen"" to ensure Britain's quest to reach the knockout stage started strongly - even without Jack Draper.",12 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:03.708415,China News,BBC,China,"Billy Harris celebrates his Davis Cup debut win Billy Harris produced ""one of the best Davis Cup debuts you'll have seen"" to ensure Great Britain's quest to reach the knockout stage started strongly - even without the rested Jack Draper. Late bloomer Harris, who used to drive to low-level tournaments in a van before earning his first ATP Tour win last year, clinched an opening victory against Finland in the group stage. The 29-year-old looked unflappable in a 6-4 7-6 (7-4) win over Otto Virtanen which gave the hosts an unbeatable 2-0 lead. US Open semi-finalist Draper celebrated from the sidelines, having sat out the tie following his exploits in New York. Harris' win came after Dan Evans, 34, won 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 against 703rd-ranked Eero Vasa to put Britain ahead in Manchester. ""I'm absolutely thrilled for Billy â I think that's one of the best debuts you'll have seen. It was that good,"" said British captain Leon Smith. ""If you look at Otto's record over the past couple of years in the Davis Cup it's pretty flawless. ""Billy actually could have won in a more straightforward manner â he was absolutely immense. Nothing really kind of fazes him, even though he's not really been on a big court before."" Draper left out of GB team for Davis Cup opener British number four Kartal reaches first WTA quarter-final Harris' display meant Smith's decision to give Draper, 22, more time to recover paid off, but he could return for the round-robin contests against Argentina and Canada later this week. Britain are aiming to finish in Group D's top two and reach the Davis Cup Finals last eight in Malaga this November. Evans and Neal Skupski could not complete a clean sweep as they fell to a 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 doubles defeat against Virtanen and Harri Heliovaara. Britain could be left to rue not winning the tie 3-0, with the competition's format meaning every match counts until the end. ""It feels disappointing because it is a long day and last year [at the same event] it almost came back to bite us, not getting that 3-0 on the first day,"" added Smith. ""But it is a positive day. At the start, when you don't have Jack and Cameron Norrie â your two highest ranked players - and end up winning a tie 2-1, you'd take that."" As the post-Andy Murray era begins, the British squad has a fresh look and new impetus. Former world top-10 player Norrie is missing through injury and Harris - joined as a rookie in Smith's squad by Wimbledon doubles champion Henry Patten - has been rewarded for his stunning rise over the past 18 months. The journey to the cusp of the world's top 100 has been long and arduous. Driving around Europe to play in lower-tier events, sleeping in his van while parked in McDonald's car parks, stood as testament to Harris' dedication. He was a hitting partner when Britain played in the Davis Cup Finals knockout stage in November - now he is playing a pivotal role in their quest. Asked where the victory ranked in his career, Harris said: ""I think making my debut for Great Britain and winning on my first cap probably tops it all so far. ""Three years ago I was probably ranked about 600 so I had no chance of getting near the team. ""But I've been improving each year since then and feel like I was ready to step into the team once I got called up."" This video can not be played Davis Cup: Best shots as Dan Evans wins opening match Evans, despite a difficult season where he has struggled for form and fitness, is a reassuring presence in this British team. He has dropped to outside the world's 150 in recent months but, in front of about 6,500 fans at Manchester Arena, demonstrated his value. Those watching would have been forgiven for thinking Evans would breeze past the unheralded Vasa, a regular on the bottom-rung Futures Tour. However, the 27-year-old Vasa surprised the crowd - if not Evans - by playing well above his ranking. ""It was a difficult match,"" he said. ""He played great at the start. I knew he would come out and play aggressive. ""I found it tough for a long time to get the ball-striking and I started to play better in the second and better at the end."" Evans is playing his 26th Davis Cup tie, moving him past the recently-retired Andy Murray into joint second on the list of most British appearances Having missed out on last year's Davis Cup Finals knockout stage, Spain got past the Czech Republic in Valencia in their quest to avoid the same fate in 2024. There was a brief scare for Carlos Alcaraz, who dropped the opening set of his match against Tomas Machac before recovering to level at 6-7 (3-7) 6-1. Machac, seemingly cramping, then retired in the opening game of set three. Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut had earlier defeated Jiri Lehecka 7-6 (7-1) 6-4. Italy beat Brazil in Bologna behind singles wins for Matteo Berrettini and Matteo Arnaldi. The United States fended off Chile 3-0 in Zhuhai, China, with third-set tie-break wins for Reilly Opelka, Brandon Nakashima and the doubles pairing of Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram. Canada also beat Argentina 2-1 in Manchester, Belgium overcame Netherlands in Bologna by the same score, Australia defeated France 2-1 in Valencia, and Germany sunk Slovakia 3-0 in Zhuhai.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy527yex0no,Putin welcomed in Mongolia despite ICC arrest warrant,The Russian leader's visit to the ICC-member state is seen as a show of defiance against the Hague.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:03.818928,China News,BBC,China,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Mongolia, his first visit to an International Criminal Court (ICC) member since it issued a warrant for his arrest last year. He was welcomed by Mongolia's leader at a lavish ceremony in the Asian nation's capital Ulaanbaatar on Tuesday. The Russian leader is wanted by the court for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. A spokesperson from the Kremlin said it was not concerned Mr Putin would be arrested during the visit. Soldiers on horseback lined the capital's Genghis Khan Square as martial anthems were played by a live band to welcome the Russian leader, who met with the Mongolian president Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh. A small group of protesters gathered at the square on Monday afternoon, holding a sign demanding ""Get War Criminal Putin out of here"". Another protest is planned for midday Tuesday at Ulaanbaatar's Monument for the Politically Repressed, which commemorates those who suffered under Mongolia's decades-long Soviet-backed communist regime. Other protestors were prevented from getting close to the Russian president on his arrival by security forces.  Ahead of his visit, Ukraine had urged Mongolia to arrest Mr Putin. ""We call on the Mongolian authorities to comply with the mandatory international arrest warrant and transfer Putin to the International Criminal Court in the Hague,"" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said on Telegram. The court alleged last year that the Russian president was responsible for war crimes, focusing on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.  It has also issued a warrant for the arrest of Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, for the same crimes. It alleges the crimes were committed in Ukraine from 24 February 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Moscow has previously denied the allegations and said the  warrants were ""outrageous"". ICC members are expected to detain suspects if an arrest warrant has been issued, but there is no enforcement mechanism. The Hague-based court last week said members had ""an obligation"" to take action. Mongolia has not publicly responded to Ukraine or the ICC's call.  The former Soviet satellite state has maintained friendly relations with Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It has not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and declined to vote on the conflict at the United Nations. The landlocked country, which also borders China, also relies on Russia for gas and electricity. Russia has been in talks for years about building a pipeline to carry 50 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas a year from its Yamal region to China via Mongolia. The project, known as Power of Siberia 2, is part of a strategy to compensate for the drop in gas sales in Europe, following widespread boycott of Russian resources due to the invasion of Ukraine. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c207958pp9qo,Venezuelan forces surround embassy sheltering opposition figures,The Argentine embassy is sheltering six political figures opposed to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.,8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:03.943347,China News,BBC,China,"Venezuelan security forces have surrounded the Argentine embassy in the capital Caracas, which is sheltering six Venezuelan political figures opposed to President Nicolás Maduro. Members of the Venezuelan opposition posted images and videos of officers from the country’s intelligence service forming a perimeter around the embassy complex. Opposition figures inside the building said they were under ""siege"" by Mr Maduro's regime. The embassy, as well as Argentine interests in Venezuela, have been represented by Brazil since diplomatic relations between Argentina and Venezuela broke down over the summer due to the outcome of Venezuela's presidential election. On Saturday, the Venezuelan government revoked Brazil's custody of the embassy, it said, in an apparent attempt to remove its diplomatic protection. Argentina is among several countries to have disputed the official results of the presidential election, which gave Mr Maduro a third term. Others have called on the Venezuelan government to publish voting data, while allies of Mr Maduro - including Russia and China - have recognised his victory. Voting tallies published by the Venezuelan opposition indicate its candidate, Edmundo González, won - but western nations have stopped short of recognising him as the president-elect. The latest actions by the Venezuelan government come after the Argentine foreign ministry said it would ask the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Mr Maduro and other senior officials. Pedro Urruchurtu Noselli, an adviser to opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has been at the embassy since March, wrote on X that as of Saturday morning, there was ""an increasing presence of hooded officials. ""They have closed off vehicular traffic on the street. We are still without electricity."" Meanwhile Omar Gonzalez Moreno, another opposition official, said that the embassy had been without electricity since Friday evening. ""The siege and threat of attack on the Argentine diplomatic headquarters in Caracas, represented by Brazil, by security agents of the Maduro regime continues,"" he added. The Venezuelan government said it had been forced to take action after it supposedly uncovered ""evidence of the use of the facilities... for the planning of terrorist activities and assassination attempts"" against Mr Maduro and his deputy. Brazil said in a subsequent statement that it would continue to represent Argentina's interests in Venezuela until another government was selected to fulfil the role. It emphasised ""the inviolability of the facilities of the Argentine diplomatic mission"". The Argentine foreign affairs ministry said in its own statement: ""Any attempt to interfere or kidnap asylum seekers staying in our official residence will be harshly condemned by the international community.  ""Actions such as these reinforce the belief that fundamental human rights are not respected in Maduro's Venezuela."" The foreign ministry of Chile criticised Venezuela for what it described as acting ""without justification"", adding the move showed ""serious disregard"" for international convention on diplomatic premises. Venezuela's decision has also attracted condemnation from Paraguay and Uruguay."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gv0rvx0dvo,New beanless 'coffee' emerges but does it taste any good?,Start-ups launch drinks that look and taste like coffee but they say are better for the environment.,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:04.060187,China News,BBC,China,"I am in a high-end coffee shop in a tech-heavy area of San Francisco, staring suspiciously into a cup of espresso. This is no conventional coffee: it is made without using a single coffee bean. It comes from Atomo, one of a band of alt-coffee start-ups hoping to revolutionise the world of brewed coffee. “We take great offence when someone says that we're a coffee substitute,” says Andy Kleitsch, the chief executive of Seattle based start-up Atomo, from whose pure, beanless ground product my espresso has been made. Traditional coffee substitutes have a reputation for not tasting much like coffee and are usually caffeine-free. However, the newcomers intend to replicate one of the world’s most popular beverages from taste, to caffeine punch, to drinking experience – and the first of this nascent industry’s beanless concoctions have begun to appear. They say there's a strong environmental argument for their beanless brews. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, coffee cultivation is currently the sixth largest cause of deforestation. That impact is expected to widen as demand increases: consumption is fast rising in traditional tea drinking countries like India and China. Meanwhile, climate change is pushing plantations to higher altitudes to escape the heat. So, beanless coffee is potentially a less environmentally damaging alternative. The newcomers also argue that, if scaled up, beanless coffee could be cheaper than its conventional competition. And, with coffee prices reaching record levels on the international markets this year, that point is timely.  Also, in December, a new EU regulation is set to come into effect that outlaws the sale of products, coffee included, that can’t prove they are not linked to deforestation. “A lot of big coffee companies are watching this field,” says Chahan Yeretzian, a professor of analytical chemistry, who heads the Coffee Excellence Centre at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. Niels Haak, director of sustainable coffee partnerships at Conservation International, an environmental non-profit, welcomes the innovative approaches to tackling coffee’s deforestation problem, but he also doubts if beanless coffee will be able to make much dent. Coffee growing provides livelihoods and income to many smallholder farming families globally, he further notes. The conundrum is if they move away from growing coffee, they will turn to alternative crops or land uses. In some countries there is even a risk they turn to illicit activities such as growing coca – the plant cocaine derives from – which has similar deforestation issues. “There are no silver bullets,” he says. He notes there is work ongoing – from coffee certification schemes, to efforts aimed at strengthening so-called shade coffee farming where coffee is grown under a canopy of other trees – to make coffee growing more sustainable and support communities. “[The coffee sector] is on a journey to transform,” he says. Yet the beanless companies counter that transformation isn’t wide enough or quick enough. Coffee is causing massive deforestation and coffee farmers live in poverty. If alt-coffee could offset even just the extra projected coffee demand it would be a win for the planet that wouldn’t put anyone out of business. And, as the climate changes, there are plenty of crops beyond illicit ones that coffee farmers could switch to that don’t require slashing more forest. Atomo, which launched in 2019, is currently sold in more than 70 coffee shops in the US. Coffee shop chain Bluestone Lane added it to the menu at all its locations in early August, including in San Francisco. Since June, Atomo has also been selling through its website a blend of beanless and conventional coffee intended for home brewing that I have also purchased to try. It currently costs slightly more than premium conventional coffee. For example, to make my espresso with Atomo adds on 50 cents (38p). Atomo’s ingredients aren’t particularly high tech: date seeds, ramón seeds, sunflower seed extract, fructose, pea protein, millet, lemon, guava, fenugreek seeds, caffeine and baking soda. Things begin with waste date seeds or pits. Rock hard, they are granulated then infused with a secret marinade of ingredients from the list above, before being roasted to create new flavours, aromas and compounds. Further ingredients then finish things off. Atomo’s caffeine is sourced from green tea decaffeination, though synthetically-made caffeine is also used to provide beanless coffee’s kick. Atomo operates a facility in southern California, where the date pits are cleaned and washed, and a second facility in Seattle where the manufacturing takes place. Current capacity is four million pounds a year, which Mr Kleitsch describes as a “rounding error” in the world of coffee production: Starbucks buys about 800 million. As for trying Atomo, both the coffee shop espresso and the brew-at-home version tasted close enough to good coffee for me. Perhaps luckily for these companies, coffee can have many different undertones. Others have different ingredients and methods. Over the past year the bean-free coffee products of Dutch start-up Northern Wonder, founded in 2021, has secured space on supermarket shelves in the Netherlands and Switzerland. Roasted and ground lupin, chickpea, malted barley, and chicory are amongst the major ingredients the company works with, along with an undisclosed natural flavouring. Though notes David Klingen, the company’s boss, operations are still in the research and development phase. Ingredients may change as it perfects its brew. Other companies on the scene include Singapore-based Prefer and San Francisco's Minus. And, though it is further from market, also being pursued is the tantalising possibility of lab-grown or cultured coffee. In the same way animal cells can be cultivated in a bioreactor and harvested to produce meat cell products – so cells extracted from coffee plants could be similarly grown, then fermented and roasted to produce a brew. Proof of concept was demonstrated in 2021 by Finnish government researchers, who are now trying to help accelerate commercialisation. Cell-based coffee start-ups include Swiss-based Foodbrewer, US-based California Cultured, and Singapore-based Another. The approach may provide a closer match to coffee than surrogates like Atomo or Northern Wonder, but regulatory approval for such novel food takes time and money. There are also doubts the technology will be able to scale economically. Meanwhile, challenges for the beanless firms remain. The house-filling aroma that real coffee generates is still elusive for them. And bean-free coffee doesn’t provide emotional connections to faraway places – Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia – the way real coffee can. Atomo’s main business hurdle now is finding large coffee partners who want to offer their consumers a new choice, while Northern Wonder’s is finding the right investors. “People aren’t completely sure how big the category will be and when,” says Mr Klingen. I don’t think I’ll be switching – I can’t help but like that real coffee is grown by people somewhere – but beanless coffee certainly left me thinking I should investigate the sustainability and ethics of my conventional brew."

The Great Britain trio of Larne woman Taggart, Kayleigh Haggo and David Smith fought back from 4-0 down to be on the brink of victory at 7-5 only for the Indonesians to level at 7-7 to force the tie-break, which they won 2-0. Taggart's defeat came shortly before Antrim woman Katie Morrow's hopes of a wheelchair basketball team medal was dashed by Great Britain's 59-52 quarter-finals defeat by USA. A devastated Taggart blamed herself for not closing out the boccia team quarter-final in the sixth end as instead the Indonesians took the match into sudden death before clinching victory.  ""It was kind of on me to seal the game, finish the game off and obviously I didnât do that so obviously Iâm beyond gutted that Iâve let these guys down so badly,"" said the 29-year-old county Antrim woman as she spoke alongside Haggo and Smith. ""They are shaking their heads but they know Iâm really disappointed in myself and disappointed that Iâve let them down."" An emotional Taggart paid particular tribute to Haggo, who only took up the sport ""only two years ago"".  Smith said the increasing strength of teams such as Indonesia, China and Korea is only making achieving success ""harder and harder"" and appealed for ""greater investment in boccia at UK level"". ""More leagues, more clubsâ¦.people playing at a local level to challenge us to push us to give us opportunities to play at home. We have to travel all around the world just to get some decent team games,"" said Smith.  ""If we had some fun, enjoyable matches at home that we could get our teeth into, play with other players, play with able-bodied people, it would make it a lot easier when you are coming here and trying to figure it out."" After trailing 4-0 following the opening two ends, Great Britain reduced the margin to 4-3 and while Indonesia then edged 5-3 ahead, Taggart and her team-mates secured a 4-0 win in end five to move 7-5 up. But Indonesia, who included Gischa Zayana who beat Taggart in the bronze medal match in the individual competition, ensured the tie-break by winning end six 2-0, before clinching victory by a similar margin. The Great Britain trio had progressed to the quarter-finals by edging out Portugal 5-4 on Tuesday night after a 13-1 defeat against China in their earlier group match. Taggart, 29, was competing in her third Paralympics following her appearances at the Rio and Tokyo Games.  The Larne woman has won World Championship and European Championship medals in addition to triumphs at World Cup level but has never secured a Paralympics medal.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw3gdxed60o,Russian hypersonic scientist jailed for treason,He is the latest expert on technology that could be used to make modern missiles to be jailed.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:12.987567,China News,BBC,China,"A Russian scientist who worked on hypersonic technology has been jailed for 15 years after being accused of treason, according to state media. Alexander Shiplyuk is the latest in a string of experts linked to research that could be applied to next-generation missiles to have been arrested in recent years. The Russian news agency Tass reported he was accused of passing state secrets related to hypersonic technology to a foreign power, which the scientist denied. Mr Shiplyuk was detained at a high-security penal colony following a trial held behind closed doors. When he was arrested in August 2022, Tass described Mr Shiplyuk as a leading expert in his field and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The 57-year-old was director of the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the Siberian branch of the academy, and has published papers on hypersonic flight. Hypersonic missiles can reach speeds of at least five times the speed of sound and can change direction during flight, making them potentially far more difficult for air defences to stop. A dozen Russian scientists with some connection to hypersonic technology, or to institutions known to have worked on it, have been arrested since 2015 and charged with high treason. Few details have been released from Mr Shiplyuk's secretive trial, but Reuters reported last year that he was accused of passing secrets to China.  He pleaded not guilty to the charges, BBC Russian reported. His son Mikhail Shiplyuk told the BBC: ""He and his lawyer fought to the last."" He described his father as ""a man who loves his work, in general, who gave his life to it"". Most of the scientists arrested by Russian intelligence in recent years are elderly and three have since died, including one who was suffering from cancer. He died shortly after being arrested in his hospital bed. Last year, Mr Shiplyuk’s institute - which employed three of those arrested - published a since-deleted open letter defending its staff, and suggested their detention was the result of normal scientific activities, like presenting at international conferences and publishing articles in journals. President Vladimir Putin has publicly lauded Russia's progress at developing hypersonic missiles, and described one model as an ""ideal weapon"". However, some analysts argue their efficacy is overstated. Russia says it has used two types of hypersonic missiles as part of its invasion of Ukraine, which would mark the first time they have been deployed in combat -though Kyiv has claimed to have shot some down. In 2022, the US, UK and Australia announced they were co-operating on research on how to defend against the modern missile models."

Ms Hasina’s dramatic ouster on 5 August followed weeks of student-led protests which spiralled into deadly, nationwide unrest. She was initially expected to stay in India for just a short period, but reports say her attempts to seek asylum in the UK, the US and the UAE have not been successful so far.  Her continued presence in India has generated challenges for Delhi in developing a strong relationship with the new interim government in Dhaka.  For India, Bangladesh is not just any neighbouring country. It's a strategic partner and a close ally crucial to India's border security, particularly in the north-eastern states.  The two countries share a porous border 4,096km (2,545 miles) long which makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India’s north-eastern states to cross into Bangladesh for a safe haven.  After Ms Hasina's Awami League party came to power in 2009, it cracked down on some of these ethnic militant groups. Ms Hasina also amicably settled several border disputes with India.   While border security is at the core of the relationship, there are financial aspects too. During Ms Hasina's 15-year rule, trade relations and connectivity between the two countries flourished. India has gained road, river and train access via Bangladesh to transport goods to its north-eastern states.  Since 2010, India has also given more than $7bn (£5.3bn) as a line of credit to Bangladesh for infrastructure and development projects.  Ms Hasina’s sudden exit means that Delhi has to work hard to ensure that these gains are not lost.  “It’s a setback in the sense that any turbulence in our neighbourhood is always unwanted,” says Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, a former Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka.  But the former diplomat insists that Delhi will work with the interim government in Dhaka because “there is no choice” and “you can’t dictate what they do internally”.  The Indian government has wasted no time in reaching out to the interim government in Dhaka, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi holding a telephone conversation with leader Muhammad Yunus. However, it will take a while for Delhi to assuage the anger in Bangladesh over its unwavering support for Ms Hasina and her Awami League for the last 15 years.   Many Bangladeshis attribute the anger against India to Delhi's swift endorsement of three controversial elections won by Ms Hasina's party amid allegations of widespread vote-rigging.  With Ms Hasina’s fall, Delhi’s “neighbourhood first” policy has taken another jolt with Bangladesh joining the Maldives and Nepal in resisting any attempt at dominance by India.  Analysts say that Delhi can’t afford to lose its influence in another neighbouring country if it wants to protect its status as a regional powerhouse - especially as rival China is also jostling for influence in the region.  Just last year, Mohamed Muizzu won the presidency in the Maldives on the back of his very public anti-India stand.  “It’s time for India to do some introspection regarding its regional policy,” says Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka.  Delhi needs to look at whether it has adequately taken on board the perspectives of its regional partners, he says.  “I am not only talking about Bangladesh, [but also] almost all other countries in the region,"" adds Mr Bhattacharya, who heads a committee appointed by the interim government to prepare a white paper on the state of Bangladesh’s economy. For example, in the case of Bangladesh, analysts point out that successive Indian governments have failed to engage with other opposition parties, particularly the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).  “India somehow thought that the Awami League and its government are the only allies inside Bangladesh. That was a strategic blunder,” says Abdul Moyeen Khan, a senior leader of the BNP.   If free and fair elections are held in Bangladesh in the coming months, BNP leaders are confident of victory.  That will pose a diplomatic challenge for Delhi. There is a perceived trust deficit between India and the BNP, which is led by Begum Khaleda Zia, who had been prime minister for two terms earlier.  Ms Zia, who spent most of her time in jail since 2018, has always denied corruption charges against her and has accused Ms Hasina of political vendetta. She has now been released from jail and is recovering from her illness.   In the coming days, Delhi and the BNP leaders will have to find a way to work past their differences. During the previous BNP-led coalition government from 2001 to 2006, the bilateral relationship deteriorated with Delhi accusing Dhaka of harbouring insurgents from India’s north-east. During Ms Zia's rule, Hindu leaders in Bangladesh said there were a series of attacks against them - including murder, looting and rape - by Islamist parties and the BNP which began as the election results were announced in 2001.  The BNP denies the charges of giving shelter to anti-Indian insurgents and also of carrying out attacks on minority Hindus in 2001. BNP leaders, including Mr Khan, say India hasn't been forthcoming in engaging with them, adding that ""now it’s time for a policy shift on the part of Delhi”.  He also stresses that given India’s proximity, population, geographical size and its growing economic and military might, a party like the BNP cannot afford to make the mistake of harbouring any anti-Indian insurgents within Bangladesh. There are other factors also behind the anger against India. India and Bangladesh share 54 rivers and the sharing of water resources is a contentious issue. The recent floods triggered by heavy rains in eastern Bangladesh are an example of how misinformation can fuel suspicions between the two countries.  Following a sudden heavy downpour in the Indian state of Tripura, the excess water flowed into the Gumti river - which flows between the two countries - inundating vast areas inside the state as well as downstream in neighbouring Bangladesh.   Millions of people were affected with many losing their houses, belongings and farmland. Many villagers and social media users accused India of deliberately releasing water from a dam in the night, leading to the floods.  The Indian external affairs ministry was forced to issue a statement denying this, explaining that the floods had been caused by heavy rains in the catchment areas of the Gumti river.  Then there is another factor - China. Beijing is keen to extend its footprint in Bangladesh as it battles for regional supremacy with India.  It rolled out the red carpet for Mr Muizzu when he chose China for his first state visit after winning the Maldives election. Delhi would want to avoid the same fate with Bangladesh. And it would hope that Bangladesh’s reliance on Indian goods and trade will buy it some time to work out its diplomatic strategy and change its image.  So Delhi will have to tread carefully around Ms Hasina’s presence in India, especially if the new government makes a formal extradition request. A statement issued on her behalf by her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy last month had already stoked anger in Bangladesh.  But India wouldn’t want to ask Ms Hasina to leave the country when her future remains uncertain and come across as leaving a formidable former ally in the lurch.  “It doesn’t matter how she is accorded hospitality in India. But it matters to Bangladeshis how she intervenes in the domestic matters staying over there. If she speaks against the current interim government, that would be considered as an act of hostility,” Mr Bhattacharya warned.   Diplomats in Delhi will hope that Ms Hasina makes a choice for herself without forcing India’s hand."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlv0enpeno,‘I grieve for the person I was before' - Covid inquiry to begin new phase,"The Covid inquiry opens its next set of hearings on Monday, looking at the impact on healthcare and the NHS.",9 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:13.209874,China News,BBC,China,"The public inquiry into the pandemic will start 10 weeks of hearings on Monday looking at the impact on patients, healthcare workers and the wider NHS.  Covid patients have been admitted to hospital more than a million times in the UK since the virus emerged in 2020, while countless others have had care for other conditions disrupted.  The third stage of the inquiry will also examine the impact on NHS staff, the use of masks and PPE in hospitals, the policy of shielding the most vulnerable and the treatment of long Covid.  And for the first time, the stories of more than 30,000 healthcare staff, patients and relatives will form part of the material entered into evidence. BBC News has spoken to some of them.  “It was absolutely horrendous. We were really struggling, having to scrounge around for masks and gloves,“ says Mandi Masters, a community midwife from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. At that early stage the NHS was, she says, “working in the dark” as the virus spread from China to Italy and then to the UK. Mandi later caught Covid herself – she is convinced at work – and ended up in hospital on oxygen for three weeks. “My husband took me to A&E but had to leave me there, turn around and walk away,” she says. “The news was coming out on how many health professionals were dying of Covid, but I was just too poorly to care at that point,” she says. “Looking back, I have to admit, it was extremely frightening.” Mandi, 62, has now returned to work part-time, but still struggles to catch her breath after a short walk. Every cold or chest infection “wipes her out” and she “grieves for the person I was before Covid”. The third section of the Covid public inquiry will look in detail at the effect on healthcare workers. It will also cover: It has to examine the impact on the wider healthcare system, including the sharp increase in delays and waiting lists triggered by the pandemic. Lynda Ross, from Portadown, was booked in for spinal surgery in early 2020. Her operation was cancelled and, by the time she could see her specialist again, she was told it was too late for treatment. “The consequence of that is I have to live my life in a level of pain that has me on the same medication as someone who is dying from cancer.” she says. ""It feels like the rest of my life has been destroyed."" More than 50 witnesses are expected to give evidence over the next 10 weeks, including scientists, medical experts, healthcare workers and politicians. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, which represents more than 7,000 relatives, says it is “deeply worried” that only two of the 23 witnesses it has put forward have been called to appear. “Without our input, the inquiry risks repeating the mistakes that played out during the pandemic by failing to take into consideration the lived experience of ordinary families,” said its spokesperson Rivka Gottlieb. The inquiry says it does allow members of the public to contribute online to its Every Story Matters project, and has run 20 different face-to-face events so far in town centres across the UK. The stories of more than 30,000 healthcare workers, patients and relatives have been collated into a 200-page written record that will be entered into evidence on Monday. The inquiry’s secretary, Ben Connah, said the document could not replace one-to-one testimony, but did allow a large number of people to contribute anonymously - ""some of whom wouldn’t want to give formal evidence in a frankly scary courtroom"". The public inquiry, likely to be one of the most expensive in legal history, has been split into nine different sections, each of which will hear from witnesses and report findings separately. Baroness Hallett, who is chairing the inquiry, has already taken evidence on pandemic planning and political decision-making, with future sections expected on the vaccine rollout, the care sector, test and trace, the impact on children, and the economy."

The Daily Mail uses her phrase ""out of darkness, can come light"" as its main headline, and describes the video announcing the end of her chemotherapy as ""deeply personal"".   The Times calls it ""slick"" and ""one for the Instagram generation"" - but it concludes there is ""nothing confected"" about the emotion.  ""Kate"", it says, ""is at her most private and most genuine.""   The Sun describes the film as ""the most intimate look at Royal life ever"". The other main issue for the papers is the looming Commons vote on winter fuel payments.  The Guardian says the prime minister is ""defiant"" on the issue and that the chancellor ""faced down"" would-be rebels when she addressed them last night. Rachel Reeves has written an article for the Daily Telegraph in which she says pensioners are on course for a £1,700 boost by the time of the next election.  She says she has refused to ""duck difficult decisions"".   The Times still predicts a revolt by ""dozens"" of Labour MPs.  It quotes one cabinet minister saying the row is already a “massive issue” on the doorstep, and that the government is “at risk of ignoring the danger”. The Daily Telegraph says the victims' commissioner for London is warning that some people are not being told their attackers are being freed early from jail, as part of the scheme to tackle overcrowding.  In an article for the paper, Claire Waxman says it could be a ""horrible shock"" for victims.  The Daily Express quotes experts who say that criminals who are let out will probably reoffend within days.  An editorial in the Daily Mail warns freeing prisoners early poses an unacceptable risk to the public. It says Sir Keir Starmer portrays himself as ""a one-man crime-fighting machine"", because of his background as a prosecutor - but that this move suggests ""the pendulum has swung too far in favour of the criminals, and away from the victims"". The evidence heard yesterday at the Covid Inquiry offers a reminder of NHS workers’ incredible dedication during the pandemic, according to the Daily Mirror. The latest phase of the hearings focuses on the impact on the health service - as well as questions about how it coped. The paper argues the commitment of nurses and doctors is too often taken for granted. ""If we value our NHS,"" says its editorial, ""we should also value the heroes who work in it."" The Guardian is one of several papers to report on a rise in sales of ""retro"" crisps. ""Forget black truffle or sea salt"", it says - Frazzles and Nik Naks are having a revival. Sales of bacon Frazzles are up 48% since last year, while Skips are up by 47%. The Daily Telegraph says social media videos appear to have driven the surge in interest, as ""taste tests"" earn hundreds of thousands of views.  The Daily Star seeks out a pun for its report on the trend. ""Retro crisps are making a triumphant comeback"" it says, ""and the firms are making a packet!"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crkm3kkm640o,What will be the legacy of an 'amazing' Paralympics?,"Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson assesses how Paris did as hosts of the Paralympics, the GB performance and what we can expect at Los Angeles in 2028.",8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:13.460922,China News,BBC,China,"Swimmer Poppy Maskill won three golds and two silvers at La Defense Arena Baroness Grey-Thompson, who won 11 Paralympic gold medals for Great Britain and competed at every summer Games from 1988 to 2004, was part of the Radio 5 Live team in Paris. The Paralympics in Paris have been amazing with packed stadiums, intense competition, great performances and the event has shown the world what sport can do. There have been the highs and lows you expect, tears of happiness and of disappointment - what more would you want from a sporting event? But it is hard not to think, as we leave here, about what the legacy of the Games is going to be. Legacy is a word that was imposed on Barcelona long after the 1992 event, when it had eventually figured out how to use the expensive venues they built for the Games. Many of the cites that have followed since then have struggled. London had to be mindful, not only of the public nature of the costs and the desire to not have white elephants, but of the promises that were made to inspire a generation. Paris took that further in terms of sustainability. They used many existing venues and then put a Paralympic overlay on top but that meant that there were lots of steps, platform lifts, not always decent viewing platforms and a frequent sense of frustration that while disabled people were competing, it wasnât always so easy for disabled people to come along and watch. Public transport has been another issue, as it always will be in an old city like Paris. Buses have been overhauled to make them accessible, which is a start, but the Metro system is not and the head of the Paris transport network said before the Games that it remained a weak spot for disabled travellers so it will be interesting to see what happens after the Games. I didnât try the transport, partly because I didnât need to, and being in the fortunate position of being media-accredited gives you access to venues that spectators donât get. We were driven around the city in the dedicated Games lanes, and went from the underground car parks to the venues with little difficulty but I know the day-to-day experience outside Games time will be significantly different. Having visited Paris a number of times before, the biggest change I have noticed is the attitude towards disabled people. People are generally more helpful and for getting around there are more things like dropped curbs, although the cobblestones, of which there are lots, are a challenge for a wheelchair user. The medal table is binary. The medal target set by UK Sport was 100-140 and that was achieved with two days of competition still to go, but there will be lots of debate in the coming weeks about what does success look like and each sport will be under review for the next cycle. The number of golds, silvers and bronzes and near misses will be analysed.  ParalympicsGB is also proud of the breadth of the performances but there will be some things outside its control for Los Angeles 2028, such as what other countries are doing and how they are being funded. The British swimmers were phenomenal and their multi-medallists like Poppy Maskill, Alice Tai and William Ellard have been superb, as were the cyclists with Sarah Storey again winning medals, as she was doing when we were on the GB team together. Sarah Storey continued her record of winning a medal at every Games since her debut in Barcelona in 1992 However, the athletics team has probably not performed how they would like with six golds and 18 medals overall, their lowest total since Beijing in 2008, and it shows how quickly the world can move on in some disciplines. France, once a powerhouse of athletics, only won five medals in track and field and no golds. Had they won, it would have made a difference to the atmosphere in the Stade de France although it was still electric whenever a home athlete competed. ParalympicsGB is not in a position to challenge China for top spot, but were pretty secure in second place in the face of some strong competition from the United States. But with these Games barely over, every sport will now be looking at where is the next set of âtalentâ going to come from â whether it is from talent transfers from other sports, improving the existing talent pool or finding new athletes. While everyone was excited about Paris, the next Games in LA 2028 were at the back of many minds. Broadcasters NBC were out here in force and it will be interesting to see how the coverage of the Games has gone down in the USA. Unfortunately they didnât have Snoop Dogg here like they did for the Olympics. Maybe they needed to pay him more to come here â it would have been really cool to have him here! In terms of competition, I think the US Paralympic Committee could learn from what GB have achieved here and in Tokyo and work on having a wider spread of medals across sports, because they have huge potential. They also need to get their athletes known and for Americans to care about them. We now have a Paralympic champion in Hunter Woodhall married to an Olympic champion in Tara Davis-Woodhall and they could do things to really put Para-sport on the map. Overall, the Games have been incredible and perhaps the sports legacy for France will come in 2028, but it does feel like we are leaving a city that will have embraced the Games and perhaps will think a little differently about disability, and a Paralympic movement which has taken another step forward.

GB won six golds among 16 medals on Friday as they reached their Games target of 100-140 medals, set by UK Sport, with two days of competition still to come. Hewett, who will aim to complete a career Golden Slam in the singles on Saturday, and team-mate Reid beat Japan's Tokito Oda and Takuya Miki at Roland Garros. Sarah Storey, 46, won the women's C4-5 road race to claim her 19th career Paralympic gold before Sophie Unwin, 30, won her fourth medal of the Games in the B womenâs road race, alongside pilot Jenny Holl. Poppy Maskill, 19, claimed her third gold in the pool by winning the women's S14 100m backstroke, wheelchair fencer Dimitri Coutya clinched the men's epee B title, and in the Para-athletics Ben Sandilands won men's T20 1500m gold. Great Britain won 41 golds among 124 medals in Tokyo, and it is that overall total which they will now target over the closing weekend in the French capital - beginning with an action-packed Saturday featuring 75 gold medal events. Great Britain (42 golds, 100 medals) are second in the medal table behind China (83 golds, 188 medals), with the United States third (31 golds, 86 medals) Elsewhere on Friday, Para-table tennis players Robert Davies (menâs MS1)and Will Bayley (menâs MS7) both won silver medals, as did wheelchair fencer Piers Gilliver in the men's epee A category. At the Stade de France, Marcus Perrineau-Daley won silver in the menâs T52 100m final. There was silver for GB's 4x100m universal relay quartet of Zac Shaw, Ali Smith, Jonnie Peacock and Samantha Kinghorn, while Hollie Arnold took bronze in the women's F46 javelin. There were bronze medals for swimmers Maisie Summers-Newton (women's S6 400m freestyle), Mark Tompsett (men's S14 100m backstroke) and Olivia Newman-Baronius (women's S14 100m), with cyclists Lora Fachie and pilot Corrine Hall also making the podium in the women's B road race. Paralympic gold 'stuff of dreams' for Hewett & Reid Magnificent Maskill wins third gold in Paris Coutya wins second Paris gold as GB beat Tokyo tally Rio 2016 singles champion Gordon Reid (right) won his fifth Paralympic medal Hewett and Reid lost the gold medal match at both the Rio and Tokyo Paralympics, but they finally have the one prize which had evaded them. After a competitive opening set, the Britons - who have won 21 Grand Slam titles together in doubles, including all three played this year - raced through the second to seal a 6-2 6-1 victory. The joy and relief was evident as they celebrated together, although Hewett's attention must now turn to ending his wait for singles success against Oda, eight years after losing to Reid in the Rio final. ""We felt confident going into this week but there is always a doubt because of those two losses at the Paralympics. We've just squashed that and played our brand of tennis. Thankfully, this time, we're not crying on each other's shoulders,"" said Hewett. ""We've wanted this title for a very long time. We've been on such a journey to get here. It's hard to put in words the last few months, it's the stuff of dreams."" Reid added: ""We finally did it, it's ours. It feels amazing. We've been desperate this for a long time, we've come close twice and felt that heartbreak and pain.  ""Those matches have been some of the toughest moments of my career so sit here with the gold around our necks is one of the best feelings."" Poppy Maskill was ""a little bit annoyed"" at not winning in a faster time Maskill's outstanding Games debut reached new heights on Friday as the British teenager won her third gold - the most of any ParalympicsGB athlete in Paris. A seven-time World Championship medallist, the S14 100m backstroke title was Maskill's fifth medal of the Games following golds in the 100m S14 butterfly and the mixed 4x100m S14 freestyle relay, plus silvers in the 200m freestyle S14 and the 200m individual medley S14. Maskill trailed Valeriia Shabalina at halfway but fought back to win in a time of one minute 5.74 seconds, as fellow Briton Newman-Baronius took bronze. ""I'm obviously happy with my medals as they are a great achievement but I'm slightly disappointed in my time because I know I can be better,"" Maskill said. ""It's really cool to have five medals and the most of any ParalympicsGB athlete so far here [now level with Sammi Kinghorn]. It feels great."" Great Britain have won 30 medals in the pool before the last day of action at La Defense Arena - their highest in any sport in Paris. The first of Storey's 30 Paralympic medals came in 1992 in Para-swimming Two days after winning her 18th Paralympic gold medal in the womenâs C5 time trial, Storey extended her British record haul to 19 in the road race. With just one kilometre to go, Storey appeared destined for silver but fought back to deny France's Heidi Gaugain - 27 years the Briton's junior - by less than a second to claim a remarkable 30th career Paralympic medal.  Asked whether she could continue until the Los Angeles 2028 Games, Storey, only the fourth Paralympian to reach 19 gold medals, said: ""Who knows. I need to enjoy this first. Never say never to anything.  ""This just needs to sink in because it was one of the most exciting races that we've had and from the word go it was full gas."" Unwin and Holl claimed their second gold in five days during the womenâs B road race, beating Irelandâs Katie-George Dunlevy and pilot Linda Kelly in a sprint finish. The winning margin was three seconds, while British team-mates Fachie and Hall finished 95 seconds later for bronze. Dimitri Coutya is competing at his third Paralympics Coutya had the honour of winning his nation's 42nd gold medal in Paris to take ParalympicsGB beyond their total of 41 in Tokyo. The 26-year-old won his second wheelchair fencing gold - and third medal - of the Games in the men's epee B category at the Grand Palais, defeating Thailand's Visit Kingmanaw 15-10 to add to his foil title. On taking GB past their Tokyo tally, Coutya said: ""I had no idea and Iâm very proud to have been able to do that.  ""Competing for ParalympicsGB is always such an honour and a privilege and the ethos they provide really helped push me this week."" Team-mate Gilliver, who three years ago became Britain's first gold medallist in the sport in 33 years, was unable to defend his epee A title, losing 15-12 to China's Sun Gang. However, the 29-year-old's third silver of the Games was the 100th medal won by GB in Paris, ensuring they have reached their target before the final weekend. Sandilands' gold medal was the fifth for Great Britain in Para-athletics in Paris Sandilands was the first member of ParalympicsGB to claim a medal on day nine in Paris, breaking the world record as he won the 1500m title by more than four seconds. Sandilands, 21, clocked three minutes 45.40 seconds to beat the old mark held by American Mikey Brannigan by 0.10secs and earn GB's fifth Para-athletics gold. ""It's an amazing feeling. The timing has to be perfect and I went for it, and the world record means a lot. It's incredible,"" Sandilands said.  Fellow Paralympic debutant Perrineau-Daley said he believes he is ""destined for gold"" after the 35-year-old finished runner-up to Belgian 100m world record holder Maxime Carabin. Kinghorn's sensational Games continued as the 28-year-old won her fifth medal as part of GB's relay team, adding a fourth silver to T53 100m gold. Elsewhere, transgender athlete Valentina Petrillo failed to reach the final of the T12 200m after finishing third in her semi-final on Friday. On Monday, the 51-year-old Italian failed to reach the T12 400m final after finishing third in her semi-final. What's happening and when at the Paris Paralympics?

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjv3gdxv7go,"Eating pets, inflation, abortion - key debate claims fact-checked",BBC Verify has been examining Trump and Harris's claims in their first head-to-head debate in the US election campaign.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:13.709558,China News,BBC,China,"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris went head to head in their first televised debate in the US election campaign. In 90 minutes of often fiery exchanges, the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates traded claims over key election issues including the economy, immigration and abortion. BBC Verify has been examining them. CLAIM: Trump: “In Springfield, they’re [immigrants] eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats, they’re eating the pets of people that live there”. VERDICT: There is no evidence that this is happening.  Trump's comment followed a baseless claim - which was shared by his vice-presidential candidate JD Vance - that immigrants from Haiti who have recently settled in Springfield, Ohio, have been eating pets. Springfield city officials told BBC Verify: “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” You can read more here. CLAIM: Harris: “Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression”. VERDICT: This is false.  At the end of Trump’s term of office in January 2021, the unemployment rate was 6.4%. But it has been higher since the Great Depression. In October 2009, unemployment peaked at 10% in a period of deep economic recession.  It has fallen steadily since, apart from a sharp peak during the Covid pandemic, and in the most recent data for August 2024, unemployment stood at 4.2%. CLAIM: Trump: “We have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums”. VERDICT: There is no evidence for these kind of numbers. There have been about 10 million encounters with migrants crossing over the US border since January 2021.  There are no publicly available figures on how many of them have served time in prison or come from mental institutions but there is some data on how many have previous criminal convictions. Of the 1.4 million apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally so far this financial year (to September 2024) - and where the Border Patrol was able to check against law enforcement databases - about 14,700 people had previous criminal convictions. That's equivalent to roughly 1% of all border apprehensions in this period and doesn’t amount to the “millions” Trump is claiming. CLAIM: Harris: ""If Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban"". VERDICT: This is misleading. Trump has denied that he would sign a national ban if elected president.  He has said that he would leave limits on abortion access up to individual states to decide. Here, Harris also talked about ""his Project 2025"" - a reference to a document published by the right-wing Heritage Foundation outlining a list of policy proposals that they believe a Trump presidency should implement. It doesn’t propose a national ban either, but it does recommend limiting abortion access. Trump has distanced himself from the document, saying: “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.” Many former Trump administration officials are associated with Project 2025. CLAIM: Trump: “The worst inflation we've ever had"" [was under Biden].  VERDICT: This is false.  Under President Biden, inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, at a time when prices were rising sharply in many countries.  Inflation was last above 9% in 1981, but it has been significantly higher than that at several other points in US history. Since its peak in mid-2022, inflation has dropped to 2.9%, for the year to July 2024. But prices are still rising and it is a key issue for many voters. CLAIM: Harris: ""Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result for middle class families in about $4,000 more a year"". VERDICT: Harris calls Trump's proposed tax on imports a sales tax. Some economists have estimated that these tariffs could cost families this much. Others have lower estimates.  Trump insists the cost would be felt by foreign countries but economists believe there would be an economic cost for US importers and consumers.  The $4,000 figure comes from analysis - by the left-of-centre think tank the Centre for American Progress - of Trump’s pledge to increase tariffs on all imported goods to 10-20% and all goods imported from China to 60%. They took the amount the US buys in goods from abroad annually, figured out how much the new taxes on these goods would be and divided this by the number of households in the US. It works out at $4,600 per household, but when you look at “middle income” families you get a figure of $3,900 a year. Other estimates are lower. The Peterson Institute thinks the impact would be closer to $1,700 a year (for tariffs at 10%) or $2,500 (at 20%). CLAIM: Trump: “Crime in Venezuela… is way down because they have taken their criminals off the streets and given them to her [Harris] to put into our country”. VERDICT: There is no evidence that Venezuela is doing this. Crime levels are down but experts say this is because of the state of the economy.  The Venezuelan government does not publish reliable crime figures, but the independent Venezuelan Observatory of Violence does. The Observatory’s 2023 annual report said that violent deaths that year - such as homicides - were down by a quarter compared to 2022. The Observatory told BBC Verify: ""Crime is reduced in Venezuela by a reduction in crime opportunities: bank robberies disappear because there is no money to steal; kidnappings are reduced because there is no cash to pay ransoms.” It said it had seen no evidence that the Venezuelan government was sending criminals to the US.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14zdypxr7no,Venezuelan opposition leader lands in Spain after fleeing homeland,"Edmundo González landed at a military base in Madrid, where he will be granted political asylum.",8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:13.835658,China News,BBC,China,"The opposition candidate in Venezuela's recent presidential election has arrived in Spain after fleeing his homeland. A Spanish Air Force plane carrying Edmundo González landed at Torrejón airbase in Madrid, where he will be granted political asylum.  Mr González had been in hiding in Venezuela. A warrant for his arrest was issued after the opposition disputed July's presidential election result, which saw incumbent Nicolás Maduro handed a third term. The Venezuelan opposition's overall leader, María Corina Machado, said Mr González had fled ""to preserve his freedom, his integrity and his life"". She accused Mr Maduro's administration of unleashing ""a brutal wave of repression"" following the election, the results of which many nations in the region have questioned. Venezuela's Attorney General, Tarek Saab, said on Sunday that the Venezuelan government had agreed with Madrid to give him safe passage.  Mr Maduro's deputy had earlier said this was to restore ""political peace"", after Mr González ""voluntarily"" sought refuge at the Spanish embassy in Caracas. However, Spain's foreign ministry said there had been no official talks with the Venezuelan government on Mr González's exit. Spain's Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said that Madrid would grant Mr González asylum as it was ""committed to the political rights"" of all Venezuelans. The departure of the 75-year-old came a week after Venezuelan authorities sought to arrest Mr González, accusing him of conspiracy and of forging documents, among other ""serious crimes"". He had been in hiding since 30 July, fearing arrest following statements made by leading government politicians who said he should be ""behind bars"". Mr González had not been widely known before March this year, when the main opposition coalition registered him as its candidate. Ms Machado had won an open primary with 93% of the vote - but the opposition looked for an alternative candidate after she was barred from running for public office. After another opposition candidate was also banned from standing, Mr González's name was put forward. Fearing he too could be barred from running, the opposition kept Mr González in the background, while Ms Machado criss-crossed the country calling on people to vote for him. The opposition said it had evidence Mr González had won by a comfortable margin, and uploaded detailed voting tallies to the internet which suggest Mr González beat Mr Maduro convincingly. Venezuela's election body, which is stacked with government supporters, has failed to publish its voting tallies, despite international pressure to do so. The US, the EU and the majority of foreign governments have refused to accept Mr Maduro as the winner without Caracas releasing detailed voting data to prove the result.  The European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, described Mr González's flight as ""a sad day for democracy in Venezuela"".  He added: ""In a democracy, no political leader should be forced to seek asylum in another country."" Some nations have recognised Mr González as the winner of the Venezuelan presidential election, while allies of Mr Maduro - including Russia and China and Iran - have expressed support for the incumbent. Spain's foreign minister reiterated on Sunday that until vote tallies were produced and verified, Madrid would not recognise Mr Maduro as president-elect.  Mr Albares said that Spain would ""promote dialogue and negotiations between the government and the opposition to reach a peaceful solution"". Mr González's departure came as security forces in Venezuela have surrounded the Argentine embassy in the capital, Caracas, where six opposition figures have been sheltering. Venezuela's foreign ministry alleged that terrorist acts were being plotted inside."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c990z4pgd8mo,From one to 29 medals: India’s Paralympic revolution,India's impressive show in Paris has delighted many but there is plenty more to do.,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:22.602206,China News,BBC,China,"India had a lone shining moment at the 2012 London Paralympics when Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda won a silver medal in the men’s high jump. The country hadn't won any medal at the 2008 edition in Beijing, so it felt special to millions of Indians. But Nagarajegowda’s win also sparked discussions on whether a lone medal was enough for a country that has millions of people with disabilities. It also raised questions around India’s attitudes to para sport and disability in general. But something seems to have clicked for the country since 2012. India won four medals in Rio in 2016 and 20 at the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics. And it closed the Paris Paralympics with an impressive tally of 29 medals. There have been so many moments to savour for India in Paris – from Sheetal Devi, who competes without arms, winning a bronze with Rakesh Kumar in a mixed compound archery event to Navdeep Singh registering a record throw of 47.32m in javelin to win a gold in the F41 category (athletes with short stature compete in this class). These achievements are special given the leap of growth Indian para athletes have shown in just over a decade. India still has a long way to go to take on countries like China (220 medals), Great Britain (124) and the US (105) but supporters of para sports in the country say the tide may be turning. So what changed in this relatively short period of time? Plenty. Several government agencies, coaches and corporate firms came together to invest in para athletics. And as they helped more heroes emerge, more children and their parents felt confident to take up para sport as a profession. Gaurav Khanna, the head coach of the Indian para badminton team, says having people to look up to has changed mindsets: “This has increased the number of athletes who are participating and who are having confidence that they can do better. When I joined the para badminton team in 2015, there were only 50 athletes in the national camp. Now that figure has gone up to 1,000."" This is a stark change from the time he began training para athletes. Earlier, Khanna used to spot young talent in strange places like shopping malls, corner shops and even on roads while driving in the country’s rural areas. “It used to be tough to convince parents to send their children for something they knew little about. Just imagine convincing the parents of a young girl to send her to a faraway camp and trust somebody they didn’t know. But that’s how earlier champions came to the fore,” he adds. Technology has also played a crucial part. With India’s growing economic prowess, Indian para athletes now have access to world-class equipment. Khanna says each category in different disability sports requires specific equipment, which is often designed to meet the needs of an individual athlete. “We didn’t have access to good equipment earlier and we used whatever we could get. But now it’s a different world for our athletes,” he says. Disability rights activist Nipun Malhotra also acknowledges the change in mindset. He says the biggest change he has noticed is that parents now believe that children with disabilities can also become heroes: “I think families have started playing a much more important role, and people with disabilities have got integrated much more into families today than they were 20 years ago. This also affects how society looks at disability as well. The fact that there are people with disabilities who are excelling in sports also gives hope to the future generations."" Khanna and Malhotra both give credit to government schemes like TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) for identifying and supporting young talent. Private organisations like the Olympic Gold Quest, which is funded by corporate houses, have also helped para athletes realise their full potential. And then there are people like Khanna who started talent scouting and coaching using their own money, and continue to do so. Sheetal Devi’s journey wouldn’t be possible without the support she got from a private organisation. Born in a small village in Jammu district, she didn’t know much about archery until two years ago. She visited the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board sports complex in Jammu's Katra on a friend’s advice and met her coach Kuldeep Vedwan there. Now she is as popular in India as Manu Bhaker, who won two bronze medals in shooting at the Paris Olympics. Brands are already lining up to sign Devi, and a jewellery advert featuring her has gone viral. Social media has helped para athletes connect with people directly and tell them their stories. Experts hope that this will help them build a brand and eventually take them to commercial success as well. Stars like Devi are already there and there is hope that many more will follow. But there is plenty of work left to do. India has a long way to go to become disability-friendly, with most public places still lacking basic facilities to help people navigate everyday life. Malhotra, who was born with arthrogryposis - a rare congenital disorder that meant that the muscles in his arms and legs didn’t fully develop - found that many didn’t want to hire him despite his degree in economics from a prestigious college in India. He hopes the triumph of India’s para athletes will slowly help in opening those shut doors. “The upside of this [India’s medal tally in Paris] is pretty high. Disabled people, including those with degrees from Oxford, struggle to get jobs in India. What our Paralympics triumph will do is that it will open the minds of employers about employing disabled people without any fear,” he says. While India’s impressive showing in Paris has delighted many, coaches like Khanna believe grassroots facilities for para athletes are still poor even in big Indian cities. He points out that classifications in para sports are very technical and trained coaches are essential to identify raw talent and guide them towards the right categories - all this even before a young person can start training. Sports facilities have improved drastically even in small Indian cities in the past two decades but para sport still lags behind by quite a distance. “You will not find well-trained para sport coaches even in most prominent schools in cities like Delhi and Mumbai and this has to change,” says Malhotra. For Khanna, change has to start at entry level and he urges government and private players to train more coaches. He argues that players can hope for stardom today only if they are spotted and then supported by organisations. “But we won’t get to the top of the table like this. We have to ensure that a disabled child even in the remotest part of the country should have access to a good coach and facilities,” the para badminton coach adds."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4ye15le8xo,Baseless claim about Harris crash spread by mysterious website,The false story has been viewed millions of times online - we break down how you can know it was fake.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:22.702120,China News,BBC,China,"A story posted on a mysterious website has been widely circulated on social media after it made a baseless claim that Kamala Harris - the Democratic presidential nominee - was involved in an alleged hit-and-run incident. It claims, without providing evidence, that a 13-year-old girl was left paralysed by the crash, which it says took place in San Francisco in 2011. The story, which was published on 2 September by a website purporting to be a media organisation called KBSF-San Francisco News, has been widely shared online. Some online posts by right-leaning users citing the story have been viewed millions of times. BBC Verify has found numerous false details indicating it is fake and the website has now been taken down. The online article - accompanied by a five-minute video - contains an interview with a woman who it identifies as 26-year-old Alicia Brown and who it claims is paralysed. There is no evidence to confirm her identity or whether she is paralysed (she is filmed sitting down and from the waist up in an undisclosed location). The article refers to her as both Alisha and Alicia, without explanation. In the video, she claims she was hit by a car while crossing the road in June 2011 with her mother in San Francisco and later claims, again without providing any evidence, that the person who hit her was Kamala Harris. A narrator in the video then say this woman has undergone 11 surgeries and two X-rays are shown.  No evidence of the incident occurring nor the involvement of Ms Harris are provided. BBC Verify ran a search for the website’s registration details, which revealed the domain was set up within the last few weeks - on 20 August 2024. There is also no public record of a KBSF news outlet in San Francisco. The website has now been taken offline and is no longer accessible. The top image in the story, which also features in the video, shows a close up of a smashed car windscreen with what looks like a police officer and a number of fire crew standing by the side of the road next to it. BBC Verify downloaded the image and searched for previous versions of it online - using a reverse image search tool - and found that it was originally posted in a news story about a crash in Mangilao, Guam, in 2018. Next, we examined the X-rays shown in the video. Using reverse image search again, it is clear that these images have been lifted from medical research articles posted in 2010 and 2017. According to the articles, the first X-ray belongs to a 58-year-old patient admitted to a hospital in China.  The second X-ray belongs to a 12-year-old girl admitted to the Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. On the video interview itself, we approached several experts to see whether it had been generated by AI. Professor Hany Farid, an expert in digitally manipulated images, analysed the video and found no evidence of digital manipulation or AI-generation in either the audio or visuals. “I think it is most likely that this is an old-fashioned (and not particularly well executed) cheap fake that is simply staged,” he said. Prof Farid explained that unlike “deepfakes” which are typically created or edited by using artificial intelligence tools, a “cheap fake” can be created by using lower-tech software that is cheaper and more accessible. A cheap fake, he said, encompasses everything from slowing down an audio to make someone sound drunk to cropping an image. “It is a good reminder that we don't need a lot of technology to perpetrate lies,” Prof Farid added. We looked for any press reports from 2011 about a hit and run incident in San Francisco allegedly involving Ms Harris - who was then Attorney General of California - but could find none. We have also contacted the San Francisco police department and the Harris campaign. The story and the website it originally appeared on share striking similarities with a network of fake news websites that masquerade as US local news outlets, which BBC Verify has previously extensively reported on. John Mark Dougan, a former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind the network. Approached by BBC Verify to comment on the hit-and-run story, Mr Dougan denied any involvement, saying: “Do I ever admit to anything? Of course it’s not one of mine.” The websites mix dozens of genuine news stories taken from real news outlets with what is essentially the real meat of the operation - totally fabricated stories that often include misinformation about Ukraine or target US audiences. The websites are often set up shortly before the fake stories appear on them, and then go offline after they serve their purpose. These fabricated stories often include videos featuring people who claim to be “whistleblowers” or “independent journalists”. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors – in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Examples of the fake stories include a rare Bugatti car purchased by Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska, an expensive UK mansion purchased by President Zelensky, and a secret wiretapping operation at Donald Tump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.  What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce380vgeq1po,"Typhoon Yagi kills 59, injures hundreds in Vietnam","It has been downgraded to a tropical depression, but authorities warn of more flooding and landslides.",8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:22.818173,China News,BBC,China,"Super typhoon Yagi, Asia's most powerful storm this year, has killed at least 59 people and injured hundreds in northern Vietnam, according to local authorities. At least 44 victims were killed by landslides, the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said on Monday. Yagi, which made landfall in Vietnam on Saturday, has been downgraded to a tropical depression, but authorities have warned of more flooding and landslides as the storm moves westwards. Among the victims were four family members who died after parts of a hill collapsed onto their house in the mountainous Hoa Binh province on Sunday. A 51-year-old man was able to escape while his wife, daughter and two grandchildren were buried. Their bodies were recovered later, AFP news agency reported.   State media reported that a landslide in Sa Pa, in the northern mountainous Lao Cai province, occurred around noon on Sunday, burying 17 people. Six of them have since been found dead, with nine others left injured. A 68-year-old woman, a one-year-old boy and a newborn baby were among those said to be killed. After Yagi made landfall in northern Vietnam on Saturday, the storm hit Hai Phong and Quang Ninh provinces with winds of up to 203 km/h (126 mph), the Indo-Pacific Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre said. It lifted roofs from buildings and uprooted trees, leading to power outages across the region, including in the capital, Hanoi.  Videos online showed car drivers slowing down to shield motorbike riders trapped on the roads due to strong winds. State media said four people died in the northern Quang Ninh province, with another killed in Hai Duong, near Hanoi.  A bridge in the northern Phu Tho province collapsed on Monday morning, plunging 10 cars and two scooters into the Red River, according to Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc. Local media reported that at least three people had been rescued and 13 were missing. It is unclear if there were casualties as a result of the bridge collapse. Footage online showed part of the bridge still standing, while the collapsed sections were swept away in the raging river. Some 41 fishing boats are among vessels sunk or adrift in the wake of the storm. Search and rescue personnel found 27 people drifting at sea after a dozen fishermen were reported missing.  In the port city of Hai Phong, several areas were under half a metre (1.6 feet) of flood waters on Sunday, with power lines and electrical poles damaged, according to AFP. Metal roof sheets and commercial sign boards were seen flying across the city of two million, which faced the brunt of the storm. Power outages hit parts of Hai Phong - home to multinational factories - on Saturday, while four of north Vietnam's airports suspended operations for much of the day. At the Hai Au boat lock on Tuan Chau island, north of Hai Phong, at least 23 boats were seriously damaged or sunk, according to local residents.  51-year-old sailor Pham Van Thanh told AFP he had never experienced such a strong and violent typhoon. He said all the crew had remained on board his tourist boat since Friday to stop it from sinking. ""The wind was pushing from our back, with so much pressure that no boat could stand,"" he told AFP. ""Then the first one sank. Then one after another."" Nearly 50,000 people have been evacuated from coastal towns in Vietnam, with authorities issuing a warning to remain indoors. Schools were temporarily closed in 12 northern provinces, including Hanoi. Duong The Hung, a restaurant owner in Ha Long Bay, a Unesco world Heritage site, said his business's signs had all fallen off. ""The ceiling has collapsed. The metal roof needs repairs. The damage is severe."" The storm is expected to move into northernmost Laos by Sunday evening.  Before hitting Vietnam on Saturday, the typhoon brought devastation to the Chinese island of Hainan - a popular tourist destination dubbed China's Hawaii - and to the Philippines, killing at least 24 people and injuring dozens of others, AFP reported.  On Friday, China evacuated some 400,000 people in Hainan island. Trains, boats and flights were suspended, while schools were shut. Local media there reported widespread power outages, with about 830,000 households affected. Valuable crops have also been wiped out. A super typhoon is equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane.  Scientists say typhoons and hurricanes are becoming stronger, more frequent and staying over land for longer due to climate change. Warmer ocean waters mean storms pick up more energy, which leads to higher wind speeds. A warmer atmosphere also holds more moisture, which can lead to more intense rainfall.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221026-what-if-polluters-paid-for-climate-change-loss-and-damage,The world's greatest unpaid debt?,Should rich countries and fossil fuel companies pay for the climate losses and damages they have caused?,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:22.927461,China News,BBC,China,"Should rich countries and fossil fuel companies pay for the climate losses and damages they have caused? In August 2022, Pakistan was devastated by catastrophic flooding. The unprecedented monsoon rains killed more than 1,500 people and left the inundated country with economic damages exceeding $30bn (£27bn). Within a month, a scientific study had concluded the high rainfall was ""likely increased"" by climate change. The link between greenhouse gas emissions and extreme weather events already happening today is now well established. Events such as Pakistan's floods, Madagascar cyclones  and Somalia's drought are becoming more intense and more frequent due to climate change. They have led to death and destruction and left countries facing immense economic damages, plunging them into debt and diverting funds away from other critical areas, such as healthcare and education. What's more, these impacts are only set to get worse. If global temperatures were to rise by 2.9C, the average GDP of the world's 65 most climate-vulnerable countries will fall by 20% by 2050 and 64% by 2100. The US states making polluters pay In May 2024, Vermont became the first US state to require oil and gas companies to pay for the climate damages they have caused, after signing the Climate Superfund Act into law. The law mandates polluting companies to be financially accountable for their share of climate impacts. New York is currently deliberating a similar mechanism, which would charge fossil fuel companies $3bn (£2.3bn) a year for 25 years to pay for climate damages. The discussion of who should pay for climate losses and damages has become a major geopolitical issue and is expected to be high on the agenda at the upcoming Cop27 climate talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in November. By 2030, vulnerable nations are likely to face $290-580bn (£260-520bn) in annual climate ""residual damages"" – damages that cannot be prevented with measures to adapt to climate threats. By 2050, the total cost of loss and damage could rise to $1-1.8tn (£890bn-1.6tn). UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who has become increasingly more outspoken on the injustices of climate change in recent years, has described the climate crisis as a ""case study in moral and economic justice"". He argues ""polluters must pay"" because ""vulnerable countries need meaningful action."" As such climate threats become a larger part of our lives, many argue that the countries and companies responsible for the pollution in the first place should be the ones footing bill. So what if we lived in a world where polluters really did pay for the climate damage they have caused? How much would they need to cough up, and would these payouts signal the end of the fossil fuel industry? Would this funding ever be able to alleviate the harm done? And could it mean the world's most vulnerable countries recover from climate disasters and adapt to looming threats?   Responsibility for climate change can be seen on several different levels – the actions of governments, companies, communities and individuals can all be linked to emissions. A study published earlier this year by Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, in the US, provided the first assessment of countries' liability in fuelling the climate crisis. It concluded that emissions from the US, the world's largest historical emitter, cost the world more than $1.9tn (£1.6tn) in climate damages between 1990 and 2014. The next four largest emitters – China, Russia, India and Brazil – caused a further $4.1tn (£3.6tn) in global economic losses in the same time period. Combined, these losses are equivalent to around 11% of yearly global GDP. ""We show that there is a scientific basis for [climate] liability claims,"" says Justin Mankin, co-author of the study and assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College. ""The science shows that if one country can have detectable damages; one country's foregoing [of] emissions can have detectable benefits. That's really essential… it overturns this narrative of 'what can one country do?'"" If governments were serious about covering the damage from this harm, countries could establish a loss and damage finance facility under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – the UN's climate change body – which they would pay into in line with their fair share, says Sadie DeCoste, an organiser for Tipping Point UK, a non-profit working on climate justice. The fair share could be calculated based on their historical and ongoing contribution to global emissions, she says. Having the fund as part of the UNFCCC process, rather than an external body, would help it to be ""accountable and transparent"" and ensure it is a ""collective commitment to reach an agreed-upon sum"", adds DeCoste. Such a fund should not be based on voluntary commitments made only by the countries that are more willing to pay, she says. The world's most climate-vulnerable nations have called for such a facility to be set up, which would assess countries' needs after a climate disaster and request specific funds from governments based on factors including their contribution to global heating. To date, rich countries have strongly resisted these calls, insisting that humanitarian aid is enough to deal with the issue. Fossil fuel companies are also increasingly being held accountable for their greenhouse gas emissions. A 2017 report from the CDP, a non-profit, found just 100 fossil fuel companies are responsible for producing 71% of all global greenhouse gases emitted since 1988. Another report from consultancy Profundo and non-profit Transport and Environment concluded that Europe's five biggest oil majors are responsible for some $13tn (£11.5tn) of damage in the past 30 years, including pollution, deteriorating public health and carbon emissions. These companies make enormous profits from extracting and selling fossil fuels, which have fuelled rising temperatures and exacerbated extreme weather events. If the world's biggest fossil fuel companies were held accountable for these emissions, they could be forced to pay an annual sum, based on their share of global carbon pollution that has been emitted over the past 20 years, into a polluters-pay climate fund. This could help developing countries deal with climate impacts and the costs of transitioning to clean energy. More like this: Polluters could also be made to pay for any ongoing emissions via an international tax on fossil fuel extraction, as proposed by a coalition of climate vulnerable nations. Here, companies would be taxed for each tonne of coal, oil or gas they extract. Starting at a low rate and increasing every year, such a tax could raise billions to help countries rebuild and recover from disasters. ""[A climate damages tax] is a way of establishing accountability and responsibility,"" says DeCoste. It opens up a conversation about how polluters can provide vulnerable countries with enough funding to adapt to the climate threats they are facing, she says.   Some governments today are already considering taxing the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies that benefit from high energy prices. Some of the revenues raised by such a tax could help vulnerable communities recover from extreme events, such as droughts and floods. However, a major limitation of this in the long run is that windfall taxes on fossil fuel companies are only intended to be temporary. ""We need to ensure fossil fuel companies are taxed effectively and consistently all the time, not just with one-off windfall taxes,"" says Olivia Hanks, climate justice lead at the faith group Quakers in Britain. However, since governments also need to set a timeline for rapid phaseout of coal, oil and gas, fossil fuel taxes could only fund climate losses and damages temporarily, says Hanks – meaning other sources of finance will also be needed to pay for climate damages. Industries which use a lot of fossil fuels, such as aviation and bunker shipping, could also be taxed to generate the necessary funds to pay for those suffering the impacts of climate change. Unsustainable behaviours, such as frequent flying and eating red meat, could also be taxed to raise finance for countries devastated by climate change, says DeCoste. The most polluting behaviours tend to be associated with the lifestyle of a small numbers of people with very high incomes – just 1% of the global population is responsible for 50% of flying emissions, for example, while 90% of people have never flown. Airline travel levies, which would increase with each additional flight the individual takes, are a ""fair, feasible, and suitable"" way to raise loss and damage funds, some researchers say. They could generate up to $5-10bn (£4-9bn) each year, be easily collected at international flight departures, and be channelled to vulnerable communities through international bodies like the Green Climate Fund, which was set up to help developing countries reduce their emissions and adapt to climate impacts. Redirecting public money which currently supports polluting activities towards supporting those suffering the impacts of climate change could also make a huge difference. A recent report estimated that governments around the world currently spend a staggering $1.9tn (£1.3tn) each year on environmentally harmful subsidies, such as support for fossil fuel production and for intensive agriculture. This is equivalent to around 2% of annual global GDP – money that in many cases could instead be used to support victims of climate disasters. Governments would play an important role in redistributing money in these ways, but the courts are another important avenue through which victims of climate disasters could compensated. Recent advances in the science of ""climate attribution"" are especially important here. ""Climate attribution allows us to quantify the contributions of particular fossil fuel producers on impacts such as global average temperature increase, sea level rise, and ocean acidification,"" says Kathy Mulvey, climate accountability campaign director at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US. Ongoing scientific advances in this area will enable lawyers to bring more cases against polluters, says Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy organisation in the US that works to hold polluters accountable. (Read more about why climate lawsuits are surging). One 2014 study has been particularly influential in bringing more court cases against polluters, says Wiles. The study, written by Richard Heede from the Climate Accountability Institute, established a causal link between the actions of fossil fuel companies and climate impacts. It identified 90 fossil fuel and cement producers, dubbed the ""carbon majors"", as being collectively responsible for 63% of global emissions since the industrial revolution, and pinpointed the share of emissions each of these companies are responsible for. ""This was critical to getting [legal] cases off the ground,"" says Wiles. ""[As a lawyer], you needed to be able to say that Exxon was responsible for a portion of those damages with data and that the company you're accusing of crimes can actually be proven to have contributed to the damage."" A spokesperson for ExxonMobil says the company has ""long acknowledged the reality and risks of climate change and has devoted significant resources to addressing those risks."" ""We have announced our ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for operated assets by 2050,"" he says, adding that the company is developing roadmaps for reducing emissions from its facilities and assets. An important case which aims to use attribution science to sue for climate damages is a lawsuit brought by a Peruvian farmer against Germany's largest utility company, RWE. The lawsuit is the first case of its kind and could set a precedent for whether polluters should provide compensation for climate damages on a pro rata basis. In the case, which is ongoing, farmer Saúl Luciano Lliuya aims to hold RWE accountable for the role of its emissions in melting a glacier above his hometown, Huaraz, in the Peruvian Andes. Lliuya says RWE should pay 0.47% of the cost of building flood defences to protect Huaraz – which would amount to around €20,000 (£17,600;, $19,600). The amount is based on an update to Heede's study by the Climate Accountability Institute which attributes this share of global emissions to RWE. Lliuya's lawyers are building their case on climate attribution science, including a 2021 study which concluded that the melting of the Palcaraju glacier is ""entirely attributable"" to rising temperatures and that the change geometry of the glacial lake and valley has ""substantially increased the outburst flood hazard"". ""We have a very clear picture of climate change being responsible for creating this very large lake that now threatens a city,"" says Rupert Stuart-Smith, the study's lead author and a research associate in climate science and the law at the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme. The power of precedent ""could mean that we will see more and more successful claims being brought before courts,"" he says. These could potentially be in jurisdictions across the globe and target a great number of companies, he adds. ""If corporations with large emissions can be held responsible for their impact, then it could really be a game changer for pay action [polluters paying for climate damages] in many ways."" If court cases and taxes which made fossil fuel companies more accountable for the impact of their emissions did pile in, would this be the death knell for the industry – the end of coal, oil and gas? It would certainly incentivise fossil fuel companies to switch to producing clean energy, such as wind and solar, instead of producing more carbon-intensive fuels, says Hanks. ""If polluters knew they had to pay the full cost of their activities, we'd see the energy transition happen much faster."" Could this bankrupt fossil fuel companies? ""If polluters are held responsible for the harm done as a result of their emissions, then you could be looking at vast sums of money,"" says Stuart-Smith. ""I don't think it is unreasonable to talk about numbers in the billions of dollars. We could see payouts large enough that they would substantially impact [fossil fuel companies'] profits."" The fossil fuel industry is estimated to have made $2.8bn (£2.5bn) in profits per day over the last 50 years – $1tn (£891bn) a year and a staggering total of $52tn (£46tn). In a scenario where fossil fuel companies were asked to foot the entire bill of climate damages (projected to reach $290-580bn (£260-520bn) per year by 2030), this is equivalent to roughly 30-60% of their current annual profits. Lawsuits can also directly impact a polluter's business model going forwards, adds Stuart-Smith. ""We're seeing cases brought, for instance, challenging corporate and national emission reduction plans as inadequate,"" he says. A 2021 Dutch court ruling, for example, ordered Shell to reduce its emissions in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. The ramifications of this also go beyond any direct damages paid by the companies, says Wiles. ""[The real damage] is the reputational risk and the loss of their social license."" He compares this to the reputational damage the tobacco and opioid industries suffered after they were forced to disclose the health risks associated with their products and make public key documents which highlighted these. In the case of opioids, this disclosure led to hundreds of new lawsuits seeking to hold the industry accountable. This could also happen to the fossil fuel industry, Wiles notes.   For climate-vulnerable countries, funds put forward by polluters would be a lifeline. The long-term finance would allow them to invest in resilient infrastructure protecting them from extreme events, such as hurricanes and floods, as well as slow-moving threats, such as rising seas. The money would also enable countries to strengthen their public health systems and cover the climate-related health costs, such as waterborne diseases, which are increasing due to climate change. It could also provide compensation for workers losing jobs in polluting industries. The global coal industry, for example, is estimated to lose 4.7 million jobs in the clean energy transition, while the mining industry is expected to lose 4 million jobs. Compensation could also support workers who have lost their jobs due to climate impacts, such as farmers and fishers, says Mulvey. Many developing countries are heavily reliant on fossil fuels to meet their energy needs and grow their economies. ""But the path to development is dirty; it's industrialisation,"" says Mankin. Mankin says it is unclear whether loss and damage funding would put these countries on a cleaner path and allow them to develop and at the same time adapt to climate threats.  But Hanks says loss and damage finance would create ""financial and decision-making space"" for developing countries to focus on the energy transition, rather than  having to ""relentlessly deal with disaster after disaster with no money to do so"". Loss and damage finance could also make a huge difference for people who have been permanently displaced due to climate change. It is estimated that by 2050 up to 216 million people will be forced to leave their homes due to climate impacts such as water scarcity, declining crop productivity and sea-level rise. The money could also pay for the restoration of vital ecosystems, such as mangroves and coral reefs, which have been damaged or destroyed by storms and floods and can provide vital protection against climate impacts. CARBON COUNT The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.   In a world where polluters did pay their fair share, would it be enough to compensate communities for the losses they have suffered? Wiles says no matter what is paid it will ""never be enough"", because many communities will continue to see climate impacts into the future. What's more, there are some climate impacts which polluters could never pay for – because they cannot be quantified or recovered at any cost, says Mulvey. ""No amount of money can compensate for some climate loss and damage: lost human lives, cultural heritage, animal and plant species, and ancestral lands are among the most profound impacts,"" she says. ""The sovereignty of a country that has lost its physical territory [due to rising seas, for instance] can't be brought back with money."" Still, polluters paying for damages would help redress global climate injustice and recognise that those who are disproportionately harmed by climate change tend to not be the ones who are responsible for causing it. ""It would help us think differently about responsibility,"" says Hanks. ""It's about calling out the moral wrong, [and] also imagining the world and those power relations differently."" Capitalism teaches us a competitive mindset where as a country we shouldn't give money to another country and thus risk our strategic advantage, she adds. ""But it is possible to think in more cooperative terms and realise that if [vulnerable nations] are thriving it makes [rich countries] more likely to thrive."" ** This story was originally published on 27/10/22 and was updated on 23/09/2024 with information about Vermont and New York's plans to introduce a climate superfund, mandating polluters to pay for climate damages.  For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

Cyclist Storey, 46, won the women's C5 time trial to secure her 29th Paralympic medal - 32 years after her first in 1992. GB collected two further golds on Wednesday as wheelchair racer Sammi Kinghorn won the women's T53 100m final and Dimitri Coutya was victorious in the wheelchair fencing foil category B. ParalympicsGB also won seven silver medals on day seven and three bronzes. GB remain second in the medal table with Wednesday's results increasing their gold total to 33 and medal tally to 74. Only China have more medals than Great Britain with 135. This video can not be played Sarah Storey's 18th Paralympic gold medal comes 32 years after she won her first in Barcelona in 1992 ParalympicsGB's bountiful Wednesday was kicked off by the nation's most decorated Paralympian, Storey, who is competing at her ninth Games. Such is her longevity, Storey had already won 16 Paralympic medals before French teenager Heidi Gaugain - who finished second behind her on day seven - was even born. Wednesday's win means she now has 29 Paralympic medals in all - 16 in Para-swimming and 13 in Para-cycling. She is fifth on the all-time Paralympic medal list. There was also a Para-cycling silver for GB's Fran Brown, with the 39-year-old then posting on social media her medal came three days after she dislocated her shoulder having been knocked off her bike by a car. Sophie Unwin and Lora Fachie, with their pilots Jenny Holl and Corinne Hall, won silver and bronze respectively in the womenâs B individual time trial behind Irelandâs Katie-George Dunlevy, who won her countryâs first gold medal of the Games. Storey wins 18th Paralympic gold on 'appalling' course This video can not be played Kinghorn beats Debrunner to gold in T53 100m If at first you don't succeed, try and try again. Great Britain's Kinghorn must have been sick of the sight of Switzerland's Catherine Debrunner having finished second behind her in the T53 800m and 1500m earlier in the Games. Kinghorn came into the 100m final as a four-time Paralympic medal winner, but had never before won a gold. She needed something special in the 100m and she delivered, crossing the line with a Paralympic record time of 15.64 to beat the Swiss by 0.13 seconds. ""I sobbed the whole way round my victory lap, just sobbed the whole time,"" she said. Kinghorn and Debrunner will line up against each other again on Thursday over 400m. Kinghorn's 'mind blown' by first Paralympic gold Coutyaâs first gold is an upgrade on the bronze he won in Tokyo British wheelchair fencer Coutya is another Paralympian who finally secured a long-awaited first gold medal on Wednesday. The world number one could only win bronze in Tokyo, but three years later managed to beat China's two-time defending Paralympic champion Feng Yanke 15-7 at the Grand Palais. ""I really wanted that gold,"" the European champion said after his victory. ""And it's something that I've dedicated my life to for the last few years."" Coutya, who is also world number one in epee category B, will target further gold medals in the menâs team foil quarter-final on Thursday (11:40 BST), the individual epee B category on Friday (08:40) and team epee quarter-final on Saturday (11:40). The 26-year-old is certainly one to watch. GB's Coutya wins Paralympic gold in wheelchair fencing Alice Tai won silver for Great Britain in the S8 women's 400m freestyle final Great Britain were swimming in silvers on Wednesday with three of their seven coming in the pool. Rhys Darbey and Poppy Maskill added to the golds they won in the S14 mixed 4x100m freestyle relay with successive silvers in the men's and women's S14 200m individual medley finals on Wednesday afternoon. About 30 minutes later, GB's Alice Tai finished second in the S8 womenâs 400m freestyle final, behind USA's Jessica Long who claimed her 17th career Paralympic gold. And while success was flowing in the pool, ParalympicsGB also claimed silver medals through Zoe Newson in the Para-powerlifting women's -45kg event, and Andy Lapthorne and Greg Slade in the wheelchair tennis quad doubles. Elsewhere, Britain's Sophie Wells took bronze in the Para-equestrian grade V individual test, winning her ninth Paralympic medal, while Tim Jeffery won Para-shooting bronze in the mixed 50m rifle prone SH2. And the success keeps coming. Looking ahead, more podium places are on the way. British 14-year-old Bly Twomey is guaranteed a medal in the Para-table tennis women's WS7 singles after reaching the semi-finals on her debut.  Rob Davies will claim at least a silver after reaching the Para-table tennis men's singles MS1 final. He faces Cuba's Yunier Fernandez in the showpiece match on Friday (13:00 BST). Alfie Hewett is also through to the last four of the wheelchair tennis men's singles. He will also contest the men's doubles final alongside team-mate Gordon Reid on Friday.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg58lvyl4nyo,Warning over drugs that can kill in tiny doses,Police in Greater Manchester said at least four deaths had been linked to the drugs.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:23.133072,China News,BBC,China,"Police and public health leaders have warned it has ""never been"" more dangerous to take drugs thanks to the arrival of super-strength man-made opioids. Nitazenes can be hundreds of times stronger than heroin but unscrupulous drug suppliers have been mixing them into other drugs - despite potentially ""dire consequences"". Vulnerable Tameside man Harry Durose, 21, died from taking what police believe to have been fake Valium laced with nitazenes on March 2.  The force said it believes at least three other deaths have been linked to the drugs, although it can take time for tests results to come back. Det Supt Joseph Harrop, head of organised crime at Greater Manchester Police, said the potentially lethal substances are believed to be produced in China.  The force believes they have been imported by individuals buying fake prescription drugs over the dark web, and also in wholesale quantities that are then mixed with street heroin.  Det Supt Harrop told the BBC: ""Nitazene supply is like any other organised crime - It's just a means for criminals to make money.  ""If they can produce synthetic opioids that are cheaper, easier to do, and they can make significant sums of money from it, then that's what they'll do."" In March, the BBC reported how Mr Durose had been prescribed diazepam for a chronic condition called hypermobility, which can cause fatigue, pain and stiffness in joints and muscles, and for joints to dislocate easily.  His mother Amy said she believed he had tried to buy the drug himself on the black market as he ""struggled to sleep with his pain in his legs"" after his doctor ended his prescription. Jon Hobday, Greater Manchester public health lead for drugs and alcohol, described nitazines as ""extremely potent"".  He said their introduction into the UK market appears to have followed a steep reduction in the production of heroin, after the government in Afghanistan cracked down on the production of opium poppies.  Drug dealers began to turn to another type of synthetic opioid, fentanyl, until that was made illegal by the Chinese government.  ""I think it's the drug market making changes in response to law in other countries,"" he told the BBC.  ""Unfortunately what it has resulted in is some very, very dangerous drugs being mixed with usual street drugs which are causing significant issues."" Mr Hobday said from experiences in Manchester, one of the major concerns with nitazines is the fact most users do not realise they are taking them until it is too late.  He said: ""If it's laced with nitazenes in any way, shape or form it can have absolutely dire consequences in the form of overdose. ""And it only takes very, very small amounts and the issue is, particularly with fake prescription drugs, they can just look like normal drugs."" Mr Hobday said people with drug addiction issues have been issues with testing strips which can give an indication if a substance has been laced with nitazenes.  Police officers and other emergency services personnel have also been issues with Naloxone, a drug that can rapidly reverse an overdose.  However Mr Hobday said the only safe option is not to take illicit drugs.  ""The risks are getting greater and greater so it's never been a riskier time to be taking non-prescription drugs.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nj5l0gego,Anger after strangers lock toddler in plane toilet,"The airline said that the girl's grandmother had given the two women permission to ""educate her"".",29 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:23.234625,China News,BBC,China,"An incident which saw two women lock a crying toddler in an aeroplane toilet has sparked an online debate in China on how to manage children in public spaces. The incident went viral on the Chinese internet after one of the two women, Gou Tingting, posted a video of herself carrying the girl inside the cubicle. In her post, she presented herself as trying to help others on board, but was swiftly met with backlash.  The airline later said that the girl's grandmother had given the two women permission to ""educate her"".  The incident took place on 24 August onboard a Juneyao Airlines flight from the southwestern city of Guiyang to Shanghai.  The toddler, who was travelling with her grandmother, had started crying during the flight.  The airline said in a statement two days after the incident that the girl's grandmother had agreed to let two women take the girl to the toilet.  A video posted by Ms Gou on Chinese social media reportedly showed the other woman telling the girl she could leave the cubicle only if she stopped crying.  Local media reports say she was a one-year-old, though the airline has not given that detail. Shortly after she posted the video, backlash was swift, with many criticising Ms Gou for lacking empathy and ""bullying"" the child. Responding to the criticism, Ms Gou said she ""prefers to take action rather than be a bystander"".  ""I just wanted to calm the child down and let everyone rest,"" she wrote on Douyin, China's equivalent of TikTok.  She also explained that some passengers had ""moved to the back of the plane to escape the noise"" while others stuffed tissue papers into their ears. Ms Gou's account has since been set to private.  ""Children cannot control their emotions when they are one or two years old. What's wrong with crying? Didn't you cry when you were young too?"" one user wrote on Weibo. Another was concerned about the psychological impact on the girl, saying: ""We should be thinking about how public spaces can better accept and accommodate young children."" But there were some who defended the women, saying their actions were justified as the girl's grandmother had given her consent.  ""To be honest, some children cannot do without some education,"" a Weibo user wrote. There has been growing debate over how to manage what China calls ""bear children"" - spoilt young kids who kick up a fuss in public spaces such as by screaming or damaging public property. The use of the word ""bear"" in this instance suggests some people in China think some children can act in a feral way. Some public trains have started operating separate compartments for children. There are mixed views on this elsewhere in the world. South Korea, for example, has designated hundreds of children-free zones in restaurants, museums and theatres.  Lawmakers have called on the government to get rid of these zones, citing the need to recreate a society which are more accepting of children - especially as the country is wrestling with a low birth rate. Global airlines, including Turkish-Dutch carrier Corendon Airlines and Singapore-based Scoot, offer the option for passengers to pay more to be seated in a child-free zone."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypreexqxlo,Venezuela opposition: Everyone knows we won vote,Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado says foreign nations should recognise Edmundo González as Venezuela's president.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:23.333697,China News,BBC,China,"The Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, has said the US, Europe and the UK should recognise the opposition’s candidate as the president of Venezuela. Speaking to international journalists, Ms Machado said: “Everyone knows that Edmundo González is the president-elect.” Multiple foreign governments have said they believe the opposition won July’s election in Venezuela, but stopped short of recognising Mr González as the president. The state-run electoral council and the country's highest court - both stacked with government loyalists - have announced that President Nicolás Maduro won a third term in July, but voting tallies published by the opposition indicate Mr González won. Ms Machado was banned from running in the election and Mr González ran in her place. “I certainly think they [the US and UK] should recognise Edmundo González for what he is,” she said in a response to the BBC when asked if it was time for the West to recognise him as president. “The position of Maduro is to increase repression. It keeps on isolating him and is unsustainable,” she added. The result has been recognised by President Maduro’s allies including Russia, China and Iran, but not the majority of foreign governments, who have called on the government to release the voting tallies to prove the result. This includes some countries that had previously maintained closer relationships with Maduro’s government, including Brazil and Colombia. After the last election in 2018 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, dozens of governments including the US recognised the then opposition leader Juan Guaido as the interim president and imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela. But the US, UK and EU have stopped short of recognising Mr González as the president this time, despite US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken saying there is “overwhelming evidence” that he won, not President Maduro. Instead, several foreign governments in the West have prioritised the so-called ""Brazil approach"" to try to negotiate a peaceful transition of power with Mr Maduro’s government. In response, Ms Machado said: “Some countries withheld from doing that [recognising the opposition candidate as president]. “We need to increase our stake at this point. The UK should move forward and say that Edmundo is president.” She added that President Maduro had to recognise that “the cost of staying in power will increase every day that goes by”. “I certainly think the US should do much more. Perpetrators of human rights violations should know they will be held accountable. Not only in the military but also the judicial system. “These messages should come clear to the regime.” She remains in hiding as she spoke to journalists. The government has called for her and Mr González to be arrested. She said there was “certainly” a risk they could be put in prison. “They are looking for us intensely. They have put in prison people they thought know where I was,” she said. “We have to stay alive and free and that is our main challenge. “Every day that goes by is harder and riskier. The regime is able to do anything. They have no limits.” But she said she would not seek asylum elsewhere: “I believe my duty is to stay in Venezuela.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/articles/c3w6236wxw6o,There is a buzz because of snooker money - Trump,World number one Judd Trump says snooker has been hoping for the huge prize money on offer at the Saudi Arabia Masters for more than a decade.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:23.416600,China News,BBC,China,"Judd Trump is the current world number one with Â£974,000 prize money World number one Judd Trump says snooker has been hoping for the huge prize money on offer at the Saudi Arabia Masters for more than a decade. The tournament in Riyadh, which has been given the unofficial title of being the sport's 'fourth major' by organisers, is the biggest ever staged outside the UK. With a Â£2.3m prize fund and Â£500,000 winner's cheque, only the World Championship in Sheffield is comparable. ""There is a different kind of buzz similar to the Crucible here and everyone throughout the last 10 to 15 years has hoped this would happen to snooker,"" Trump told BBC Sport. ""We have watched the other sports take the money away and everyone is happy and excited by this opportunity. Some of the events we go to in the Home Nations apart from Northern Ireland - which is a great venue - feel a bit second tier in how they are set up. You can feel the excitement here. ""There is a buzz because of the money and the chance for players to support their families."" The Saudi tournament and other events like the Xi'an Grand Prix in China have helped swell the prize money on offer on the professional tour to a record Â£19m, at least, this season. Mark Allen, ranked number two in the world, said: ""I appreciate it can change someone's life, unless you are a maybe a Ronnie [O'Sullivan], Judd or Ding [Junhui] that is set for life.  ""It is a huge, huge amount of money we are playing for but it is not what we are thinking about. We are here to try and win a tournament.  ""You don't start out in the game to win Â£500,000, you start out to be world champion and world number one. They are the dreams you have as a young boy and that shouldn't change."" Stars gear up for Saudi Arabia Masters - all you need to know  Snooker's World Championship has been held at the iconic Crucible in Sheffield every year since 1977. Trump says ""there's no real reason for it to move"" to Saudi Arabia. ""This is a big one,"" he said speaking about the Saudi Arabia Masters. ""At the moment to have the two biggest tournaments over here would not make too much sense. ""They need to go about growing this and making it as attractive and equal to the World Championship as possible and that looks like the idea to me."" Trump added he would ""like to see the World Championship move around the world and change venue every year"".  It was last held outside of England in 1975 in Australia. South Africa and Jersey have been the only other hosts.  Allen added: ""There was a lot of chat about the World Championship moving when we were in Sheffield. I'm not really bothered either way.  ""This will sound bad but we need to go wherever the most money is because that's how the sport will grow."" Like Judd Trump, Mark Allen has won Â£974,000 prize money this season Northern Ireland's Allen has called for the world rankings to ""move to a points-based system"" with less weighting towards the big tournaments.  Since 2014-15 snooker rankings have been based on prize money won - excluding at certain tournaments. ""You could pretty much lose in the first round of every tournament and win in Saudi and the Worlds and you're probably going to be number one,"" he said. ""It's time to find a balance with a points-based system that we've been trying to get for the last few years."" Englishman Trump, the 2019 world champion, agrees. ""The rankings still need to be looked at because we obviously have two big events now that stand out way above anything else so it is very difficult for anyone who doesn't win one of them to be number one,"" he said.  ""I would much rather be winning five or six events a year which would make you feel like a far more deserving number one."" Allen, 38, says this is ""absolutely"" the best time to ever be a snooker player with the big prize money on offer. ""The young boy Robbie McGuigan, who has just turned professional from our club is absolutely buzzing,"" he said.  ""He knows nothing but what he's experienced these first few months and it's rubbed off on me and Jordan [Brown] in the club and it has given us an added extra incentive.  ""It is the best time you could ask for to be a snooker player. It is amazing what World Snooker have done in the last 12 to 18 months because it wasn't great for a while."" Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has invested in several sports at the top level, including golf, football, Formula 1, boxing and tennis. It has won the right to stage the finals of a revamped Asian Champions League football tournament, the 2034 Asian Games, 2027 Asian Cup and 2029 Winter Olympics, and is set to host the football 2034 World Cup. Critics claim the investment is to gain legitimacy and deflect attention from controversy over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and its impact on the environment, a practice known as 'sportswashing'. Allen said: ""It's an easy get-out but it is nothing to do with me. I am here to play snooker and that is all I'll ever focus on. We go to a lot of countries that have issues and we have our own issues in the UK and nobody ever questions that."" Trump echoed those sentiments. ""I think every country has their own issues,"" he said. ""Especially in the UK at the moment it is not good.  ""I can only go on how I am treated here by people walking round and everyone is very friendly and it is very safe."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3lky7z7eo,"War ‘tour’, football and graffiti: How Russia is trying to influence Africa",The African Initiative spreads misleading claims online and promotes Russian culture on the ground.,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:39.311682,China News,BBC,China,"Teenage footballers listen to the Russian national anthem before a match. Nearby, artists paint Russian President Vladimir Putin’s portrait on a wall during a graffiti festival.  Welcome to Burkina Faso, one of the African nations where Russia is boosting its operations to gain influence. Evidence found by the BBC shows that Russia is using media and cultural initiatives to attract African journalists, influencers, and students while spreading misleading information. These events are being promoted by African Initiative, a newly founded Russian media organisation which defines itself as an “information bridge between Russia and Africa”. It inherited structures previously set up by the dismantled Wagner mercenary group and is believed by experts to have links with the Russian security services. Registered in September 2023, a month after Wagner’s leader Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash, African Initiative has welcomed former employees from his disbanded enterprises. Its efforts have been particularly focused on the three military-run countries of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.  Following recent coups, these West African nations have distanced themselves from Western allies like France, criticising their failed interventions against jihadist groups and colonial legacies. They have instead pivoted towards Russia. Alongside cultural events on the ground, African Initiative maintains a news website with stories in Russian, English, French, and Arabic, as well as a video channel and five Telegram channels, one of which has almost 60,000 subscribers. Some of the Telegram channels were “recycled” from older ones which had been set up by groups linked to Wagner. They were the first to promote the Russian Defence Ministry's paramilitary group Africa Corps, which has effectively replaced the military wing of Wagner in West Africa. Pro-Kremlin narratives and misleading information, especially about the United States, are rife. Stories on the African Initiative’s website suggest without evidence that the US is using Africa as a production and testing ground for bio-weapons, building on long-discredited Kremlin disinformation campaigns. One story echoes the Kremlin’s unsubstantiated claims about US bio-labs being relocated from Ukraine to Africa. Another maintains without evidence that US bio-labs on the continent are increasing, claiming that “under the guise of research and humanitarian projects, the African continent is becoming a testing ground for the Pentagon”, suggesting that secretive biological experiments are being conducted. While Prigozhin’s propaganda efforts targeted mainly France, African Initiative “targets Americans to a greater degree,” says researcher Jedrzej Czerep, head of the Middle East and Africa Programme at the Polish Institute of International Affairs. “It’s far more anti-American.”  In June, a group of bloggers and reporters from eight countries were invited for a seven-day “press tour” of the Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. The trip was organised by Russian state media and Western-sanctioned Russian officials, and the journalists visited African Initiative’s headquarters in Moscow. ""Africa wasn’t getting much information [about the war],"" Raymond Agbadi, a Ghanaian blogger and scientist who studied in Russia and who participated in the “press tour”, told the BBC. ""Whatever information we were getting was not convincing enough for us to understand what the war was really about.” American influencer Jackson Hinkle, a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has spread multiple false claims about Ukraine, was also on the visit.  After visiting Moscow, the journalists travelled 1,250km (780 miles) to the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region. Then they went to towns in the Zaporizhzhia region – all areas which were captured by Russia early in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Throughout the visit, the reporters were accompanied by Russian officials and travelled with the Russian military in vehicles marked with the Z sign – the symbol of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In May, African Initiative organised a separate “press tour” to Russian-occupied Mariupol for a delegation of bloggers from Mali. Press trips for journalists are a widely used tool to attempt to sell a country’s viewpoints. But while “Western media does a lot of progressive training [for journalists] to report on key topics which have become global concerns, Russia uses these guided tours as a way of propagating certain narratives,” says Beverly Ochieng, senior analyst at Control Risks and the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, noting that China organises similar tours. Having African journalists report on their trips gives an “impression of authenticity” because they “reach out to the audience on languages they recognise”, rather than looking like it is part of “a wider campaign used to portray Russia in a positive light,” says Ms Ochieng. In stories published since the trip, the African journalists refer to the Ukrainian cities occupied by Russian forces as ""conflict zones in Russia"" and quote Russian-installed authorities, echoing Russian state propaganda and presenting the Kremlin’s view of Ukraine’s borders. In a piece published on JoyOnline, an English-speaking website operated by the Multimedia Group, Ghanaian journalist Ivy Setordjie writes that the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia region [whose capital is under Ukrainian control], is ""located in the south of European Russia."" She tells the BBC she disagrees that the regions were illegally annexed by Russia, affirming that her reports are reflections of her own judgement and “not tilted towards” the country. Beyond press tours, local affiliates of African Initiative in West Africa's Sahel region have been actively involved in community outreach efforts aimed at boosting Russia’s image. The BBC has been monitoring African Initiative’s Telegram channels and Facebook pages, where videos, images, and reports of their work on the ground are shared. In Burkina Faso, we found reports about a football competition where the Russian national anthem was played, “friendship lessons” in schools where students are taught about Russia, a competition of the Soviet martial art “sambo”, first aid workshops for citizens and policemen, and a graffiti festival where participants drew Russian President Vladimir Putin alongside Burkina Faso’s former leader Thomas Sankara, all sponsored by African Initiative. Images also show African Initiative members distributing groceries to locals and neighbourhood screenings of the Wagner-backed documentary The Tourist, about a group of Wagner instructors in the Central Africa Republic, where Wagner and its offshoots have been helping the government fight rebels for several years. “The original idea with the Africa Corps was to erase whatever military structures Prigozhin had developed and to replace it with something new. African Initiative, often serving as its media wing, was more accommodating and happy to reuse all assets that were already there,” says researcher Mr Czerep from the Polish Institute of International Affairs. The FSB, the Russian Federal Security Service, plays an important part in the new organisation, he notes. The head and editor-in-chief of African Initiative is Artyom Kureyev, identified by Russia experts as a Russian Federal Security Service agent. Mr Kureyev is linked to the Valdai Club, a Moscow-based think-tank close to President Putin. African Initiative’s website lists Anna Zamaraeva, a former Wagner press officer, as deputy editor-in-chief.  Viktor Lukovenko, known as one of Prigozhin’s “political technologists,” founded the Burkina Faso office of the African Initiative but left the position in recent months. A former Russian nationalist with a criminal past, Mr Lukovenko served five years in prison for an attack in Moscow on a Swiss citizen who later died. We reached out to African Initiative for comment. Its office in Moscow confirmed it had received our queries but its response did not reach us by email. The African Initiative reacted to the BBC story in an article on its website, quoting a response it said it had sent to the BBC. The organisation said its “humanitarian activities in the Sahel, such as the football competition” aimed to “improve Russian football and recruit new players” and the goal of film screenings and school lessons is to introduce the people of Africa to “the great Russian culture”. The organisation reiterated and defended the stories which were highlighted by the BBC as misleading, however it didn’t provide any new evidence. It referenced the Russian constitution and Russian laws as the justification for its terminology when referring to areas of occupied Ukraine as Russian territory. In February, in response to a report by the US Department of State, an article on African Initiative’s website stated that its editorial board “insists that its purpose is to spread knowledge about Africa in Russia and popularise Russia in African countries”, giving “various Africans an opportunity to be heard, including their criticisms of Western countries”. Meanwhile, the organisation continues intensifying its outreach in the Sahel. In the last week of August, about 100 students in Burkina Faso attended a talk about training opportunities in Russia.  ""I learned about the culture of Russia and the relation between our governments,"" said a smiling teenager wearing a T-shirt with an African Initiative logo in a video recorded after the discussion.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypreexqxlo,Venezuela opposition: Everyone knows we won vote,Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado says foreign nations should recognise Edmundo González as Venezuela's president.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:39.405409,China News,BBC,China,"The Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, has said the US, Europe and the UK should recognise the opposition’s candidate as the president of Venezuela. Speaking to international journalists, Ms Machado said: “Everyone knows that Edmundo González is the president-elect.” Multiple foreign governments have said they believe the opposition won July’s election in Venezuela, but stopped short of recognising Mr González as the president. The state-run electoral council and the country's highest court - both stacked with government loyalists - have announced that President Nicolás Maduro won a third term in July, but voting tallies published by the opposition indicate Mr González won. Ms Machado was banned from running in the election and Mr González ran in her place. “I certainly think they [the US and UK] should recognise Edmundo González for what he is,” she said in a response to the BBC when asked if it was time for the West to recognise him as president. “The position of Maduro is to increase repression. It keeps on isolating him and is unsustainable,” she added. The result has been recognised by President Maduro’s allies including Russia, China and Iran, but not the majority of foreign governments, who have called on the government to release the voting tallies to prove the result. This includes some countries that had previously maintained closer relationships with Maduro’s government, including Brazil and Colombia. After the last election in 2018 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, dozens of governments including the US recognised the then opposition leader Juan Guaido as the interim president and imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela. But the US, UK and EU have stopped short of recognising Mr González as the president this time, despite US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken saying there is “overwhelming evidence” that he won, not President Maduro. Instead, several foreign governments in the West have prioritised the so-called ""Brazil approach"" to try to negotiate a peaceful transition of power with Mr Maduro’s government. In response, Ms Machado said: “Some countries withheld from doing that [recognising the opposition candidate as president]. “We need to increase our stake at this point. The UK should move forward and say that Edmundo is president.” She added that President Maduro had to recognise that “the cost of staying in power will increase every day that goes by”. “I certainly think the US should do much more. Perpetrators of human rights violations should know they will be held accountable. Not only in the military but also the judicial system. “These messages should come clear to the regime.” She remains in hiding as she spoke to journalists. The government has called for her and Mr González to be arrested. She said there was “certainly” a risk they could be put in prison. “They are looking for us intensely. They have put in prison people they thought know where I was,” she said. “We have to stay alive and free and that is our main challenge. “Every day that goes by is harder and riskier. The regime is able to do anything. They have no limits.” But she said she would not seek asylum elsewhere: “I believe my duty is to stay in Venezuela.”"

Wales sent a contingent of 22 Para-athletes to the Games with Great Britain and 14 returned with medals around their necks. There were 16 medals in total - seven golds, five silvers and four bronzes - across 10 different sports. That is the most medals since Athens 2004 when Welsh athletes earned 22. It is also the best Welsh performance at a Paralympic Games since Beijing 2008, when 10 golds were won as part of a 14-medal total. The youngest winner in Paris was 17-year-old swimmer Rhys Darbey, who won gold and silver, and the oldest was 40-year-old table tennis player Rob Davies, who won silver.

Matt Bush began the gold rush and made a little bit of history along the way in becoming the first male to win Para-taekwondo gold for Great Britain.  It proved to be third time lucky for the 35-year-old after injury had ruled him out of competing in Rio and Tokyo. Ben Pritchard rowed his way to victory the following morning, the Mumbles single sculler convincingly beating the reigning champion and long-time rival Roman Polianskyi of Ukraine. Pritchard, who finished fifth in Tokyo, won by more than 10 seconds. Meanwhile on the final day of action in the velodrome, James Ball claimed the biggest win of his cycling career.  He beat team-mate Neil Fachie in the time trial, with Ball having finished second to the Scot in Tokyo three years ago. Ball was helped to the title by his pilot, and fellow Welshman, Steffan Lloyd. Sabrina Fortune's first round effort of 15.12m was a new world record in the shot put Over in the athletics, Sabrina Fortune claimed gold in the shot put. The 27-year-old won bronze in Rio as a teenager, but injury meant she could only manage fifth in Tokyo. Since then she has claimed two world titles, and twice broke the world record on her way to victory in Paris.  Swimmer Rhys Darbey completed the golden weekend and did it in style.  He won gold on his first ever Paralympic race, the 4x100m freestyle relay, and remarkably did so with three fellow teenagers. Two further golds would follow later in the Games and few more memorable than Jodie Grinham in the Para-archery. She won the mixed team title with Nathan Macqueen, but her Champagne will have to sit on ice as she competed while seven months pregnant. Laura Sugar had to be patient for her shot at gold, but did it in style on the final day. The 33-year-old not only retained her singles kayak title from Tokyo, but set a new Paralympic record just for good measure. This video can not be played Pregnant gold medallist Jodie Grinham's 'weirdest celebration' While there was elation for some, there was disappointment for other athletes, such is the nature of sport.  Aled Sion Davies had gone to Paris at the hot favourite having set a new shot put world record in May this year, but the 33-year-old had to settle for silver after what he called a âmassive underperformanceâ in the final.  Fellow track athlete Olivia Breen also left the games disappointed. After winning 100m Commonwealth gold, Breen missed out on the final after finishing ninth overall.  Medal hopes then transferred to the long jump, but the 28-year-old was pipped to the bronze medal by the tightest of margins. Breen had jumped the same distance as the third-placed competitor, but her second best jump had not been as long.  Three-time Paralympics boccia champion David Smith also had hopes of adding to his haul, but he was beaten in the individual bronze medal match and also failed to win a medal in the team event.  The 35-year-old said afterwards that he had ""just ran out of gas"". Aled Sion Davies said he was ""gutted"" at missing out on gold The Games must, however, be viewed as a roaring success for Welsh athletes and ParalympicsGB as a whole. They ended their 2024 Paralympics with a total of 124 medals, including 49 golds.  Only China, with 94 golds and 219 total medals, won more during the 11-day event. The final Welsh honour in Paris falls to Matt Bush, who was given the task of being Great Britain's flag bearer alongside para-swimmer Poppy Maskill. The ceremony at Stade de France starts at at 19:30 BST. "

It looked like China's Wu, 20, was going to end Trump's 28-match unbeaten run in best-of-11 matches, which stretched back to December 2022, as he went into the interval 4-0 up. But Trump, 35, showed why he ranked top of the pile as he re-emerged to win five frames in a row and progress. ""I was looking at flights home!"" Trump told Eurosport afterwards. ""I'm very, very happy with that. That was one of my best wins in the manner of digging in and [having] self belief."" Seven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan progressed more comfortably as he beat Lei Peifan 5-1. The 48-year-old was in dominant form, recording a break of at least 50 in each of the five frames he won - including two centuries. But he was not completely happy with his game and at one point switched to taking shots left-handed. ""I haven't had no feel for over two years now, so it's been really difficult to get the enjoyment from it. It's been tough,"" said O'Sullivan, who next faces Zhang Anda. ""So I decided to just start playing a bit left-handed, because it frees me up a bit. I enjoy playing then. I can actually practice."" Former world champion Stuart Bingham saw off Ding Junhui 5-4 in a nine-frame thriller to reach the last 16, where he will meet Mark Williams. Australian Neil Robertson, who has not reached a ranking event final in the last two years, produced an impressive display to see off England's Mark Selby 5-3. World number two Mark Allen, however, exited the tournament as he lost 5-1 to Xiao Guodong of China. It looked like Allen would also stage a comeback after falling behind 2-0, when he hit a 104 break to take the third frame, but Xiao won the next three to progress. Former world number one John Higgins was also knocked out as he lost 5-2 to Jimmy Robertson. Scot Higgins, who has not won a ranking event since the Players Championship in 2021, never recovered from going 3-0 down and must rely on results elsewhere to keep a spot in the world's top 16. There were also defeats for Ali Carter and Barry Hawkins. World number 10 Carter was beaten 5-3 by fellow Englishman Elliot Slessor, while 16th-ranked Hawkins lost 5-1 to Scotland's Scott Donaldson. The Saudi Arabia Masters, which has been given the unofficial title of being the sport's 'fourth major' by organisers, is the biggest ever tournament staged outside the UK.

The men, two from China and one from Myanmar, were still thought to be alive as recently as Thursday. They were trapped when part of the tunnel they were building collapsed on Saturday in Pak Chong district, about 200km (124 mi) north-east of the capital Bangkok.  On Friday, authorities announced all three had died, with initial investigations suggesting this was due to a lack of air.  The tunnel, which was under construction and is part of the Thailand-China high-speed railway project, had collapsed due to a landslide at around 23:40 local time (16:40 GMT) last Saturday. Rescuers, comprising officials from the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) and a Chinese disaster response team, had been working round-the-clock over the past week with the hope of rescuing the victims.  They had tried to pump oxygen into the tunnel to keep the workers alive, but it is unclear whether the tubes they used reached the workers at all. On Thursday, rescuers found the body of a Burmese truck driver buried under a pile of soil and rocks.  The bodies of the two Chinese workers, a supervisor and an excavator operator, were found at about 06:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Friday, the SRT said.  All three bodies were found about 25 metres from the point of the tunnel collapse, officials had said. Local reports claim rescuers had got within just one metre of one of the men on Wednesday. On the same day, they had purportedly heard faint sounds which they believed were coming from the men. Scanners and sniffer dogs had also detected vital signs, offering hope that the workers could still be alive. However rescue efforts progressed slowly due to the ongoing landslide - falling dirt continually blocked the holes made by rescuers to move deeper into the tunnel. Thailand's caretaker Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said rescuers were hindered by ""the limitation of engineering"". They had to be careful that their digging would not cause other parts of the tunnel to collapse, he said, adding that the rescuers had to build 3m (9.8ft) high supporting structures for their own safety. ""Nobody wanted [this incident] to happen,"" he said at a press conference on Friday.  ""We did not only try to save the lives of the victims, we also had to [ensure the safety] of the rescuers and workers,"" he said.  The bodies of the three men were brought out of the tunnel on Friday.  Thai police have opened an investigation into the incident, while construction works around the tunnel have been suspended for the time being."

Martin Vickers, Conservative MP for Brigg and Immingham, told MPs closing the blast furnaces in Scunthorpe would affect ""many thousands of people and many businesses"". As part of a £1.25bn decarbonisation plan announced in November, British Steel’s owner, Jingye, said it would close the plant's two blast furnaces and replace them with a greener electric arc furnace. However, a spokesperson said no decision had been made regarding the date for the shutdown of the furnaces. Speaking in the Commons on Thursday, Mr Vickers said: ""There have been widespread media reports suggesting that coke would stop being imported from October [and] that would mean production would be stopping in Scunthorpe by Christmas. ""There are rumours concerning the fact that employees will be given notice very soon,"" he said. ""This is obviously creating great anxiety amongst those directly employed by British Steel, and also those in the supply chain which, particularly in northern Lincolnshire, extends to many thousands of people and many businesses,"" he added. In response, Labour industry minister Sarah Jones said the government planned to spend £2.5bn ""to rebuild the steel industry"". The money would sit alongside a separate £500m package for Tata Steel in Port Talbot, South Wales, to build an electric arc furnace to replace the existing coal-powered process.  Ms Jones said the previous administration had spent over a decade ""lurching from crisis to crisis, with no clear plan to safeguard the future of a competitive domestic steel industry"". ""This government is determined to change that,"" she said, adding ""decarbonisation must not mean deindustrialisation"". However, Conservative shadow business minister Greg Smith asked Ms Jones whether she had discussed electric arc furnaces with British Steel, and whether the firm would switch to foreign imports from China to fulfil its UK supply chain obligations. In a statement, a British Steel spokesman said: “We are in ongoing discussions with the government about our decarbonisation plans and the future operations of our UK business.  ""While progress continues, no final decisions have been made”. North Lincolnshire Council granted British Steel planning permission for a new electric arc furnace in Scunthorpe last April. Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council has also given the green light to plans for an electric arc furnace at the firm's Teesside site, as part of its £1.25bn decarbonisation plan. Speaking in November, British Steel chief executive Xijun Cao said: ""Our desire to dramatically reduce our carbon footprint, coupled with current market conditions, means we can't wait and need to transform our business as quickly as possible. ""And while decarbonisation will not happen overnight, it's imperative we take swift and decisive action to ensure a sustainable future for British Steel.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02plzv90po,Minister warns of 'tough choices' on defence spending,"Some military projects are likely to be cut because of financial pressures, defence secretary suggests.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:40.065174,China News,BBC,China,"Some military projects are likely to be cut or cancelled because of financial pressures, the defence secretary has suggested.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l1qd1nwnjo,"Where Donald Trump stands on 10 key issues, from tax to Israel","From abortion to trade, here are his policy pledges as he runs for the White House for a third time.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:46.023554,China News,BBC,China,"Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president for the third consecutive election.  When he was defeated by Joe Biden after his first term in office, the country was in the midst of Covid, lockdowns and social unrest.  It followed a campaign in which restoring both economic health and law and order were his central messages. Here are his policy pledges this time. This is the biggest issue for voters and it’s the pinch of high food and housing costs that seems to be shaping their sentiment rather than the robust growth and low unemployment. Inflation has fallen steeply from a 40-year high in 2022, but the former New York businessman has retained a persistent polling advantage on the economy over his Democratic opponents. One of the 20 core promises on his campaign website is to “end inflation and make America affordable again”. A president’s power to lower prices directly is very limited. Trump has pledged to expand US energy production, opening areas such as the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, which he argues would lower energy costs, though analysts are sceptical. He says he can reduce housing costs by preventing some undocumented immigrants from getting mortgages and deporting others, and by launching a home building programme on federal land. Trump has a raft of tax cuts planned. Firstly, he wants to extend the cuts he enacted in 2017, which are due to expire next year. That was the biggest tax overhaul in decades, aimed at simplifying the tax code and promoting growth and investment. The largest cuts went to businesses and the wealthy, which Democrats have called to reverse. The Republican also wants to shave a further percentage point off corporation tax - and has floated an even bigger cut to 15%. He has proposed making tipped income tax free, a proposal that his opponent Kamala Harris subsequently backed, too. Trump has also called on abolishing the tax on Social Security payments, a move that would be welcomed by retired Americans but would at the same time punch a big hole in the fund. The former president brought the era of US free trade to a juddering halt when he became president, but his tariffs on Chinese imports were largely retained and even expanded by Joe Biden. This time around he has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods with imports from China bearing the brunt at 60%. It is part of his attempt to promote homegrown manufacturers and stop outsourcing, but some economists have warned this could push up prices for consumers. During the presidential debate with Harris, Trump pointed out he imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and that the Biden administration has not removed them. This tops his list of priorities as it did in 2016 when “Build the wall” was his signature slogan. The number of border crossings hit record levels at the end of 2023, but has fallen this election year. Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the wall and increasing enforcement. He has also promised the biggest mass deportations of undocumented migrants in US history. His vice-president pick, JD Vance, said they would start by removing a million people, but experts told the BBC that deportations on that scale would face huge legal and logistical challenges. There are also claims it could slow economic growth. Children of undocumented residents would no longer be eligible for citizenship under another Trump policy, although this would face significant legal obstacles. This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, and Trump has struggled to find a consistent message. The three judges he appointed while president were pivotal in the landmark decision, which Democrats have used to rally supporters as abortion restrictions have been introduced in numerous states. Trump himself has regularly said states should be free to decide their own laws on abortion. But in recent weeks he has tried to walk a tightrope, taking a more moderate stance while trying not to alienate his conservative base. He criticised Florida’s six-week ban, provoking an angry backlash, but also said he would oppose a ballot measure in the state establishing the right to an abortion. During the presidential debate he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. The Republican has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world. He has pledged to end the war in Ukraine “within 24 hours” through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin. ""I know Zelensky very well, and I know Putin very well,"" he said during the presidential debate. ""I think it's the US best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal."" Trump gave no details on what he thinks each side should give up in such a deal, and the Kremlin has said nothing can be done in 24 hours. Trump has also said he would stop the cash flowing to Ukraine. Mr Biden signed off $61bn in military aid for Ukraine in April. On Nato, he thinks countries that fall short of the advisory 2% of GDP spent on defence should forego the protection that comes with membership. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel and condemned pro-Palestinian supporters on US college campuses. But he has also at times been critical of the way Israel has conducted the war. He has said the war would not have happened if he had been president but offered no details on how he would end it. As president he angered Palestinians by moving the embassy to Jerusalem and his administration stopped calling Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which contravene international law, illegal. In his top 20 priorities, Trump promises not to cut Medicare, which is federally provided health insurance for older people. While president he tried unsuccessfully to dismantle the signature legislation of President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions more people. He still criticises the law, which remains popular, but in March he said on Truth Social he would not undermine it. Recently he called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but it's unclear if such a large expense has the support of Republicans in Congress. He has pledged to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime. His Republican policy platform vows to restore safety in neighbourhoods by replenishing police departments and protecting officers from “frivolous lawsuits”. Democrats point to his promise to pardon hundreds of convicted January 6 rioters as contradictory to his law-and-order stance. They also point to the fact violent crime was down 6% in 2023 and murders down by 13%, according to FBI data. As president, Trump rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles, and protections for federal waterways. This time, he is again vowing to cut regulations, particularly as a way to help the American car industry. He has constantly attacked electric vehicles, promising to overturn Biden targets encouraging the switch to cleaner cars. And he has long railed against offshore wind farms, promising to halt this source of renewable energy as soon as he is elected.

The pair's victory was sandwiched between GB wins in the men's single sculls and mixed coxed four while Annie Caddick and Sam Murray took silver in the mixed double sculls PR3.  Rowles and Stevenson, aiming for Great Britain's third successive Paralympic gold in the division, trailed Chinese Lius Shuang and Jijan Jiang with 100m to go in the 2,000m event.  But the British duo timed their charge perfectly to snatch a dramatic victory in a time of eight minutes 20.97 seconds. Shuang and Jiang, who led for the majority of the race, looked dejected as they finished 2.48 secs behind the British pair to claim silver, with Israel third.  The victory is Rowles' third gold following wins in Tokyo in 2021 and Rio in 2016 with former partner Laurence Whiteley. Rowles is the first British rower to win three Paralympic gold medals.  It was the second rowing victory of the day for Great Britain after Ben Pritchard won gold in the PR1 men's singles sculls with a comeback win of his own. The Welshman trailed Italy's Giacomo Perini during the first 1,500m of the 2,000m event.  But Pritchard started his charge with 500m to go and eased to victory in the home straight, finishing with a time of nine minutes 03.84 seconds.  Ukraine's Roman Polianskyi pipped Perini at the finish to take silver, finishing more than 10 seconds behind Pritchard.  Pritchard's victory was Britain's first in the division since Tom Aggar's gold at the 2008 Games in Beijing.

Competitors from as far away as the US, China and India will be flexing their feet for the World Toe Wrestling Championship. Organisers of the event say the sport, founded in a pub in the 1970s, is ""like arm wrestling, but with feet"". Two contestants battle on a special podium with two walls either side by locking toes and trying to push their rival's foot or toe to the opposite wall.  Reigning men's champion Ben Woodroffe, from Fenny Bentley in Derbyshire, is taking part for the 15th time, as he seeks to win his third golden toe. Known as ""Toe-tal Destruction"", Mr Woodroffe started toe wrestling at the age of 14 and has been competing for more than 20 years. He said: “[Alan] Nasty Nash has come out of retirement and has 17 championship title wins under his socks, so it’s going to be tough this year. ""However, I’m confident, and my toes feel seriously strong after a strict regime of fortifying oat drink, foot baths and toe deadlifts.” Lisa ""Twinkletoes"" Shenton, from Ashbourne, will be defending her title in the female division. The winner receives a bronze-cast trophy in the shape of a foot, with £500 each going to the champions of the men and women's categories.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgwpkvl97eo,New Zealand hikes tourist tax prompting warning,The south Pacific country's tourism industry warns the increased entry fee is a barrier to visitors.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:46.445848,China News,BBC,China,"New Zealand will steeply increase an entry tax for foreign tourists in a move some fear could deter visitors. The cost of the International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy will near triple to NZ$100 (£47.20) from NZ$35 (£16.52) from 1 October. The government said this is to help economic growth and “ensure visitors contribute to public services and high-quality experiences while visiting New Zealand"". But Tourism Industry Aotearoa  - the country's independent tourism body - says the higher fee is a barrier to visitors, making it ""incredibly expensive to visit"".  The nation is famed for its Māori culture and dramatic scenery, including glaciers, mountains, volcanoes and lakes. But its location in the South Pacific and associated long-distance air fares have often posed a barrier for visitors. “New Zealand’s tourism recovery is falling behind the rest of the world, and this will further dent our global competitiveness,” said Rebecca Ingram, the association's chief executive. New Zealand first introduced the levy in 2019, as it grappled with the impact of large numbers of visitors on its infrastructure, environment and communities. During the coronavirus pandemic, the country shut its borders for two and a half years and didn't allow foreign visitors to return until August 2022. The country has been struggling to return to the visitor levels it saw before the pandemic, with just under three million international visitors in 2023, roughly three-quarters of pre-pandemic levels. Tourism Minister Matt Doocey argued the new tax cost would not be a huge deterrant, as NZ$100 would make up less than 3% of most tourists' average spend in the country. He said it remained competitive compared with countries such as Australia and UK, and he remained “confident New Zealand will continue to be seen as an attractive visitor destination by many around the world”. The tax does not need to be paid by visitors from Australia and the Pacific. Most visitors to New Zealand are from Australia, the United States, China and Fiji. The increased costs will come on top of separate visa fees for some visitors which are also rising from 1 October. New Zealand is not the only place where tourist taxes exist. Other countries that charge tourists include Indonesia, Spain, France, Austria, Croatia, Costa Rica, Iceland and Italy. In most places, the tax is included as part of accommodation, visa or plane ticket costs. In April, Venice launched a trial where day trippers were charged a €5 tax to visit the city on peak days, in a bid to combat the effects of over-tourism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp81gp30e8yo,The pains of plugging budget holes with renewables windfall,ScotWind is a vital part of balancing the government's budget at a time when just transition plans loom.,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:46.542537,China News,BBC,China,"First Minister John Swinney says he hopes to avoid the £460m raid on a long-term investment fund announced by Finance Secretary Shona Robison to balance the books this year. He said so as he officially opened the onshore maintenance base in Buckie for one of Scotland's biggest offshore windfarms - Moray West. He wishes to be seen as a champion of the renewable energy industry. And on a sunny day on the Moray coast, that was how it looked. But that £460m was to support the transition to greener energy. Yet Shona Robison says she intends to use that money, if the UK government does not fund public sector pay deals, which have been coming in well ahead of the 3% increase she budgeted this year. The budget problem and the raid on a long-term fund for short-term cash are being blamed on the UK government. Mr Swinney accuses it of a return to 'austerity', meaning a squeeze on public spending. But these are also embarrassing circumstances for the Scottish government.  Even before the programme of cuts to public spending could be announced, the official fiscal watchdog had nailed the problem with budget planning on the door at St Andrew's House: under-estimating the cost of public sector pay, freezing council tax, and expanding relatively generous welfare payments for Scots. The Scottish Fiscal Commission pointed out that choices were being made at Holyrood before Labour came to power in Downing Street. Those choices, in the budget set out in draft last December, set the course for the mid-year budget crunch we're now seeing. The scale of Ms Robison's recruitment freeze and spending claw-back remains unclear, at least until Chancellor Rachel Reeves reveals her plans at the UK Treasury. But if the £460m is required, the Scottish government is undermining its own arguments for long-term investment in energy and a 'just transition' from fossil fuels to renewable power. That plan has been awaited for a long time. It requires some difficult wording on the future path for Scotland's oil and gas industry, which has been on its own transition from the backbone of the economic case for Scottish independence (see the referendum campaign 10 years ago) to something of a political pariah. But publication now looks imminent. It will have to address the limited economic benefit accruing to Scotland from renewable power. The Moray West wind farm has no more than 70 permanent jobs attached. The manufacturing has been done in the east of England and beyond. The strategy will require funds to help pay for transition, and that looks a shaky prospect if money earmarked for it is being diverted to avert strikes by bin collectors, teachers and doctors, to freeze council tax and fund welfare payments. So as it is a vital part of plugging the hole in the Holyrood budget, it's worth a closer look at the ScotWind windfall. The story began in English waters. Offshore wind looked very expensive, and to create incentives for private sector firms to invest in it, the UK government offered 'Contracts for Difference'. These are promises to fund developers with a minimum price for power per megawatt hour, while also clawing back revenue above that level. Who will pay? Not the government, but those who pay household and business electricity bills. A series of auctions, in which the winners offer to supply power into the grid at the lowest price, saw the cost of offshore wind plummet at each time of asking. It was a highly effective way of driving the industry to become more cost-efficient. The more turbines they installed, the more efficient they became. As a consequence, there are more than 2,000 wind turbines installed in UK waters. It was the country with the biggest such investment until China recently overtook it. That auction process worked well until last year, when an auction round was pitched by the government at too low or ambitious a price, and there were no bidders. Last week, a more successful bidding round secured 131 winning bids. Some 37 projects securing Contracts for Difference were in Scottish waters, including fixed and floating offshore windfarms, as well as onshore wind, tidal and solar arrays. Scotland, meanwhile, had gone big with onshore wind power, where Contracts for Difference drove down prices so much that some new developments can stand alone on a commercial basis. England effectively blocked new plans for onshore turbines, where they met with local opponents. Going offshore from Scottish waters offered the prospect of consistent wind at higher speeds, but in deeper water with higher development costs.  So Scotland came to offshore wind more recently.  It has only a small share of installed capacity, but big prospects. Another auction process, for the right to develop a sea area, produced another astonishing result in English waters. Private sector developers were willing to bid far more than expected. An auction for areas of Scottish seabed, known as ScotWind, was halted while the agency which owns and leases the seabed, Crown Estate Scotland, recalibrated what it could expect - concluding it could be as much as ten times more than anticipated. In April 2022, Crown Estate Scotland announced the winning bidders for 17 sea areas around Scotland's coast, including some large ones around Orkney, as well as areas off Lewis and Islay. Later that year, three more sea areas were added off Shetland. Total takings from the auction: £755m. And that's only for the right to plan and develop these sites.  It does not secure planning rights, or consent to plug a windfarm into the national grid, or one of those Contracts for Difference. Each winning bid still carries significant technical risks for developing offshore in wild waters. Of the 20 areas, 13 are to use floating wind turbines, which are much less mature in their design. There is financial risk. These auction bids were ahead of interest rates going up, inflation applying to supplies and bottlenecks in the development process. There is, for instance, a shortage of the huge barges required to install turbines which now reach more than 200 metres (656ft) above sea level. They have to be booked well in advance, and competition for them has pushed up prices. The ScotWind windfall could have been more if conditions had not been applied. Crown Estate Scotland chose bids that looked most credible as well as being lucrative, with a large share of the supply chain close to home, and a clear route to being installed within 10 years, which is when the development rights run out. Crown Estate Scotland has an interest in seeing these plans progress, because it will eventually be charging windfarm owners an annual rent for the seabed once the power and the cash begin to flow. It has the same financial interest as the Scottish government. Although its name is derived from the estates owned historically by kings and queens, it is wholly owned by Scottish ministers, and all its profits flow into their coffers. So that is where the windfall reaches Shona Robison. This is a one-off payment, to be followed, in 10 years or so, by more modest annual leasing profits. Putting that money into long-term investment in the energy transition is in line with the SNP's long-standing criticism of the UK government for failing to put aside oil and gas revenues. For 50 years, these have been absorbed into the giant bank account at HM Treasury, some of them to pay for capital projects and a lot of them to avoid higher taxes. By contrast, Norway at first used its North Sea windfall to pay off its government debt, and for the past 33 years, while levying very high personal taxes, it has taken the long-term view and built up a colossal investment fund, by last month worth £1.3 trillion. Supporters of independence have long argued that Scotland could have done the same. And maybe it could. But to save and invest funds for the long term, a government has to avoid the temptation of plugging gaps in budgets, to protect priorities in the short term. That is exactly what the Scottish government is now doing. And while public sector pay will have to be funded next year, with pressure from public sector unions for a further rise at least to match higher prices, there will be no ScotWind windfall available. Nor will public sector unions take kindly to being accused of forcing ministers to raid the Scottish government's investment fund.   A letter from the GMB Scottish secretary Louise Gilmour states: ""The decision to use £460m of one-off ScotWind income to plug the gap in Scotland’s finances is unsustainable and represents poor financial planning. For our members in energy, it yet again obliterates the claim of a ‘just transition’. ""These funds should have been used to build the renewable supply chains across Scotland. Instead, they have been squandered."" The union leader isn't holding back: ""Just as Thatcher raided Scotland’s oil and gas profits preventing the creation of a sovereign wealth fund akin to that of Norway, Scotland’s future in renewables is now being frittered away. ""Failing to invest and plan in the future of our energy network undermines the Scottish government’s own ability to fund future spending in the public sector."" So, not much thanks there to Shona Robison for funding those union pay demands. Plugging that budget hole looks set to become more politically painful before it's over."

He is expected to highlight environmental concerns and the importance of interfaith dialogue during the 12 day trip, which will also see him travel to Papua New Guinea,  Singapore and Timor-Leste - the only one of the four countries that is predominantly Catholic. It's a particularly challenging journey for a man who turns 88 in December and has been battling a spate of health issues. Asia Pacific is one of only a few places in the world where the Catholic Church is growing in terms of baptised faithful and religious vocations. Parts of the Pope's trip, which was originally scheduled in 2020 but postponed due to the pandemic, will retrace the steps of St John Paul II, who also visited the four nations during his 27-year pontificate.  ""Today I begin an Apostolic Journey to several countries in Asia and Oceania,"" he wrote on X on Monday. ""Please pray that this journey may bear fruit.""  Since his election in 2013, the Pope has urged the Catholic Church to bring God's comfort ""toward the periphery"" - referring to communities who are marginalised or far away. He is only the third pope to visit Indonesia, which has the largest population of Muslims globally.  During his four days there, he is expected to visit the Indonesian capital's main mosque, meet with outgoing president Joko Widodo and hold a mass for some 70,000 people, according to the Vatican News. Nasaruddin Umar, the grand imam at the Jakarta mosque, told news agency AP he hopes the visit will offer opportunities to ""discuss the common ground between religious communities and emphasise the commonalities between religions, ethnicities, and beliefs"". Observers say the visit to Indonesia highlights the Pope's interest in deepening dialogue between Christian and Muslim communities. ""For the longest time, there [have been] tensions. [Both groups have had] misunderstandings over the course of history,"" said Jonathan Tan, a religious studies expert at the Case Western Reserve University in the US. ""I think what the Pope wants to do is to do a new way forward, a new way of relating to one another, not a defensive way,"" he said. In Papua New Guinea, the Pope will travel to the remote city of Vanimo to meet with missionaries from his native Argentina who have been reaching out to tribal communities.  Miguel de la Calle, an Argentine missionary in Papua New Guinea's north-western-most city, said he hoped the Pope's visit would ""significantly boost"" ongoing evangelisation efforts in the territory. People have been travelling from all Papua New Guinea - and even across the border from Indonesia - to see the Pope, he told Vatican News.  ""Some have been walking for days due to the scarcity of transportation,"" Father Miguel said. In Timor-Leste, the Pope will officiate mass in the capital Dili, on the same seaside esplanade where John Paul II spoke in 1989 to comfort local Catholics who suffered under Indonesia's occupation of the territory. Timor-Leste gained independence in 2002.  The sheen of Pope Francis's visit to the country has dimmed in recent days, however, following revelations that hundreds of homes in the area were bulldozed. Nearly 90 residents were told to find somewhere new to live before he arrives. Francis will wrap up his trip with a visit to Singapore, where he will celebrate Mass at the 55,000-seater National Stadium. For the past decade, the Pope has been increasing his engagements with Asia.  Early in his pontificate, he made four long-distance trips to the region: to South Korea, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Japan. Only 0.5% of Japan's population identified as Catholic at the time. He has also visited Bangladesh, Mongolia, Myanmar, and Thailand. No pope, however, has been able to visit China to date, as relations between the Vatican and the Chinese Communist Party have been strained by disputes over who can appoint bishops in the country. Both sides are believed to have reached a deal on this in 2018, which gives the Vatican a say on such appointments.  During his trip, Francis will be accompanied by a doctor and two nurses. Concerns have been raised over the impact of such an ambitious itinerary on his ailing health.  Francis, who has had part of one lung removed in his younger days, had been struggling with respiratory and mobility problems of late - some of which have led him to miss his weekly Sunday blessings. In November last year, he cancelled his trip to Dubai for the annual United Nations climate meeting because of a lung inflammation. Additional reporting by Hanna Samosir in Jakarta"

Clegg, the world record holder in the event, was pushed all the way to the line but touched home first in 57.49 seconds. Dzmitry Salei, a neutral Paralympic athlete hailing from Belarus, took silver, with bronze going to Azerbaijan's Raman Salei. It was Clegg's second gold in Paris after he won the S12 100m backstroke earlier in the Games. Afterwards he thanked his mother Moira - who was celebrating her birthday, as well as her son's victory, on Saturday. ""I don't even know how to begin with my mum, she has always supported me,"" Clegg said.  ""When I've struggled she has always been there to encourage me, whatever I wanted to do she had my back which is really special. ""Me, my sisters and brother are lucky to have her - she's four foot 11 and rammed with love."" Clegg's win earned the 18th gold of an impressive campaign for GB's swimmers. The swimming squad have won 32 medals at these Games, more than any other sport - short of the 47 attained at Rio 2016, but having secured more golds than eight years ago. For Clegg, gold in the event where he has held the world record since 2021 provides redemption following the Tokyo Paralympics three years ago, where he was narrowly beaten in the final.

Clegg was third at the halfway point, but produced a powerful 31-second final 50m to ensure he would not suffer another Paralympic heartbreak. He came home just 0.43secs ahead of Dzmitry Salei, and a further 0.21secs from the other Salei brother, Raman. France's Kylian Portal, 17, missed out on a medal at his home Games by just 0.04secs, and Clegg made sure to commiserate the tearful teenager after the race. âI wasnât sure when I touched the wall if I got it, I didnât want to celebrate too hard,"" the Briton said. Now Clegg, whose sister Libby and brother James are also GB Paralympic medallists, wants to use his profile from these Games to help other visually impaired people. âI want to reassess what impact I can have on Para-sport, on visually impaired athletes,"" he said.  ""It is a real struggle for people with visual impairments, we have shockingly high levels of anxiety and depression, something needs to be heavily looked at. ""Hopefully off the back of this I can be some sort of role model."" Sport-by-sport guide to Paris 2024 Paralympics Paralympics 2024: What you need to know about classification Paralympics 2024: Who has been selected for the GB team? Earlier, Alice Tai earned her fifth medal of the 2024 Games - and GB's 31st in the pool - in ""one of the silliest races I ever swam"" as she won bronze in the women's S8 100m butterfly on the final day of competition in La Defense Arena. Tai stormed out of the blocks and led by more than a second at the halfway point and by a significant margin with 20 metres remaining. However, she slowed significantly in the final stages, allowing USA's Jessica Long to overtake her for gold while Viktoriia Ishchiulova, a Russian competing as a neutral Paralympic athlete, won silver. Tai's GB team-mate Brock Whiston finished fourth. ""It's probably one of the silliest races I ever swam. My coach told me to feel the first 50m, and it felt really nice,"" Tai said with a laugh after the race. ""Then it got to the last 20 metres, and it started getting worse and worse to the point where I didn't care where I finished. ""So to get the bronze is great - my best time this season would have won it so there's always that bit in the back of my mind, but honestly I'm tired after this week."" Tai has been one of Britainâs most successful athletes at these Games with two gold medals - in the S8 50m freestyle and SB13 100m breaststroke - a silver and now two bronzes. It is a significant return for the 25-year-old, who had her lower leg amputated in 2022 after years of constant pain, and essentially had to relearn to swim. She admitted the fatigue of the week caught up with her in the final few metres of her last race in Paris. ""With my [butterfly], it's a real mixed bag - sometimes I go out like that and I'm OK coming back,"" Tai said. ""But I'm really fatigued, mentally after the 50m freestyle I shut down, I'm done. ""I'm happy with all my performances, I know I couldn't have done more in that race. I'm happy, and excited to go home."" Tai can also look back on these Games much more fondly than her previous experience at Rio 2016, where she had suicidal thoughts as she struggled with undiagnosed ADHD. ""A lot of my friends are commenting on how much happier I am, they can see it,"" the seven-time Paralympic medallist said. ""I got two medals in Rio, and I went up to my room and just cried. I put a face on for the media, but deep down I was miserable, didn't want to be there, didn't want to be alive. ""Now I can say I have enjoyed every day - even rubbish swims like that, I'm genuinely happy with third and a swim four seconds off my best."" Elsewhere on Saturday, Faye Rogers finished fourth in the women's 200m SM10 individual medley. Rogers, who won 100m butterfly gold earlier this week, is a world bronze medallist in this event and led after the first leg - her favoured butterfly stroke. However, she fell down the field as the race progressed as Zhang Meng of China took gold. In the morning heats, Iona Winnifrith, the youngest member of the ParalympicsGB squad, failed to make it through to the final after finishing 10th quickest in the women's S7 50m butterfly heats. Winnifrith, 13, won a silver medal in the SB7 100m breaststroke earlier in her debut Games.

After competing in front of no spectators in Tokyo because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Gilliver said the prospect of up to 2,400 people inside the Grand Palais during this year's Games added another element.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rx1vr83ldo,France on charm offensive as New Caledonia simmers,A proposed voting reform had sparked deadly protests in the French overseas territory in May.,30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:53.365104,China News,BBC,China,"For the Pacific Islands, climate change, geopolitics and security have often been the bread and butter of any summit. But at this year’s Pacific Island Forum Leader’s Meeting - the region’s biggest diary event - there was another hot topic thrown into the mix: that of New Caledonia and the unrest that hit the French overseas territory back in May. A controversial French proposal to extend voting rights to people who had lived on the islands for more than 10 years sparked deadly protests. Eleven people have since died – nine civilians and two French gendarmes - and there are still French police on the ground. President Emmanuel Macron visited New Caledonia and, in June, halted the reform.  But tensions remain high, with a growing push towards independence among the Indigenous Kanaks, who make up 41% of the population. The French have said they want to set the record straight. They were on a PR mission in Tonga, where leaders from all 18 island nations and territories gathered this past week, including New Caledonia’s President Louis Mapou. But small island nations were sceptical - the violence in New Caledonia had seen support for the French wane. And many saw it as an attempt by France to hold on to a strategic part of the world where the US and China were fighting for sway. “We’ve seen lots of nice press about the French delegation throughout this week,” Véronique Roger-Lacan, France’s ambassador to the Pacific, said on Thursday, breaking into an ironic laugh. She was holding a press briefing that had been heavily publicised, her team consistently encouraging media to attend. She made it clear they were there to answer questions and show transparency in what had been a bruising few months not just for New Caledonia but for France’s reputation in the region. The French delegation attended as a ""dialogue partner"" - one of 21 such countries with interests in the region, inlcuding Washington and Beijing. As an overseas French territory, New Caledonia's defence, foreign affairs and policing are coordinated by France. To many here, it looked like France was chaperoning the pro-independence leader. “Being a country in the Pacific we can feel that we are part of a community of challenges,” François-Xavier Léger, the French Ambassador to Fiji, said at the briefing. And before that, Ambassador Roger-Lacan said that ""New Caledonia is France"". These comments ruffled feathers at the forum, where there was much discussion of decolonisation and independence. “In making this kind of statement, it’s not really helping the discussion,” said Reverend Billy Wetewea, a pastor at the Protestant Church of Kanaky who also attended the forum. Reverend Wetewea has worked with many of the Kanaky youth in New Caledonia who led the protests. “I don’t justify the violence, but I think it can be explained through social dynamics,” he said, adding that years of inequality in education, health and social issues had taken their toll. New Caledonia is on the United Nation’s list of non-self-governing territories - countries the UN monitors in their progress towards independence. France has been clear it is following the steps towards decolonisation. The Nouméa Accord, signed in 1998, put the territory onto a path of more autonomy. The intention was that over a 20-year period, a more independent New Caledonia would emerge. Three referendums were also tabled. In the first, held in 2018, voters rejected independence by 56.7%. Then in 2020, there was a narrower victory for the anti-independence side - 53%. In 2021, independence parties boycotted the final referendum, arguing that the vote was being rushed through. The Covid pandemic had made campaigning impossible and Indigenous Kanaks were still taking part in rituals to bury their dead. Unsurprisingly, the pro-France side won with an overwhelming majority. That last referendum has set the tone for the past few years of strain between France and the Kanaks, who feel that France playing isn't fair in their path to decolonisation. When asked by the BBC what France could do to change that view, Ambasssador Roger-Lacan was resolute they are doing everything by the book. “This is the ongoing job in New Caledonia with you all in the press,” she said. “Things have to be portrayed in a neutral manner, everywhere, disinformation has to be stopped, right information has to be put to the people on this self-determination and democratic process.” While France may blame the media for not reporting their side, many here blamed France’s tone – and questioned their interests. “They want to maintain their presence in the Pacific geopolitically [with] the fear of China taking over the Pacific,” Reverend Billy Wetewea said. China sent its largest-ever delegation to the forum this year. And the US delegation was led by Kurt Campbell, President Joe Biden’s Deputy Secretary of State, widely credited as the architect of Washington’s recent alliance-building in Asia. France’s position in the Pacific was brought into sharp focus in 2021, when Australia cancelled a multi-billion dollar contract with a French firm to build nuclear submarines. Instead it signed a new, key defence pact with the US and the UK. This, researcher Benoît Trépied said, altered France’s approach with New Caledonia: “Suddenly there was a huge new interest of French officials in the Pacific. [The] colonial, imperial reflex which was – no, if we want to be powerful in the Pacific, New Caledonia has to stay French. Period.” Despite the stand-off, this week’s meeting was fruitful. Leaders endorsed a planned fact-finding mission to visit New Caledonia, which was meant to happen earlier but disagreements over who was in control of the mission made the timing slip. But for Reverend Wetewea, there needs to be more dialogue. “They cannot take decisions without consulting the people,” he said. “If they make their own decisions, it will be really tense again. Now the youth want their voice to be heard.”"

Hannah Cockroft won her fourth successive women's T34 100m title to clinch GB's first Para-athletics gold, ahead of team-mate Kare Adenegan, before Sabrina Fortune produced a world record to win the women's F20 shot put title at the Stade de France. Four golds were won in the pool, where Maisie Summers-Newton took the women's SB6 100m breaststroke title, Brock Whiston claimed women's SM8 200m individual medley gold as Alice Tai took bronze, Grace Harvey triumphed in the women's SB5 100m breaststroke, and Britain's quartet won mixed S14 4x100m relay gold. The final day of Para-track cycling action in the velodrome brought three GB golds, with James Ball and pilot Steffan Lloyd beating team-mates Neil Fachie and Matt Rotherham to the men's B 1,000m time trial title. Sophie Unwin and pilot Jenny Holl triumphed in the women's B 3,000m individual pursuit, with bronze going to Lora Fachie and Corrine Hall, while there was open C1-5 750m team sprint success for Jody Cundy, Jaco van Gass and Kadeena Cox. The day began with three rowing golds, won by Lauren Rowles and Gregg Stevenson in the mixed double sculls, Ben Pritchard in the men's single sculls and the mixed coxed four. Among GB's 18 medals, there was also silver for Sammi Kinghorn in the Para-athletics women's T53 800m, and rowers Annie Caddick and Sam Murray in the mixed PR3 double sculls silver. ParalympicsGB's previous record for gold medals won on a single day at a Games was nine - achieved at both Rio 2016 and Beijing 2008. The outstanding haul of 12 on day four took the team to 23 golds in Paris, with their overall medal total at 43 - second only to China (67 medals including 30 golds), who have topped the table at the past five Games.

The 32-year-old Cockroft, dominant in the event since her international debut in 2011, is three behind Tanni Grey-Thompson's record for most Para-athletics golds at the Games by a GB competitor. She can narrow that gap by retaining her T34 800m title on Saturday. ""The support was amazing. I can't wipe the smile from my face. For 12 years, that's what we've worked for. I knew Paris could do it, and I'm so glad they did,"" said Cockroft. ""I'm making my life well hard doing this. You know you're the one people are watching but that's what keeps you going, you don't want to let people down and I know I have more in me.""

I just wanted to jump up and down and celebrate right then - and then I remembered I [still] had five more throws after that,"" Fortune said. After a two-day wait, Kinghorn earned GB's first athletics medal as the only athlete able to follow world record holder Catherine Debrunner's explosive start - the Swiss setting a Paralympic record in one minute 41.04 seconds. Two-time champion Jonny Peacock, a medallist at his three previous Games, qualified safely for Monday's T64 100m final (18:46 BST). It was yet another superb night in the pool for ParalympicsGB, who lead the Para-swimming medal table after four days of action with an unmatched 11 golds among their 16 medals. Summers-Newton led from start to finish to capture her second title in Paris in the SB6 100m breaststroke, before Whiston produced a stunning comeback to overturn a halfway deficit of more than 10 seconds to team-mate Tai in the SM8 200m individual medley and edge Viktoriia Ishchiulova in the closing stages. This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Maisie Summers-Newton wins second gold of 2024 Games That success was a long time coming for Whiston, unable to compete at the Tokyo Games or the 2022 Commonwealth Games because of issues around eligibility and category. ""I knew I had something to prove to myself and I was out there to show myself what I can do. I was like, 'nothing's stopping me'. I was ready for it tonight,"" Whiston said. Harvey upgraded her silver from Tokyo 2020 in the SB5 100m breaststroke as GB's medal rush continued, with a fourth gold added by the S14 mixed 4x100m freestyle quartet of teenagers William Ellard, Rhys Darbey, Poppy Maskill and Olivia Newman-Baronius in the final event of the day. Darbey, 17, said: ""Iâm looking forward to seeing what we can do in Los Angeles [in 2028]; everyone in this team is under 20. Hopefully that world record can be ours in LA."" Britain's Para-cyclists also shone on the closing day of track events at the velodrome, topping the final medal table after adding three golds, a silver and bronze on Sunday. Ball and pilot Lloyd beat team-mates Fachie and Rotherham to men's B 1,000m time trial gold to reverse the result of the Tokyo 2020 final, before Unwin and Holl judged their 3,000m effort perfectly to overhaul Ireland's Katie-George Dunlevy and Eve McCrystal. Cox, having suffered heartbreak when her bid for women's C4-5 5,000m gold was ended by an early fall on Thursday, then returned to the track to help GB to gold in the open C1-5 5,000m alongside Van Gass and nine-time gold medallist Cundy.

Mentally I had to climb over a massive hurdle to be on the start line."" ParalympicsGB had a near-perfect morning with three golds and a silver from five Para-rowing races at the Vaires-sur-Marne stadium. Rowles, 26, claimed a historic win in the PR2 mixed double sculls with Stevenson, becoming the first British rower to win three Paralympic golds. It came in a thrilling final in which the British pair recovered from more than a boat length behind China's Liu Shuang and Jiang Jijian to take gold on the line. Lauren Rowles won her third rowing gold after successes at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 with former partner Laurence Whiteley After setting a Paralympic record in qualifying, Pritchard earned gold in the PR1 single sculls, and Great Britain's PR3 mixed coxed four of Frankie Allen, Giedre Rakauskaite, Josh O'Brien and Ed Fuller, coxed by Erin Kennedy, retained their Tokyo title. Kennedy, who received the all-clear from breast cancer last year, said: ""Today is the end of a narrative chapter in my life that I didn't really want to start. It has been a bit of a mental three years and 680 days since I was diagnosed. ""Rowing has been the constant for me when things were changing and always provided the goal. I just pass a lot of the credit on to my team-mates. The belief in myself might have run out at some point but they never let it happen.""

GB started the day with a last-16 match against Switzerland and won 35-26, with Emily Kemp scoring four touchdowns. GB, ranked fourth in the world after winning last year's European Championships, then faced Japan in the quarter-finals and suffered a 40-34 defeat. Kemp again scored four touchdowns but third-ranked Japan claimed the game-winning score with 29 seconds remaining. GB then faced Canada to help determine fifth to eighth place, and Canada edged a 48-47 shootout, despite GB quarterback Brittany Botterill throwing seven touchdown passes - five to Kemp. GB's women now face a crucial game against Italy on Friday. The winners will clinch seventh place - and only the top seven teams qualify for the 2025 World Games in China. A last-16 defeat for GB's men on Wednesday left them battling for a spot between ninth and 16th, and they won 34-28 against Spain before beating Japan 36-34.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr40dpz1rkwo,Japan says Chinese spy plane violated its airspace,The breach would be the first known instance of such a direct violation.,27 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:53.709937,China News,BBC,China,"Japan has accused a Chinese spy plane of breaching its airspace, in what would be the first known instance of such a direct violation.  Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Y-9 surveillance plane ""violated the territorial airspace"" of Danjo Islands for about two minutes at 11:29 local time Monday (02:29 GMT). Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary called the breach ""utterly unacceptable"" and summoned a Chinese embassy official in Tokyo in protest.  The incident comes as tensions rise in the region, where China competes for influence against the US and its allies, including Japan. Japanese authorities issued ""notifications and warnings"" to the Chinese aircraft during Monday's incursion, but no weapons such as flare guns were used, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. Nonetheless, the incident has stoked concern. The Japanese government said it had contacted Beijing through diplomatic channels to lodge a strong protest over the incursion and demand the prevention of such breaches in the future.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said they had ""no intention of invading the airspace of any country"" and that relevant departments were still trying to understand the situation, reported Reuters. Tokyo also recently flagged the presence of Chinese ships in the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by China and which Beijing calls the Diaoyus. The islands, which are uninhabited but potentially possess oil and gas reserves, are one of several sources of tension between Beijing and its neighbours - most of whom are American allies. Another is Japan's Okinawa island, which is home to the largest US military installation in the Asia-Pacific region. There are also American troops stationed in Taiwan, the Philippines and South Korea. ""This latest incursion may seem alarming as China tends not to venture directly into Japanese airspace,"" Professor Ian Chong, a Chinese foreign policy expert at the National University of Singapore, told the BBC. ""Although it is consistent with China's behaviour as regards Taiwan and the Philippines in recent years."" In a single day last month, Taiwan's defence ministry reported 66 incursions by Chinese military aircraft across the so-called 'median line' - an informal border between the two sides in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing does not recognise the median line and, according to Taiwan, its planes have breached it hundreds of times in the past two years. The Philippines, meanwhile, recently called China the ""greatest disrupter of peace"" in South East Asia. Those comments followed a clash in a disputed part of the South China Sea on Sunday, over what Manila said was a resupply mission for fishermen. ""We have to expect these kinds of behaviour from China because this is a struggle,"" said Philippines Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro. ""We have to be ready to anticipate and to get used to these kinds of acts of China which are patently illegal, as we have repeatedly said,"" he told reporters on Monday. The US national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, is in Beijing this week for talks with China's foreign minister, Wang Yi. The two sides will discuss their differences over several flashpoints in the region and across the world. ""Washington probably will be looking at ways to avoid uncontrolled escalation, although this proposition can be difficult to put into practice,"" said Professor Chong.

Just 24 hours after Kearney won swimming gold in the S5 200m freestyle, the 27-year-old returned to the pool to successfully defend her 100m freestyle title. Paralympic and world champion Maisie Summers-Newton then retained her crown in the womenâs SM6 200m individual medley at La Defense Arena. Van Gass won the first British cycling gold on the track with victory over team-mate Fin Graham in the menâs 3,000m individual pursuit final, before Lizzi Jordan and pilot Dannielle Khan won womenâs B 1,000m time trial gold - with Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl taking bronze. Blaine Hunt started Friday's medal rush with silver in the menâs C4-5 1,000m time trial, while Matthew Robertson won men's C2 3,000m individual pursuit bronze. Brock Whiston clinched GB's ninth medal of the day with silver on her Paralympic debut in the women's SB8 100m breaststroke. That took ParalympicsGB's total haul to 15 medals - including six golds - after two days, second only to China (25 medals, 12 golds) in the table. Kearney and Summers-Newton power to swimming golds Van Gass wins cycling gold days after car accident Swimmer Hext to miss Paris 2024 on medical advice After winning gold on Thursday evening, Kearney forged ahead of Ukrainian silver medallist Iryna Poida on the last length to clinch her second triumph, with Italyâs Monica Boggioni taking bronze. Summers-Newton then seized her moment in the spotlight, powering clear of the field to take gold as team-mate Grace Harvey placed fourth, while Bruce Dee finished in the same position in the menâs race. Whiston then completed another successful day in the pool for GB, the 27-year-old finishing second to 16-year-old Spaniard Anastasiya Dmytriv Dmytriv in her final. Twin sisters Scarlett and Eliza Humphrey finished seventh and eighth respectively in their first Paralympic final in the S11 400m. This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Maisie Summers-Newton defends Para-swimming title Meanwhile, US Para-swimmer Christie Raleigh Crossley, who won silver in the women's S9 50m freestyle on Thursday evening, has claimed she is being targeted and bullied over her classification as a disabled athlete. The 37-year-old, who set a world record in the heats, said she received negative comments on social media before the final, ""including comments by a team member - a team-mate of mine"". She added: ""The fact it is a prominent team member of Team USA who has come after me the hardest, it's just absolutely disgusting."" The gold rush for GB started when Van Gass successfully defended the Paralympic title he won at his Games debut in Tokyo in the menâs 3,000m individual pursuit. The British Army veteran was the favourite going into the final having set a world record in the heats in 3:15.488 to finish ahead of team-mate Graham, who took silver in Tokyo. Van Gass, 38, quickly opened up a sizeable lead in the final and revealed afterwards his victory had come just a week after he was hit by a car on a training ride in Paris. ""I was heartbroken, I literally thought this could be my Paralympics done,"" Van Gass said. ""I took a day off to let my body settle, then I was back on the bike."" This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Jaco van Gass wins Britain's first cycling gold medal of the Games It was then Jordanâs turn to star, alongside pilot Khan, beating the time set by Australiaâs Jessica Gallagher and pilot Caitlin Ward to take gold. Silver medallist Hunt, sporting a magnificent handlebar moustache on his Paralympic debut, was one of three Britons in the menâs C4-5 1,000m time trial alongside Jody Cundy, who finished fourth at his eighth Paralympics, and Archie Atkinson in fifth. Robertson claimed bronze after beating Japanâs Shota Kawamoto in the menâs C2 3,000m individual pursuit. ParalympicsGB legend David Weir ensured he will have the chance to win his 11th medal at the Games on Saturday after safely qualifying for the men's T54 5,000m final. There the 45-year-old, winner of six Paralympic titles, will come up against reigning champion Marcel Hug of Switzerland in an eagerly anticipated showdown. Weir broke the T54 5,000m British record in February, finishing within 0.2 seconds of Hug as the Swiss set a world record. ""I don't set goals for medals anymore because I tried that in Tokyo and it just put too much pressure on me. I will just do my best tomorrow and hopefully it will be a medal. If it isn't, I'll move on to the next race,"" Weir said. David Weir has not won a Paralympic medal since winning four golds at London 2012 The first evening session of Para-athletics at Stade de France also saw Brazil's Petrucio Ferreira, the fastest Paralympian in the world, complete a T47 100m treble. Ferreira, who smashed the world record in a time of 10.29 seconds in 2022, won a third consecutive Paralympic title after successes at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 in a time of 10.68secs. ""I'm happy, lightning has struck for the third time at the Paralympic Games and I'm coming home with another medal. It's an emotion that's hard to describe,"" said Ferreira, who lost his left arm below the elbow in an accident at the age of two. Earlier, British debutant Zac Shaw qualified for Saturdayâs men's T12 100m final in a photo finish and will seek to upgrade his 2024 world bronze, while Eden Rainbow-Cooper qualified for the women's T54 5,000m final at her first Paralympics. ParalympicsGB history maker Rachel Choong, the first female to represent Great Britain in Para-badminton at a Paralympic Games, won her opening women's singles SH6 group match at La Chapelle Arena. Choong, 30, came back from a game down to beat Peru's Rubi Milagros Fernandez Vargas in a decider to put herself on course for a place in the quarter-finals. Elsewhere, British Para-rower Benjamin Pritchard, fifth in Tokyo, set a Paralympics Games best time in the PR1 menâs single sculls heats in 8:51.26 to reach the final. There was also a world best for Frankie Allen, Josh OâBrien, Giedre Rakauskaite, Ed Fuller and cox Erin Kennedy in the PR3 mixed coxed four, shaving more than three seconds off their own previous record. GB's wheelchair rugby team followed up victory over Australia with a narrow 55-53 win over Denmark in their preliminary-round Group B match , while Para-archer Phoebe Paterson Pine beat Ecuadorâs Diana Gonzabay Guaman to progress. Zakia Khudadadi, from Afghanistan, became the first member of the Paralympic Refugee team to win a medal in Paris with bronze in the K44 -47kg Para-taekwondo category. The 25-year-old, one of eight members of the Paralympic Refugee Team, said she hopes her achievement ""sends a message for all the refugees in the world to follow hope, follow freedom and follow peace"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74j2lz88pwo,The great gene editing debate: can it be safe and ethical?,A UK law allowing gene-edited food has been paused and some British scientists fear being overtaken.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:54.053467,China News,BBC,China,"There’s nothing new about genetic engineering. By cross-breeding plants and animals, our Stone Age ancestors realised they could boost the amount of food they produced. Modern genetics has enabled scientists to do much more: to make precise, targeted changes to the DNA of organisms in a lab. And that, they claim, will lead to new, more productive, disease-resistant crops and animals. The science is still in its infancy, but gene-edited foods are already on the shelves in Japan: tomatoes rich in a chemical that supposedly promotes calmness; red sea bream with extra edible flesh; and puffer fish that grow more quickly. In the US, too, firms are developing heat-resistant cattle, pit-less cherries and seedless blackberries. Supporters of the technology say it could reduce animal diseases and suffering and lead to the use of fewer antibiotics. They also believe it could tackle climate change by lowering emissions of the greenhouse gas methane - produced by livestock such as cows, goats and deer when their stomachs are breaking down hard fibres like grass for digestion. But opponents say gene editing is still not proven to be safe and that they remain concerned about the implications for animal welfare. Now a law permitting gene-edited food to be sold in the UK has been paused and some British scientists warn they could be overtaken by other countries. The new Labour government has pledged closer alignment with the European Union, particularly on regulations that might affect trade. And currently, the EU has much stricter rules around the commercial sale of gene-edited and genetically modified crops. The EU set stringent regulations on genetically modified (GM) crops decades ago because of safety concerns and public opposition to the technology. Gene-edited crops are covered by the same regulations. But to scientists, the terms “gene editing” and “GM” refer to different things.  GM, a much older technology, involves adding new genes to plants and animals to make them more productive or disease-resistant. Sometimes these new genes were from entirely different species - for example, a cotton plant with a scorpion gene to make it taste unpleasant to insects.  By contrast, gene editing involves making more precise changes to the plant or the animal’s DNA. These changes are often quite small ones, which involve editing sections of the DNA into a form that, its advocates say, could be produced through natural means like traditional cross-breeding, only much faster. Along with the US and China, the UK is among the countries that lead the world in gene editing. Last year the previous government passed the Precision Breeding Act, which paved the way for the commercial sale of gene-edited food in England. At the time, many scientists working in the field were overjoyed. “I thought: ‘Great, this is going to uncork a whole area of activity in the public and private sector’ and we could build an entrepreneurial community for gene editing in the UK,” says Prof Jonathan Napier of Rothamsted Research, a government agricultural research institute in Harpenden. But he says his hopes were soon dashed. For the law to come into effect, secondary legislation was required, and this was due to be passed by Parliament this July. But the earlier-than-expected election meant that it was not voted on by MPs and the Act is currently in limbo. Prof Napier was among 50 leading scientists to write to the newly appointed ministers at the Department for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) at the end of July asking them to act “quickly and decisively” to pass the secondary legislation. The Defra minister responsible, Daniel Zeichner, responded to the scientists’ plea last week by stating that the government was “now considering how to take forward the regulatory framework outlined in the Act and will share our plans with key interested parties soon”. One of the prime movers behind the scientists’ letter, leading expert Prof Tina Barsby, described the minister’s response as a “encouraging” but said that his promise of clarity “soon” had to mean really soon. Other countries, she said, were pressing ahead with their plans for gene edited-crops at great speed. Thailand recently joined Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil, Argentina and the USA in adopting regulations around gene editing. Even New Zealand, which according to Prof Barsby “has historically taken a more cautious regulatory approach to genetic technologies”, has announced that it will also introduce new legislation. Prof Barsby added: “With our world-leading science base in genetic research, we cannot afford to be left behind.” But Defra ministers also have to consider the views of environmental campaigners, such as Dr Helen Wallace of Genewatch UK, who have concerns about the “unwanted consequences” of the Precision Breeding Act. “If you remove these plants and animals from GM regulations then you don’t have the same degree of risk assessment, you don’t have labelling and you risk markets because many of them regulate them as GMOs,” she says. Dr Peter Stevenson, who is the chief policy advisor to UK-based Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), also fears that the technology will further add to the intensification of animal farming - with negative consequences. “The use of selective breeding over the past 50 years has brought a huge number of animal welfare problems,” he says. “Chickens have been bred to grow so quickly that their legs and hearts can’t properly support the rapidly developing body and as a result millions of animals are suffering from painful leg disorders, while others succumb to heart disease. “Do we really want to accelerate this process with gene editing?” CIWF’s biggest fear is that gene-editing animals to make them more resistant to diseases will mean that the industry will not be motivated to deal with the conditions that lead to the animals getting ill in the first place - such as crowded, unsanitary conditions. The intensity of the production of milk, meat, and eggs currently leaves many animals “exhausted and broken”, Mr Stevenson told BBC News. Any genetic alteration to an animal has the potential to have negative effects. But advocates say that for any commercial application, firms have to demonstrate to the regulator that their changes do not harm the animal and back this up with data. Indeed, many of those who argue for the use of gene-editing technology do so partly on animal welfare grounds - because it could make farm animals more resistant to disease and, since fewer would die as a result, fewer would be needed in the first place. Another of the letter’s signatories is Prof Helen Sang, who has laid the foundations for using gene editing to develop bird flu resistance in chickens. “With a virulent strain of (the pig disease) PRRS wiping out pig herds in Spain, African Swine Fever on the march north through Europe, and bird flu virus detected in both dairy cattle and their milk in the US, the importance of enabling all possible solutions, including precision breeding, cannot be overstated,” she said in response to Mr Zeichner. Some of the solutions to the problems Prof Sang mentions are already waiting in the wings. She works at the Roslin Institute, where Dolly the Sheep was cloned nearly 30 years ago. It now leads the world in developing gene-edited animals. Prof Sang’s colleagues at Roslin developed a strain of pig that is resistant to the PRRS pig disease six years ago. They can’t yet be commercially sold to UK pig farmers - but Genus, a British company that has commercialised the PRRS-resistant pigs, has received regulatory approval for their use in Colombia. The firm also has an application for permission to introduce the pigs to the US market which, if given the green light, could be approved as early as next spring. Genus is also planning to seek approval for the commercial use of their gene-edited pigs in Canada, Mexico and Japan. Despite the strong opinions on both sides, there appears to be scope for consensus around some applications of the technology. For instance, Mr Stevenson of CIWF does think it’s at least possible that gene editing could be applied in an ethical way. To do so, he says, it would need to meet three criteria: that any change it brings about is unlikely to cause animal welfare problems; that its objectives cannot be met by any less intensive means; and that it will not have the effect of entrenching industrialised livestock production. The PRRS-resistant pigs may tick all three boxes in specific circumstances, according to Mr Stevenson, as do efforts to use gene editing to enable the egg-production industry to produce female-only chicks to avoid the need for billions of male chicks being killed each year when they are just a day old. Likewise, Prof Mizeck Chagunda, who is the director of the Centre for Tropical Genetics and Health, which is also based at the Roslin Institute, believes both in the positive potential of gene editing and that it needs to be carefully overseen. He says the technology could improve the lives of the poorest farmers in the world: “70% to 80% of farmers are smallholding farms with two to three animals.” A devastating disease can leave a farmer and their family with nothing. “So, giving them animals that have been prepared with these technologies would help to protect them from this huge risk to their livelihoods,” says Prof Chagunda. However, Prof Chagunda warns that there needs to be good, strong regulations in place if this technology is to be accepted by the public. “Some changes can be too experimental, and we should not be doing them,” he says. “Scientists should be working with the regulatory authorities to achieve the good products that the farmers and consumers are looking for. We should be doing science that is ethical and at the same time helping humanity.” The gene editing work at Roslin is led by its director, Prof Bruce Whitelaw, who was a scientist at the institute when Dolly the sheep was cloned. In the past he has been through the process of explaining the potential benefits of seemingly alarming technological developments and he believes there is an urgent need to do so again now. “We are world leaders in the technology and sitting at top table in terms of developing it,” he says. “If we don’t have the legislation to do that, then our credentials to sit there will slowly wither away and we will lose investment, scientific talent and the boost to our economy to other countries.” There are lessons here from the past. Genetic modification was rejected by many consumers in the UK, the European Union and other countries 30 years ago because of its perceived unnaturalness. GM crops were publicly trampled by protestors who saw this as a technology that they didn’t need, want or consider safe. At the same time, scientists were angry and upset that what they believed to be their world-saving technology was being destroyed by, in their view, a wave of anti-scientific hysteria fuelled by the media. Gene editing seems to be a more palatable version of GM to some, arriving at a time when the debate is less polarised, the need for environmental solutions is even more urgent and there seems to be a greater readiness for some scientists and campaigners to see each other’s perspectives. Mr Stevenson of CWIF believes that in the long run, there has to be “huge reductions” in global livestock production to deal with climate change, but pragmatically, the fact that climate change is already destroying so many lives, the use of gene editing could be “legitimate”. But he is wary. “It is hard for me to trust that part of the scientific world who say: ‘Hey now, we have a new way to alter animals.’ “The danger is of animals being thought of as things, units of production, more so than they are now, because we can modify them to make them more amenable to our uses and taking us away from this notion of animals as sentient beings.” What happens next, not just in the UK, but the rest of the world, depends on whether the advocates of gene editing can convince the open-minded, but wary, such as Mr Stevenson, that they can act safely, ethically and in a way that makes lives better, not worse - for people and animals alike.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c703nzl25ypo,Canada's 2023 wildfires emitted more carbon than most countries,"Only China, the US and India emitted more carbon than last year's worst-on-record wildfire season.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:36:54.170302,China News,BBC,China,"Canada’s record wildfires last year produced more carbon emissions than the burning of fossil fuels in all but three major countries, according to a study released in the journal Nature. Only China, the US and India produced more carbon emissions than the 2023 Canadian fires. Unusually high temperatures and drought helped fuel the worst wildfire season in the country's history, burning 15m hectares (37m acres) of land - an area roughly the size of Florida. Scientists worry the exceptional burning of Canada’s boreal forest could affect global climate change projections, as the forests play a major role in capturing planet-warming carbon. The study, published on Wednesday, was authored by a team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology and others from universities in Canada, the Netherlands, and the US state Missouri.  The researchers calculated the total emissions from the fire at around 647 teragrams of carbon. A teragram is a million metric tons. This figure far exceeds Canada’s typical forest fire emissions, which have hovered between around 29 teragrams to 82 teragrams of carbon over the last decade. It is also five times more than Canada’s total annual emissions, and comparable to India, which emitted 740 teragrams of carbon last year. Brendan Byrne, a carbon cycle scientist with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and one of the authors of the study, said these figures are “shocking”. He said there is growing concern that wildfires of this magnitude could become more frequent in Canada, which would have an impact on the world's overall carbon footprint. Wildfires during the summer months in the country's boreal forests - northern forests made up of deciduous trees and conifers - are normal and common, but scientists say they have grown in intensity and frequency in recent years. In 2023, Canada experienced its hottest and driest summer on record since 1980. These conditions helped cause the worst wildfire season in the country’s history, with blazes burning coast-to-coast. While most fires were out by autumn, a record number continued to burn under thick layers of snow over the winter. This year’s wildfire season has been tamer than last, though it is on track to produce the second-highest carbon emissions of a Canadian wildfire season since 2003, according to August data by the European Union’s space programme. These projected emissions for the 2024 season are second only to last year’s devastating fires. Mr Byrne said it is difficult to predict what wildfire activity will look like in the future but his study warns that the same hot and dry conditions that led to Canada’s record wild season could become the norm by the 2050s. Other studies have projected that wildfires in Canada could become more frequent and intense in the future due to rising temperatures. In the study, researchers raise the alarm on the long-term consequences of increased wildfire activity in the country. Canada’s forests play an important role in capturing planet-warming carbon from the atmosphere, as they amount to 8.5% of the Earth’s total forested area. Their trees absorb fossil carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, slowing the pace of global warming. In recent years, studies have shown that the country’s boreal forests are burning faster than they can regrow. “This could have the long-term effect of reducing the ability of the forests to store carbon, and therefore there'd be more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than we would expect,” said Mr Byrne, the co-author of the study. This means that scientists may have to rethink just how much carbon humans can emit into the atmosphere without warming the planet beyond what the world can adapt to. “When we plan for the future, we basically expect that these forests will continue to take up carbon,” Mr Byrne told the BBC. The 2015 Paris Agreement has set a global warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above industrial times. Last year was the warmest year on record since 1850, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Canada is already feeling the impact of climate change. The country is warming at a rate twice as that of the global average due to its large land mass, and its Arctic region is warming three times as fast.  Last summer, temperatures in Canada were more than 2.2 C (4 F) above the historical average."

Stephen Clegg, William Ellard and then Alice Tai each topped the podium at La Defense Arena - with Clegg and Ellard doing so with world-record performances. Truesdale won women's K44 +65kg gold in dramatic circumstances, avoiding disqualification after a kick inadvertently caught Uzbekistan's Guljonoy Naimova in the face and left her opponent unable to continue. Bush then added ParalympicsGB's fifth gold of the day - and 11th of the Games - to take the team's medal total to 25. Further medals were won in the pool by Poppy Maskill, who won silver ahead of bronze medal-winning team-mate Louise Fiddes. There was also silver for Archie Atkinson at the velodrome, although the 20-year-old world record holder suffered gold-medal heartbreak as he fell just two laps from clinching a dominant victory in the men's C4 4,000m individual pursuit.  Para-archer Jodie Grinham, who is seven months pregnant, beat compatriot and defending champion Phoebe Paterson Pine in the women's individual compound bronze medal match. Bronze was also secured by table tennis players Paul Karabardak and Billy Shilton in the men's doubles MD14. This video can not be played Ellard sets a freestyle world record on a golden night for GB Great Britain's swimmers put on a superb display for their supporters inside La Defense Arena on Saturday as golds were captured and records tumbled in a frantic 40-minute medal rush. That began when Tokyo bronze medallist Clegg, 28, broke a 12-year world record in winning the men's S12 100m backstroke final, finishing ahead of Azerbaijan's Raman Salei and Ukraine's Yaroslav Denysenko in 59.02 seconds to win his first Paralympic title. Teenager Ellard celebrated his second medal of the Games in style with a S14 200m freestyle world record in one minute 51.30 secs, the 18-year-old beating Canada's Nicholas Bennett and Australia's Jack Ireland to add to his men's S14 100m butterfly silver. This video can not be played GB's Tai breaks Paralympic backstroke record Seven-time world champion Tai, 25, then earned her first individual Paralympic gold with a dominant display in the women's S8 100m backstroke, taking victory by six seconds to set a Paralympic record of 1:09.06. Tai, who finished ahead of Neutral Paralympic Athlete Viktoriia Ishchiulova and China's Zheng Tingting, missed the Tokyo Games because of injury and later chose to have her leg amputated. Maskill claimed her second medal of the Games, the 19-year-old adding women's S14 200m freestyle silver to her S14 100m butterfly gold, as team-mate Fiddes also made the podium in third - but Olivia Newman-Baronius missed out in fourth. Amy Truesdale won K44 +58kg bronze in Tokyo as Guljonoy Naimova won gold There was a dramatic conclusion to GB's medal-filled Saturday at the spectacular Grand Palais. Truesdale, 35, led her gold medal contest 8-2 against Tokyo champion Naimova before accidentally catching her opponent in the face. There were tense moments as the referee reviewed the incident while Naimova received treatment - but the Briton was eventually shown only a yellow card to avoid disqualification and be declared the champion with her opponent unable to continue. ""I didn't know what to do for a celebration. It's the last medal I needed to complete my Para-taekwondo career,"" said Truesdale, who did a cartwheel and the splits after her gold was confirmed. ""I just need to cry on my own for 20 minutes after the medal ceremony. People who know me after Tokyo, the hardest fight is the one that I have every day in my mind and I smashed that today, so I'm grateful that was the fight that I won."" Not long after those celebrations, Bush produced another golden moment for GB by beating Neutral Paralympic Athlete (NPA) Aliaskhab Ramazanov 5-0 in the men's  K44 +80kg final. Archie Atkinson led by more than seven seconds in pursuit of gold before his fall Those inside the velodrome were left stunned when Atkinson fell as he closed on men's C4 4,000m individual pursuit gold, having opened up a significant lead on Jozef Metelka. Staff raced to Atkinson's aid and assisted him off the track, but the Briton raised his arms to acknowledge the support of the crowd and celebrate silver on his Paralympic debut as the Slovakian finished the race and took the title.  Atkinson, favourite for gold after smashing the world record by five seconds in the heats, said: ""I dug as deep as I ever have and it showed. I just ran out of energy and went down. ""I'm so proud, so happy. A world record and a silver medal, I wouldn't have believed that in my wildest dreams."" Men's C3 3,000m individual pursuit champion Jaco van Gass had a second gold in his sights after setting a C3 world record in qualifying for the C1-3 1,000m time trial, but finished fourth behind C1 riders Li Zhangyu (C1) and Liang Weicong (C1) of China, and France's Alexandre Leaute (C2). Blaine Hunt also missed out on a medal in the men's C5 4,000m individual pursuit by finishing seventh, a day after he claimed silver in the menâs 4-5 1,000m time trial. Known as the 'Silver Bullet' because of his eye-catching silver helmet, Switzerland's Marcel Hug won four Paralympic titles in Tokyo three years ago - but his hopes of repeating that quadruple in Paris were ended by American Daniel Romanchuk in the men's T54 5,000m final. Romanchuk timed his sprint for the line to perfection to deny Hug, as GB's six-time Paralympic champion David Weir faded in the closing stages to finish eighth. ParalympicsGB still await their first Para-athletics medal of the Games, after two-time defending champion Sophie Hahn finished sixth in a high-quality women's T38 final won by Colombia's Karen Palomeque - who ran 12.26 secs to break Hahn's world record. Fellow Briton Maddie Down, 16, was eighth on her debut. Tokyo champion Thomas Young missed out on the podium in the men's T38 100m final by an agonising 0.01 as American Jaydin Blackwell clocked a world record 10.64 for gold. There was also a fourth-place finish for Zac Shaw in the men's T12 100m final, won by Turkey's Serkan Yildirim. Earlier in the day, Eden Rainbow-Cooper's medal hopes were ended by a collision at the start of the women's T54 5,000m final, won by Switzerland's Paralympic and world champion Catherine DeBrunner in a Games record of 10:43.62.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c703nzl25ypo,Canada's 2023 wildfires emitted more carbon than most countries,"Only China, the US and India emitted more carbon than last year's worst-on-record wildfire season.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:00.893532,China News,BBC,China,"Canada’s record wildfires last year produced more carbon emissions than the burning of fossil fuels in all but three major countries, according to a study released in the journal Nature. Only China, the US and India produced more carbon emissions than the 2023 Canadian fires. Unusually high temperatures and drought helped fuel the worst wildfire season in the country's history, burning 15m hectares (37m acres) of land - an area roughly the size of Florida. Scientists worry the exceptional burning of Canada’s boreal forest could affect global climate change projections, as the forests play a major role in capturing planet-warming carbon. The study, published on Wednesday, was authored by a team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology and others from universities in Canada, the Netherlands, and the US state Missouri.  The researchers calculated the total emissions from the fire at around 647 teragrams of carbon. A teragram is a million metric tons. This figure far exceeds Canada’s typical forest fire emissions, which have hovered between around 29 teragrams to 82 teragrams of carbon over the last decade. It is also five times more than Canada’s total annual emissions, and comparable to India, which emitted 740 teragrams of carbon last year. Brendan Byrne, a carbon cycle scientist with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and one of the authors of the study, said these figures are “shocking”. He said there is growing concern that wildfires of this magnitude could become more frequent in Canada, which would have an impact on the world's overall carbon footprint. Wildfires during the summer months in the country's boreal forests - northern forests made up of deciduous trees and conifers - are normal and common, but scientists say they have grown in intensity and frequency in recent years. In 2023, Canada experienced its hottest and driest summer on record since 1980. These conditions helped cause the worst wildfire season in the country’s history, with blazes burning coast-to-coast. While most fires were out by autumn, a record number continued to burn under thick layers of snow over the winter. This year’s wildfire season has been tamer than last, though it is on track to produce the second-highest carbon emissions of a Canadian wildfire season since 2003, according to August data by the European Union’s space programme. These projected emissions for the 2024 season are second only to last year’s devastating fires. Mr Byrne said it is difficult to predict what wildfire activity will look like in the future but his study warns that the same hot and dry conditions that led to Canada’s record wild season could become the norm by the 2050s. Other studies have projected that wildfires in Canada could become more frequent and intense in the future due to rising temperatures. In the study, researchers raise the alarm on the long-term consequences of increased wildfire activity in the country. Canada’s forests play an important role in capturing planet-warming carbon from the atmosphere, as they amount to 8.5% of the Earth’s total forested area. Their trees absorb fossil carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, slowing the pace of global warming. In recent years, studies have shown that the country’s boreal forests are burning faster than they can regrow. “This could have the long-term effect of reducing the ability of the forests to store carbon, and therefore there'd be more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than we would expect,” said Mr Byrne, the co-author of the study. This means that scientists may have to rethink just how much carbon humans can emit into the atmosphere without warming the planet beyond what the world can adapt to. “When we plan for the future, we basically expect that these forests will continue to take up carbon,” Mr Byrne told the BBC. The 2015 Paris Agreement has set a global warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above industrial times. Last year was the warmest year on record since 1850, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Canada is already feeling the impact of climate change. The country is warming at a rate twice as that of the global average due to its large land mass, and its Arctic region is warming three times as fast.  Last summer, temperatures in Canada were more than 2.2 C (4 F) above the historical average."

The Great Britain competitor from Larne was was always behind in the contest, chasing the game after going 0-4 down after two ends. Taggart was beaten 3-2 Korea's Soyeong in the semi-finals earlier on Sunday.  âIâm absolutely gutted - I just feel like Iâve worked so hard for this and I feel like Iâve let my friends and family down,"" she said. ""Iâm gutted for me, my family and for the community I live in who really support me and are massive advocates of me. Iâm absolutely devastated. I need to take a little bit of a break and decide what I do from there. Iâm just feeling absolutely gutted and devastated right now."" The 29-year-old, who first competed at Rio in 2016 and is now a three-time Paralympian, won two gold medals at the 2022 Boccia World Cup in Portugal and later the same year clinched gold at the Boccia World Championships in Rio. Taggart will be back on court to play as part of the BC1/2 Team along with Kayleigh Haggo and David Smith OBE. âItâs always a good opportunity to play in the team and itâs something that definitely picks up my mood so it will be good to do that.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240829-healing-generational-trauma-and-mental-health-by-understanding-ancestry,How your ancestors can heal you,Learning about ancestry can boost mental health and act as a powerful tool in helping heal generational trauma.,30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:01.128312,China News,BBC,China,"Learning about ancestry can boost mental health and act as a powerful tool in helping heal generational trauma. I often think about my grandfather. Born in 1915 in the Chinese countryside to a family of poor farmers, he was the first in the village to go to university. He barely survived being a political prisoner in brutal concentration camps – a punishment for being a journalist speaking against the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT), the government in power at the time. He survived a world war, a civil war and a cultural revolution that divided a nation and persecuted educated people such as himself. Yet despite all these hurdles, he went on to live a long and fulfilling life. Reflecting on his story reminds me how different my life would be if my grandfather hadn't defied his father and gone off to university. As well as how different it would be, if his daughter (my mother) hadn't also defied her father's wishes, and left China in 1989 to study a master's degree in the UK. I feel incredibly grateful and proud when I think about how brave they were to take their respective leaps. Their bravery has afforded me educational opportunities that some of my extended family, still living in that small village in rural China, could have only dreamt of growing up. Nor am I unique in valuing this sense of connection to the choices of those who've come before me. In today's fast-paced world, many of us feel disconnected – not only from others but from ourselves. Yet research suggests that engaging with our ancestry can have profound psychological benefits: helping individuals to thrive by building emotional resilience, inspiring personal growth and disrupting cycles of generational trauma. Whether driven by curiosity or uncovering challenging truths, discovering our heritage can allow us to put our own experiences into perspective. It can remind us that even negative emotions can be reframed into empowering narratives of resilience, becoming a powerful tool to heal trauma and prevent history repeating itself down later generations. According to Susan Moore, an emeritus professor of psychology at Swinburne University of Technology, family stories about overcoming adversity can be ""empowering"" when they are passed down to new generations. Her research on ancestry and well-being finds that exploring our family history can offer significant psychological benefits. ""Young people, children and teenagers who know more about their family history have higher levels of satisfaction and wellbeing,"" she says. The Science of Happiness You can find out more about the benefits of thinking about our ancestors in this episode of The Science of Happiness on BBC Sounds, executive-produced by Shuka Kalantari and produced by Haley Gray. Listen to more episodes of The Science of Happiness. Moore has conducted and analysed of a survey of almost 1,000 Australian hobbyist genealogists to explore the psychosocial drivers behind researching family history.  She found that engaging in ancestry research often leads to people feeling more in control of their lives and experiencing a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world – including gratitude for the struggles their predecessors faced on behalf of their children. Other studies, too, show that younger people's knowledge of family history contributes to a developing sense of self. And that it can be a useful clinical indicator of psychological wellbeing and have a positive impact in clinical and educational settings. When oral historian and cultural leader Mi'Jan Celie Tho-Biaz reflected on her great-great-grandmother Emma's journey from slavery to freedom, it became a source of strength and resilience as she navigated her own challenges after her father's passing. Spending time communicating to ancestors, she told me, whether it was through writing, research, or meditation, helped ground her in everyday life – supporting her sense of identity and agency. ""My DNA is made of people who have defied odds, I come from people who worked to attain freedom and love,"" she says. ""The huge stakes and odds they beat, just for me to exist... [it] makes you feel like you have superpowers."" Connecting with ancestry as a form of therapy can thus have tangible mental health benefits, not least since the hardships and trauma that ancestors experienced can affect later generations. Understanding that history can help break intergenerational trauma.   Moore recounts the story of a young man whose father suicided at the age of 45. Upon conversing with his grandmother, he discovered that his late grandfather had done the same at a similar age. Having had a history of depression, learning this about his family motivated him to finally seek help and start therapy. More like this: • Can trauma's legacy be passed down the generations? • I rewired my brain in six weeks • How to optimise your slumber Helen Parker-Drabble, a social historian and former counsellor, says for some people engaging with ancestry can be ""absolutely life-changing"" in improving mental health. She notes one individual who discovered they were not the first in their family to suffer from addiction. ""It can help them reframe their experience and let go of some of that guilt, shame, and self-hatred they had been carrying and treat themselves more kindly,"" she says. Digging into one's past is not always a positive process however. ""Sometimes people find out things [about their ancestors] they're not happy about,"" says Moore. Some discoveries, such as murder, family secrets, or betrayal of ancestors can challenge mental health. Moore's research found that around two-thirds of family historians experienced strong negative emotions like sorrow or anger through researching their ancestors; however nearly all had experienced strong positive emotions such as joy or pride. By understanding the past in context and acknowledging sources of dysfunctionality, it is possible to rework sadness into a positive family narrative of resilience and strength, says Moore. It is important, however, that such work is done in a supportive environment. A survey by Clive Haydon and his colleagues of 239 university students aged 18-20 revealed the positive influence of understanding family history – but also highlighted the need to facilitate the exploration process in ""a context of warmth and mutual respect”. In my own case, my grandfather, Hongren Tang, passed away when I was a teenager. Separated by a continent, language and culture, I couldn't fully appreciate or understand his experiences until years later. He was around my age when he was a political prisoner, and I often wonder what I could learn from his struggles during my own times of doubt and crisis. What advice would he have when I feel lost? I don't know the answer, but the connection I have to my ancestors has become a source of inspiration and strength during moments of uncertainty.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx6462wl07o,Why South Africans are flocking to a Chinese hospital ship,Cape Town residents queue for free medical care due to the poor state of the country's health sector.,28 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:01.244263,China News,BBC,China,"Miserable winter weather, snow on Table Mountain and gale force winds have not dampened Cape Town residents’ enthusiasm for free medical care being offered on a Chinese ship, currently docked in the South African city’s harbour. A financial crisis in one of Africa’s biggest and most developed economies has left public services underfunded, and many people say they cannot afford private healthcare because of soaring prices. It comes months after the government signed into law a controversial new health scheme, which aims to provide universal healthcare for all, but is facing threats of legal challenges. Since China's so-called Peace Ark arrived last week, more than 2,000 South Africans have been treated on board - ranging from maternity check-ups and cataract surgeries to cupping therapy. China enjoys a strong political partnership with South Africa, and this is Beijing's latest show of soft power. Lucy Mnyani told local media she was happy to see images of her unborn child for the first time: “I had been going to the day hospitals in Gugulethu and Langa [townships] and they never sent me for a CT scan.” Another person who queued up, Joseph Williams, told national broadcaster SABC: “When you go the local clinic you sit for hours and hours before they help you, depending on your condition. “Here the service was very quick so I’m grateful that I came. I actually got the results for what I came for.” Officials say the ship has a capacity of 700 patients each day and the service forms part of a joint exercise between the South African and Chinese armies. The ship has 100 people on board with 300 beds, 20 intensive care beds, operating theatres, clinical departments and even a rescue helicopter. The Peace Ark's first two days saw pre-selected people being offered treatment before it was extended to the general public on Monday. “We arranged with the night shelters to provide a service for people who live on the streets of Cape Town because they don’t have access to any healthcare,” Saadiq Kariem, head of Western Cape’s Health Department, told the BBC. He added that elderly people living in care homes had also been brought in for medical care, and Western Cape health staff were offered wellness visits. “From registering to completing my care took me an hour,” said Dr Kariem, who himself went for a medical check-up and joined the queue as an ordinary citizen. “It’s something that would take much longer at our public healthcare facilities because you have many more people requiring services.” A total of 57 surgeries have been carried out so far, a tiny dent in the province's waiting list of 80,000 patients.  And this is in Western Cape province, which arguably has one of the best health systems in the country. “These have been mostly orthopaedic, cataract and a few tubal ligation surgeries for women who no longer wish to fall pregnant,” Dr Kariem said. The popularity of the Peace Ark is telling, said Dr Shuaib Manjra, chairperson of the Health Justice Initiative: ""It shows the public health system in the province and in the country is not serving the people as it should.  ""Often you find people spending an entire day at a clinic waiting to be seen. There are major backlogs at hospitals, budgets and posts are being cut, and often this results in people missing out on up to two days of work after waiting to be seen for a simple procedure,"" he told the BBC. The African National Congress (ANC) says its National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme will be a huge improvement as all services at both public and private facilities will be free at the point of care – paid out of a central fund. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has insisted it will still be implemented despite the party losing its parliamentary majority in May, and going into coalition with parties like the Democratic Alliance (DA) that oppose some aspects of the scheme. It will cause a massive shake-up of the health sector, but critics fear it could prompt an exodus of health professionals to find employment abroad. The scheme is being vociferously opposed by private health companies as it bars people from taking out private health insurance for treatment. At the moment about 14% of the population have private medical care, with the remaining 86% relying on overburdened state clinics and hospitals. Last week, Business Unity South Africa and the South African Medical Association refused to sign what is known as the “health compact” - an annual agreement with the president that sets out how various sectors are to address health challenges in the coming year. The two organisations - which between them represent private businesses and 12,000 doctors - are angry about the NHI in its current form, feeling it has been forced upon them. Dr Manjra said the NHI was a ""noble idea"" but he understood the reservations. ""Our history of corruption and incompetence will potentially destroy the entire health sector. There's an estimate that in some cases up to a third of the health budget is lost through corruption."" Dealing with these issues within the public health sector should be the priority, he said. Siphiwe Dlamini, spokesman for the South African army, told the BBC the response to the Peace Ark had been overwhelming with good feedback about “the attention and care received”. The floating hospital leaves Cape Town on Thursday for Angola before moving on to several other countries. It has already visited the Seychelles, Tanzania, Madagascar and Mozambique - on this its 10th excursion since being commissioned in 2008. The initiative is seen as a further step in China’s efforts to increase its influence on the African continent. Over the past two decades its trade with Africa has grown steadily, while Beijing has also been increasingly involved in the construction sector - including building large sports stadiums in several parts of the continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240829-the-search-for-the-worlds-biggest-electric-vehicles,The vehicles pushing the limits of electric power,How much energy you can pack into a battery is one limit on how big an EV can get – but meet the EVs ditching batteries altogether to attain mammoth proportions.,1 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:01.357835,China News,BBC,China,"How much energy you can pack into a battery is one limit on how big an EV can get – but meet the EVs ditching batteries altogether to attain mammoth proportions. This is no golf cart. This is one of the biggest mining excavators in the world. The clawed bucket it uses for tearing at mineral-laced rock is so big that you could fit more than 3,000 footballs in it. The driver sits in a cab roughly as high up as the roof on an average two-storey British house. And the excavator's hefty caterpillar tracks alone are just shy of 3m (10ft) tall – and about as long as a London bus. It weighs 778 tonnes in total and you might be forgiven for thinking that this beast, the PC8000-11 surface mining excavator made by Komatsu, could only run on a fossil fuel like diesel. Surely such a behemoth demands all the raw, dirty power of combustion to function? Well, there is a diesel model – but Komatsu have recently brought out an electric equivalent. And it works just the same. ""We are not sacrificing performance when you go electric,"" says Thomas Jordan, marketing manager at Komatsu Germany. While the diesel excavator guzzles more than 400 litres (88 gallons) of fuel per hour, according to Komatsu, the electric alternative relies instead on a chunky power cable – meaning the vehicle itself produces zero emissions. When comparing diesel and electric versions of the excavator used by one Swedish customer, well-to-wheel emissions are 95% lower for the electric type, according to Komatsu. This customer has access to electricity from nuclear and hydro sources. Mining companies are increasingly interested in options like this, says Jordan. ""We see a trend for more electrification, that's definitely the case."" BBC Future Planet recently went on a hunt for some of the biggest electric vehicles in the world – by size and weight. There is no shortage of impressive examples, from giant mining machines to trains and cargo ships. Bigger electric excavators than the PC8000-11 exist, but Komatsu's vehicle is worth noting for the particularly tough job it does, stresses Jordan. The excavator's hydraulics system allows it to tackle rock – in this class of machinery, the PC8000-11 was the biggest we could find in terms of tonnage. ""If you go to the big copper mines and gold mines, you will find hard material where you need that kind of hydraulic excavator,"" says Jordan. For a larger electric excavator still, consider one of the biggest vehicles ever built, regardless of fuel type. It holds the Guinness World Record for heaviest land vehicle and it's not even new, having been manufactured way back in the 1990s by the German mining equipment firm Takraf. The colossal Bagger 293 bucket-wheel excavator is used for strip-mining operations in Germany and it weighs a barely believable 14,200 tonnes. That's about the same as 78 empty Boeing 747-400s. Although the Bagger 293 dwarfs the PC8000-11 in raw tonnage, its job is a little less intense – moving earth and soil instead of rock. Nevertheless, the Bagger 293 requires so much energy that, just like the PC8000-11, it is connected to an electric power source by a cable, rather than using an on-board battery. Ironically, the adoption of electric vehicles in mining has been going on for decades partly because coal mines tend to have their own small power plants, says Jordan. It means they can power electric vehicles on-site at a low cost – albeit using a very polluting power source. Today, many different kinds of mines are turning to electric vehicles as a way of reducing carbon emissions from their operations. Some mines now even claim to run their machinery largely on renewable electricity. However, reducing emissions from operations only gets you so far – when it comes to coal mining, for instance, the climate-warming emissions from burning its products aren't reduced at all by electrifying the equipment used for extraction. Mining remains a polluting and dangerous activity in many parts of the world. Globally, extractive industries, including mining, cause an estimated €400bn to €5tn ($440bn to $5.5tn/£340bn to £4.3tn) in environmental damage each year by one estimate. That's even before products such as fossil fuels are burned. But mining is also important for the extraction of minerals such as nickel, copper and gold, which can be used in consumer electronics, solar panels and, yes, electric vehicles. ""For large mining countries like Chile and Australia, they are all looking to the potential to electrify their mining industry,"" says Zhenying Shao, senior researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation. She and colleagues have interviewed mine workers who recently started using electric trucks and excavators. Their comments tend to be positive – particularly about the reduction in air pollution and noise made by the vehicles, she says. ""They're the ones who drive those machines, [so] that really counts."" Komatsu notes that there are limitations to cable-powered vehicles. The PC8000-11's electric cable is 300m (980ft) long. It's a considerable range, but when the excavator needs to go somewhere else, a small electrical sub-station also has to be relocated in order to power it. Outside of mining, there are plenty of other examples of mighty electric vehicles. How much they are capable of dragging behind them can matter for certain applications, as well as their own size and weight. Take the Iveco electric van that, although not large itself, managed to tow 153.58 tonnes. The towed load comprised of a lorry carrying a digger, a truck filled with rocks and an airport fire engine all strung together, one behind the other. But in terms of weight, heavy goods vehicles are among the largest EVs you might yourself sharing the road with. Volvo's FH Electric truck, if you include its double trailer and load, is among contenders for the heaviest battery-powered electric road vehicle. One currently being trialled in Gothenburg, Sweden, features a 74 tonne, 13m-long (43ft) version of this truck and trailer system. ""They are running in commercial traffic every day,"" says Niklas Andersson, director of electric solutions at Volvo Trucks of the tests. A slightly lighter, 68-tonne version of this setup is also running in Finland on a 160km (99 mile) route. Although the truck's battery can usually power the vehicle across that entire distance without requiring a recharge, weather conditions can affect performance, says Andersson. ""When it's cold you have like 10cm [4in] of slush on the road, which means that the rolling resistance is really bad. Then we have to charge during the way."" He notes that the batteries for these trucks have become rapidly more energy-dense over time. The first version of the battery launched by Volvo Trucks in 2019 weighed about 500kg (1,100lb) and offered 49 kWh of energy. Last year, the company came up with a new battery that is roughly the same size and weight but offers nearly twice as much power – 94 kWh, says Andersson. The rate of improvement of electric vehicle batteries in recent years has surprised Chris Thorne, director of strategy and operations at UMAS, a maritime consultancy, and advises on various power sources for marine industries. ""In 2015, I'm pretty sure at some point I said heavy goods vehicles will never be battery electric and five years later I was working on it. It taught me a hard lesson,"" he jokes. Electric drivetrains are actually well-suited to heavy duty machines because they don't require the system of shafts and gears used in petrol and diesel vehicles – these can require higher maintenance over time. ""You have a lot of flexibility in how you lay the vehicle out. You can have a motor on each wheel if you want to,"" adds Thorne. And he points out that batteries are helpfully modular. You can just keep adding modules until you get the amount of power you need. There are practical limits, of course. Something as large as the PC8000-11, for example, can't run on a battery yet because, with today's technology, the battery pack would weigh more than half as much as the vehicle itself, according to Komatsu. Energy density, the amount of power you can pack into a given volume, is still a barrier for electrifying some vehicles – notably, large aircraft. Though research suggests we might one day see electric passenger aircraft capable of carrying as many as 90 people. The biggest electric planes today can accommodate a maximum of around nine passengers. The energy density problem also limits electrification of ships, though some surprisingly hefty vessels are beginning to run on battery power. In Incat Tasmania, an Australian shipyard, a ferry currently known as Incat Hull 096, is under construction. When complete, it is planned to have capacity for 2,100 passengers and 225 vehicles – and will be 130m (427ft) long. It was ordered by a Uruguay-based ferry operator. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. Finally, the most powerful electric train in the world is perhaps the Shen24 in China. It is capable of carrying more than 10,000 tonnes – of coal – at up to 120km/h (75 mph). Thorne notes that it isn't really surprising that electric vehicles are becoming so common in heavy industry. These machines have long service lives, tough jobs and cost a lot to buy upfront. So if you can make them cheap to run, say on locally-sourced renewable electricity, and easier to maintain with fewer moving parts than the fossil-fuel-powered alternatives, then they soon become attractive. On the other hand, not every company or industry is ready to embrace these vehicles just yet. There may be questions over the safety of giant batteries in certain contexts where vehicles might be involved in collisions, for example. Shao says that, while heavy-duty battery electric vehicles are clearly highly capable, some companies may still hesitate about switching to them. ""It's a new technology,"" she says. ""The industry has been dominated by diesel for so long."" -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

The 33-year-old threw 74.49 metres with his fourth effort at Stade de France on Thursday. That bettered the previous record of 71.01m - set by Aleksandr Svechnikov of Uzbekistan in 2017 - by 3.48m. Pembroke had already broken Svechnikov's mark with an effort of 71.15m from his third throw, before going even further. The Briton retains the title he won three years ago in Tokyo, having also won two world titles since the last Games. His gold rounded off a successful evening of athletics for ParalympicsGB, after Sammi Kinghorn won her fourth medal in Paris with silver in the women's T53 400m. What's happening and when at the Paris Paralympics? Paris 2024 Paralympics medal table All you need to know about the Paris Paralympics In the morning session, Anna Nicholson was ""over the moon"" to win bronze in the women's F35 shot put amid heavy rain. She made light of the conditions to throw 9.44 metres - just 3cm short of her personal best - and claim third place. However, team-mate Olivia Breen missed out on a Paralympic medal by the tightest of margins in the women's T38 long jump. Breen's best jump was 4.99 metres, level with bronze medal winner Karen Palomeque Moreno of Colombia.  But because Palomeque Moreno's second best jump of 4.89m was longer than Breen's 4.79m, the South American made it on to the podium. Maddie Down came sixth behind Breen in the T38 long jump, while Funmi Oduwaiye finished fifth in the women's F64 shot put. In the evening, GB's Nathan Maguire narrowly missed out on a medal in the men's T54 800m, as he finished fourth just 0.11secs behind bronze medallist Marcel Hug of Switzerland. Melanie Woods was sixth in the women's 400m T54 final, while Dan Greaves and Harrison Walsh finished sixth and seventh respectively in the men's F64 shot put. GB's Marcus Perrineau Daley progressed to the final of the men's T52 100m by finishing second in his heat with a new personal best of 16.87 seconds. Sport-by-sport guide to Paris 2024 Paralympics Paralympics 2024: What you need to know about classification Paralympics 2024: Who has been selected for the GB team? Pembroke's throw in the Paralympic final broke the previous world record by more than three metres Pembroke has come to dominate his discipline since returning to athletics following a seven-year break, having sustained an injury while trying to qualify for the London 2012 Olympics. With his eyesight deteriorating, he chose to leave sport behind - but returned to Para-sport in 2019, competing against other visually impaired athletes. Nowhere has that dominance been more obvious than on Thursday night in Paris, where he set records on top of records to the astonishment and delight of the crowd. Pembroke revelled in the atmosphere, celebrating wildly after both world records before whipping up the crowd for his final effort - a victory throw, with gold already assured. ""I've never had anything like that before in my life,"" he said. ""The crowd just got behind me, that was my secret weapon. I've got a taste of it and I want some more ' LA here I come. ""That crowd out there was so good to me, I wanted to do a lap of honour to celebrate them sharing it with me.  ""It will stay with me for the rest of my life. You had people all around the world, getting the same joy I was getting, it was brilliant."" Pembroke admitted even he was surprised to have thrown further than 74 metres, but feels he is now capable of even more following a recent diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a condition that causes joint pain if untreated. ""I've had no pain in my body for two months,"" he said. ""I've changed my diet, got the right medication. If I get a year's training behind me, who knows what can happen."" Iran'âs Ali Pirouj took silver as he threw 69.74m - nearly five metres off Pembroke - while Ulcier Aguilera Cruz of Cuba won bronze. Paris 2024 Paralympics Sammi Kinghorn now has six Paralympic medals, with two in Tokyo and four in Paris After medalling in all four of her events in Paris, Kinghorn says she has finally learned to enjoy competing for the first time. The 28-year-old added to the gold she won in the 100m on Wednesday night, as well as the silvers she earned in the T53 800m and T54 1500m. Catherine Debrunner, who Kinghorn beat in the 100m final, got a measure of revenge by winning gold - her fourth of these Games -  in a new Paralympic record time of 51.60 seconds, as 2016 champion Zhou Hongzhuan of China took bronze. Kinghorn, who said she had been up until 3am after winning her first Paralympic gold the previous night, said she had  made a conscious effort to enjoy these Games more than Tokyo, where she claimed two medals. ""It's been amazing, I've done a lot better than I thought I would coming in,"" she said.  ""It's definitely been my best Games by far. You can get wrapped up and quite nervous, I have never really enjoyed the whole experience. ""I just wanted to enjoy this, you never know if it will be your last Games. Sometimes I can be quite bad at taking myself off and not socialising because I get quite nervous, I donât want to do that. ""We have been playing a lot of games of Monopoly Deal, it has been getting quite competitive, a lot of games through the team. ""As I have got older, I have realised it is not the medals which are making you happy. At Tokyo I thought 'if I win a Paralympic medal I'll be the happiest person ever', then I came away and I realised they haven't made me any happier. So going into these Games that's what I wanted to make sure of - that I was happy."" Kinghorn has plans to combat the post-Games blues this time - she is going to Singapore to watch Formula One in the coming weeks - but before then she is going to celebrate with her family. ""My dad is my biggest fan, and the person who thinks I can conquer the world,"" she said."

Schrager took silver in the women's C1-3 3000m individual pursuit, while Bate and pilot Chris Latham also came second, in the men's B 4000m individual pursuit final. Cox did not finish in the final of the women's C4-5 500m time trial, as the British athlete missed out on the first gold medal of the Games. Four-time Paralympic champion Cox had qualified second fastest for the final in Paris but endured a bad start in the medal race, and slipped as she tried to correct herself before hitting the velodrome track on the first corner. Schrager, world champion in her discipline, then hoped to pick up GB's first gold but had to settle for silver after being dominated by Xiaomei Wang of China in the final. Wang finished nearly 10 seconds ahead of Schrager and almost lapped her, in the process of setting a new world record. Schrager, 23, is world champion at C2 level but on her Paralympic debut could not find a way to gold in the combined category competed at these Games. Schrager took silver behind Xiaomei Wang of China Schrager was nevertheless delighted with a debut Games medal, and said: ""Honestly it's just mesmerising, I've dreamed of this since I was a kid. I'll be looking at it [her medal] for years to come. ""My coach said to me, 'four years' time you will have that gold', we've made that pact now."" Schrager had a surprise bonus too, when she received her medal from cinema legend Jackie Chan on the podium. ""It was just insane!"" she said.

Bate had earlier taken the world record from Bangma in qualifying, only for the Dutchman to snatch it back by riding a second quicker before cruising to gold. It is nevertheless an impressive showing from 47-year-old Bate, twice a Paralympic champion and now a five-time medallist in possibly his final Games. ""Everything has been geared towards this event, I haven't thought much beyond that,"" he said, when asked if he will go for LA 2028. ""If this is my last event, a hell of a way to go out.

Kadeena Cox had to be helped from the track after crashing in the women's C4-5 500m time trial final It was a dramatic afternoon in the velodrome after Cox - who has multiple sclerosis and suffered a calf injury in the build-up to the Games - had to be helped off the track by support staff. The 33-year-old was not allowed to restart, as rules brought in before these Games only permit a second attempt if there is a mechnical fault with a bike. ""It was a weird one. I didn't feel comfortable in the gate, my right side is my weak side - I just over-compensated and couldn't balance on my weaker side, I was all over the shop,"" Cox told Channel 4. Dutch rider Caroline Groot won the first gold of the Games in a time of 35.566 seconds. Hosts France picked up their first medal as Marie Patouillet took silver, with Canadaâs Katie OâBrien winning bronze. Reigning world champion Cox had looked strong in qualifying, recording 35.436 seconds â the second quickest overall after Groot, and ultimately faster than the time the Dutch athlete rode in the medal final. Cox has previously been dominant in this event, having won gold at the 2016 and 2020 Paralympics - but found only heartbreak here. She was visibly emotional and unsteady on her feet as she was helped from the track, before being embraced and comforted by GB staff. However, BBC Sport has been told that Cox has not sustained a significant injury, whether new or to her previously problematic calf.  ""I got back on the bike two weeks ago. It has been a rubbish year, this time last year I couldn't walk as I had a relapse which effected my right side - I guess that's MS,"" she said. ""The fact I got here is amazing."" She may be able to come back and compete for a medal later in the Games, with the mixed C1-5 team sprint taking place on Sunday.

And it is more than 75 years since GB last appeared at the Winter Olympics. This weekend 50-year-old Russell can celebrate a decade in charge by guiding the national side into the most prestigious competition in international ice hockey for the first time since 1948. GB face hosts Denmark, Norway and Japan in Aalborg between 29 August and 1 September, with the winner of final qualifying group F sealing a place at the 2026 Winter Games in Milan. For Russell, who also coaches Cardiff Devils, it could mark another significant landmark in the emergence of the British team since he took over. It is a journey that initially he was reticent to even start. In 2014 when Russell was director of hockey at the Okanagan Hockey Academy in Swindon, he was becoming sought after by clubs in the Elite League (EIHL) and the English Premier Ice Hockey League (EPIHL). At the same time UK hockey were looking to fill a vacant position. âThey were trying to get a couple of coaches for the GB senior team, and it didnât work out and they called me,"" recalled Russell. âThey said to me, âWeâve spoken to a couple of high-end players, and they want you to coach the teamâ. âI said, âI donât want to coach the GB national team and they were like, âWhat?â âI said, âLook, itâs an amazing thing to even be offered, but I just donât think I can do that'. âThey said, âWe want you to do it,â and thatâs where it all started.â Russell, having returned to club hockey as head coach at Milton Keynes Lightning,  was persuaded to take on the national role on a part-time basis. He took charge of a Great Britain team in the third tier of world hockey, regularly ranked around 25th, and pretty much going nowhere. In 2018 Great Britain won Division I, Group A of the 2018 World Championships in Budapest to join ice hockey's top flight elite Russellâs first two World Championship campaigns were relatively successful but also hugely frustrating. In both 2015 and 2016 Great Britain finished second. On both occasions 2-1 defeats - to Lithuania and Ukraine - in their final games cost them first place and promotion. âI think that was a good lesson for the guys, they were hungrier than ever after that,"" said Russell. âWe had a good core at that time, we had the captains of Sheffield Steelers, Nottingham Panthers and the Cardiff Devils in our team, so we had a good dressing room."" Then in 2017 the British rise up the world hockey order began. In Belfast, Great Britain swept aside their opponents with five wins from five, including beating the Netherlands 14-0. âWe dominated that tournament and from there it just propelled, everything just came together,"" remembers Russell. Will GB ice hockey reach first Winter Olympics since 1948? GB break winless run with Austria victory Great Britain had secured promotion to the second tier of the 2018 World Championships to face Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Poland and Slovenia. âWe were the favourites to get relegated and went on that crazy journey,"" said Russell. âI remember we played the first game against Slovenia who had just been in the Olympics with the same team and done well and [netminder] Ben Bowns was the best player on the ice, he was fantastic. âWe won that game 3-1 and it was a bit like, âOh, weâre alright hereâ."" Despite losing the second game heavily to Kazakhstan victories against Poland and Italy gave them a chance to win the gold medal against hosts Hungary in front of 8,000 spectators. They took it in a shootout with a save from Bowns which earned them promotion to ice hockeyâs top level. âIt was probably the best atmosphere Iâve experienced in my life in any rink Iâve ever coached in. âThat place was shaking, they were the home nation, how quick that quietened was a pretty cool experience. âWe were going crazy, it was a big moment in history for Great Britain ice hockey.â At the 2019 World Championships in Slovakia Great Britain faced the very best international teams in a group that included the USA, Canada and Finland. In their last game against France, GB famously avoided relegation with Cardiff born players Jonathan Phillips and Ben Davies combining to score the winner in over-time. Since then, Great Britain have played three more times in the top division becoming something of a yo-yo team among the elite nations. Netminder Ben Bowns has been playing in the Great Britain squad since 2012 Great Britain have had a mixed 2024. In May they lost six out of seven games at the World Championships and were relegated from the top division. But in February Russell's side breezed through round three of their Olympic qualifying group games held Cardiff, beating China (10-1), Serbia (11-0) and Romania (7-4). In the final round GB will face two of the teams they lost to in this yearâs World Championships in Czechia. The 4-3 loss against Denmark was one Russell thinks could have been different. âAgainst Denmark we played really well, we could have won that game, the goalie played really well, but it didnât happen,"" said Russell. âAnd Norway caught us cold in the first period, we made a game of it in the end, but it wasnât enough. Theyâre mega talented and young, fast and hungry. âWeâre up against more this time because Denmark have stacked up with NHL (National Hockey League) guys, so thatâll be a different proposition."" Russell points out his Great Britain squad have come a long way since they faced teams such as South Korea, the Netherlands and Estonia in mid-level world ranking matches. âThe GB journey has been brilliant, the number of players that now have 100 caps and 75 caps, the new guys coming in and the younger players we integrated,"" he said. ""Itâs just so cool watching them all because youâve been there that long."" Success this weekend would finally see Great Britain return to the Winter Olympics in 2026 after a gap of 78 years. âWeâve surprised people before, no-one thought weâd get to [World Championship] Pool A. âWeâve got nine periods of hockey to do something wild and thereâs no pressure on us. âThree games - if God looks down on us and we get a bit of luck and things go our way, you never know. âItâs been awesome to see it come along, even to be in these situations where you have a chance. âThatâs a big thing and weâve given ourselves that chance.â Thursday, 29 August Norway v Japan - 14:30 Denmark v Great Britain - 18:30 Friday, 30 August Norway v Great Britain - 14:30 Japan v Denmark - 18:30 Sunday, 1 September Great Britain v Japan - 11:30 Denmark v Norway - 15:30 Netminders: Ben Bowns (Cardiff Devils), Jackson Whistle (Belfast Giants), Lucas Brine (Glasgow Clan).

The 40-year-old defeated Colombia's Edilson Chica 8-5 to win the BC4 men's individual title at the South Paris Arena. McGuire was a late addition to the British squad for Paris 2024, having had to recover from a broken leg and knee sustained in a fall at his home in 2022. Following the accident, he was bedbound for a lengthy period and says it took him ""about 18 months to prove to myself that I could be competitive again"". He learned of his selection on 1 July, months after the rest of his British team-mates. It is McGuire's first Paralympic medal at his fourth Games, having previously finished fourth in three competitions at the event. ""To get over the line yesterday [in the semi-final] and get into that final, I felt confident,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say there was many nerves, there was more nerves in the semi-final because I'd been there before. It was just about enjoying the moment."" His flatmate is GB team-mate David Smith, a three-time Paralympic gold medallist, who gave him advice before the final. McGuire said: ""From his experience, he said 'don't settle for a silver, just go for it. If you get a silver by going for it, putting it all out there, fair enough, but you'll give yourself the best chance of the gold.'"" In Monday's final, it was 3-3 at the halfway mark but in the third of four ends, McGuire scored five points to establish a decisive lead. ""The third end was key. To get a five points at this level, it doesn't happen very often,"" he said. ""I knew my opponent then would go long, trying to force an error, so for me it was just about closing down the scoring space. It wasn't about trying to win the end, it was making sure that he couldn't score five.""  A Celtic fan and season ticket-holder, McGuire said he had experienced ""an incredible couple of days"" after their 3-0 win in the Old Firm match against Rangers on Sunday, of which he saw the final 10 minutes before his semi-final.  He also enjoys chess, which he likens to boccia. ""I love strategic games. Chess is where I started,"" he said.  ""A lot of my team-mates refuse to play me now at chess. When we've got time to kill on planes or sitting in the village, I like to play. Anything where I can think a few moves ahead. ""My whole game is about tactics.

Sun Yang won gold in the men's 400m freestyle at China's National Summer Swimming Championships in Hefei on Sunday - and then broke down while speaking to reporters. He had been previously vilified by many in China as a drugs cheat, but his return was praised across state media. His win on Sunday comes shortly after a highly publicised anti-doping row at the Paris Olympics this summer, in which China said its athletes were being unfairly targeted.  In a tearful poolside interview with reporters, the 32-year-old thanked those close to him for helping him get back to competing. “This is really because of the reliance and support from my family -- that's what's kept me going until today,"" he told the South China Morning Post. Sun was suspended by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) in 2020 for refusing to provide samples for testers who had visited his home. In 2012, Sun became China's first male swimmer to win an Olympic gold when he came first in the 400m and 1,500m freestyle races in London. Four years, he followed this up with another gold in the 200m freestyle at the Rio Olympics. But his career came crashing down when anti-doping officials visited his home in 2018 for an out-of-competition test. Sun and his team said the testers lacked the proper accreditation and refused to co-operate with them.  According to the testing team, a member of Sun’s entourage smashed a vial of his blood with a hammer to prevent them from departing with the sample. Sun - who had already been suspended for three months in 2014 for using the banned substance Trimetazidine (TMZ) - denied any wrongdoing and he was initially cleared by swimming's governing body Fina. Two years later, however, CAS overturned the decision and ruled that Sun had refused to cooperate with the sample testers. He was given an eight-year ban, which was later reduced to four years and three months on appeal. As he had never technically tested positive for any banned substances, Sun was allowed to keep all of his medals. His victory on Sunday was widely hailed in Chinese state media outlets, whose posts on social channels were flooded with positive comments. “Brother Sun, don’t cry. The past four years haven’t been easy. You’re amazing,” said one user on Weibo. Another said: ""Congratulations to Sun Yang. Four years and three months of determination and perseverance have all been worth it and have led to this moment. Looking forward to Los Angeles."" Chinese swimmers have been in the spotlight since the Paris Olympics after a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) was covering it up. Those who headed to Paris were drug-tested twice as much as some other nations, which, in turn, has fuelled accusations of a conspiracy to disrupt their performance. At the time, the state-run Global Times blamed Western powers for ""abusing doping tests to disrupt [the] Chinese swimming team"", while breaststroke champion Qin Haiyang accused opposing teams of using underhand ""tricks"" to disrupt Chinese competitors. In his long-awaited return, Sun represented his home province of Zhejiang - but it is unclear whether he will be allowed to represent China on the international stage. According to the country's anti-doping regulations, athletes who have been banned for more than one year are not eligible to be selected for the national team. Sun insists he will ""go all out"" to compete for a spot in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles - although his performance will need to drastically improve.  His race on Sunday featured no competitors who swam in the Paris Olympics and his time was nearly nine seconds slower than his previous best, which he clocked in London in 2012. “I could have done better. Four years away from competition and without intensive training, I do feel rusty in controlling the tempo, and I need more competitions,"" he told state-run outlet China Daily. ""But it’s a good start for my comeback, and I’m happy with this result,” he added."

A star-studded line-up has been confirmed for Zurich, where athletes have their last opportunity to earn points and secure qualification for the winner-takes-all Diamond League final in Brussels from 13-14 September. In addition to winning the Diamond Trophy, each of the 32 champions crowned across the 16 disciplines in the Belgian capital will receive Â£24,000 in prize money. You can watch the action from Zurich on BBC Two from 19:00 BST on Thursday, as well as on the BBC Sport website and app. Coverage of the Brussels final is also available on BBC Two from 19:00 on Friday, 13 September and BBC Three on Saturday, 14 September.

Kerr 'ready' for latest Ingebrigtsen showdown As athletes aim to finish the Olympic year strong, Zurich is set to host high-quality competition - not least in the men's 1500m which features the top four from a dramatic Olympic final. In Paris, Hocker took gold in an Olympic record three minutes 27.65 seconds after finding space on the inside down the home straight as world champion Kerr and defending Olympic champion Ingebrigtsen battled for gold.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n8x6y6lzo,Fury in China as deliveryman kneels before guard,"Many are calling for better protection for gig workers, while the police have urged the public to be kind.",15 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:08.642674,China News,BBC,China,"Chinese authorities have called for gig workers to be treated with kindness after videos of a delivery rider kneeling before a security guard led to protests by dozens of riders. Guards stopped the rider from leaving a building in Hangzhou on Monday - saying he damaged railings while scaling them during a rushed delivery. Worried that his subsequent deliveries would be delayed, the rider got on his knees and pleaded to be let go, the city's police said in a statement. The incident sparked outrage online, with many urging better protections for workers in the industry. Some 12 million people work as delivery riders in China, and the pandemic has fuelled explosive growth in the sector.   But the industry - much like in the rest of the world - is notorious for its tight deadlines, where low-wage riders are subject to tough penalties over delays and poor customer feedback.  Many also work long days, earning less than a dollar for each delivery. The incident on Monday drew huge crowds of angry delivery riders to the building  in downtown Hangzhou, leading the police to dispatch dozen of officers to manage the situation - including from the special weapons and tactics team. Videos shared on social media show the riders chanting, ""Apologise! Apologise!""  At one point, they start belting out China's national anthem. Hangzhou police issued a statement on Tuesday urging the public to ""stay calm and seek to understand one another"". Meituan, the delivery platform that the rider in question was working for, said it will ""take thorough responsibility"" to look into whether he was treated unfairly, and ensure its delivery riders are properly protected.  The platform added that it has paid to repair the broken railings. Hashtags related to the incident have clocked up hundreds of millions of views on microblogging platform Weibo in the last few days. Some users condemned the security guards' ""bullying tactics"", while others acknowledged that the rider had made a mistake. ""They are both low-wage workers. Why did it have to come to this?"" one user wrote. ""It's a hot day, it's not easy for all of us. Let's try to empathise with one another.""  Others cited poor working conditions as a factor. ""Why do delivery riders break traffic rules so often? It's simple. They will be fined if their deliveries are delayed,"" another user wrote.  ""This is the power of the platforms they work for. And so the riders work as hard as they can and risk their lives in order to complete what they have to do.  ""It's exactly how sweatshops function."" China has over the years introduced guidelines to protect the rights and interests of gig workers, but problems remain.  Incidents of riders clashing with security guards in China have made headlines in the past.  In January this year, a delivery rider in the eastern city of Qingdao was stabbed to death by a security guard for entering a building without authorisation. Research by the China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based NGO, shows gig workers have held at least 400 protests in the last five years to demand improvements."

Maskill, 19, set a world record to deliver ParalympicsGB's first gold in the French capital, winning the women's 100m butterfly S14 title in one minute 03.00 seconds. World record holder Kearney then upgraded her Tokyo silver in the women's 200m freestyle S5 to put the British team second in the medal table behind China. Teenager Will Ellard earlier won men's 100m butterfly S14 silver in the pool, after Daphne Schrager and Steve Bate also clinched silvers in the track cycling. However, team-mate and four-time Paralympic champion Kadeena Cox was left distraught after she crashed out of her gold medal race at the velodrome. There was also Para-table tennis bronze for 14-year-old Bly Twomey and team-mate Felicity Pickard in the women's doubles W14 as the British team made a superb start to the 11 days of competition. Maskill and Kearney starred for ParalympicsGB as the British team made a golden start in the pool on the first evening of Para-swimming action at La Defense Arena. Maskill shone on her Paralympic debut, delivering her nation's first gold moments after team-mate Ellard had taken silver in the men's race - a feeling she described as ""unreal"". The world silver medallist finished ahead of Hong Kong's world champion Yui Lam Chan and Neutral Paralympic athlete Valeriia Shabalina. ""I was just hoping to swim my hardest and see what happens and that's what I did. This gives me so much confidence for my other events,"" said Maskill. ""Being here at my first Paralympics feels unreal. My mum, dad, sister and nan are here and I can't wait to see them."" Tully Kearney said she was out for ""redemption"" in Paris In the final event of the night, Kearney made it double gold delight for GB as the 27-year-old held off the challenge of Ukraine's Iryna Poida in the closing stages. That came three years after Kearney missed out to China's Li Zhang by 0.12 seconds in the event - although she did win gold in the 100m freestyle S5. ""I'm just absolutely ecstatic and a bit speechless. I really wanted redemption from Tokyo,"" Kearney said. ""To be able to get here means a lot to me. Even a few weeks ago we weren't sure if I was going to come out and compete, or how many events I would be able to do."" Ellard, 18, was the first British Para-swimming medallist with his silver. The European champion led for much of the final but Denmark's Alexander Hillhouse overhauled him for gold, winning by 0.25 seconds. Debutant Schrager won GB's first medal of the Games in the women's C1-3 3000m individual pursuit, the 23-year-old losing out to Xiaomei Wang of China in the gold medal race despite setting a world record in her C2 classification. Wang finished nearly 10 seconds ahead of Schrager, world champion at C2 level, and almost lapped her in the process of setting a new C3 world record. ""I'm very privileged to have got a medal at all and to do it in front of my family and friends and the whole team is an amazing achievement,"" said Schrager, who was presented her medal by cinema legend Jackie Chan on the podium. GB's Daphne Schrager embraces China's Xiaomei Wang after winning a silver medal Schrager's success was swiftly followed by another Para-cycling silver, achieved by team-mate Bate and his pilot Chris Latham in the men's B 4000m individual pursuit. In the final track event, Bate and Latham finished 2.2 seconds behind world record holders Tristan Bangma and Patrick Bos of the Netherlands, who retained their title in a repeat of the Tokyo final. The 47-year-old Bate, gold medallist in Rio, and Latham smashed the world record in the heats, but that was bettered by the Dutch pair in the next heat - and again in the final. The velodrome also witnessed heartbreak for one of the team's big gold medal hopes. Cox's bid for glory was ended by an early fall in the women's C4-5 500m time trial final, won by the Netherlands' Caroline Groot. The 33-year-old Briton, who endured a turbulent build-up to the Games following a recurrence of her multiple sclerosis which left her unable to walk, and a calf injury, had to be assisted off the track but avoided serious injury.

""It was a weird one. I didn't feel comfortable in the gate. My right side is my weak side and I think I overcompensated,"" said Cox. ""I got back on the bike two weeks ago. I was in a boot four weeks ago. It has just been a really rubbish year. This time last year I couldn't walk because I had a really bad relapse that affected my right side. ""It has been a rollercoaster, I guess that's MS. It's just not what you want a year out from the Games. The fact that I got here was amazing in itself."" Bly Twomey competed in the women's doubles and mixed doubles on Thursday Twomey made history as Great Britain's youngest Paralympic table tennis medallist as she took bronze on her Games debut alongside team-mate Pickard, 30. ""It's amazing because I am so young. I wouldn't have done this without Fliss so I am really proud to have her by my side,"" Twomey said. ""It feels amazing, the atmosphere is just incredible. I'm really proud to get a medal at my first Paralympic Games and I think it means a lot to be doing it at 14."" The British pair recorded a 3-0 win against a Norwegian pair in their quarter-final match to guarantee a medal, but missed out on the gold medal match after losing to China's Wenjuan Huang and Yucheng Jin. Seven-month pregnant para archer Jodie Grinham competed in the heats of the women's individual compound on day one. Rio 2016 silver medallist Grinham, 31, is believed to be the first woman that far into pregnancy to have been selected for the British Paralympic team, and hopes she can send out a powerful message to women. The Briton progressed to the last 16 after setting a personal best score of 693 to place fourth overall, while team-mate and defending champion Phoebe Patterson Pine will hope to join her in the next phase. ""It's brilliant to get that score, I want to compete. I didn't want this Games to just be about a pregnant woman taking part, I wanted to be competitive,"" Grinham said. ""I'm pregnant, so what? If I worked in an office they'd be fine with me working there until I'm 39 weeks pregnant. What's the difference competing at the Paralympics? I want to be a mother and an athlete.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cz6xe1q101do,"‘What an able body can do, I can do’ - Nigeria's powerlifting power",Nigerian powerlifter Folashade Oluwafemiayo on the challenges she has overcome to become a Paralympic gold medallist.,2 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:08.957296,China News,BBC,China,"This video can not be played Nigerian powerlifter Folashade Oluwafemiayo is targeting more Paralympic gold in Paris Folashade Oluwafemiayo is someone who knows how to be strong. The 39-year-old wheelchair user is part of Nigeriaâs hugely successful para-powerlifting squad that has topped the sportâs medal table at two of the last three Paralympic Games. It is the countryâs women who have driven most of that success; three years ago in Tokyo they won all six of the nationâs powerlifting medals. One of those was the gold claimed by Oluwafemiayo in the 86kg category, but her backstory is one that has tested her strength in other ways and could have led to a very different life. âMy ambition was to become a nurse,â she told BBC Sport Africa. However, a family friend, who worked as a matron, discouraged her from applying and would not even help her lay hands on the application form. For Oluwafemiayo, the discrimination cut deep. âI was weeping and my mum consoled me. I wasn't happy because I felt (for) people with disability there's no life, they canât get to where they want to go, they canât do what they have in mind. âIs it because of my disability that I can't become a nurse? I still have the ambition that I'm still going back for that nursing school.â The Paralympic table tennis love story Paralysis, amputation and Paralympic archery  A native of Jos, a large city in central Nigeria, Oluwafemiayo lost the use of her legs after catching polio aged three. She admits that this made elements of her childhood tough. âThere is some play you want to play (but) because of your disability you cannot,â she explained. âYou will see your mate running, you cannot run. You have to be crawling on the ground. It's so painful.â Her life changed course again as a teenager when her uncle introduced her to para-sport. In 1999, she started powerlifting at the Rwang Pwam Stadium in Jos â although her initial experiences did not immediately win her over. âI was not serious about it,â she admitted, before explaining how one coach in particular, John Oguntoye, saw her potential. âThe first day, I lifted like 80kg. So, he was like âYou are very strong, you will be good in this gameâ. âBut because of the pain, I couldn't go there. The following day, I ran away."" Luckily, Oguntoye did not give up, even visiting Oluwafemiayoâs home to encourage her. Going back to the gym is a decision she does not regret. âI followed him and I met so many people there who are living with disability. So that was how I started powerlifting.â The encounter was life changing and she has been part of the Nigerian national team since 2010. Folashade Oluwafemiayo won silver at her first Paralympic Games in London, but her success was soon overshadowed by scandal In 2012, Oluwafemiayo competed in her first Paralympics in London. During competition she broke a world record, but ultimately her performance was only good enough for silver in the 75kg category. But a year later her sporting career was halted when she tested positive for furosemide, a banned substance classed as a diuretic and masking agent. Oluwafemiayo was banned for two years. ""I had a miscarriage,"" she revealed. ""I was rushed to the hospital and the doctor admitted a drug that he's not supposed to, because they never told him I was a sportsperson."" She then missed the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro because of pregnancy. But since returning to competition her trajectory has been stellar, with world, Commonwealth and Paralympic titles in the bag. âWinning these medals means a lot to me. It makes me feel among my other colleagues â I donât feel discriminated,â she said. âWhat an able body can do, I can do it too.â As she bids for more Paralympic glory in Paris, Oluwafemiayo has been named as the general captain of Team Nigeria. She has gone up in weight for competition in the French capital, moving into the +86kg bracket â the heaviest category for women. She will face stiff competition from the likes of Chinaâs Zheng Feifei and Nataliia Oliinyk of Ukraine. âIt's not easy because the last qualifier I went for in Tbilisi, it was hot. The China girl and the Ukraine girl [Feifei and Oliinyk] were trying to break my record. So, we follow ourselves closely.â Oluwafemiayo's husband Tolu-Lope Taiwo is also an international powerlifter Now based in Lagos, Oluwafemiayo trains at the National Stadium Power Gym alongside some of Nigeriaâs other elite powerlifters, such as two-time Paralympic champion Bose Omolayo. âFor me to get to the stadium is very difficult,â Oluwafemiayo explained. âI wake up by three in the morning. âI have to take two bikes before getting to where I will take the vehicle that will take me to stadium.â This dedication - and success that has followed - inspires her two young boys. âMy second boy will say, âMummy, is this how you do your weight?â âSometimes, if I'm doing exercise at home, they will join me. They inspire me.â While the boys might be budding powerlifters, the family already contains a second Paralympic star. Oluwafemiayoâs husband Tolu-Lope Taiwo, also a wheelchair user, competed at both the 2012 and 2016 Games. She describes him as another âsource of inspirationâ and her âbackboneâ. âShe impresses and inspires me,â Taiwo told BBC Sport Africa. âI am always proud of her and I boast that she is my wife. âI always encourage her because at times when she lifts the weights and is discouraged, I always tell her âYou can do it'.â With powerlifting already a family affair, Oluwafemiayo is hoping to inspire the next generation so that Nigeria can retain its strong tradition in the sport. âI want to make Africa proud,â the three-time world champion said. âNigeria proud, myself, family and my federation. âThis won't be my last Paralympic Games. I'm still training for more and I'm targeting for more world records.â Where can Africa win medals at the Paralympics?"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89wygq2k7zo,Kiribati’s pro-China leader faces an election test,The Pacific nation votes amid concerns around the cost of living and stronger ties with China.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:09.059406,China News,BBC,China,"The remote Pacific Island nation of Kiribati headed to the polls on Wednesday in a general election that could hold profound implications for the South Pacific region. The archipelago, which has a population of about 116,000, is viewed as strategically valuable to both China and the United States due to its relatively close proximity to Hawaii and its relatively vast claim of oceanic territory, according to experts. In recent years its government has also forged strong relations with Beijing, after current long-time President Taneti Maamau shifted the country’s ties from Taiwan to China in 2019. Now, as President Maamau seeks to extend his near decade in power, outside observers are watching and waiting to see where Kiribati’s geopolitical allegiances will fall. “In the space of five years we've seen a very rapid escalation of China’s political access, economic influence, and increasingly security access into Kiribati and the territory that it controls – a hugely significant change brought on by the incumbent president,” Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, told BBC News. “That's the issue that’s at stake: this rapid escalation in ties between Kiribati and China.” On the ground, Mr Sora said, the I-Kirabiti people will likely have voted based on issues affecting them day-to-day, such as the cost of living, the economy, and the “poor state of government services”. “But internationally, of course, people will be interested in what foreign policy posture would a new government take,” he added.  While US efforts to establish an embassy in Kiribati stall, China’s presence in the country has become increasingly tangible. In February, Reuters reported that Chinese police had begun working alongside local authorities on the ground in Kiribati. Last month, China donated riot control gear to the Kiribati police force, saying it was willing to “elevate China-Kiribati relations to a new level”, according to a post on Kiribati Police Service’s Facebook. From China’s perspective, Kiribati has become increasingly strategically valuable as  geopolitical rivalries in the South Pacific grow, according to Mr Sora.  It is for this same reason that warming ties between the two nations have stoked anxieties in the West. “Ultimately the scenario that the US and allies will be looking to avoid is the establishment of infrastructure that has you seeing Chinese vessels on rotation in Kiribati, for example, or the placement of personnel,” Mr Sora said. “The implication of the incumbent retaining power is that this trajectory continues and China increases and consolidates its strategic access to Kiribati.  ""And that changes regional security dynamics. It adds a security overhead to the Pacific Islands region that we haven't seen for a long time."" Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said from Kiribati’s perspective, China is likely seen as a valuable development partner that can provide support against economic and climatic concerns. “Obviously a lot of these [South Pacific] countries are quite small, they're facing large climate and environmental threats, and so they need access to a range of partners to really keep building on their development. And that includes China,” Mr Johnson told BBC Newsday. As people on the ground in Kiribati cast their votes, he added, they might have been questioning whether their government’s relationship with China is truly improving their quality of life, or negatively impacting it. “Geopolitics always come second to the everyday needs of the people,” Mr Johnson said. Mr Sora added that in many ways global geopolitical concerns have distracted from these more pressing, everyday issues. “You have this competition for access and influence playing out in various ways… but one of the criticisms is that it’s distracted from development partner support to traditional sectors like health and education,” he said. “It’s quite easy to demonstrate how geopolitics has distracted from key development issues.” Voting is not compulsory in Kiribati, and Wednesday's ballot is the first of two rounds in which citizens will select the country’s members of parliament. These will be followed by the vote for president. The country’s last election was in 2020."

Britain's Patten and Finn Heliovaara beat French pair Sadio Doumbia and Manuel Guinard 6-4 7-5 in New York. The sixth seeds saved four break points and converted their first to go up 5-4 before saving another break point as they served out the first set. The second set followed a similar pattern as Doumbia and Guinard failed to make the most of two break points early on. That allowed Patten and Heliovaara to claim the crucial break and clinch victory. Three-time Grand Slam doubles champion Neal Skupski and partner Michael Venus of New Zealand are also through to the second round. Liverpudlian Skupski and Venus, the eighth seeds, were 6-3 6-3 winners against Hugo Gaston and Gregoire Jacq of France.

Trump's semi-final win over Daniel Wells ensured he would replace Mark Allen as world number one and regain top spot for the first time since 2021.  The 35-year-old was hoping to secure a 29th ranking title, which would have taken him clear of Steve Davis in fourth on the all-time list.

The firm claims its upgraded batteries can be charged from 10% to 80% capacity in 10 and a half minutes using its ultra-fast charging stations. In comparison, Elon Musk’s Tesla says a 15 minute charge allows its Model 3 to cover 175 miles (282km), a little under half the car’s full range. Zeekr's 2025 007 sedan, which will be available from next week, will be its first vehicle to have the new battery. The battery performs well even in cold weather charging from 10% to 80% of its capacity in less than half an hour at temperatures as low as -10C, the company also said. BBC News has contacted Tesla and BYD to request a response to Zeekr's announcement. Tu Le, founder and managing director of consultancy firm Sino Auto Insights told the BBC: ""Tesla’s charging technology is not industry leading anymore and has not been for some time."" ""These bold claims by Zeekr are believable, but more importantly even if it’s not the fastest charging EV battery, being one for the fastest is still quite a leap for them"". ""The competition in China is incredibly fierce and while brands like BYD prioritise scale and sales, brands like Zeekr, Li [Auto] and Nio are focused on maximising the charging experience,"" said Mark Rainford, a China-based car industry commentator. ""Zeekr's parent company, Geely, is pretty much a vertically integrated business... they have the resources to do this,"" he added. Geely owns several brands, including UK-based luxury sports car brand Lotus and Sweden's Volvo. In May, Zeekr's shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first major US market debut by a Chinese company since 2021. The shares are currently trading 27% below the price set in its initial public offering (IPO). The listing came just days before the Biden administration announced major tariff hikes on Chinese-made electric cars, solar panels, steel and other goods. The White House said the measures, which included a 100% border tax on EVs from China, were a response to unfair policies and intended to protect US jobs. Officials in the US, the European Union and other major car markets have grown increasingly concerned about the rapid overseas expansion of Chinese EV companies."

Manatees are large aquatic mammals commonly known as sea cows. All three manatee species are listed as vulnerable to extinction due to a variety of threats including boat collisions, hunting and habitat destruction. ""The first time I got into the water with manatees, I saw them being super playful with each other. They were curious and inquisitive,"" he said. ""There was one manatee that became super curious about me, and he would leave the other group of manatees and walk on his flippers, and he'd get about halfway towards me and then run back to the group on his flippers.

The call was also the first between Mr Xi and a British prime minister since he spoke to Boris Johnson in  March 2022.   The two leaders discussed potential areas of co-operation, including on trade, the economy and education, a No 10 spokesperson said.  ""As permanent members of the UN Security Council, the leaders agreed on the importance of close working in areas, such as climate change and global security,"" they added.   ""The leaders also agreed on the need for a stable and consistent UK-China relationship, including dialogue between their respective foreign and domestic ministers."" China's embassy in the UK said President Xi congratulated Sir Keir on taking office, and said the two countries needed to ""view their relations from a long-term and strategic perspective"". In a statement, it added: ""China is committed to building a great country and achieving national rejuvenation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernisation, and follows a path of peaceful development. ""It is hoped that the UK will view China in an objective and rational manner."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy met Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathering in Laos last month. He urged China to stop its companies supporting Russia's war effort, and stressed the UK's ""ironclad"" commitment to backing Ukraine.  Sir Keir's conversation with Mr Xi comes amid a period of strained relations between London and Beijing over espionage allegations and China's tightening control over former UK colony Hong Kong. However, the two countries remain major trading partners as well as permanent members of the UN Security Council. China was Britain's fifth largest trading partner in 2023, according to UK statistics, but diplomatic relations were icy under former PM Rishi Sunak. Soon after taking office in October 2022, Mr Sunak declared an end to the so-called ""golden era"" of UK-China relations trumpeted by former Prime Minister David Cameron. He also described China as a ""systemic challenge"" to UK values. In 2021, China imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens, including five Conservative MPs. In 2023, the UK Parliament banned TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app, from being accessed on its wi-fi over security concerns. TikTok has denied claims it passes on users' data to the Chinese government.  In April, UK police charged two men under the Official Secrets Act with spying for China."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y35nvvepwo,Boss arrested over deadly fire at S Korea battery plant,The arrest of Aricell's chief executive follows an investigation that found multiple safety failings.,29 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:20.005359,China News,BBC,China,"The chief executive of Aricell, a South Korean lithium battery company, has been arrested over a massive factory fire in June that killed 23 people and injured nine others.  A court approved the warrant for Park Soon-kwan's arrest on Wednesday. Investigators have said Aricell's management is suspected of workplace safety violations. The fire was one of South Korea's worst factory disasters in recent years. Aricells' parent company, S-Connect, did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. After the fire Mr Park issued an apology: ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of life and would like to express our deepest condolences and apologies to the bereaved families."" ""We take great responsibility and will sincerely provide support to the deceased and their families in every way possible,"" he added.  His arrest comes after a police investigation found that the factory had been rushing to meet production deadlines. Investigators said there were a number of safety issues at the plant, including a failure to address quality defects in batteries and hiring unskilled staff to handle dangerous materials. It was also alleged that Aricell had been cheating in quality inspections related to contracts with the military. The blaze broke out on 24 June after several battery cells exploded. At the time of the fire, the Aricell factory housed an estimated 35,000 battery cells on its second floor, where batteries were inspected and packaged. As a lithium fire can react intensely with water, firefighters had to use dry sand to extinguish the blaze, which took several hours to get under control. The victims were mostly foreign workers, from country's including China and Laos. South Korea is a leading producer of lithium batteries, which are used in many items from electric cars to laptops."

Sgt Korbein Schultz was arrested in March after an investigation by the FBI and US Army counterintelligence alleged that he was paid $42,000 (£33,000) in exchange for dozens of sensitive security records. The criminal conspiracy began in June 2022 and continued up until his arrest, officials said. He is scheduled for sentencing in January. Sgt Schultz, who held a security clearance to access top secret information, conspired to collect data with someone whom he believed to be living in Hong Kong, according to court documents. The purported Hong Kong resident asked Sgt Schultz to collect sensitive data related to missile defence and mobile artillery systems, according to court records. Sgt Schultz also collected data on US fighter aircraft, military tactics, and the US military's defence strategy for Taiwan, based on what it learned from Russia's war in Ukraine. “By conspiring to transmit national defence information to a person living outside the United States, this defendant callously put our national security at risk to cash in on the trust our military placed in him,” Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the DOJ's National Security Division said. Sgt Schultz on Tuesday pleaded guilty to all charges against him, including conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information and bribery of a public official. The indictment against Sgt Schultz earlier detailed messages he sent to the supposed Hong Kong resident, who was referred to in court documents as Conspirator A. In one exchange, Sgt Schultz said he ""wished he could be Jason Bourne"" in reference to the fictional spy character. After being promised more money from his handler, he said in another message: ""I hope so! I need to get my other BMW back!"". The FBI and US Army Counterintelligence Command are continuing investigations into the case."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvyre936zvo,Blockbuster Chinese video game tried to police players - and divided the internet,The hugely popular Black Myth: Wukong has attracted some press for the wrong reasons.,25 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:20.255300,China News,BBC,China,"An anthropomorphic monkey and a campaign against ""feminist propaganda"" set the video gaming community alight this week, following the release of the most successful Chinese title of all time. Many players were furious after the company behind Black Myth: Wukong sent them a list of topics to avoid while livestreaming the game, including “feminist propaganda, fetishisation, and other content that instigates negative discourse”. Still, within 24 hours of its release on Tuesday, it became the second most-played game ever on streaming platform Steam, garnering more than 2.1 million concurrent players and selling more than 4.5 million copies. The game, based on the classic 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, is being seen as a rare example of popular media broadcasting Chinese stories on an international stage.  Black Myth: Wukong is a single-player action game where players take on the role of ""the Destined One""- an anthropomorphic monkey with supernatural powers. The Destined One is based on the character of Sun Wukong, or the Monkey King, a key character in Journey to the West. That novel, considered one of the greats of Chinese literature, draws heavily from Chinese mythology as well as Confucianism, Taoist and Buddhist folklore.  It has inspired hundreds of international films, TV shows and cartoons, including the popular Japanese anime series Dragon Ball Z and the 2008 Chinese-American fantasy film The Forbidden Kingdom.  First announced via a hugely popular teaser trailer in August 2020, Black Myth launched on Tuesday after four years of anticipation.  It is the Chinese video game industry’s first AAA release – a title typically given to big-budget games from major companies. High-end graphics,  sophisticated game design and hot-blooded hype have all contributed to its success - as well as the size of China's gaming community, which is the largest in the world.  “It's not just a Chinese game targeting the Chinese market or the Chinese-speaking world,” Haiqing Yu, a professor at Australia’s RMIT University, whose research specialises in the sociopolitical and economic impact of China’s digital media, told the BBC. “Players all over the world [are playing] a game that has a Chinese cultural factor.” This has become a huge source of national pride in the country.  The Department of Culture and Tourism in Shanxi Province, an area that includes many locations and set pieces featured in the game, released a video on Tuesday that showcased the real-world attractions, triggering a surge in tourism dubbed “Wukong Travel”. Videos posted on TikTok in the wake of Black Myth’s release show tourists flooding temples and shrines featured in the game, in what one X user characterised as a “successful example of cultural rediscovery”. Niko Partners, a company that researches and analyses video games markets and consumers in Asia, similarly pointed out that Black Myth “helps showcase Chinese mythology, traditions, culture and real-life locations in China to the world”.  Ahead of Black Myth’s release, some content creators and streamers revealed that a company affiliated with its developer had sent them a list of topics to avoid talking about while livestreaming the game: including “feminist propaganda, fetishisation, and other content that instigates negative discourse”. While it is not clear what was precisely meant by “feminist propaganda”, a widely circulated report by video game publication IGN in November alleged a history of sexist and inappropriate behaviour from employees of Game Science, the studio behind Black Myth. Other topics designated as “Don'ts” in the document, which has been widely shared on social media and YouTube, included politics, Covid-19, and China’s video game industry policies. The directive, which was sent out by co-publisher Hero Games, has stoked controversy outside China. Multiple content creators refused to review the game, claiming its developers were trying to censor discussion and stifle freedom of speech.  Others chose to directly defy the warnings.  One creator with the username Moonmoon launched a Twitch stream of Black Myth titled ""Covid-19 Isolation Taiwan (Is a Real Country) Feminism Propaganda"". Another streamer, Rui Zhong, discussed China’s one-child policy on camera while playing the game. On Thursday, Chinese social media platform Weibo banned 138 users who were deemed to be violating its guidelines when discussing Black Myth. According to an article on the state-run Global Times news site, a number of the banned Weibo users were “deviating from discussing the game itself but instead using it as a platform for spreading ‘gender opposition,’ ‘personal attacks’, and other irrational comments”. While the controversy has attracted a lot of attention in international media and online, it has not really dented or detracted from Black Myth’s overwhelmingly positive reception. The game made $53m in presales alone, with another 4.5 million copies sold within 24 hours of its release. Within the same timeframe it broke the record for the most-played single-player title ever released on Steam. On platforms like Weibo, Reddit and YouTube, and elsewhere, reams of comments are celebrating the game’s success. Many suggest that the fallout from the controversies surrounding the game’s release has been overblown. Ms Yu agreed, describing Black Myth as an “industry and overall market success”. “When it comes to Chinese digital media and communication platforms, of course people cannot avoid talking about censorship,” she said. “Black Myth is… an example of how to tell the Chinese story well, and how to expand Chinese cultural influence globally. I don't see any censorship there.” She also pointed out that apparent attempts to steer or censor what reviewers said were unlikely to have come from Chinese officials themselves. More likely, Ms Yu suggested, is that the list of ""Dos"" and ""Don'ts"" came from a company that was trying to keep itself out of trouble. “The company issues their notification so if anybody from the central government comes to have a chat with the company, the company can say, ‘look, I already told them. I can't stop people from saying what they want to say.’ “They have basically, to use the colloquial term, covered their own ass,” she concluded. “I view it as a politically correct gesture to the Chinese censors, rather than a real directive coming from the top down.”"

Triathletes David Ellis and Megan Richter won early golds for Great Britain, with swimmers Ellie Challis and Louise Fiddes also triumphant across 15 scintillating minutes in the pool. Stephen McGuire became a Paralympic champion in boccia, while Para-archers Nathan Macqueen and Jodie Grinham - the latter competing while seven months pregnant - won gold in mixed team compound open final. Elsewhere on Monday, Briton Claire Cashmore took silver and fellow triathletes Hannah Moore and Lauren Steadman won bronzes. Dan Bethell and Krysten Coombs won silvers in badminton, while there was heartbreak for sprinter Jonnie Peacock who finished fifth in the men's T64 100m final. Monday's results take GB's Paris gold tally to 29 and their overall medal count to 54 - second only to China (87 medals, including 43 golds), who have topped the table at the past five Games. GB's Ellis and Richter storm to triathlon gold in Paris Inspired McGuire wins boccia gold for GB Bethell and Coombs win Para-badminton silvers Grinham and Macqueen won gold together at the European Para Cup earlier this year British Para-archer Jodie Grinham is a Paralympic champion - and she is also seven months pregnant. The 31-year-old, who beat team-mate Phoebe Paterson Pine to women's individual compound bronze on Sunday, took gold alongside Nathan Macqueen by beating Iran 155-151 in the mixed team compound final on Monday. Grinham - already a mum to toddler son Christian - has attracted worldwide media attention. Before yesterday's medal, Paris 2024 has been far from straightforward for the Welsh archer.  After a scare last week she had to attend a Parisian hospital for a check-up before being released and cleared to compete. After Grinham's success she told BBC Wales: ""All I wanted to do was jump up and down and cry and scream and shout. ""But being heavily pregnant, realistically the best thing to do was crouch down and take a second and then I could give hugs and things."" Pregnant archer Grinham wins Paralympic gold GB's Challis & Fiddes win swimming golds GB's Peacock finishes fifth in 100m final  Stephen McGuire previously finished fourth on three occasions in competitions at Paralympic Games, at London 2012 and Rio 2016 It is incredible Great Britain's Stephen McGuire is even competing at Paris 2024, let alone winning a boccia gold medal. The 40-year-old was a late addition to the British squad for Paris 2024, having had to recover from a broken leg and knee sustained in a fall at his home in 2022. He also only learned of his selection on 1 July, months after the rest of his British team-mates. But the Scotsman put in a dominant performance in the BC4 men's individual final to beat Colombia's Edilson Chica 8-5 and secure his first Paralympic medal at his fourth Games, having previously finished fourth in three competitions at the event. McGuire said ""lots of hard work and lots of soul-searching"" helped him recover from his setbacks to win gold. ""If she can do it, I can do it."" Those were the words of Fiddes as she won gold for Great Britain in the S14m 100m breaststroke final, just 15 minutes after she watched her friend Challis dominate the women's S3 50m backstroke final. The two Britons are room-mates in Paris and both improved on the silver medals they won three years ago in Tokyo. Fiddes told Channel 4 before her race she was ""on the edge of her seat"" watching Challis, who she labelled a ""queen"". Challis, 20, swam a lifetime best of 53.56 seconds, almost five seconds clear of second-placed, while Fiddes, 23, held off Brazilian favourites Debora and Beatriz Carneiro to add to her bronze she won in the S14 200m freestyle on day three. Dave Ellis won gold alongside guide Luke Pollard GB's first gold of the day was won by Ellis and guide Luke Pollard in the men's PTVI triathlon event. The pair's victory more than made up for their DNF in Tokyo when they had to abandon with a mechanical failure on the bike leg. Paralympic debutant Richter added to GB's medal tally with victory in the women's PTS4 competition, with fellow Briton Moore third. In the women's PTS5 event Cashmore and Steadman won silver and bronze respectively. The pair have elaborate Paralympic histories. It has been a tough few years for Tokyo 2020 champion Steadman, who has suffered with long Covid and returned to triathlon after a spell in winter sports. Cashmore's medal haul now stands at 10, with a podium place at every Games since Athens 2004. What's happening and when at the Paris Paralympics?

That said, there were still some moments of heartbreak for British athletes. Para-badminton player Bethell said he was ""devastated"" after a heartbreaking loss to India's Kumar Nitesh in the men's SL3 singles final in Paris. The Briton, who also took silver when the sport made its debut in Tokyo in 2021, had match point at 21-20 ahead in the decider, but lost 14-21 21-18 23-21. His team-mate Coombs lost his SH6 singles final later on Monday 21-19 21-13 to Frenchman Charles Noakes as Britain's wait for a first Paralympic badminton gold continued. Two-time Paralympic champion Jonnie Peacock finished fifth in the men's T64 100m final. The 31-year-old told Channel 4 he needs to find ""2017 Jonnie"" to compete against the best. There was also disappointment for David Weir, who finished sixth in his heat and failed to qualify for the men's T54 1500m final, while GB's men's wheelchair rugby team lost their bronze-medal match 50-48 to Australia.

It follows an investigation by BBC World Service that found a hotel and former bank offices on the island had been used by scammers conning victims in China out of millions of dollars. The government said it had a “zero-tolerance attitude towards” alleged international criminal activities. The Isle of Man Constabulary said the force was unable to comment as an investigation was ongoing. The BBC investigation found ""MIC"" or Manx Internet Commerce, was part of a group of companies - all with the same owner.  An online casino, run by King Gaming Ltd, was the most prominent. It found MIC was first based at a hotel in Douglas, before moving to former bank offices in the east of the city. Six people who worked for them in Douglas have now been convicted of carrying out scams against Chinese citizens, after going home to China, . The Chinese court, which heard the cases late last year, said about £4.17m had been taken from at least 12 victims. In April, the Isle of Man Constabulary raided the former bank offices and another address in Douglas. The force said the raids had been in connection with a wider fraud and money laundering investigation in relation to King Gaming Ltd IOM. Seven people were arrested and released on bail at that time, and a further three people were arrested in May. The island's gambling regulator has stripped MIC's gambling affiliate companies of their licences. A Manx government statement said it was “aware of increased media reporting surrounding a business that operated on the Island, which has been subject to significant multi-agency responses to disrupt and close down alleged international criminal activities”. “The robust response by the Isle of Man Constabulary, Gambling Supervision Commission and other government agencies that led to the disruption and closure of businesses at the centre of these concerns demonstrates that, as an island, matters of this nature are taken extremely seriously and that government will not hesitate to act in such situations,"" it added. “As the various matters are subject to ongoing criminal investigations, we are unable to offer any further comment at this stage. “We do, however, wish to reaffirm that significant and wide-reaching action has been taken and that the businesses involved at the centre of these allegations are no longer in operation as a result of the actions taken by government.” Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook, and X?

Each player aims to hit the ball over the net on to the opponent's half of the table and wins the point if they fail to return it successfully. A match is played over the best of five sets, with each won by the first player to reach 11 points. If the score in a set reaches 10-10, though, a player must establish a two-point lead to win it. The server changes every two points. Competitions take the form of preliminary rounds followed by knockout stages. For Paris, team events have been revamped and replaced by men's and women's pairs and mixed doubles events. Athletes with a range of impairments can take part in the sport and there are 11 different classifications: 1-5 for those competing in wheelchairs, 6-10 for those who play standing and 11 for standing athletes with a learning disability. Athletes are assessed and allocated a number between 1 and 10, depending on their functional ability - reach, muscle strength, locomotive restrictions, balance and ability to grip the bat. In the wheelchair category, those competing in class 1 have the highest level of impairment with class 6 being for standing athletes with the highest level of impairment. Rio gold medallists Will Bayley and Rob Davies lead the British team's hopes. Bayley, who appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2019, recovered from a serious knee injury sustained on the programme to win class 6 silver in Tokyo but wants to be back on the top of the podium again while Davies missed Tokyo through injury. And there will be lots of interest in 14-year-old Bly Twomey who trains alongside Bayley in Brighton and who only made her international debut last year but has already enjoyed plenty of success. China have been the trailblazers for many years and one of their many stars, Liu Jing, will be aiming to win a history-making fifth successive singles title when she competes in the women's C1-2 event.  Liu has also won five team medals since making her debut in Beijing in 2008 but will face a tough challenge from Korea's Seo Su-yeon. But for longevity, it is Slovakiaâs Jan Riapos and Spainâs Jose Manuel Ruiz Reyes who are the stars with both set to make their eighth Paralympic appearance, having made their debuts in Atlanta in 1996. Riapos has four golds a silver and a bronze from his class 2 events while Ruiz Reyes  has three silvers and two bronzes in class 10. And Brazil's Bruna Alexandre and Melissa Tapper of Australia come to the Paralympics having already experienced the Paris competition atmosphere by representing their nations at the Olympics. Table tennis was part of the Paralympic movement before it was played at the Olympics. It was one of the sports included in the first Paralympic Games in Rome in 1960 but it was the Seoul Games in 1988 when it made its Olympic debut.

They face hosts Denmark, Norway and Japan in the final qualifying event in Aalborg between 29 August and 1 September, with the winner sealing a place at the 2026 Winter Games in Milan. GB won all three of their matches - against China, Serbia and Romania - in the initial qualifying series in February, but will have to overcome higher-ranked opponents to reach the Games. Great Britain are currently ranked 17th in the world, whereas Denmark - who reached the quarter-finals at the 2022 Winter Olympics - are 11th and Norway 12th. Japan are 24th. Head coach Pete Russell said it was the biggest challenge he had faced since taking up the role in 2015. ""Itâs a super hard challenge to play Pool A nations after eight months of a season, never mind with such short preparation time, but our players will give it everything they have,"" he said. Great Britain have won two Winter Olympic medals in ice hockey - bronze in 1924 and gold in 1936. Women's ice hockey was introduced at Nagano 1998, but Great Britain have not qualified for a Games. Each team plays each other once with the overall winner booking their ticket to the 2026 Winter Olympics. Fixtures (all times BST): Thursday, 29 August Norway v Japan - 14:30 Denmark v Great Britain - 18:30  Friday, 30 August  Norway v Great Britain - 14:30  Japan v Denmark - 18:30 Sunday, 1 September  Great Britain v Japan - 11:30  Denmark v Norway - 15:30 There will be 12 teams in the men's competition at the 2026 Winter Olympics and, for the first time since Sochi in 2014, NHL players will be allowed to compete for their countries. Eight countries have already booked their places, with hosts Italy joined by the top nations based on the 2023 International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) world rankings - Canada, defending Olympic champions Finland, United States, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Russia competed as the Russian Olympic Committee at the last Games in Beijing - and won the silver medal - but they, and Belarus, are currently banned for the 2024-2025 season. The IIHF cited security reasons because of the war in Ukraine and has set a deadline of May 2025 for its ruling council to decide whether Russia and Belarus can return in time for the 2026 Olympics. Should Russia be allowed, they would qualify as the ninth country to participate, based on the world rankings. The final three spots will be decided at three separate events taking place this weekend. Apart from Great Britain's event in Demark, there are also final qualifiers in Slovakia and Latvia. In Bratislava, hosts Slovakia face Kazakhstan, Austria and Hungary, while hosts Latvia play France, Slovenia and Ukraine in Riga."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nm2xjlp3o,The family home that became a famous bookshop,"Scarthin Books attracts customers from far and wide to the small, historic village of Cromford.",1 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:27.945851,China News,BBC,China,"An independent bookshop, which has been described as one of the best of its kind in the world, is celebrating its 50th anniversary. But how did this shop - tucked away in a small Peak District village - became known far and wide, and how has it survived in the age of online retailers? Scarthin Books, in Cromford, Derbyshire, is spread over four floors of what was once a family home. Almost every wall and surface of the shop is covered in new and second-hand books - even around the staircase that runs through the centre of the building - which twists slightly due to the toll of the heavy stock. There are so many books - an estimated 100,000 - that the centuries-old building was in danger of collapsing nine years ago. Fortunately, the bookshop's many loyal customers raised money for structural repairs in a matter of days. There were humble beginnings at the bookshop. ""Nobody gave us a chance when we opened,"" said founder and proprietor Dave Mitchell. ""They said, 'how can you possibly have a successful bookshop hidden up that decrepit side street in Cromford in the middle of nowhere?'"" The bookshop was originally just on the ground floor, but the rooms were gradually taken over by books as the business grew. ""If it was still just a ground-floor shop, we couldn't possibly survive against competition, but we've always been able to expand and keep ahead,"" he said. Mr Mitchell, who is now 79, fell in love with second-hand books while studying physics, maths and engineering at Cambridge, and buying them cheaply from the city's long-established G. David bookshop.  He came to live in Derbyshire in January 1972, after getting a job working for Derbyshire County Council's town and country planning department. He bought what was then called Scarthin House later that year, for about £3,800. It struck him as an ""amazing place"" when he viewed it, and he was partly also attracted by its location overlooking Cromford Mill Pond, which was then silted up. He originally lived there with three lodgers, and said they had a ""wild time"" hosting ""wild parties and things"". ""Someone parked his motorbike in what is now the shop, and there was a piano down there,"" said Mr Mitchell. However, he decided to set up a bookshop on the ground floor after marrying his first wife, Pat. ""I thought while I'm working Pat could run a bookshop, just as a hobby,"" he said. The shop opened on 30 August 1974 and sold a mix of second-hand and new books from the start. ""That's been one of the keys to our success, that we've always done both new books and second-hand books,"" he said. After two years he felt confident enough to give up his council job, having by then transferred to Derbyshire Dales District Council. ""I wasn't happy at work and a bookshop was my salvation,"" he said. ""I was able to give up my failing career and go with the bookshop."" The number of books increased and gradually enveloped the house, so Mr Mitchell bought a cottage at the back of the shop, which he still lives in. The bookshop's well-known vegan and vegetarian cafe opened 30 years ago, at the same time he and his third wife moved into the cottage. The room had previously been their kitchen, so he said it made sense to turn it into a cafe. ""It's very hard to make any money out of the cafe,"" he said. ""It just about breaks even but it adds so much to the atmosphere and pleasure of visiting us."" What was once a ""decrepit side street"" is now an attractive location, as the mill pond in front of the shop has been restored. Cromford is also now in the middle of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site, which was designated in 2001. Mr Mitchell said the shop had been ""blessed"" by tourists who came to the area. ""We are part of people's visits to the Peak District,"" he said. ""People fit us into their holidays. If they're passing and they know about us, they make a special effort to come."" The bookshop and other parts of the village were used in the 2007 film, And When Did You Last See Your Father?, starring Colin Firth and Jim Broadbent. Adding to its fame, Scarthin Books was placed at six in a list by The Guardian of the world's best bookshops, and at 14 in travel agency Skyscanner's most beautiful bookshops in the world. ""We're known internationally now,"" said Mr Mitchell. ""An ex-employee was in a bookshop in Paris and on a table he saw a book called Les Plus Belles Librairies Du Monde, the Most Beautiful Bookshops in the World, and sure enough we're in there. ""Some people came from China bearing a book in Chinese and there we were, in there, and a few months ago a young man who wanted to open a bookshop in Michigan had researched British bookshops and decided to visit."" The bookshop is now run day-to-day by manager David Booker, who said the last few years had been ""phenomenal"". ""We get regular returning visitors from Australia, New Zealand, all over Europe,"" he said. He says the shop gets ""plenty"" of famous visitors too. ""[Musician] Jarvis Cocker was a real treat for customers when he came in not long ago,"" he said. ""The one I was gutted to have missed was one of my heroes when I was a kid, the artist David Hockney. I was so gutted, he came on my day off one Saturday and had tea and cake in the cafe."" Mr Booker met his wife Eve while working at the bookshop, and they now have a seven-year-old son. ""I love being here, it's wonderful, and I work really hard and the days fly by because there's so much to do,"" said Mrs Booker, who is the assistant manager. ""You just can't find places like this any more. So many bookshops are shutting down all the time and we're so lucky that we're so busy and so loved by our customers."" She said one of their customers, Stuart Beardsall, even became a really close friend. ""Stuart had been coming to the shop since it opened, and we lost Stuart this year unfortunately,"" she said. ""I think we became his family because Stuart didn't have a wife or children. Part of his routine would be to come to the bookshop, to chat to us, to have a look round. ""There are just some wonderful people and we're really lucky to have the customers that we do."" Now Mr Mitchell has stepped back from the day-to-day running of the bookshop, he describes it as his ""wayward child or grandchild"". ""It's got my genes, most of the shelving and the design and the layout and all the different rooms, that's all down to me, but what's actually happening there, the books that are purchased and the way it's all laid out and displayed, that's all down to David and Eve and Bev, and all the members of staff who are doing their own thing,"" he said. Looking back at the bookshop's history, Mr Mitchell described it as ""a series of crazy mistakes"". ""I shouldn't have bought the place in the first place, I should have bought a quick and easily-sold semi so I could move on, and I certainly shouldn't have allowed what was a lovely family home to become a business,"" he said. ""It was a very stupid thing to do, but these mistakes have somehow proved fruitful."" Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nzpx45wxo,US charges Chinese dissident with allegedly spying for Beijing,"Yuanjun Tang, now an American citizen, is alleged to have spied on US-based Chinese democracy activists.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:28.026391,China News,BBC,China,"US prosecutors have filed criminal charges against a Chinese dissident living in the US, accusing him of being an agent of Beijing's intelligence service. Yuanjun Tang, 67, was arrested on Wednesday in the New York City, the US department of justice (DOJ) said in a statement. He is alleged to have spied on US-based Chinese democracy activists and dissidents. Mr Tang, now a naturalised US citizen, is also accused of making false statements to the FBI. The BBC could not immediately identify a lawyer for Mr Tang. In Wednesday's statement, the DOJ said Mr Tang ""was charged by criminal complaint with acting and conspiring to act in the United States as an unregistered agent of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and making materially false statements to the FBI"". It also alleged that between 2018 and 2023 he acted as China's agent on the orders of the country's ministry of state security (MSS) - China's principal civilian intelligence agency. Mr Tang is accused of regularly receiving instructions via email, encrypted chats and other means of communications from the agency. It is also alleged that he ""regularly received instructions from and reported to an MSS intelligence officer regarding individuals and groups viewed by the PRC as potentially adverse to the PRC’s interests, including prominent US-based Chinese democracy activists and dissidents."" ""He also travelled at least three times for face-to-face meetings with MSS intelligence officers and helped the MSS infiltrate a group chat on an encrypted messaging application used by numerous PRC dissidents and pro-democracy activists to communicate about pro-democracy issues and express criticism of the PRC government,"" the DOJ alleges. He apparently agreed to work for China's intelligence agency in a bid to see his family living in mainland China, according to CBS, the BBC's US news partner, which cites US prosecutors. According to court documents, Mr Tang was imprisoned in China for opposing the Chinese government. He protested against the Chinese Communist Party during the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations, CBS reports. In about 2002, he managed to defect to Taiwan, and was later granted political asylum in the US, the DOJ said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrjqy02z0yo,The earliest pictures capturing the art and beauty of Indian monuments,A new exhibition in Delhi showcases a collection of photographs from the 1850s and 1860s.,1 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:28.120121,China News,BBC,China,"A new show in the Indian capital Delhi showcases a rich collection of early photographs of monuments in the country.   The photographs from the 1850s and 1860s capture a period of experimentation when new technology met uncharted territory. British India was the first country outside Europe to establish professional photographic studios, and many of these early photographers were celebrated internationally. (Photography was launched in 1839.) They blended and transformed pictorial conventions, introduced new artistic traditions, and shaped the visual tastes of diverse audiences, ranging from scholars to tourists. While the works of leading British photographers often reflect a colonial perspective, those by their Indian contemporaries reveal overlooked interactions with this narrative. The pictures at the show called Histories in the Making have been gathered from the archives of DAG, a leading art firm. They highlight photography’s crucial role in shaping an understanding of India’s history.  They also contributed to the development of field sciences, fostered networks of knowledge, and connected the histories of politics, fieldwork, and academic disciplines like archaeology. ""These images capture a moment in history when the British Empire was consolidating its power in India, and the documentation of the subcontinent's monuments served both as a means of asserting control and as a way to showcase the empire's achievements to audiences back in Europe,” says Ashish Anand, CEO of DAG. This is a a picture of Caves of Elephanta taken by William Johnson and William Henderson. The Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage site, are a group of temples primarily dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva in the state of Maharashtra. William Johnson began his photographic career in Bombay (now Mumbai) around 1852, initially working as a daguerreotypist - the daguerreotype was an early photographic process that produced a single image on a metal plate. In the mid-1850s, Johnson partnered with William Henderson, a commercial studio owner in Bombay, to establish the firm Johnson & Henderson.  Together, they produced The Indian Amateur’s Photographic Album, a monthly series published from 1856 to 1858.  Linnaeus Tripe arrived in India in 1839 at the age of 17, joining the Madras regiment of the East India Company.  He began practicing photography and in December 1854, captured images in the towns of Halebidu, Belur, and Shravanabelagola.  Sixty-eight of these photographs, primarily of temples, were exhibited in 1855 at an exhibition in Madras (now a major city called Chennai), earning him a first-class medal for the ""best series of photographic views on paper"". In 1857, Tripe became the photographer for the Madras Presidency - a former province of British India - and photographed sites at Srirangam, Tiruchirapalli, Madurai, Pudukkottai, and Thanjavur.  Over 50 of these photographs were displayed at the Photographic Society of Madras exhibition the following year, where they were widely praised as the best exhibits.  John Murray, a surgeon in the Bengal Indian Medical Service, began photographing in India in the late 1840s.  Appointed civil surgeon in the city of Agra in 1848, he spent the next 20 years producing a series of studies on Mughal architecture in Agra and the neighbouring cities of Sikandra, and Delhi.  In 1864, he created a comprehensive set of pictures documenting the iconic Taj Mahal.  Throughout his career, Murray used paper negatives and the calotype process -  a technique of creating ""positive"" prints from one negative - to produce his images. Thomas Biggs arrived in India in 1842 and joined the Bombay Artillery as a captain in the British East India Company.  He soon took up photography and became a founding member of the Photographic Society of Bombay in 1854.  After exhibiting his work at the Society's first exhibition in January 1855, he was appointed as the government photographer for the Bombay Presidency, tasked with documenting architectural and archaeological sites.  He photographed Bijapur, Badami, Aihole, Pattadakal, Dharwad, and Mysore before being recalled to military service in December 1855.  Biggs experimented with the calotype process, producing ""positive"" prints from one negative. Felice Beato, one of the most renowned war and travel photographers of the 19th Century, arrived in India in 1858 to document the aftermath of the 1857 mutiny.  Indian soldiers, known as sepoys, had set off a rebellion against the British rule, often referred to as the first war of independence. Although the mutiny was nearly over when Beato arrived, he photographed its aftermath with a focus on capturing the immediacy of events.  He extensively documented cities deeply affected by the uprising, including Lucknow, Delhi, and Kanpur, with notable images of Sikandar Bagh, Kashmiri Gate, and the barracks of Kanpur. His chilling photograph of the hanging of sepoys, stands out for its stark depiction. As a commercial photographer, Beato aimed to sell his work widely, spending over two years in India photographing iconic sites. In 1860, Beato left India for China to photograph the Second Opium War. Andrew Neill, a Scottish doctor in the Indian Medical Service in Madras, was also a photographer who documented ancient monuments for the Bombay Presidency.  His calotypes were featured in the 1855 exhibition of the Photographic Society of Madras and in March 1857, and 20 of his architectural views of Mysore and Bellary were shown by the Photographic Society of Bengal.  Neill also documented Lucknow after the 1857 revolt. Edmund Lyon, who served in the British Army from 1845 to 1854 and briefly as governor of Dublin District Military Prison, arrived in India in 1865 and established a photographic studio in the southern city of Ooty.  Working as a commercial photographer until 1869, Lyon gained significant recognition, particularly for his photographs of the Nilgiris mountain range, which were showcased at the 1867 Paris Exposition. Accompanied by his wife, Anne Grace, Lyon also captured southern India's archaeological sites and architectural antiquities.  His work resulted in a remarkable collection of 300 photographs documenting sites in Trichinopoly, Madurai, Tanjore, Halebid, Bellary, and Vijayanagara Samuel Bourne’s stunning images of India, especially from his Himalayan expeditions between 1863 and 1866, stand among the finest examples of 19th-Century travel photography. A former bank clerk, Bourne left his job in 1857 to pursue photography full-time.  Arriving in Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1863, he soon moved to Shimla, where he partnered with William Howard to establish the Howard & Bourne studio. Later that year, Charles Shepherd joined them, forming 'Howard, Bourne & Shepherd'. When Howard left, the studio became ‘Bourne & Shepherd,’ a name that would become iconic. Bourne embarked on three major Himalayan expeditions, covering vast regions including Kashmir and the challenging terrain of Spiti. His 1866 photographs  of the Manirung Pass, at over 18,600ft (5,669m), gained international acclaim.  In 1870, Bourne returned to England, selling his shares, though Bourne & Shepherd continued to operate in Calcutta and Simla. The studio, which later documented the  spectacular Delhi Durbar – the ‘Court of India’ of 1911, an event that saw 20,000 soldiers marching or riding past the silk-robed Emperor and Empress - had a remarkable 176-year legacy before closing in 2016."

The army filed 14 charges against Mr King for the illegal crossing in July 2023. He plans to enter a guilty plea to five charges, including desertion and assault, as part of a plea deal. ""He will plead not guilty to the remaining offenses, which the Army will withdraw and dismiss,"" his lawyer Franklin Rosenblatt said in a statement to BBC News.  His plea and sentencing hearing will take place on 20 September at a military base in Fort Bliss, Texas. ""Travis’s guilty plea will be entered at a general court-martial,"" Mr Rosenblatt said in an emailed statement on Monday. ""There, he will explain what he did, answer a military judge’s questions about why he is pleading guilty, and be sentenced.""  Mr King is grateful to support from his family and friends and to all those who did not ""pre-judge"" him based on the allegations, the lawyer added. Charges expected to be dismissed as part of the plea deal include possession of indecent images of children.   Pvt King has been in the army since January 2021 and was in South Korea as part of a unit rotation when he crossed into North Korea. Prior to that incident, he had served two months in detention in South Korea on charges that he had assaulted two people and kicked a police car. He was released from custody on 10 July - eight days before he crossed the country's border with Pyongyang. His release deal was brokered by Swedish officials, who brought Pvt King to North Korea's border with China. Little is known about how he was treated in North Korea, why he fled there in the first place, and why Pyongyang expelled him. The US has said it made no concessions to secure his release."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240910-how-water-has-shaped-new-york-city-for-400-years,How water shaped New York City,"As NYC turns 400, one of the best ways of understanding what propelled the city's astronomical growth is by paddling the rivers that built it.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:28.307578,China News,BBC,China,"As NYC turns 400, one of the best ways of understanding what propelled the city's astronomical growth is by paddling the rivers that built it. Somewhere near Inwood Hill Park, home to the last native forests on the island of Manhattan, the jackhammering racket of the city softened and an orchestra of crickets trilled in unison. I paddled closer to the water's edge, where a tangle of gnarled tree roots gripped boulders deposited during the last Ice Age. Just then, a great blue heron swooped low, landing on a small sandy cove before disappearing into the reeds towards the last remnant of the original salt marshes that once surrounded Manhattan.  ""Finally,"" I thought, after spending the day kayaking around one of the most man-made places on the planet. ""Maybe this is something the island's original residents might recognise."" This year marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of New York City – or, more accurately, the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam that would grow to become one of the world's greatest cities. It's a complicated milestone, and for years officials have been grappling over what, if anything, they should do to observe the event. As Russell Shorto, author of the best-selling book The Island at the Center of the World explained, this tiny Dutch settlement effectively birthed ""the world's first modern city"" – a place powered by pluralism and capitalism under the promise that anyone, regardless of where they came from, could make something of themselves. ""If what made America great was its ingenious openness to different cultures, the small triangle of land at the southern tip of Manhattan island is the birthplace of that idea: this island city would become the first multiethnic, upwardly mobile society on America's shores, a prototype of the kind of society that would be duplicated throughout the country and around the world,'' he writes. More so than Boston, Plymouth Rock or Jamestown, ""Manhattan is where America began.""  At the same time, the Dutch created this multiethnic society by removing Native people from their lands and importing enslaved Africans to build much of Lower Manhattan. ""They brought tolerance and intolerance; capitalism and colonialism. We have to process both of these things in a nuanced way that acknowledges their achievements and failures,"" Shorto told the BBC. As a result, the few events honouring the city's quadricentennial have tried to carefully balance how this settlement forever shaped the nation with its dark legacies of land dispossession and slavery. ""We're viewing this anniversary more as a commemoration as opposed to a celebration,"" said Sarah Cooney, the executive director of the Holland Society of New York, which is co-sponsoring a picnic on 14 September at Governors Island, where the Dutch landed in 1624 before permanently settling in southern Manhattan soon after.  Those early immigrants never could have foreseen that the far-flung fur trading outpost they established would one day rise to become the most linguistically diverse city in history, nor that it would play host to a remarkable experiment that continues to this day: to see whether all the peoples of the world could live together in a single place. In many ways, Manhattan stands as the ultimate triumph of man over nature. But while it may be tempting to view it today less as an island and more as a cement reef covered by steel skyscrapers and manicured parks, the story of how this relatively small 23-square-mile enclave grew to become the economic capital of the world is directly attributable to a natural phenomenon many New Yorkers have long forgotten: its access to water.  ""It's all about the water. The entire city is about the water,"" said Captain Jonathan Boulware, the president and CEO of the South Street Seaport Museum in Manhattan. ""The growth of New York into the city we know today as a global capital, a cultural capital and a multicultural city, every single aspect of its identity is rooted in water and its connections to the rest of the world."" And so, as the city reflects on the many things that have made New York ""New York"" over the last 400 years, I lowered myself into a kayak and set out on a 30-mile circumnavigation of Manhattan in hopes of better understanding the one thing that made it all possible. It turns out that this nine-hour journey isn't just one of the most unique ways of seeing New York City, but a dramatic reminder of how Manhattan is rediscovering its relationship to the very rivers that shaped it.  In 1609, Henry Hudson, an English explorer hired by the Dutch to find the fabled Northwest Passage to Asia, steered his ship from the churning waters of the Atlantic into an immense protected bay. He pushed 150 miles upstream on the mile-wide river that would one day bear his name, hoping it led to China. It didn't. But while Hudson had failed to find a faster route to the riches of the East, he stumbled on one of the world's largest natural harbours. Sheltered from the sea's wrath by Staten Island and Long Island and stretching across a 770-mile network of navigable waterways extending into the continent's interior, this geographical gem wasn't just ""a safe and convenient haven, wherein 1,000 ships may ride in safety"", as the Dutch chronicler Adriaen van der Donck wrote in 1650, but a front door into the untapped resources of the New World. ""The harbour of New York is like no other. It's a marvel. It's wide, it's so deep it rarely freezes and it serves as the nexus for two bodies of water [the Hudson and East rivers] that come together to transport goods,"" said Dr Louise Mirrer, president and CEO of the New-York Historical Society.    This immense commercial potential is what attracted the Dutch to Manhattan from the start. At a time when the most efficient way to move cargo over long distances was by water, the Dutch Republic catapulted from relative obscurity to become one of the wealthiest and most powerful nations in the world by controlling maritime trade. It's also what made Manhattan distinct from other early US settlements. Unlike the Puritans who founded Boston, the Quakers who came to Philadelphia and the Catholics who arrived in Maryland, the Dutch didn't settle Manhattan to worship in peace; they came to make money.  ""The Dutch basically created a colony dedicated to capitalism. They didn't really care about religion; they were open to anybody involved in commerce,"" said Dr Gretchen Sorin, a historian and the director of the Cooperstown Graduate Program at the State University of New York at Oneonta. ""And so from the very beginning, New York has always been an incredibly diverse place."" According to one document, by 1646 the island was home to some ""400-500 men of different sects and nations"" speaking about ""18 different languages"".  But as Shorto explained, ""Manhattan was a cultural crossroads long before Europeans arrived there. It wasn't just the Lenape who used it to fish and exchange goods, but also the Shinnecock and other [Native Algonquin] peoples from the whole region who came to take advantage of the harbour and rivers."" After the Dutch purchased Mannahatta or ""Island of Many Hills"", as it was known, from the Lenape in 1626, more and more seafaring entrepreneurs poured into the harbour to navigate up these rivers, shipping beaver pelts, tobacco and grain from the continent's interior back to Europe. The Dutch eventually declared the settlement a free-trade zone in 1640, and by the time the British took it at cannon point in 1664 and renamed it after the Duke of York, this ambitious, polyglot little seaport had planted the seeds of religious tolerance, individualism and enterprise that would eventually spread across the nation. Mannahatta: An ecological oasis When the Dutch arrived on Mannahatta, it was a stunningly biodiverse place. In his book Mannahatta: A Natural History of New York City, landscape ecologist Eric W Sanderson details that in 1609 the island was home to 66 miles of rivers and streams, 233 species of birds, 32 types of reptiles and amphibians, 70 kinds of trees, 24 species of mammals and 55 different ecosystems – which is more, per acre, than Yosemite and Yellowstone or a typical coral reef or rainforest of the same size. ""If Mannahatta existed today as it did then,"" he writes, ""it would be the crowning glory of American national parks."" The British soon surpassed the Dutch as the greatest maritime empire on Earth and Manhattan became a nexus point for the flow of goods and people around the globe. Coopers, blacksmiths, sailmakers and shipbuilders began flooding to the island city, and by the 1770s, New York had become ""the breadbasket of the Atlantic"", shipping wheat and timber to Britain and importing rum, molasses and sugar – as well as enslaved people – from the Caribbean and Africa. The city would burn at the end of the American Revolution, but over the next few decades, it would become the largest place in the western hemisphere – all thanks to water.  In 1795, New York replaced Philadelphia as the country's main port, and as more ships from around the world flooded in and out of the harbour, the city expanded north from the southern tip of Manhattan at astonishing speed. Old Dutch farms and English estates were quickly carved up into smaller and smaller plots until DeWitt Clinton (arguably the greatest or worst New Yorker in history) spearheaded two ideas that would forever change Manhattan. The first was to level the entire natural geography of the island to accommodate its growing seaport. In 1811, the city filled in its marshes, paved over its spring-fed ponds and levelled the oak and hemlock forests where wolves and bear once roamed, replacing it all with a massive 11,000-acre street grid that turned this ""island of hills"" into an island of rectangles. The second was the construction of a 363-mile-long ditch connecting the Hudson River to the Great Lakes. When the Erie Canal opened in 1825, it not only paved the way for Manhattan to become an industrial juggernaut by giving it direct water access to the Midwest, but transformed the young nation by allowing the mass movement of goods, ideas and people across the country. The city was on its way to becoming the busiest port in the world and the centre of a new global supply chain connecting the continent with the rest of the globe. As Manhattan exploded with industry and became the place to do business, so many immigrants steamed into the harbour that according to Census records, by 1860 nearly 70% of adults in New York City were born outside the US. Manhattan: America's emporium The book Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 reveals that by 1836, 62% of all imports to the US came through Manhattan, and on a single day that year, 921 boats on the East River waited to dock on South Street, while an another 320 waited on the Hudson. ""If you look at aerial photos of Manhattan [in the late 1800s and early 1900s], it's so completely ringed with piers that it looks like a porcupine,"" Boulware said. ""These ships were coming from all over the world to load and unload cargo, and there were a lot of entrepreneurs trying to creatively turn $5 into $6 on those docks. It was an early example of the New York hustle. This is the DNA of the city and the port and water is the core of it.""  As planes started replacing passenger liners and container ships were diverted to New Jersey in the 1950s, Manhattan's maritime industry began to collapse. Over the coming decades, piers and warehouses were abandoned, docks fell into decay and New York Harbor, which had been one of the most diverse and dynamic environments on the planet when the Dutch showed up, became a de facto dump.  But in the last decade, billions of dollars have been pumped into cleaning up the city's waterways, a string of ambitious projects have transformed Manhattan's rusting piers into landscaped green spaces and the city's once-derelict waterfront has become a model of urban renewal. As a result, more than four centuries after Hudson's crew reported that waves of Lenape came out to greet their ship in ""great canoes"" as they approached the island, Manhattan is returning to its water-bound roots, and quickly emerging as one of the US's most unique paddling destinations. ""There's no place like it in the country,"" said Suzy Basu, managing partner of Manhattan Kayak Co, which offers hourly rentals, classes and guided tours around the city – including a 30-mile lap of Manhattan. ""So many people here don't even realise Manhattan is an island, but when you paddle around this magnificent, man-made mountain range of towers shooting into the sky, it changes your whole perspective of the city. You'll see.""  Pushing out of Pier 84 and into the Hudson's swift tidal flow, it quickly became clear that the key to navigating Manhattan's waterways on your own power is something the island's Indigenous residents understood long ago: it's all about the current.  The original Algonquin name for the Hudson River was Mahicantuck or ""river that flows two ways"". That's because, like the East River that rings Manhattan's opposite end (which isn't actually a river but a tidal strait), its current changes direction every few hours as it flows in and out of the ocean. Therefore, our floating parade of 14 kayakers and four stand up paddleboarders would travel counterclockwise around the island in a perfectly timed route designed to take advantage of the rivers' shifting currents.  Accompanying us were three guides armed with two-way radios whose job was to safely navigate us through the rush of ferries, barges and sightseeing cruises – one of whom was Eric Stiller, Manhattan Kayak Co's 64-year-old founder, who estimates he's circumnavigated the island 80 to 100 times. He explained that back in the 1980s, there was no access to the water for paddlers anywhere, so he used to jump fences and launch his foldable kayak in the Hudson from rotting piers. As word of his exploits spread, people started paying him to lead them out into the rivers where no one else dared go.  ""My first paying customer was [American singer] David Lee Roth, followed soon after by John F Kennedy Jr,"" he said, as we paddled towards the glimmering pinnacles of the Chrysler and Empire State buildings in the distance. ""We used to wheel kayaks out [in the Meatpacking District], jump the fence and paddle out to Ellis Island. That's how this all started."" Fast-forward to today and the New York City Water Trail connects paddlers with 160 square miles of navigable waterways, dozens of launch sites dot the city and many of Manhattan's newly opened boathouses now offer free kayaking.  As the current carried us south along the 550-acre Hudson River Park that runs along Manhattan's western shore, the island's recent waterfront revival unfolded in front of us. Since first opening in 1998, the park has been slowly transforming many of the collapsing piers that once propelled the city's growth into creative urban oases – all while paying homage to Manhattan's maritime past and incorporating native ecosystems that thrived here 400 years ago.  We soon paddled past Little Island, a $260m ""floating park"" rising like a bouquet of tulip-shaped concrete columns from the Hudson that opened in 2021. Built atop the former Cunard Line dock that shipped people and goods between Manhattan and the British Empire (and next to the pier where the survivors from the Titanic landed in 1912), it's home to 350 species of flowers, trees and shrubs that Mannahatta's early residents would recognise today.  Moments later, we drifted past Gansevoort Peninsula, where novelist Herman Melville spent years working as a customs inspector at the wharf after writing Moby Dick. Opened in 2023, the park features a restored marsh, native grasses and a 1,200-ton sand beach designed to mirror those that lined the island's western shore when the Dutch arrived. Tribeca's 2.5-acre ""ecologically themed"" Pier 26 then came into view, where a newly planted woodland forest, coastal grassland and maritime scrub is designed to mimic the river's original coastal habitat. A brand-new ""estuarium"" opened in January 2024 featuring a playground inspired by fish species that thrived in the Hudson before European colonisation, and as I looked to my left, I spotted children climbing into the gills of a colossal Atlantic sturgeon.  Work is underway on the other side of Manhattan, too, where the East Midtown Waterfront project is part of a grand vision to close the loop and provide New Yorkers with continuous waterfront open space around Manhattan once it's completed in 2026.  As we approached the southern tip of Manhattan where the Dutch settled, a sudden ""Hold!"" command from Stiller thrust me back into the present. Four centuries later, these waters remain Manhattan's busiest maritime throughfare. With boats and barges rumbling all around us, Stiller explained that once he gave the signal, we had exactly 10 minutes to round the island's southern point before the next Staten Island ferry stormed by.    I glanced over at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island on my right, One World Trade Center on my left and snapped a quick picture with my phone. Then, one of our guides, Tommy Montgomery said, ""You're going to want to secure that now before we get to Hell Gate.""  ""Before we get to what?"" I asked.  But before he could reply, Stiller shouted, ""Now, now, now!"" Paddling as hard as we could, our crew quickly crossed the channel, caught the East River's flood tide and shot north on an 11-knot (12.5 mph) highway past the last 19th-Century cargo sailing ship still docked at the historic South Street Seaport and under the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges. At one point, I noticed we were zipping past a kid biking along the East River Greenway. As we neared the northern tip of Roosevelt Island, Montgomery looked back at me.  ""Okay, this"" he said, ""this is Hell Gate. Stay to the left and paddle hard.""  Coined by the Dutch (Helle Gadt) and known as the most notorious stretch of the city's complex waterways, Hell Gate is the swirling, churning, narrow tidal strait where the Harlem and East rivers meet. It's also the final resting place of hundreds of ships. But because successfully traversing it could save merchants sailing from New York Harbor to New England days of travel, so many sailors tried to run its gauntlet that in the 1850s, an estimated 1,000 ships ran aground here every year. In 1885, at the height of Manhattan's maritime might, officials determined that subduing this treacherous passageway was so crucial to the nation's economy that the US Army Corps of Engineers blew up its bedrock with 300,000 lbs of explosives in the largest planned detonation before the atomic bomb.  Today, the confluence remains chaotic and unpredictable – akin to ""paddling through a whirlpool"", as Stiller later told me – but with the currents working in our favour, we were soon beached at Randall's Island.  One of the consequences planners likely didn't consider when they paved over Manhattan's natural topography is that there are virtually no places people can feasibly stop when kayaking around it – even for a bathroom break. A rocky beach on Randall's Island is one of the few exceptions. So as the other paddlers downed their energy bars and I tucked into my bodega sandwich, I took a moment to meet them.   Of the group's 17 other paddlers, 11 were women and only one other person had never completed ""the circ"". There was Nick Avrutin, who said he spends so much time on the water with Manhattan Kayak Co that he now stores his kayak at the boathouse; Stacey Hull, who was attempting her first circ on a stand up paddleboard after many in a kayak; and Giandomenica Becchio, who travels from her home in Turin, Italy, to New York every summer to lap the island.  ""When you get on the water, it really gives you a different perspective of what the city is,"" said Eva Rivlin, looking down at a crab that had washed up on the beach. ""Our shorelines are these incredible, diverse ecosystems, and to see it from this perspective, you really understand not only the scale of the city but how it all fits together."" As we chatted, a family waded into the water nearby. Officials maintain that after decades of neglect and abuse (and a more-than $45bn restoration effort), the city's waterways are now cleaner and healthier than they've been since the Civil War. In fact, many experts agree that it's generally safe to swim in the Hudson, and I even spotted a swimmer tearing through the river later that day. Rivlin pointed across the river to one of the 700 outfalls that dump billions of gallons of sewage into the city's waterways each year, but she also pointed towards a rusting pier reclaimed by the Billion Oyster Project, whose ambitious goal is to restore the 220,000 acres of oyster reefs that sustained the Lenape and nourished the Dutch.  ""People still have this perception that the water is dirty and not safe, and it's still dirty, but it's incredible the developments in the last 15-20 years that have changed it by leaps and bounds,"" Rivlin said. Two hours and 13 bridges later, we had finally paddled our way out of the Harlem River's modern industrial sprawl and reached the island's northern tip at Inwood Hill Park, where Mannahatta's primordial past still defies Manhattan's paved presence. It's perhaps fitting that here, just a few steps from a series of caves used by the island's Native inhabitants for millennia, a 1,000-year-old rock marks the site where the Lenape purportedly sold the island to the Dutch four centuries ago.  Moments after I watched the heron vanish into the reeds, the trilling of crickets was swept aside by the whooshing traffic and whirring helicopters of the city. My fleeting glimpse of Mannahatta was gone – or so I thought. As we waited for the Hudson's current to shift so it could carry us south towards the soaring skyscrapers of Midtown, it occurred to me that for as much as this island had changed in the last 400 years, one part of its natural landscape remained the same – and it had been guiding me around Manhattan all day.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cz73xj5rjlvo,Seven of the best stories from a brilliant Paralympics,A look at seven of the best moments from a brilliant Paralympic Games in Paris.,8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:35.289992,China News,BBC,China,"Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid were among Great Britain's gold medal winners in Paris The 2024 Paralympics in Paris have come to an end after 11 days of thrilling sporting action. For Great Britain, it was a Games to remember. ParalympicsGB won 49 gold medals as part of a total medal haul of 124. In and out of the sporting action, there were many moments that will live long in the memory, both for those in action and those spectating. Here are a selection of those moments from the past week and a half in Paris. In wheelchair tennis, GBâs Alfie Hewett earned a gold and silver medal double in the final days of the Paralympics. Hewett, 26, won his menâs doubles final with Gordon Reid on Friday - having lost three Paralympic finals across the previous two Games in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. Upon victory, he waved his racquet in the air and embraced Reid following a win he described as the ""stuff of dreams"". He was back in singles action on Saturday and having suffered a groin injury in the opening game, and then lost the first set 6-2, came back to take Japanâs Tokito Oda to three sets. Hewett, who only needed a menâs singles gold to complete a career set of accomplishments, won the second set 6-4, and then had a match point in the decider - but Oda came from 5-3 down to win it 7-5. While Hewett would have hoped for two golds, his back-to-back medals and doubles gold are reward for a player who has now featured in five Paralympic finals. Sophie Unwin (right) and pilot Jenny Holl (left) were among those to win gold medals on 'Super Sunday' The first of two Sundays at the Paralympics produced 18 medals for ParalympicsGB, including 12 golds. Not only was it their most successful day of the Games, but the most successful this century. There was an even split across sports, with Para-rowing, Para-cycling, Para-athletics and Para-swimming all producing multiple medals, including a first of the Games for Hannah Cockroft in the womenâs T34 100m final. It was not just individuals who stood out, with GBâs golden Sunday including mixed double sculls, mixed coxed four, mixed team sprint and mixed freestyle triumphs. Great Britain started day four with 11 golds and 26 medals, ending it with 23 golds and 44 medals. Poppy Maskill won three gold medals in Paris More than a third of ParalympicsGBâs gold medals - 18 out of 49 - came in the pool. Great Britainâs young squad of swimmers included the duo of Poppy Maskill, 19, and Alice Tai, 25, who won five medals each. For debutant Maskill in particular, it was a Games to remember. She entered five events and won three golds and two silvers across S14 individual events, as well as the mixed team freestyle relay. There were two S12 golds for Stephen Clegg in 100m events - the backstroke and butterfly finals - adding to the three medals he won in Tokyo three years ago. William Ellard, 18, won two golds and a silver, while Maisie Summers-Newton, 22, and Tully Kearney, 27, also provided Great Britain with a pair of gold medals each. Britain won swimming medals on all 10 full days of the Paralympics, all but one of which included at least one gold. Kadeena Cox (right) celebrated her team gold medal three days after crashing out of her singles race The opening day of the Games in Paris bought heartbreak from Kadeena Cox, one of ParalympicsGB's star names heading into this summer. In the womenâs C1-5 500m time trial, where Cox was among the favourites, she struggled to get rhythm on the bike and fell off within seconds of her start, unable to finish the race. Cox was helped off the track in tears following the crash, which she described as a ânightmareâ. Keen to make up for her singles disappointment in the team event three days later, she helped GB win gold on Super Sunday alongside Jody Cundy and Jaco van Gass in the mixed C1-5 750m team sprint final. Cox's gold was her seventh career Paralympic medal. Iona Winnifrith was the youngest of ParalympicsGB's medal winners ParalympicsGB's squad consisted of a wide range of experienced competitors, as well as a look at the next generation, who delivered plenty of medals. Sarah Storey extended her run as Great Britain's most-decorated Paralympian. At 46, she won golds in the womenâs C4-5 road race and C5 time trial, taking her to 19 Paralympic golds and 30 medals in total. Hannah Cockroft, 32, competing at her fourth career Games, continued her perfect record of T34 gold medals, winning over 100 and 800 metres. All nine of her medals have been gold. While Storey and Cockroft were among the familiar faces to win medals, there was also a look to the future. On the same day, there were silver medals for the teenage duo of Iona Winnifrith and Bly Twomey. Winnifrith finished second in the womenâs SB7 100m breaststroke final, while Twomey took Para-table tennis bronzes in the women's singles and doubles events, the latter alongside Felicity Pickard. Winnifrith, aged 13, and Twomey, 14, were among those to show that ParalympicsGB has a bright future. This video can not be played Grinham - Nothing is impossible Jodie Grinham won gold and bronze medal in Para-shooting while seven months pregnant. She was first Paralympian known to have been pregnant while competing at a Games. ""As long as I'm healthy and baby's healthy, I knew we could compete,â Grinham said. This video can not be played The story of a Paralympic marriage proposal and a pregnancy announcement. Tracy Otto of the United States had a summer in Paris to remember. Midway through the Games, she announced that not only she had got engaged to partner Ricky Riessl under the Eiffel Tower, but that she, like Grinham, was also expecting her first child. The 28-year-old confirmed the news on Instagram, captioning the photo ""may not have won a medal today but I am going home with something shiny"". What's happening and when at the Paris Paralympics?

Joan Kersey was a regular visitor to Ipswich High School where she spoke about her time there, according to Dan Browning, head teacher of the independent school, which moved to nearby Woolverstone in the 1990s. On social media Mr Browning said of the school's oldest ""old girl"": ""We were all impressed by her memory and ability to name classmates and teachers when she looked at old school photos.  ""She was a very important part of our IHS family and we will miss her kindness and sense of fun."" The school was formerly a girls' school based on Westerfield Road in the centre of Ipswich. It moved to Woolverstone Hall on the Shotley peninsula in early 1990s, and has recently been bought by owners with links to China and become fully co-educational. Noteable former pupils include the late June Brown, who played Dot Cotton in the BBC's EastEnders. Ms Kersey, who died aged 109, lived in Tattingstone near Ipswich, where she served as a warden at St Mary's Church, for more than 50 years. Fellow warden, Linda Smalley described her as a ""charming, lovely lady... a very faithful, loyal servant"" to the church. ""She was a very caring lady and could remember everyone's names, even at her age. An absolutely amazing lady. Everybody loved her,"" she said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ej0xx2jpxo,"Surging seas are coming for us all, warns UN chief","Speaking to the BBC at the Pacific Islands Forum, António Guterres says these islands are the ""most vulnerable"".",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:35.608755,China News,BBC,China,"The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has said that big polluters have a clear responsibility to cut emissions – or risk a worldwide catastrophe. “The Pacific is today the most vulnerable area of the world,” he told the BBC at the Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting in Tonga. “There is an enormous injustice in relation to the Pacific and it’s the reason I am here.” “The small islands don’t contribute to climate change but everything that happens because of climate change is multiplied here.” But eventually the ""surging seas are coming for us all,"" he warned in a speech at the forum, as the UN releases two separate reports on rising sea levels and how they threaten Pacific island nations. The World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Climate in the South West Pacific report says this region faces a triple whammy of an accelerating rise in the sea level, a warming of the ocean and acidification – a rise in the sea’s acidity because it’s absorbing more and more carbon dioxide. “The reason is clear: greenhouse gases – overwhelmingly generated by burning fossil fuels – are cooking our planet,” Mr Guterres said in a speech at the forum.  “The sea is taking the heat – literally.” This year’s theme - transformative resilience – was tested on the opening day when the new auditorium was deluged by heavy rains and buildings evacuated because of an earthquake.  ""It's such a stark reminder of how volatile things are within our region, and how important it is that we need to prepare for everything,"" Joseph Sikulu, Pacific director at 350, a climate change advocacy group, told the BBC.  Not far from the venue was a street parade, with dancers representing the region, including Torres Strait islanders, Tongans and Samoans. At the start of the parade, a big banner reads: ""We are not drowning, we are fighting"". Another says: ""Sea levels are rising – so are we"".  It echoes a challenge that threatens to wipe out their world - the UN Climate Action Team released a report called ""Surging Seas in a Warming World"" showing that global average sea levels are rising at rates unprecedented in the past 3,000 years.  According to the report, the levels have risen an average of 9.4cm (3.7in) in the past 30 years but in the tropical Pacific, that figure was as high as 15cm. ""It's important for leaders, especially like Australia and Aotearoa, to come and witness these things for themselves, but also witness the resilience of our people,"" Mr Sikulu said.  ""A core part of Tongan culture is our ability to be able to continue to be joyful throughout our adversity, and that's how we practise our resilience and to see and witness that, I think is going to be important."" This is the second time Secretary-General Guterres has participated in the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting. The annual meeting brings together leaders from 18 Pacific Islands, including Australia and New Zealand. As leaders convened for the official opening ceremony, heavy rain caused extensive flooding. Shortly afterwards, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the Tonga region, highlighting just how vulnerable it is.  In 2019, Mr Guterres travelled to Tuvalu where he sounded the alarm about rising sea levels. Five years on, he says he has seen real changes. “We see everywhere an enormous commitment to resist, a commitment to reduce the negative impact of climate change,” he told the BBC. “The problem is, the Pacific Islands also suffer another big injustice - the international financial instruments that exist to support countries in distress were not designed for countries like this.” Mr Guterres on Monday visited local communities whose livelihoods are threatened by rising sea levels. They’ve been waiting for seven years for a decision to be made on the funding of a sea wall. “The bureaucracy, the complexity, the lack of sense of urgency because it’s a small island, far away,” he said, citing the failings of the international financial system, especially when it comes to small, developing island states.  “There are promises of increases of money available for adaptation in developing countries but the truth is we are far from what is needed, from the solidarity that is needed for these countries to be able to exist.” Many Pacific islanders here at the conference single out the biggest regional donor and emitter - Australia.  Earlier this year, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia would be ramping up its extraction and use of gas until “2050 and beyond,” despite calls to phase out fossil fuels. “There is an essential responsibility of the big polluters,” Mr Guterres said, when asked by the BBC what message he has for regional emitters like Australia. Without that, the world will breach the threshold of 1.5C that was established in the Paris Agreement in 2015. That agreement aims to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2C by the end of the century, and ""pursue efforts"" to keep warming within the safer limit of 1.5C. “Only by limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius do we have a fighting chance of preventing the irreversible collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets – and the catastrophes that accompany them,” Mr Guterres said.  “That means cutting global emissions 43% compared to 2019 levels by 2030, and 60% by 2035.” Last year though, global emissions rose 1%. “There is an obligation of the G20 that represent 80% of emissions – there’s an obligation for them to come together, to guarantee a reduction of emissions now,"" Mr Guterres said.  Singling out the G20 as well as companies who contribute to much of the world's global emissions, he added: ""They have a clear responsibility to reverse the current trend. It’s time to say 'enough'."""

Six people were on board the Naddoddur when it got into trouble on Tuesday evening - the fourth day of the voyage - and a distress signal was sent.  Only five people managed to get into an inflatable life raft. They were later airlifted to safety by helicopter. A woman's body was eventually found on Wednesday morning close to where the boat capsized. The US State Department confirmed the death of an American citizen ""off the coast of Norway"" but declined to comment further ""out of respect for the privacy of the family"".  ""We extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the deceased,"" the agency told BBC News.  Norwegian media identified the deceased woman as 29-year-old Karla Dana. A blog maintained by the group contains several entries written by Ms Dana. In one post that appears to have been written before their departure, she describes trepidation over the expedition as she watched online videos of the North Sea.  ""It’s hard to keep excitement from turning into fear when you see those waves casually tossing around huge modern boats like toys,"" she wrote in the post, which published Wednesday.  ""But there’s a wild beauty in the North Sea, a reminder of nature’s raw power, and I feel incredibly lucky to be part of this adventure."" Ms Dana's body was found trapped underneath the capsized boat, Faroe Islands news website local.fo reported. Norway's Sea Rescue Society (NSSR) described conditions when the boat capsized as very demanding, posting a video of the strong winds and high sea west of the town of Stad.  It said waves were up to 5m (16ft) and winds were as much as 40 knots. According to Ms Dana's LinkedIn profile, she is an archaeologist specialising in the Viking era, with previous experience working and studying in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, England, Germany, Morocco, China and Taiwan. In 2023, Ms Dana joined the Florida chapter of The Explorers Club. The Explorers Club is a prestigious international organisation founded in 1904 by Arctic explorers to promote scientific discovery and research. Joseph Dituri, the chairman of The Explorers Club's Florida chapter who sponsored Ms Dana's entry into the club last year, said that her death is a reminder ""that we make these dangerous Expeditions and Explorations look easy but they are not"". ""This brave Explorer left this planet doing something she loved entirely too early,"" he told BBC News. ""Her exploration spirit was evident in everything she did as well as her zest for life! It is a better world having had her in it."" Dr Dituri, who holds a Guinness World Record for having spent 100 days in an underwater habitat, said that Ms Dana had begun to pursue an archaeology masters degree in June at the University of the Highlands and Islands at the remote Orkney Island campus. ""As she finished her first excavation unearthing Iron Age Viking artifacts in the Orkneys, Karla shared, 'I’m happy to say I’m living out my dreams,'"" Dr Dituri said. Earlier, she had led a project in Costa Rica, doing ethnographic field research on the Ngöbe Indigenous Tribe. Her work culminated in book about the tribe's language, legends and traditions. Bergur Jacobsen, who is chairman of the Naddoddur boat club on the Faroe Islands, told the BBC that everyone was very sad about what had happened. He explained that the 10m-long boat had been on previous Viking voyages before to Iceland, Shetland and Norway. ""It's not a Viking boat, it's a Faroes fishing boat without a motor but with sails."" He said he could not speak about the accident as a Norwegian investigation team was due to speak to him. Locals were said to be in shock over the accident. One seaman told the BBC that visitors were keen to go on expeditions with the boat, although he would not have done so himself. The expedition had been postponed for several days because of bad weather until Saturday. One of four Swiss nationals on the trip, Andy Fitze, posted a map on social media two days into the voyage showing the boat to the north-east of Shetland. Before the trip, the Faroese member of the crew, Livar Nysted, said when you were in the middle of a storm ""you just try to do the best you can"".  ""It's an open boat. You sleep under the stars and when it's raining or windy you can feel the elements."" The expedition was not affiliated with the Viking Cruises company. With additional reporting from Max Matza"

It is played by two teams of three using a ball with bells inside. The ball is the size of a basketball but twice the weight. The game is played on a standard volleyball court and the goals are nine metres in width, which is the same length as the court. All players on the court must be blindfolded and the aim is to roll or throw the ball into the opponents' goal as many times as possible within two halves of 12 minutes. The ball must make contact with certain areas of the court and once it has passed these points, defenders will attempt to block the ball with their bodies. Beyond the group stages, drawn matches are resolved by two extra halves of three minutes. If the game is still tied after this period, extra throws will decide the winner - this is goalball's equivalent of a penalty shootout. For the third Games in a row, neither the Great Britain men nor women will be competing having failed to get through qualifying.  Brazil and Turkey are the defending champions in the men's and women's events and are also the reigning world champions. In the men's event, the strongest challenge could come from China, who were only beaten 6-5 in the final at the Worlds, as well as European champions Ukraine and Lithuania, who took gold in Rio in 2016. Turkey are aiming for a third win in a row in the women's competition but Tokyo silver medallists USA will not be involved after failing to qualify from the Americas region. World silver medallists South Korea and Japan, bronze medallists at the 2020 Games, could be the biggest dangers along with China. There are 11 different officials in a game of goalball. There are two main referees responsible for officiating the match, who use different whistle blows and verbal commands so the players understand. Four officials are located near the goalposts and they are responsible for replacing balls and guiding substituted players on and off the court. The remaining officials work away from the court on the table recording scoresheets and the remaining time left in the match. None"

Defending champion Novak Djokovic followed Carlos Alcaraz out of the door at the US Open as he suffered a shock defeat by Alexei Popyrin in the third round. Australia's 28th seed Popyrin stood with his arms aloft as he wrapped up a surprise 6-4 6-4 2-6 6-4 win to hand Djokovic his earliest US Open exit in 18 years. The Serb will end the year without winning a Grand Slam for the first time since 2017, while his search for a record 25th major title goes on. Djokovic was far from his clinical best, serving a career-high 14 double faults in a Grand Slam match and committing 49 unforced errors. ""I have played some of the worst tennis I have ever played,"" the 37-year-old said. ""Honestly, the way I felt and the way I played from the beginning of this tournament, third round is a success."" Djokovic's exit follows that of French Open and Wimbledon winner Alcaraz, who lost to unseeded Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round. He said he ""spent a lot of energy"" winning Olympic gold - his self-proclaimed ""biggest sporting achievement"" - earlier this month. ""I tried my best, I didn't have any physical issues. I just felt out of gas, and you could see that. From the first match, I just didn't find myself on this court."" Djokovic added. ""Life moves on. I'll try to recalibrate and look forward to what's next."" Popyrin, 25, will make his first fourth-round appearance at a Grand Slam when he faces Frances Tiafoe, who moved past fellow American Ben Shelton in a five-set thriller. Champion Gauff comes from behind to beat Svitolina Dart and Parry upset Olympic champions at US Open 'More aggressive' Draper faces Alcaraz conqueror in third round Popyrin enjoyed a positive build-up to the US Open, claiming his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Montreal earlier this month. The Sydney-born player was brimming with confidence as he manoeuvred his way through the first set, fending off five break points before striking at 4-4 and serving it out. He looked even better in the second, steadily going about his work and winning 88% of points on his first serve as Djokovic continued to falter. The 24-time major winner finally burst to life at the beginning of the third set, winning the first three games before a blip allowed Popyrin to break back. But Djokovic was quick to respond and animatedly demanded more noise from the  lively crowd on Arthur Ashe Stadium as he restored his advantage and broke for a third time to keep his title defence alive. Djokovic was aiming to win a fifth US Open that would have moved him past  Margaret Court and take sole ownership of the all-time record for the most Grand Slam singles titles. The pair continued to go toe-to-toe in set four, but Popyrin landed Djokovic in deep trouble when he he successfully converted his fourth break point in the fifth game. He held firm in his next service game, too, saving two break points before a series of double faults and careless errors from the usually clinical Djokovic moved the 28th seed to the brink of a seismic victory. With a double break behind him, Popyrin failed on his first attempt at serving out the match but he was more successful the second time around, landing three huge serves before Djokovic pushed the first match point long. ""It's unbelievable because I've been in the third round about 15 times in my career but haven't been able to get to the fourth round,"" Popyrin said. ""To be able to do it against the greatest of all time to get into the fourth round is unbelievable, it's a great feeling that the hard work has paid off."" Tiafoe reached the semi-finals of the US Open in 2022 - his best performance at a Grand Slam Earlier, Tiafoe avenged his defeat by Shelton at last year's US Open by beating the 13th seed in an all-American five-set thriller. The pair, who are good friends, faced each other in the quarter-finals in New York last year with Shelton emerging as the victor. But it was the lower-ranked Tiafoe who won on Friday, coming from behind twice to triumph 4-6 7-5 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 6-3 after more than four entertaining hours on Arthur Ashe Stadium. ""Ben is an incredible player, he really is. He goes for all kinds of shots, he's got no care in the world. It's really annoying,"" 20th seed Tiafoe said. Meanwhile, American 12th seed Taylor Fritz continued his perfect run in New York with a 6-3 6-4 6-2 victory against Argentina's Francisco Comesana. Fritz, who has yet to drop a set, will face Norway's Casper Ruud, a finalist in 2022 who made a remarkable comeback from two sets down to beat Shang Juncheng of China 6-7 (1-7) 3-6 6-0 6-3 6-1. Russian sixth seed Andrey Rublev was the first men's singles player to make it into the fourth round with an assured 6-3 7-5 6-4 victory over Czech Jiri Lehecka. Rublev, a 10-time Grand Slam quarter-finalist who has yet to win a major, will face Grigor Dimitrov after the Bulgarian ninth seed claimed a dominant 6-3 6-3 6-1 win against Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor. Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent The signs were clear - even in two straight-sets victories earlier in the week - that Djokovic was far from at his best, and Popyrin was a man perfectly equipped to take advantage. Fuelled by the confidence of winning the Masters event in Montreal earlier this month, the Australian became the first man in 18 years to beat Djokovic before the fourth round of the US Open. The 24-time Grand Slam champion served 32 double faults in just three matches. Mentally, Djokovic was drained. The Olympic gold was his highlight of this - and many other - years, and at the age of 37 he was never likely to switch surfaces without any match practice and win seven matches over the best of five sets. His exit means Roger Federer remains the last man to defend the US Open title - all the way back in 2008. Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone"

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg64pwxzln4o,Will sustainable aviation fuels take off?,"Sustainable aviation fuels work, but can they be made in sufficient quantity to replace fossil fuels?",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:42.609049,China News,BBC,China,"In a building on the edge of a business park outside Sheffield, researcher Ihab Ahmed is preparing to fire up a small jet engine. Originally used as an auxiliary power unit for a commercial airliner, it has been turned into a testbed for new fuels developed in a laboratory next door. The arrangement is a centrepiece of Sheffield University’s Sustainable Fuels Innovation Centre (SAF-IC), a research facility set up to allow synthetic fuels to be prepared and evaluated on a small scale, before being put into large scale production. On a bank of computer screens in a nearby control room, Ihab can monitor the engine as it starts with a burst of flame and powers up. Sensors tell him what the engine is doing in real time – and allow the exhaust gases to be continually analysed. Sustainable aviation fuels (or SAF) are synthetic alternatives to fossil fuels, made from renewable sources. These can include waste cooking oils, vegetable fats and agricultural waste, as well as captured carbon dioxide. The advantage of burning fuels like these is that it does not add to the overall load of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The carbon emitted has only recently been removed, either by plants or by chemical processes. By contrast, burning fossil fuels releases carbon that has been stored in the earth for millions of years. “From an environmental perspective, it’s day and night,"" Mr Ahmed explains. “In principle, the CO2 should be a net zero, so there is no more carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere, but another benefit is the non-CO2 part of things. “For example, it reduces the particulates or smoke that comes out of the engine, which can affect your lungs, as well as contributing to the creation of contrails."" In practice, sustainable fuels are not carbon neutral, because of the energy used in producing, refining and transporting them. The actual reductions vary widely depending on the fuel used. The aviation industry is under pressure to find an alternative to jet fuel. According to forecasts from both Airbus and Boeing, the global airliner fleet is expected to more than double over the next two decades, as the middle classes in countries like India and China expand, and demand for air travel increases. At the same time, members of the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines, have committed to reaching net zero by 2050. Some gains will be made by replacing older planes with new ones. The most modern aircraft are between 15 and 30% more fuel efficient than their predecessors. Yet if the industry is to continue expanding, much more will be needed. In the longer term, new technologies such as hydrogen power and electrification are likely to play a role, at least on shorter routes. But there are steep challenges to overcome. Hydrogen, for example, is bulky and difficult to store in large quantities. It either needs to be kept as a highly compressed gas or as a very cold liquid. To be sustainable, it has to be made in a ""clean"" way, from renewable sources – and supplies now are very limited. “We believe we could bring a small hydrogen fuel cell aircraft to the market between 2035 and 2045, technically,” says Arjen Meijer, chief executive of the Brazilian jet maker Embraer. “But the question that needs to be answered is: will there be sufficient hydrogen to feed those aircraft? These things need to come together. They can’t happen separately."" Batteries, meanwhile, are currently very heavy in relation to the energy they contain. This makes them unsuitable for powering large planes, or being used over long distances. This means that hydrogen and hybrid, or fully electric, planes remain years away. Sustainable aviation fuels, by contrast, can be made in the lab to have the same characteristics as conventional ones derived from crude oil, so they can be used in today’s aircraft. There are restrictions. Airlines must currently use a blend of SAF with ordinary fuel, with the SAF component not exceeding 50%. However, modern planes are capable of burning 100% SAF. In a specially approved test flight last year, Virgin Atlantic flew a Boeing 787 from London to New York using fuel exclusively produced from waste fats and plant sugars. “The technologies are already available and certified for use in aircraft,"" explains Julie Kitcher, chief sustainability officer at Airbus. “The challenge with sustainable fuels is really about getting it produced at scale, across the globe, because this is a global industry, at an affordable price.” And that is very clearly the catch. Supplies of SAF are currently minimal. According to the European regulator EASA, they make up just 0.05% of the fuel used in the EU. They also cost between three and five times as much as ""regular"" jet fuel. Governments want to change this. In the UK a ""SAF mandate"" has been introduced, which stipulates that from next year, 2% of all jet fuel supplied must be SAF, increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040. The EU has a similar mandate, although it extends to 2050 – when the target for SAF use will be 63%. The US does not have minimum requirements but offers subsidies to bring down the price of sustainable fuels. But if SAF usage is to increase, production will also need to be ramped up dramatically. There are many different methods, or pathways for making sustainable fuels. They can be made from biomass, such as waste cooking oil, energy crops, wood, agricultural residues and even human waste. However, there are concerns that this will not provide all the fuel the market will ultimately need. Some feedstocks may need to be avoided, either to prevent environmental degradation such as deforestation, or to prevent land needed for growing food from being turned over to energy production. An alternative is to use a method called power to liquid, in which water and carbon dioxide are broken down, with the resulting carbon and hydrogen combined to create liquid fuel. This could produce potentially limitless supplies of fuel, but in order to be sustainable would require large quantities of renewable electricity, as well as a substantial increase in carbon capture and storage. Both processes – using biomass or power to liquid - are currently very expensive. As a result, the aviation industry is demanding action to increase production, and bring prices down through economies of scale. However, environmentalists question whether this is actually viable. ""There are good SAFs, and there are bad SAFs, but the brutal truth is that right now there is not much of either,” says Matt Finch, UK head of campaign group Transport & Environment. “Conversely, right now there are thousands of new planes on order from airlines, and all of them will burn fossil fuels for at least 20 years. ""Actions speak louder than words, and it's clear that the aviation sector has no plans to wean itself off its addiction to pollution."" Nonetheless, at the recent Farnborough Airshow, there were several significant announcements relating to SAF. A consortium including Airbus, AirFrance-KLM, Associated Energy Group, BNP Paribas and Qantas among others announced plans to invest $200m (£151m) in a new fund which will invest in “technologically mature SAF-producing projects using for instance waste-based feedstocks”. Meanwhile Boeing said it had set up a partnership with the investment company Clear Sky to promote a method of producing SAF pioneered by the British company Firefly. That method involves taking human waste and using heat and high pressure to turn it into a substance which can then be used to make SAF. In other words, it allows planes to be powered by poo.

A team of 215 athletes have represented ParalympicsGB in the French capital, with a target of 100-140 medals set by UK Sport.  At the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games, held in 2021, the GB team finished second behind China in the medal table with 124 medals, including 41 golds. The Games began with the opening ceremony on Wednesday, 28 August, with the first medals decided the following day and action continuing until Sunday's closing ceremony. Medal events: 14 Para-athletics (menâs T54 marathon, T12 marathon; womenâs T54 marathon, T12 marathon); Para-canoe (womenâs KL1, KL2, KL3; menâs VL2, VL3); Para-powerlifting (womenâs up to 86kg, over 86kg; menâs up to 107kg, over 107kg); Wheelchair basketball (womenâs final) On the final day, action returns to the streets of the French capital with the marathons (from 07:00) which will include a 185-metre climb and link Seine-Saint-Denis, the area at the heart of the Games, and central Paris. As the race nears its end, the competitors will pass through Place de la Concorde, which hosted the opening ceremony, before heading up the Champs-Elysees and its cobbles to the Arc de Triomphe and the finish line at the Esplanade des Invalides, which was also the Olympic marathon finish. Eden Rainbow-Cooper made a major breakthrough when she won the Boston Marathon in April and will hope to shine on the Paris streets along with David Weir who famously won in London but was fifth in Tokyo after failing to finish in Rio. GB will be hoping for canoe success with defending KL2 champion Charlotte Henshaw and KL3 champion Laura Sugar both hoping to be on top of the podium again (10:41 and 11:07) and could model and Mr England winner Jack Eyers land a medal in the VL3 final (11:41)? Eyers chose to have his right leg amputated aged 16 and was the first amputee to be crowned Mr England The final day of powerlifting sees the heavyweights take to the stage - the women's up to 86kg (09:35) and over 86kg divisions (13:00) and the men's up to 107kg (08:00) and over 107kg (14:35) - the final gold medal before the closing ceremony. In the over 107kg division in Tokyo, Jordan's Jamil Elshebli and Mansour Pourmirzaei of Iran both lifted 241kg - almost 38 stone in old money - with Elshebli winning gold on countback. Chinaâs Deng Xuemei lifted 153kg to take the women's over 86kg and you can expect plenty of big lifts again this time around. The women's wheelchair basketball also takes centre stage with the Netherlands aiming to retain the title they won for the first time in Tokyo - they take on the United States in the final (12:45)."

The McLaren driver beat Red Bullâs Max Verstappen by 0.356 seconds in qualifying at Zandvoort - a significant margin around one of the shorter laps of the season. âI feel like I did a very good lap, by far my best. The car was good and I felt good too,â said Norris, who paid tribute to his team for the success of their first upgrade to the car since the Miami race in May. âWe've been quite patient. We've not really brought many upgrades, or we haven't brought any real performance-enhancing upgrades since Miami. âWe took our time because we wanted to make sure it worked well and worked as soon as we put it on the car and it does what it wants. And so far it's looked exactly that way. So credits to the team for playing a big part in this too.â It was the 24-year-old Britonâs third pole position of the season, and the largest margin in percentage teams for a pole-winning driver since Verstappenâs in China in the fourth race of the season. Norris did not convert either of the previous two - in Spain and Hungary - into a win because he was passed by rivals at the start. A series of small errors by driver or team in a number of races have cost them chances of victory and led to Norris admitting before this race that he had not been driving at the level of a world champion so far this season. Norris said: âI want to win, but I'm not desperate. I'm working hard to win. We all do as a team. All of us here want to win, but not desperate, because desperation doesn't succeed to anything.â In Spain, Norris dropped from pole to third at the first corner after being passed by Verstappen and Mercedesâ George Russell. And in Hungary he lost out to team-mate Oscar Piastri, who went on to win. The Australian qualified third in the Netherlands almost 0.5secs behind Norris. This video can not be played F1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris on his vision for the future of Formula One Norris said he and the team had been looking into how to increase their chances of converting their potential. âI know my starts have not been my forte over the last [few races] probably,â Norris said. âTheyâve not been bad, honestly. I'm still up there with being one of the best average starters. I've just missed out on a couple of races and maybe slightly worse than what it's been over the course of a season. âThere's a couple of times when they've not been quite where they need to be a couple of times I've been on the front row. Itâs been different things each time. âBut I feel confident I put in a good amount of work to kind of try and make my starts a bit better.â And he said he was hopeful Sunday would deliver the win he has wanted. âWe're in a pretty reasonable place,â Norris said. âOur long-run pace was pretty strong the other day, but Max, Oscar, both the Mercs, especially George, in the position he is, are quick and are going to be challenging. So I'm not expecting anything easy for sure.â Verstappen was pleased to qualify on the front row after a difficult weekend for Red Bull. âI never really felt that I was in the fight for pole,â the world champion said. âAnd then when you come out of qualifying on the front row, I think that's OK.â But he pointed out that Norrisâ pace advantage did not augur well for Red Bullâs chances in the race. âWhen you see the gap, it's going to be very tricky,â Verstappen said. âAlso, it just seems like Lando's a bit happier in general with just the driving and how he feels. I'm a bit more all over the place with the balance, so I don't know, maybe it stabilises a bit tomorrow.â Red Bull had their own upgrade in the Netherlands, but Verstappen acknowledged they were no longer the fastest car. âIf you look at the last, what, seven races, it's just been a bit more difficult for us,â he said. âAnd we are trying to understand or try to just improve the situation. But it's not a magic button or switch, you know, that you turn.â Verstappenâs team-make Sergio Perez took fifth, behind Mercedesâ George Russell, after benefiting from driver coaching at Silverstone this week. âIt was just to get up to speed,â Perez said. âItâs always good to refresh your mind; (and work on) things I was struggling with, understanding them.â Russell, 0.571secs off pole after being fastest in Friday practice, was optimistic he could challenge in the race. âI expect a good fight with the McLarens,â he said. âThey have still been the quickest in the last few races, even at Spa, I think Piastri was the fastest car. âIf we get the strategy right and make a good start, it can all change very quick.â His team-mate Lewis Hamilton starts 12th after struggling for pace and making an error on his final lap in the second part of qualifying. âI donât expect it to be a great race,â he said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6280kxvxpro,Anthony Fauci recovering from West Nile virus,The former chief medical adviser is now recovering at home after suffering fever and chills.,25 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:42.902553,China News,BBC,China,"Anthony Fauci, the face of the US government's response to the Covid pandemic, is recovering at home after being hospitalised with West Nile virus. The immunologist and former chief medical adviser to the president was hospitalised with the mosquito-borne disease around 11 days ago and had fever, chills and fatigue. He left hospital earlier in the week and is expected to make a full recovery, the BBC's US media partner CBS reports. Dr Fauci, 83, told CBS that he likely contracted the virus from a mosquito bite in his garden. Most people infected with West Nile virus do not feel sick, but around one in five develop symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US public health agency. The virus spreads to humans when mosquitoes bite infected birds and then subsequently bite humans, the CDC says. There is currently no vaccine for virus. It can be fatal in rare cases. Dr Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, retired from public service in 2022. He has previously said that he and his family receive death threats and now require round-the-clock security. He has faced criticism from some over his handling of the Covid pandemic. The leading immunologist was hauled in front of Congress earlier in the year by Republican politicians over accusations he attempted to obscure indirect US funding of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the lab in China some believe could be linked to the emergence of Covid-19. Dr Fauci described the allegations as false, and said they were politically motivated due to his public disagreements with former President Donald Trump at the height of the pandemic."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp70j94e8o,US trial begins in battle for Mao secretary's diaries,"Stanford University is fighting to keep the diaries, in a case framed as a battle against China's censorship.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:42.999560,China News,BBC,China,"A trial has begun in California to decide whether Stanford University can keep the diaries of a top Chinese official, in a case that is being framed as a fight against Chinese government censorship. The diaries belong to the late Li Rui, a former secretary to Communist China's founder Mao Zedong. Following Li's death in 2019, his widow sued for the documents to be returned to Beijing, claiming they belong to her.  Stanford rejects this. It says Li, who had been a critic of the Chinese government, donated his diaries to the university as he feared they would be destroyed by the Chinese Communist Party.  The diaries, which were written between 1935 and 2018, cover much of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) rule. In those eight tumultuous decades, China emerged from impoverished isolation to become indispensable to the global economy. ""If [the diaries] return to China they will be banned... China does not have a good record in permitting criticism of party leaders,"" Mark Litvack, one of Stanford's lawyers, told the BBC before the trial began. The BBC has contacted lawyers representing Zhang Yuzhen, Mr Li's widow, for comment. A prominent CCP figure known for his reformist views, Mr Li was both venerated and shunned by the party. As a young outspoken cadre he caught the eye of Mao who made him one of his personal secretaries in the mid-1950s. But the position was shortlived. When Li criticised Mao's views at a political meeting, he was ousted from the party and spent years in prison. He was among hundreds of party officials and public figures, including close allies of Mao, who fell foul of the mercurial leader. Like some of them, Li returned to prominence after Mao died in 1976. He oversaw the ministry of hydroelectric power and a CCP department that selected officials for key positions. Within the party, he was allied with the more liberal, open-minded faction advocating for reform. After his retirement, he continued to lobby the party for reform. But his unsparing, sharp-tongued criticism of leaders, including President Xi Jinping - whom he dismissed as ""lowly-educated"" - needled the government. His writings were censored and his books banned in China. As a party elder, however, he continued to be treated with respect and enjoyed privileges. When he died he was given a state funeral. Throughout, as he navigated the echelons of power, he meticulously recorded observations about party politics and key events in his diaries.  These include his account of the Tiananmen Massacre, which he witnessed from a balcony overlooking the square and labelled as ""Black Weekend"" in English in his diary. It is a highly sensitive issue that is rarely discussed in China. His daughter, Li Nanyang, began donating his documents, including the diaries, to Stanford's Hoover Institution in 2014, when he was still alive.  In a 2019 interview with BBC Chinese after his death, she said this fulfilled her father's wishes. That year Ms Zhang filed a lawsuit against Li Nanyang - her stepdaughter - in China.  Ms Zhang, who was Li Rui's second wife, argued that he wanted her to decide which of his documents would be made public and they were wrongfully given to Stanford, according to reports. The widow said the diaries contained ""deeply personal and private affairs"" of her life with Li. As the diaries can be accessed by the public at Stanford, she said their display caused her ""personal embarrassment and emotional distress"". A Beijing court ruled in Ms Zhang's favour and ordered the diaries to be handed over to her. Stanford has rejected this ruling. Its lawyers have argued that ""Chinese courts are not impartial in politically-charged cases such as this"" and that the university was not given a chance to defend itself. The trial that began in California on Monday is over a separate lawsuit launched by the university against Ms Zhang in the US.  Stanford is asking the California court to declare the university as the lawful owner of the diaries. Its lawyers argue that Li Rui wanted to donate his papers to Stanford because ""he understood that the regime would seek to suppress his account of modern Chinese history"" and he ""feared that the materials would be destroyed"". Stanford has been allowed to retain copies of the diaries, but it is arguing to keep the original documents as well, to comply with Li's wishes.  ""Li Rui wanted his diaries, including his originals, at Hoover,"" Mr Litvack said. ""That’s why they are at Hoover and we have fought to keep them at Hoover."""

The scheme would compel those working for a foreign power or body to declare their lobbying activities - failure to do so could be punishable by up to two years in prison. Plans were included in the National Security Act 2023 which came into force at the end of last year, and at the time the Home Office said the scheme was expected to begin this year. However, the Home Office says ""it is no longer expected that the scheme's requirements will come into force in 2024"". Asked about the delay, a spokeswoman said: ""It is, and always will be, an absolute priority to protect the UK against foreign interference. ""The Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS) will further strengthen our national security whilst maintaining the UK as an international hub for business."" A government official guided the BBC towards the changeover of government after the election as having caused delays, with planned regulations needing sign-offs from the new ministers.  Shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat led the plans under the previous Conservative government, and claimed the delay was ""political"", urging Labour to get ""back on track"". He said: ""Stalling on this scheme now would only put the future security of this country at risk."" The BBC has contacted Labour for comment. The scheme  is part of a shake-up of UK security laws and would require those working for a foreign government to declare their activity or face criminal prosecution. The regulations would encourage transparency around state-sponsored activity to deter foreign powers wishing to pursue their aims covertly. There would be a basic level of declarations - known as the political influence tier - and an enhanced tier, for nations the UK government deems a threat to national security, such as North Korea. Mr Tugendhat said China should be placed in the enhanced tier to defend the UK against Beijing's ""vast intelligence apparatus"". He said: ""MI5 have been clear that this scheme is essential if we are to properly fight our enemies’ attempts to interfere with our country and influence our future."" Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has also called for China to be placed in the ""enhanced tier"", which he said would increase scrutiny on Chinese government-backed operations in the UK. Relations between China and the UK have deteriorated in recent years. If China were to be included in the enhanced tier, businesses associated with the Beijing government would face restrictions and have warned of damage to commercial interests."

The firm says it temporarily suspended orders from the suppliers involved and did not resume business with them until they had stepped up efforts to tackle the issue. The revelation in Shein's 2023 sustainability report comes as it is understood to be planning to sell shares on the stock market. The company has been criticised for the conditions faced by workers at factories in its supply chain. ""Both cases were resolved swiftly, with remediation steps including terminating contracts with underage employees, ensuring the payment of any outstanding wages, arranging medical checkups and facilitating repatriation to parents/legal guardians as needed,"" Shein said. ""Following appropriate remediation, the contract manufacturers were permitted to resume business."" Shein said it has now tightened its supplier policies. Under the new rules, any child labour or forced labour violations have become grounds for immediate termination of contracts. The firm said the two cases were uncovered during the first nine months of 2023 and none were found in the last quarter of the year. It comes as the company lays the groundwork for a potential sale of shares on the stock market. The BBC understands that Shein filed initial documents for a London listing earlier this year. In June, Marco Rubio, a leading Republican on the US Senate Intelligence Committee, and an ally of Donald Trump, wrote to then-UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt warning him about ""grave ethics concerns"" and Shein’s ""deep ties to the People’s Republic of China"". “Slave labour, sweat shops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein’s success,” Mr Rubio wrote in his letter to Mr Hunt. At the time, a spokesperson for the company said: ""Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions."" That was just weeks after a report released by Swiss advocacy group Public Eye said excessive overtime was still common for many workers in Shein's supply chain. In response to the report, Shein told the BBC it was ""working hard"" to address the matters raised by Public Eye and had made ""significant progress on enhancing conditions""."

Of that number, nearly 4,000 people were discovered more than a month after they died, and 130 bodies went unmissed for a year before they were found, according to  the National Police Agency. Japan currently has the world’s oldest population, according to the United Nations. The agency hopes its report will shed light on the country's growing issue of vast numbers of its aging population who live, and die, alone. Taken from the first half of 2024, the National Police Agency data shows that a total of 37,227 people living alone were found dead at home, with those aged 65 and over accounting for more than 70%. While an estimated 40% of people who died alone at home were found within a day, the police report found that nearly 3,939 bodies were discovered more than a month after death, and 130 had lain unnoticed for at least a year before discovery. Accounting for 7,498 of the bodies found, the dataset’s largest group belonged to 85-year-olds and above, followed by 75-79-year-olds at 5,920. People aged between 70 and 74 accounted for 5,635 of the bodies found. According to Japanese public TV network NHK, the police agency will give its findings to a government group looking into the unattended deaths. Earlier this year, the Japanese National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, said the number of elderly citizens (aged 65 and above) living alone is expected to reach 10.8m by the year 2050. The overall number of single-person households is estimated to hit 23.3m in the same year. In April, the Japanese government introduced a bill tackling the country’s decades-long loneliness and isolation problem, partly caused by the country's ageing population. Japan has long tried to counter its ageing and declining population, but the shift is becoming hard for the country to manage. Last year, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said his country is on the brink of not being able to function as a society because of its declining birth rate. Some neighbouring countries are facing similar demographic challenges. In 2022, China's population fell for the first time since 1961, while South Korea has repeatedly reported the lowest fertility rate in the world."

The 21-year-old will play American fellow Grand Slam champion Sofia Kenin in the first round on Tuesday, with sixth seed Jessica Pegula a potential second-round opponent for the winner. Raducanu reached the fourth round of Wimbledon in July, but having opted to miss the Olympics, has only played one tournament in the six weeks since. ""I really wanted to play in Toronto, especially because I was born there, but the turnaround was too tight for qualifying,"" she told BBC Sport. ""I would have had to play on Sunday and I finished [in Washington] late Friday night, so flying there and adjusting I just felt was too tight. ""Otherwise, I just always do things a little bit differently."" Raducanu reached the quarter-finals in Washington, where she lost to the eventual champion Paula Badosa. With a trip to Toronto ruled out, Cincinnati was the next opportunity to continue a summer run which has brought 10 wins in her past four tournaments. But a wildcard was not forthcoming, and the world number 71 decided against entering qualifying.  She says she is not averse to playing at that level, although has not done so since winning in New York three years ago. ""I think playing qualies is not something that I am against, because if you get through those two rounds you feel you're adjusted to the court,"" she said. ""If you're playing a seed, you have a better eye for the ball, a better feel - it's not that I am against it at all. ""It was just that I would have pretty much had to wait around just for one tournament in qualies and then another week off before the US Open - so I think it was a better decision we all made to just go back and work on things there."" Raducanu's ranking may soon be high enough to take qualifying out of the equation. And if she stays injury free, then expect her to play a good run of tournaments in Asia in the autumn. Wildcards - should she need them - will be readily available in China because of her heritage, and with her fluent Mandarin and the comfort she finds in her surroundings, it is a good opportunity to finish the season strongly. Raducanu reached the fourth round at Wimbledon in July Raducanu's run to the last 16 at Wimbledon was comfortably her best at a Grand Slam since her US Open triumph. She and Jack Draper are the young British players best placed to fill the void left by Andy Murray, who retired at the Olympics. Raducanu was set to play mixed doubles with three-time Grand Slam champion Murray at Wimbledon, but pulled out when the schedule threatened to compromise her singles aspirations. And at the first major since then, Raducanu says it does not feel any different without the former world number one around. ""Tennis is unforgiving in that sense, no matter who you are,"" she said. ""It just moves on. There's always another match, there's always another tournament. Of course Andy has achieved amazing things - I watched him win this tournament - but it's a fast pace, just like life is. It's old news the next day.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e9zrywq9o,Diplomatic tightrope for Modi as he visits Kyiv after Moscow,Modi is visiting Ukraine just weeks after his Russia trip. Is it a balancing act or is there something more?,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:49.686122,China News,BBC,China,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Ukraine to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The trip comes just weeks after he met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The visit is significant because Kyiv and some Western capitals had reacted sharply to Mr Modi’s visit to the Russian capital in July. Mr Zelensky was particularly critical, saying he was “disappointed to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow”. So, is Mr Modi visiting Kyiv to placate Mr Zelensky and other Western leaders? Not entirely. It’s not surprising to see India balance its relations between two competing nations or blocs. The country’s famed non-alignment approach to geopolitics has served it well for decades. Friday's visit - the first by an Indian prime minister to Ukraine - is more about signalling that while India will continue to have strong relations with Russia, it will still work closely with the West. Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Centre think-tank in Washington, says the trip will further reassert India’s strategic autonomy. “India isn’t in the business of placating Western powers, or anyone for that matter. It’s a trip meant to advance Indian interests, by reasserting friendship with Kyiv and conveying its concerns about the continuing war,” he says. However, the timing of the visit does reflect that Indian diplomats have taken onboard the sharp reactions from the US to Mr Modi's Moscow visit.  India has refrained from directly criticising Russia over the war, much to the annoyance of Western powers. Delhi, however, has often spoken about the importance of respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations. It has continuously pushed for diplomacy and dialogue to end the war. Mr Modi’s Moscow visit in July came hours after Russian bombing killed at least 41 people in Ukraine, including at a children's hospital in Kyiv, sparking a global outcry. The Indian PM said the death of children was painful and terrifying but stopped short of blaming Russia. Mr Modi is not likely to deviate from this stance during his visit to Kyiv. The US and other Western nations have grown to accept Delhi’s stand, given India’s time-tested relationship with Moscow and its reliance on Russian military equipment. India, the world’s largest importer of arms, has diversified its defence import portfolio and also grown domestic manufacturing in recent years but it still buys more than 50% of its defence equipment from Russia. India has also increased its oil imports from Russia, taking advantage of cheaper prices offered by Moscow - Russia was the top oil supplier to India last year. The US and its allies have often implored India to take a clearer stand on the war but they have also refrained from applying harsh sanctions or pressure. The West also sees India as a counterbalance to China and doesn’t want to upset that dynamic. India, now the fifth largest economy in the world, is also a growing market for business. Mr Kugelman says the West will welcome the visit and see it as Delhi’s willingness to engage with all sides. “Mr Modi has a strong incentive to signal that it’s not leaning so close to Moscow that there’s nothing to salvage with Kyiv,” he says. This is important because India wants to keep growing its relations with the West, particularly with the US, and wouldn't want to upset the momentum. Eric Garcetti, the US ambassador to India, recently said the relationship should not be ""taken for granted"". India also needs the West as China, its Asian rival, and Russia have forged close ties in recent years. While Delhi has long viewed Moscow as a power that can put pressure on an assertive China when needed, it can't be taken for granted.  Meanwhile, many media commentators have spoken about the possibility of Mr Modi positioning himself as a peacemaker, given India’s close relations with both Moscow and the West. But it’s unlikely that he will turn up with a peace plan. “Is India really up to it, and are the conditions right? India doesn’t like other countries trying to mediate in its own issues, chief among them Kashmir. And I don’t think Mr Modi would formally offer mediation unless both Russia and Ukraine want it. And at this point, I don’t think they do,” Mr Kugelman adds. Ukraine, however, will still welcome Mr Modi’s visit and see it as an opportunity to engage with a close ally of Moscow, something it hasn’t done much since the war began. Mr Zelensky, though, is unlikely to hold back his criticism of Mr Putin in front of the Indian PM. Mr Modi can live with that as he has faced such situations many times in other Western capitals. Moscow is not likely to react to the visit as it has also been making concessions for Delhi’s multilateral approach to geopolitics. But beyond reasserting its non-alignment policy, Delhi also has bigger goals from this visit. India has been ramping up engagement with Europe in the past decade, particularly with the underserved regions in Central and Eastern Europe. Delhi wants to keep consolidating its relations with the big four - the UK, Italy, Germany and France - but also wants to boost engagement with other countries in Europe. Mr Modi is also visiting Poland on this trip - the first Indian PM to visit the country in 45 years. He also became the first Indian prime minister to visit Austria in 41 years in July. Analysts say that this signals India’s growing understanding that Central European nations will play a bigger role in geopolitics in the future and strong relations with them will serve Delhi well. The Indian government has also revived trade deal negotiations with Europe. It has signed a trade and investment deal with the European Free Trade Association, which is the intergovernmental organisation of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. So, while there will be a lot of focus on the war during his visit, Indian diplomats are likely to stay focused on the bigger goal. “Central and Eastern Europe now have greater agency in writing their own destiny and reshaping regional geopolitics. Mr Modi’s visit to Warsaw and Kyiv is about recognising that momentous change at the heart of Europe and deepening bilateral political, economic and security ties with the Central European states,” foreign policy analyst C Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express newspaper, summing up Mr Modi’s wider goal."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240905-have-we-improved-oil-spill-clean-ups-since-bp-deepwater-horizon,Mega oil spills: can we ever clean them up?,"Fourteen years after the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, would we fare any better at cleaning up another huge oil spill?",6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:49.782782,China News,BBC,China,"Fourteen years after the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, would we fare any better at cleaning up another huge oil spill? Jocelyn Timperley examines the latest science of ocean clean-ups. On April 20, 2010, a blowout caused a huge explosion on the offshore drilling rig operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven people were killed. Two days later, the rig collapsed. Oil began seeping into the sea, and it continued to flow for almost three months. The Deepwater Horizon disaster is among the most lamented environmental catastrophes of the past century. It's hard to comprehend how incredibly huge the spill was. It was the world's largest ever marine oil spill, releasing an estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil (779 million litres, or over 300 Olympic swimming pools-worth). Up to a million seabirds were killed outright, and the human health and socioeconomic effects are still being felt today. BP, rig operator Transocean, and several government agencies immediately tried to limit the damage, with BP's chief executive saying the company was ""determined to do everything in our power"" to contain the spill. Booms were deployed to try to contain the oil, skimmer ships nibbled at the edges of the widening slick and fires were set to try to burn it off the sea surface. Various devices were deployed deep below the surface to try to contain or capture the oil. BP also began to spray the oil with enormous amounts of dispersants both on the sea surface and 1.5km (0.9 miles) underwater, where oil was gushing from the wellhead. However, it is thought that these measures recovered or dispersed only around a third of the spilled oil. The BP spill sparked a huge amount of research into oil spills and their impacts. But 14 years on, what hope is there for better measures should another oil spill occur? Jeffrey Short, an expert in oil spills and now-retired scientist from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), was working for Oceana, a marine conservation organisation when the BP spill occurred. When a colleague told him about the spill at lunchtime, he felt sick. ""I knew immediately that this would be ecologically and economically disastrous, that it would wreck tens of thousands of people's lives, and that it would dominate my professional life for the next several years,"" he says. ""All of which proved true."" Oil spills are the third largest source of oil in the sea, after land-based runoff (largely from cities and vehicles) and natural oil seeps. The problem with spills, of course, is the sheer volume of oil that enters the sea all at once. This means that oil spills – especially big ones – are ""much, much more dangerous per unit oil released"", says Short. While no spill has since surpassed Deepwater Horizon's in sheer volume, Noaa responds to more than 150 oil spills every year. Just last month, oil began spewing from a submerged oil tanker and at least two other sunken vessels in Manila Bay, in the Philippines, after they were hit by monsoon rains and Typhoon Gaemi. Another oil tanker hit by projectiles from Yemen's Houthi movement remains in a precarious position in the Red Sea. However, the number of oil spills from tankers is today far lower than in the 1970s, due to improved standards. When oil spills occur, the first step is to control the source, ""whether that be a ship, pipeline, or leaking well"", says Doug Helton, regional supervisor of the emergency response division at Noaa's Office of Response and Restoration. ""The second priority is recovering oil at sea."" The major priority is to avoid the oil reaching the shoreline, where it can do the most damage. Shoreline cleanups can last days to years, depending on the type of oil and severity of contamination, says Helton. Spilt oil tends to spread quickly into a thin layer on the sea surface. Within days, centimetres-thick layers become a film of a millimetre or less, spread in drifting patches over a wide area. Efforts to scoop up the oil from the sea surface therefore offer diminishing returns as time goes on. ""Floating oil spreads very quickly and there is a limited window of time – days – when at-sea tools are effective,"" says Helton. Hundreds of skimmers were deployed to clean up the BP Deep Horizon spill. Skimmers are boats that scoop up spilled oil from the water's surface, usually after the slick is first surrounded with floating booms to keep it from spreading. They do this in various ways – some, for example, suck up the oil like a vacuum cleaner, while others use oil-attracting ""conveyor belts"" or gravity to carry the spilled oil into a reservoir. But hopes at the time that the skimmers could pick up oil ""like a lawnmower cutting grass"" proved to be overblown. They only recovered an estimated 3% of the oil. ""At sea, the oil may spread more rapidly than the skimming vessels trying to capture oil,"" says Helton. ""Going faster is not an easy option because the bow wave from the ship will push the oil away."" The satellite photos of the BP disaster ""speak volumes"", says Short. ""You'll see a half a dozen surface skimming boats that, from the sea surface next to the boat, look quite large and quite effective. But from a satellite, you realise that you are [...] just having a nearly negligible effect on the size of the spill."" In fact, a 2020 review of 30 large offshore oil spills found only 2-6% of oil was recovered using mechanical methods like skimmers. Short says that mechanical recovery has improved in recent decades, with better booms to corral the oil and better systems to remove it from the sea surface. But even with improvements, mechanical methods can't have much impact on a large spill, he says. In recent years a plethora of studies and reports have emerged looking at different ways to soak up oil spills, from laser-treated cork and textiles based on leaves to graphene, magnets and even hair and fur. These mostly rely on the oil-attracting and water-hating properties of the material, with various forms of oil-attracting sponges a particularly common solution. But the difficulty of handling oil-soaked materials means these techniques are typically only useful for small spills. When Guihua Yu, a professor of materials science at the University of Texas at Austin, and his team began considering whether a new material his lab was working on could be used to help clean up oil spills, he says he was surprised about the lack of focus on how these innovative materials could be used in practice. One central problem, he says, is that most can only be used in a non-continuous way, requiring processing to remove the oil before the same material can be used again. Yu and his team landed on a solution which he thinks could help. In a 2023 paper, his lab developed a prototype with a collection speed 10 times faster than current clean up rates. The lab produced their own super oleophilic gel capable of 99% separation of oil from water, which they used to cover a mesh filter. But they also designed a continuous roller system, which Yu says would be attached to the front of a ship. This conveyer belt picks up oil from the water surface, then rolls it round to beside an induction heater, which heats the oil, detaching it and allowing it to drip down to a collector in the middle. The roller is freed up to be directly reused as it rolls down to the water again. ""The most important [innovation in our work] is probably higher throughput,"" says Yu. ""I personally felt it's very unique and very different from what is conventional."" The invention has so far only been tested on a small motor oil spill in a lake in China using a metre-scale prototype, but Yu says he has had conversations with industry potentially interested in scaling it up. The overall costs, he believes, would be reasonable. However, he admits his current design does not address the bow-wave issue of oil being pushed away from the ship, noting that how to balance collection and bow wave is ""worthy of further investigation"". But Short says that, for large spills which require more than a day to clean up, movement of oil during the night (when operations can usually not be carried out) will always limit the efficacy of collecting oil on the sea surface. ""The following day, the oil must first be located before response equipment can be effectively deployed,"" he says. ""For large spills, especially when response equipment is limited, these challenges may limit the amount of recoverable oil to less than 10% of the initial spill volume."" Still, improvements have been made in tracking the oil too. Noaa now uses drones and satellites to help find and track oil spills, and tools for mapping and coordination have advanced. Undersea manned and autonomous tools that can tap into sunken vessels to extract oil have also been developed since the Deepwater Horizon spill, says Helton. Burning is another, more controversial, way to remove floating oil at sea. An estimated 5% of the BP oil spill was burnt off the surface. Burning requires concentrating the oil on the sea surface to at least 2-3mm – relatively thick for an oil spill. It also requires quick action, and lucky weather conditions. In the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska in 1989, a storm dispersed the oil over a wide area into a film too thin to catch alight. Improved boom designs to better corral oil have improved the effectiveness of burning over the years, says Short. But successful burning also has its own problems for the environment and human health in the form of air pollution. The impacts of air pollution on the workers attempting to clean up the BP oil spill are still being investigated today. A major 2022 study found that workers involved in cleaning up the spill were 60% more likely to be diagnosed with asthma or experience asthma symptoms one to three years after the spill, compared with those who did not work on the cleanup. Burning is not the only culprit for air pollution. The evaporation of the oil itself is also highly toxic, as is another controversial way to try to dissipate the impacts of oil spills: dispersants. During the Deepwater Horizon disaster, BP sprayed roughly 1.84 million gallons (8.37 million litres) of the dispersant Corexit on the surface and deep into the water column – the largest volume of dispersant ever used for an oil spill. Dispersants work by breaking down the oil into smaller droplets that can mix with the water below, which both helps it to degrade and removes it from the surface, where it tends to do most damage (especially to diving seabirds, surfacing marine mammals, turtles and young fish). But it needs to be added quickly after oil spills. Little was known about exactly how this quantity of dispersant would affect the environment in the BP spill, but the hope was that it would stop the oil from reaching shoreline habitats. But the sheer volume used has been widely criticised as largely ineffective as well as harmful to the environment and humans. It's thought just 8% of the oil was dispersed using Corexit. In Short's view, prior knowledge about oil spills meant that in the Deepwater Horizon spill ""you can be quite certain in advance"" that the continued application of dispersants on parts of the oil slick which had already emulsified was ""a waste of time"" beyond the first few days. ""But it shows the public that you're doing something."" Environmentalists and scientists have a term for these kinds of reactions to oil spills – ""response theatre"". It describes when companies responsible for a spill focus more on being seen to do something about the spill than necessarily doing the best thing. Some researchers, however, say the dispersants were relatively effective and may have helped avoid further air pollution by getting rid of the oil. A 2019 report from the US National Academies found that dispersants can help cope with oil spills in some circumstances, but that limitations in the research make it hard to make conclusions about whether it improves the human health aspect compared to not using dispersants. Still, counterintuitive as it may sound, there are occassions where some interventions could be a worse option than leaving an oil spill alone. In many places, ocean microbes have developed to eat the oil seeping naturally into the environment. These same bacteria and fungi can munch away at oil spills too – albeit relatively slowly and some more than others – but if they are impacted by chemicals, such as those in dispersants, this process could be disrupted. Bioremediation – such as adding nutrients to encourage oil-degrading bacteria – has a long history of use in oil spills. But scientists are still at the beginning of understanding the complex interactions between microbial communities and chemical dispersants, as well as how these interact with environmental factors like temperature and sunlight. Research, for example, has shown that sunlight levels impact oil degradation in different microbes differently. A study published in 2024 became the first to use an advanced microbiology technique to look at these interactions. Rather than look at the DNA of microbes, as previous studies have done, the scientists examined the protein expression of microbes in waters off the coast of Florida – a technique usually only used in medical or clinical science. Using these techniques can show far more detail than looking at DNA alone, says Sabine Matallana-Surget, an associate professor of environmental and molecular microbiology at the University of Stirling, Scotland, who led the study. If she did a similar study on humans, for example, she would be able to tell when they had lunch by tracking the enzymes involved in food digestion. More like this:  Her team found that Corexit induces a high expression of proteins involved in oxidative stress in oil-degrading bacteria. ""I have never seen so many proteins involving DNA damage [and] repair, [as] when you introduce the Corexit to your microbial community,"" says Matallana-Surget. More sunlight also increased the toxicity of Corexit and oil in their experiment, creating a ""double pill effect"", she adds. The team plan to conduct similar experiments in other places with natural seepages of oil, with different microbes, temperature and sunlight levels. If there is another oil spill in one of these places, Matallana-Surget says, these findings could inform the optimum level of Corexit to use in that particular location for maximum oil recovery. ""I'm hoping that in the near future, if there was an accident somewhere else, we would be able to say, 'Well, listen, no, you shouldn't apply Corexit in that region, or not as much, or maybe this concentration.'"" Dispersants aren't the only intervention after oil spills that have caused concern. ""We have found after lengthy research that aggressive cleanup of some environments can cause more harm than the oil,"" says Helton. ""Marshes and sheltered intertidal habitats, for example, are often treated very carefully."" The high-pressure, hot-water washing used to clean the ecologically sensitive shorelines of Prince William Sound in Alaska after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, for example, sterilised the beaches, inadvertently killing bacteria as well as larger animals. Research has shown that areas not cleaned by the hot water recovered faster than the treated sites. Cleaning seabirds Oil-soaked birds are often one of the most immediate and visible impact of oil spills, and depressing survival rates – which can be lower than 1% – led experts such as German biologist Silvia Gaus to argue euthanasia is a more humane option. But wildlife rescuers say these rates may be improving as they learn better animal husbandry, such as allowing rest and hydration before embarking on the stressful process of removing oil from feathers. Guidelines have also been developed for cleaning turtles and marine mammals. If a spill like Deepwater Horizon happened today, says Matallana-Surget, the reaction would be completely different. ""There have been huge conversations around what happened with applying tonnes of [a] chemical [where] we have no idea what's going in the environment. I think nobody in any part of the world would do that."" Ultimately, since spills are so hard to clean up, avoiding them happening in the first place remains the most important thing. ""Prevention is going to be the most fruitful line of approach,"" says Short. ""Continuing to implement safety measures and especially being vigilant."" The problem is that standards are expensive to maintain, he says. If years go by without a spill, they ""tend to start slipping"". Major changes have been made to US regulations governing offshore oil and gas operations, as well as advances in preventing blowouts in the first place. New performance measures and enforcement mechanisms have been introduced to improve pipeline safety. However, there are also new potential risks for oil spills: deeper drilling, ageing infrastructure, transport of new types of oil and through different routes such as the Arctic, and climate impacts like sea-level rise and more intense and frequent storms. A report released by BP in September 2010 concluded that decisions made by ""multiple companies and work teams"", including BP and others, had contributed to the spill. The unprecedented costs – over $65bn (£49bn) – to BP of the Deepwater Horizon has acted as an incentive to companies maintain the vigilance to avoid future disasters, says Short. ""I think that's really got a lot of attention in the industry, that this is not a trivial operating expense that you can just write off as business as usual."" BP also quickly announced $500m (£380m) for a 10 year research programme, which has been credited with galvanising advancement in oil spill science. But while risks can be reduced, so long as oil is being produced, ""you're not going to get rid of [spills]"", adds Short. Oil supply is set to reach a record high this year, with the US last year producing more oil than any country ever has before. Until oil dependence begins to fall, sadly the risks of another oil spill will stay with us.

The court is smaller and the net is lower as the players hit the ball over the net sitting down. For a hit to be legal, all players must keep their pelvis in contact with the floor. Teams are made up of six players and all physical impairments are included in this game. Players are either classed as 'Minimally Disabled' or 'Disabled'. Two MD players can be on a team roster but only one is allowed on court at any time. Unlike Olympic volleyball, blocking of the serve is allowed and teams can hit the ball no more than three times in succession. The first team to 25 points wins a set, but they must win by two clear points. The first team to win three sets is the winner. A maximum of five sets are played. If a match goes to a deciding fifth set, the first team to 15 points and with a two-point advantage wins. Great Britain will not be competing in the sport in Paris - the last time they were represented was at London 2012. The women's team were eighth at the 2023 European Championships while the men's team did not qualify for the Euros. Iran are the defending men's Paralympic champions having beaten Russia in the final in Tokyo for their third title out of the past four and a seventh overall. They are also current world champions from 2022 after beating Bosnia-Herzegovina in the final with Brazil taking bronze. The USA women won their second Paralympic title in a row in 2021 with victory over China while the reigning world champions are Brazil, who got the better of Canada. One player on court is known as the 'libero' and they wear a different colour shirt to the rest of the team because they specialise in defensive tactics. None"

East Lomond hill, near Falkland, is the site of an ancient fort. Since 2022 archaeologists have been excavating a major settlement dating back to the Roman Iron Age and Pictish times on the southern slopes of the hill. Terry Sommer, an undergraduate student from California who is studying in Scotland, documented this summer's investigations in black and white photographs using a 90-year-old camera that used to belong to her grandfather. ""He brought it with him during his service in World War Two,"" she said.  ""He served as a medic in the US Navy and was stationed at a hospital in China."" Terry came across the 1930s Zeiss Ikon Ikonta 521/16 two years ago. The shutter button was stuck but she was able to have it repaired at a shop in Edinburgh. She brought the camera to the slopes of East Lomond. ""I wanted to document different aspects of the site: the people working on the site, the tools, the various types of recording taking place, and parts of the site itself,"" she said. Among the latest finds were hearths, fires built for heating, cooking or metalworking. Terry said: ""I was able to photograph the process of my friend and myself excavating one of the hearths."" University of Aberdeen has been working with Falkland Stewardship Trust to investigate the archaeology of East Lomond. Prof Gordon Noble said the hill was crowned by a spectacular multi-phase fort with a series of lower defences. Excavations and a series of earlier projects have revealed an extensive settlement of five acres (2ha) on the southern side of the fort. Prof Noble said: ""The excavations undertaken by University of Aberdeen staff, students and local volunteers organised by the trust have uncovered dozens of hearths of late Roman Iron Age and Pictish dwellings."" He said there were also areas of metalworking and hundreds of artefacts including weaponry, crucibles, pottery and gaming pieces. He added: ""The research aims to illuminate the role of this hillfort at the time of the Roman occupation of southern Britain and the role of the settlement and fort as the Pictish kingdoms developed."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4gev6wp6q1o,'I don't want London to be best Paralympics ever',"Tanni Grey-Thompson says Paris will want to ""move the Paralympic bar up another notch"" from London 2012.",26 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:37:50.057372,China News,BBC,China,"The Paralympic Agitos symbol by the Eiffel Tower Baroness Grey-Thompson, who won 11 Paralympic gold medals for Great Britain and competed at every summer Games from 1988 to 2004, will be part of the Radio 5 Live team in Paris and is writing for BBC Sport during the Games. As the Olympic flame was extinguished and that family looked forward to Los Angeles in 2028, it was an important moment as Tony Estanguet, the Paris 2024 president, announced that ""the return match is now"". Along with having Paralympians in the final stages of the torch lighting at the Olympic closing ceremony, it laid down a decisive if subtle message that the âsecond halfâ of the Games is coming. The expectation on Paris as Paralympic hosts is high. London 2012 raised the Paralympic bar, and Paris will want to move it up another notch. It is time for that to happen. While I loved everything in London, I donât want it to be the best Paralympics ever, just one of the best. Since then, Rio 2016 faced huge financial challenges, putting the Games themselves in jeopardy, before a significant push to sell tickets saw venues filled for what was dubbed the âPeopleâs Gamesâ. Tokyo should have been different, but Covid meant a yearâs delay and when the Games were staged, nobody was able to watch in person, apart from a smattering of team-mates and volunteers. We are here now in the French capital with glorious venues, fantastic competition, the promise of a bold opening ceremony with athletes at its heart, and hopefully some good weather too. I am excited by the prospect of the next two weeks. The vibe in the city during the Olympics was great. The fan zones were welcoming and accessible. Paris does not have to worry about its tourist industry but there has been a change in terms of an understanding of the lack of access. Going out for dinner one night I was met at the door of the restaurant by a waiter who told me they didnât have an accessible toilet. I didnât think they would but this is a big step in moving forward. Organisers say 1.75 million tickets have been sold, 700,000 of them coming from the start of the Olympics. That push around ticket sales will continue with the hope that Parisiens coming back from their traditional French holidays - âLes Vacancesâ - will get involved. The International Paralympic Committee has promised that the summerâs sporting party isnât over and the biggest one is yet to come with people having the time of their lives, which I am sure they will. An 80,000-seater venue like the Stade de France, which will host the athletics, will not be easy to fill, but other sports like wheelchair fencing and Para-taekwondo, which will take place at the Grand Palais, the Para-cycling track events, the Para-equestrian programme and blind football at the Eiffel Tower Stadium are close to selling out. This is an important time for the Paralympic movement. This Games will have more women than ever before, more media coverage and if they donât grab this moment, it will be a lost opportunity. The coverage in the UK will be wall-to-wall and it will be the closest our athletes are going to get to a home summer games for a long time. It will make it easier for friends, family and fans, who could not travel to Tokyo, to be part of the Games and will mean that the audience can see events in real time as opposed to highlights. Tara Davis-Woodhall and husband Hunter Woodhall celebrate her Olympic gold I am also excited to see how the United States are taking coverage of the Games to a whole new level before LA 2028. Historically, the Paralympic movement in the US has been a poor relation to the Olympics and frequently confused with the Special Olympics, but now it has been elevated and their athletes will want to make a big statement before their home Games in 2028. We could also see truly global superstars coming out of these Games. Olympic long jump champion Tara Davis-Woodhall is married to amputee sprinter Hunter Woodhall. They are a real sporting power couple and what better way to highlight the linking of the two Games? ParalympicsGB will have a team of 215 athletes in action with the medal target set by UK Sport of 100-140. In Tokyo the British team finished second behind China with 124 medals, including 41 golds. But I think the USA will be pushing hard to take that second place from GB. France will also want to impress and Australia are always a threat. After the Games is time for a wider debate on where we need to sit in the medal table. We are a small country, albeit with a lot of talented athletes, but we have no control over what any other country does. The list of where we expect the golds to come from is long, but what I hope to see is a breadth of medals across all sports, similar to what was achieved in Tokyo. Some of the most amazing and unexpected moments in Japan were someone triumphing, not over adversity, but over sporting giants and those memories still live with me. The Paralympic flame was lit at Stoke Mandeville, the birthplace of the Games, last weekend and is making its way through 50 cities in France. The excitement and anticipation is growing. The British team and the athletes have put everything into this and I hope there will be some bold performances across the board.

Reports from the national media suggested that 2,500 roles could be cut before Christmas. The site's blast furnaces are set to close in the coming months. A British Steel spokesperson said no decision had been made regarding the date for the shutdown of the furnaces. However, they did confirm that there had been ""ongoing production issues"" at the plant. The spokesperson added: ""Imports of raw materials are continuing but have reduced in light of ongoing production issues. We are working to restore production levels from our ageing blast furnaces"". As part of a £1.25bn decarbonisation plan announced in November 2023, British Steel’s owners, Jingye, said it would close the plant's two blast furnaces and replace them with a greener electric arc furnace. At the time, trade unions said the move would result in 2,000 redundancies in steel and ironmaking.  The BBC has contacted the GMB union for comment. Around a quarter of the workforce in Scunthorpe is employed in manufacturing, including 4,000 at British Steel, according to North Lincolnshire Council. The council said its leader, Rob Waltham, would lead a small delegation to China to meet British Steel’s owners ""in an attempt to protect the future of steelmaking in Scunthorpe"". A team of three representatives would travel to the Shijiazhuang province in September and would hold meetings with senior officers, civic leaders and directors of the company. North Lincolnshire Council previously pledged to develop 300 acres at the site to create new employment opportunities in the green energy and engineering sectors. Mr Waltham said: ""Steelmaking is a vital industry, the backbone of our local economy and essential to our national security."" He added that he had asked the new government to offer their support to protect jobs. He said: “Whatever the plans are going forward, we have to protect the sovereign capability for blast furnace steel and create a new future for steelmaking at the same time.

Allen has yet to win the biggest prize in the sport but his career victories to date have included successes in the Masters, the UK Championship and the Champion of Champions. The 38-year-old from Northern Ireland defeated Liu Hongyu 5-2 in the first round of the Xi'an Grand Prix in China on Monday. That tournament will be followed by the lucrative Saudi Arabia Snooker Masters from 30 August to 7 September. Allen's nearest challenger in the world rankings, Judd Trump, won last month's Shanghai Masters. ""I know Judd Trump is not far behind me and if he wins titles then there won't be much I can do,"" Allen told the World Snooker Tour website, external. ""But I'm here to win the tournament too. I know I have a lot of points to defend from two years ago so I need to keep winning.  ""Saudi will be huge in terms of the number one ranking, because the money there is so big.

The tournament in Saudi Arabia will be followed by further significant events in the autumn such as the English Open, British Open and Northern Ireland Open in the United Kingdom, plus the Wuhan Open and International Championship in China. ""This is a good time for me because I like a run of tournaments without gaps in between,"" explained Allen. ""We have this one, then Saudi Arabia, then a few in the UK and then another one in China so it's a busy spell and a chance to gain momentum and hopefully pick up a few titles."" Allen's opening victory over Liu Hongyu included breaks of 66, 58, 111 and 70. ""I was fortunate to be 2-0 up, Liu struggled early in the match,"" he added.

The 48-year-old Indian national was sitting on a roadside bench in Jalan India Masjid when the ground beneath her suddenly caved in, according to local police. Videos on social media show crowds of people watching rescue workers trying to make their way into the sinkhole. Some have ladders, while others are using hammers and diggers to try and clear the way.  There does not appear to be any sign of the woman. The Kuala Lumpur Fire and Rescue Department said it received a distress call at 08:22 local time (00:22 GMT) and dispatched 15 firemen to the scene. Operation commander Mohd Riduan Akhbar told local media that a search and rescue operation was being conducted. ""The Special Tactical Operation and Rescue Team of Malaysia (STORM) and the K9 unit are at the location,"" he said. Ninety personnel from various other agencies have also joined in the operation, according to local police chief Assistant Commissioner Sulizmie Affendy Sulaiman. ""We will look at CCTV footage and take statements from witnesses to get a clearer picture of what occurred,"" he said. The BBC has reached out to the Kuala Lumpur Fire and Rescue Department for comment. Sinkholes generally form when underground water dissolves the rock on the surface, causing a hole to form. Although there is no precise data globally, geologists say they are reasonably common. Human injuries, however, are very rare.  One of the worst recent sinkholes disasters in terms of casualties occurred in Canada in 2010, when a family of four died after their entire house was swallowed by a gaping sinkhole near Montreal. The world's largest sinkhole is Xiaoxhai Tiankeng in south-western China. With a depth measuring 660 metres, researchers believe it was formed more than 128,000 years ago."

The game is played using a small ball with a bell inside that makes a noise as it moves to aid the players in their movements. The four outfield players must all wear eyeshades to ensure fair play as some players may be partially sighted. The goalkeeper can shout instructions to aid his team-mates but must not leave the penalty area, otherwise a penalty kick will be awarded to the opposing team. Each team also has a guide behind each goal to give directions to the players. The guide will often tap the goal posts with a metal baton to give the player an indication of where to shoot. The pitch is surrounded by a rebound wall so there are no throw-ins and there is no offside rule. If a player attempts a tackle, they must shout the word ""voy"" before doing so to warn the opposing player. This is used as a safety precaution to avoid any injuries. Matches are played over two halves of 25 minutes and if a match is drawn, the winner will be decided by a penalty shootout. Britain will not be represented in the eight-team competition having failed to qualify. The England team were third at the 2022 European Championships and were not able to secure a place in Paris at last year's Ibsa World Games in Birmingham. Brazil have been the undisputed stars of the sport, winning gold at every Paralympics since the sport made its debut in Athens in 2004. But in Paris they face a tricky group with the top two in Europe - France and Turkey - along with China. In the other pool, Argentina have been on the podium four times and are the current Americas and world champions. They will be joined by African champions and Tokyo bronze medallists Morocco, Paralympic debutants Colombia and Japan, who were fifth last time out.

If a member of the crowd is making too much noise, the referee can eject them from the arena. None"

Swimmers are divided into 14 classes. Those with physical impairments are classified from S1 to S10. The lower the classification number, the more severe the impairments.  Classification is based on how an athlete moves in the water, so athletes with different impairments compete against each other but they will be deemed to have a similar level of impairment in competition.  An athlete's classification may change for different swimming strokes because the nature of their impairment may affect their ability to perform a particular stroke.  Swimmers with visual impairments are classified from S11 (little or no vision and wear blacked-out goggles) to S13 (less than 20 degrees of vision). Swimmers who are blind have an assistant called a 'tapper' who may use a pole to tap the swimmer to warn them they are approaching the end of a length.  The S14 class is for swimmers who have a learning disability. The British team features some experienced campaigners including Tokyo champions Maisie Summers-Newton and Tully Kearney, along with Stephen Clegg and Alice Tai, who missed Tokyo because of injury and subsequently had her right leg amputated below the knee.  They will be joined by some exciting Paralympic debutants including William Ellard, Poppy Maskill and Olivia Newman-Baronius who have good chances in the S14 category as well as Brock Whiston and exciting 13-year-old Iona Winnifrith, who will be the youngest member of the ParalympicsGB team in Paris. Italy topped the medal table at last yearâs World Championships in Manchester ahead of Ukraine, China, Brazil and Great Britain. The Italians were led by Simone Barlaam, who came home with six golds while Stefano Raimondi landed five golds and two silvers. The Italians were also the leading nation at the European Open Championships in Madeira in April but Russian and Belarus swimmers made a big impact on their return to international competition as part of a Neutral Paralympic Athlete team. Paris could be a final swansong for American star Jessica Long. Born in a Russian orphanage to a teenage mother, Long had both legs amputated below the knee after being born with fibular hemimelia and was adopted by an American family. Sport formed a key part of her life and she has gone on to forge a successful career both in the sporting arena and outside as a speaker, advocate and author. She made her Paralympic debut in Athens as a 12 year old, winning three gold medals in the pool and has gone on to enjoy a stellar career with 29 Paralympic medals, including 16 golds, and over 50 World Championship medals and a host of world records. Now 32, she won two golds at last year's World Championships in Manchester and will hope to add to her long list of honours in Paris. 26 â eight gold, nine silver and nine bronze"

All events are raced over 2,000 metres and competitors take part in heats and, where necessary, repechages before going on to contest the finals. Competitors in the PR1 events do not have trunk or leg function and use strapping to provide support and balance. PR2 rowers have arm and trunk function while PR3 rowers also have leg function and must be able to use a sliding seat to propel the boat.  In the four, a maximum of two rowers with visual impairment are allowed per crew while the other rowers in the crew have physical impairments. There must be two rowers of each sex in the crew. The cox can be of either sex and is not required to have an impairment. Lauren Rowles will bid to become the first British rower to win three Paralympic gold medals when she lines up with Gregg Stevenson in the PR2 mixed double sculls. Rowles was victorious alongside Laurence Whiteley in both Rio and Tokyo and has formed an impressive partnership with Stevenson, a former Royal Engineer Commando. The PR3 mixed coxed four boat has an unbeaten record at major championships going back to 2011 and this season's line-up features two defending champions in Giedre Rakauskaite and cox Erin Kennedy along with debutants Frankie Allen, Ed Fuller and Josh O'Brien. Kennedy was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2022 aged 29 and has undergone successful treatment. Roman Polianskyi of Ukraine and Birgit Skarstein of Norway will both be hoping to retain their PR1 titles. Polianskyi is bidding for his third consecutive gold after a build-up which has been affected by the war in his country. Skarstein, who has also competed at the Winter Paralympics in Para Nordic skiing and is a former Dancing with the Stars contestant in her native country, is aiming for gold number two. The USA have never won a Paralympic gold medal in rowing but they have good chances in the two PR3 events while China have been the main threat to the GB pair of Rowles and Stevenson in the PR2 competition. Frenchman Laurent Cadot will join the ranks of athletes who have competed at both an Olympics and Paralympics when he takes to the water at Paris 2024. Cadot represented his country at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics and also at European and world championships.  During back surgery in 2012 he developed an infection before being diagnosed with a degenerative neurological disorder.  He came to Para-rowing in 2022 and won PR3 mixed double sculls World Championship gold that year and bronze last year with Elur Alberdi. With Alberdi having undergone treatment for cancer, Cadot will be competing with Guylaine Marchand at the Games. Two golds: Mixed double sculls and mixed coxed fours"

The probability of dying was so high that you had to come to terms with it.â In 2022, Danylo Chufarovâs home city of Mariupol was under siege. For three weeks, as the shells rained down around him, he survived on little food, no electricity and rain water.  His home was destroyed, along with most of his possessions. He didnât train for six months. But, in 2023, he became a triple world champion - the best results of his long swimming career.  He was nominated for the prestigious Laureus Awards, posing for photos on the red carpet with tennis star Novak Djokovic and Real Madrid and England midfielder Jude Bellingham.  Now the swimmer, who is visually impaired, is hoping to become a Paralympic champion. âWe can show we are ready to fight,â he smiles. âMy country shall fight on the battlefield - and we shall fight in sport. Thatâs our mission.â Chufarov poses with 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic in April Ukraineâs Paralympic success is one of sportâs more startling anomalies.  As a general rule, the Paralympic medal table broadly mirrors that of the Olympics. At the last summer Paralympics in Tokyo, China, Great Britain, the USA, Russia (competing as the Russian Paralympic Committee) and the Netherlands were the best performing nations. A month before, they had all finished in the top seven in the Olympic medal table. But next on the Paralympic list was Ukraine.  They won 98 Paralympic medals in Tokyo, putting them sixth.  And yet at the Olympics just a few weeks earlier, they had finished 44th. This was far from a one-off. In fact, Ukraine can claim to be the most consistently successful Paralympic nation in the world. At the last 10 Paralympic Games â summer and winter â since 2004, Ukraine have finished in the top six in every single medal table.  No other country in the world has done that. They competed at the 2022 Winter Games despite their country being invaded just a few days earlier.  After a four-day journey to Beijing, images of their athletes chanting âpeace for Ukraineâ resonated around the world, external.  Somehow, they went on to finish second in the medal table, ahead of traditional winter sport powerhouses such as France, Canada and the United States. The 2022 Winter Paralympics began a little over a week after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the country's Paralympic Committee, was part of Ukraine's protests at the Games The challenges that Ukraineâs athletes have faced since 2022 are all too stark.  Chufarov says the effects of his experiences in Mariupol will never leave him. âI lost a few kilos but that doesnât reflect my mental state when I left the city. I believe that this trauma will stay with me forever,â he says. He now trains in a swimming pool near Dnipro. It is one of the few facilities near him that have not been destroyed or occupied by the Russian army. However, it is less than 100 miles from the front line.  âThere are air-raid alarms all the time,"" he says. ""We have to escape to the bomb shelters â and there are electricity shortages too. These are the conditions we have to train in.â Chufarov's flat in an apartment block in Mariupol was destroyed by Russian shelling The man behind Ukraineâs extraordinary success is the president of their Paralympic Committee, Valeriy Sushkevych.  He developed a programme called Invasport, which created specialist facilities for disability sport in every region of the country. However, that infrastructure, like much else in Ukraine, has been badly damaged. Sushkevych says 500 of Ukraine's disabled sports facilities have been destroyed. He describes preparations for the Paris Paralympics as âterribleâ, with athletes sleep-deprived from air-raid sirens sounding through the night. âThereâs physical danger from bombs and rockets every day â every hour sometimes,"" he says. âWhat kind of preparation can we talk about when people training outdoors see rockets flying â and know these rockets are flying to kill people and kill their relatives?â He says repeating Ukraineâs success in recent Games will be difficult.  âVictory often depends on the emotion of the athlete. Say, for example, an athlete about to start their competition finds out that 10 minutes earlier, there was an air attack in Ukraine near their family.  ""Our athletes will need to be strong like our soldiers.â A lot of athletes have been forced abroad, with all the inevitable personal stress and disruption to training, especially as their coaches often can't go with them. Twenty-year old swimmer Anna Hontar now lives in Finland after escaping from the occupied city of Kherson.  Trapped inside her house for a month, her father made her an improvised gym. âHe put rubber over some rails on the wall and I could imitate freestyle, butterfly and backstroke,"" she says.  ""It was too dangerous to go outside. There was fighting on the streets.â Hontar won 50m freestyle S6 bronze at the Tokyo Paralympics and has taken gold in the event at the two subsequent World Championships in Madeira and Manchester Arriving in Finland, her biggest shock was the quantity of snow â âIn Ukraine, we get just a little bit, but it was so highâ â but her swimming doesnât seem to have suffered. Like Chufarov, she also won gold at the World Championships in Manchester last year. Those championships didnât feature any Russian swimmers, who were banned from competing. At the Paralympics in Paris, thatâs set to change. The International Paralympic Committee say it is expecting 90 Russian athletes to compete as neutrals. At the Olympics earlier in the summer, only 15 Russian athletes took part. Competing against Russian rivals will not be easy.  âThey killed our children, people out on the streets and in the houses where they lived,"" says Hontar. âSwimming is not political â but maybe their parents, their uncles or their fathers have gone in to our country. It is so difficult.â I ask her whether this gives her an extra motivation to win at the Paralympics. âYesâ she replies instantly, her eyes suddenly flashing with determination. âI want to fight for Ukraine, for my family and for our Paralympic team. I want to fight.â Hontar has relocated to Finland from Kherson. The city was captured in the early days of the war as Russian forces swept west from occupied Crimea. It was liberated by Ukraine eight months later but is still under attack Other athletes have found their own ways to contribute to the war effort. Wheelchair fencer Andrii Demchuk crossed the border to Poland with his wife and two children after the invasion. After settling his family in Warsaw, he began helping other Ukrainian refugees. He ferried them from the border to the Polish capital, before returning with tents, sleeping bags and equipment for the Ukrainian army. He also delivered jeeps to the border â albeit in unconventional style. As a leg amputee, Demchuk normally drives an automatic. The jeeps were manual. âIt was a bit of a problem because I donât have a leg to push the clutch,â he says.  So â ingeniously - he used his fencing sword instead. âA broken rapier can push the clutch perfectly,â he explains, demonstrating his technique with an imaginary sword. âI delivered seven jeeps this way.â Together with two Polish fencing friends, Grzegorz Pluta and Stefan Makowski, he also began visiting local schools.  âWe realised we needed to bring Polish and Ukrainian children together,"" Demchuk says. ""The Ukrainian kids were traumatised â and there were some differences.â They visited around 40 schools â and talked to about 10,000 children.  âWe wanted to show the kids how sport can take your mind off your problems and that people who are disabled donât give up and can still break barriers.â At this point, Demchuk realised that if he didnât return to training, he wouldnât qualify for the Paralympics, so Pluta and Makowski invited him to train at their club in Warsaw. Most of Ukraine's Para-fencers are in similar circumstances, having had to leave their homeland. Demchuk trained one of his team-mates - Nadiia Doloh - after her coach was unable to follow her to Poland. Despite the disruption, Ukraineâs Para-fencing team finished top of the medal table at this yearâs European Championships. Demchuk gives an exhibition on Para-fencing at a school in Poland Demchuk has since returned to his home city of Lviv, where heâs taken on another role at the military hospital. He speaks to injured servicemen about adapting to life with a prosthetic. âI tell them that life goes on â and you donât need to be worried,"" he says.  ""Donât get depressed, donât take to alcohol or other substances - just be active from the start. I won them over because Iâm a sportsman and an amputee, so they trusted me.â And while his thoughts are now focused on Paris, theyâre also focused on his countrymen. After he won a gold medal at the Rio Paralympics in 2016, he dedicated his triumph to two friends who had been been killed during Russia's earlier incursions into the Donbas region. Demchuk says he has lost many more friends during the current conflict. Will he be thinking of them when he competes in Paris? âThe problem is, if I think about my friends â and about the war â I wonât win because of the emotionsâ¦. â he says, his voice briefly faltering.  âIn fencing, if you have this emotion, itâs not good. Youâll lose the fight before you even start.â But if you were to win a medal? He clasps his hands together, smiles and looks to the skies.  âI hope,â he says.

The rules are the same as for Olympic judo, except that the fighters start the bout gripped up. The sport's classification and weight divisions have been changed since Tokyo. Now, there are two categories of visual impairment: J1 and J2 rather than fighters competing together.  In J1, athletes may have varying degrees of vision impairment, from some vision to fully blind. They wear a red circle to let others know that they may need guided support before, during and after a match. J2 athletes are partially sighted. Both the J1 and J2 categories now have four weight categories for men and women - men's 60kg, -73kg, -90kg and +90kg and women's 48kg, -57kg, -70kg and +70kg rather than the seven men's and six women's divisions in Tokyo. If an athlete has a yellow circle on their kit, it indicates that athlete is deaf as well as having a visual impairment. Contests take place over four minutes, not including breaks. Scores of varying degrees are awarded for throws, holding techniques or submissions with judokas bidding for an ippon to end the contest. However, if neither achieves an ippon, the player who has accumulated the greatest number of points, achieved through throws and holds such as a yuko and a waza-ari, by the end of the bout is declared the winner. Two waza-ari also make an ippon. Penalties (or shidos) are also given to the athletes for a range of reasons and can ultimately lead to victory and/or disqualification. Collecting four penalties can award victory to their opponent. If both judoka are tied on scores or penalties at the end of their contest, it goes to a 'golden score', where the first person to score wins, with no time limit. Chris Skelley claimed Britain's first judo gold at a Paralympics since 1996 when he triumphed in the -100kg event in Tokyo. Following the sport's classification and weight changes he now competes in the J2+90kg category and the world number four will be hoping to come away with another Paralympic medal. Like Skelley, Dan Powell is competing at his third Games while Evan Molloy will make his Paralympic debut. Powell was inspired to take up the sport by his father Terry, a two-time Paralympic judo bronze medallist, and has won world and European silver medals in the J1-90kg event while Molloy goes in the J2 -90kg event. Azerbaijan topped the medal table at the last Paralympics with eight medals, including six golds, but failed to land a title at either the 2022 Worlds on home soil or the 2023 Ibsa World Games. China and Iran are traditionally strong along with Turkey. Brazil are also perennial challengers - Willians De Araujo has dominated the J1 +90kg division while Rosicleide De Andrade (J1 -48kg) and Brenda Souza De Freitas (J1 -70kg) could figure on the women's side. And Ukraine, who managed a silver and four bronzes in Tokyo, will be hoping to win what would surely be an emotional gold - their best hope could be Anastasiia Harnyk in the J1 +70kg.  One of France's leading medal hopes in the sport is Helios Latchoumanaya who won bronze in the -90kg event in Tokyo and this time will be chasing success in the J2 -90kg competition. Since Tokyo, Latchoumanaya has gone from strength to strength and won gold at the 2022 Worlds and the 2023 Ibsa World Games in Birmingham and is also European champion. Like four-time Olympic champion Teddy Riner, he is of Guadeloupe descent, leading to comparisons between the pair, and he will be keen to match Riner's Paris 2024 achievement and land gold for the hosts.

It is similar in many ways to the running game - the court is the same size and the the basket is the same height, each team consists of five players and a team has 24 seconds from taking possession of the ball to complete an attempt on the basket. The scoring system is the same too - one point for a free-throw, two for a field basket and three for a shot made behind the three-point line. Matches consist of four quarters of 10 minutes each. Players move the ball around the court by passing or dribbling. A dribble is when a player bounces the ball and pushes their chair simultaneously or places the ball on their lap and takes up to two pushes of the chair before bouncing the ball again. Players are required to throw or bounce the ball after every two pushes of the wheels on their chairs to avoid being penalised for 'travelling'. A player who commits five personal fouls must be replaced in the game by another player. All players are given a points total from 1.0 (the most impaired) up to 4.5 (the least impaired) and this is based on an athlete's functional ability to complete all skills necessary to play the game. Each squad can consist of up to 12 players, with only five players on the court at any one time. To ensure fair play on both sides, the points total of all five players on a team must not exceed a combined total of 14.0 points to rule out any physical advantage on either side. Qualification for Paris has been tougher than ever with only eight teams competing in the men's and women's events - down from 12 and 10 respectively. Among the men's teams to miss out are Japan, who won a surprise silver medal on home soil in 2021 and Iran, the 2022 World Championship bronze medallists. The British men's team won bronze at the past two Games, as well as the 2018 world title. They come to Paris as European champions having won the title last August, just weeks after a narrow defeat by the USA in the final of the rearranged 2022 World Championship in Dubai. There is plenty of experience, not least from Terry Bywater who is competing at his eighth Games, having made his debut as a 17-year-old in Sydney in 2000. Gregg Warburton, Phil Pratt, Lee Manning and Abdi Jama will also be key figures for the team. The women bounced back from a ninth-placed finish at the Worlds to take silver at the Europeans and clinch their place in Paris. The squad features seven players who won world silver in 2018 - Helen Freeman, who will be competing at her fifth Games, Robyn Love, Sophie Carrigill, Joy Haizelden, Charlotte Moore, Laurie Williams and Amy Conroy. They are joined by Paralympic debutants Jade Atkin, Maddie Martin and Jodie Waite, along with Katie Morrow, who played in Rio, and Lucy Robinson, who made her debut in Tokyo. The United States men are bidding for a third title in a row and go into the tournament as world champions after their victory over GB. The Netherlands, Spain and former champions Canada will be among the other main challengers. On the women's side, the Netherlands have been the dominant force in recent times and hold all three major titles - Paralympic, world and Europeans. China are a rising force, while the USA and Germany will also bid to feature. GB players Laurie Williams and Robyn Love became parents in April 2023 when Williams gave birth to their daughter Alba.

The epee is the heaviest weapon at 770g and is more rigid than the other swords, the foil is lighter and highly flexible while the sabre has a short, flexible blade. In the foil event, fencers are only permitted to strike the trunk area of the opponent, while in the sabre and epee, anywhere above the waist is a valid target area. Hits are recorded by striking an opponent cleanly in the valid area, with successful hits recorded by the electronic equipment. Fencers wear metal aprons to ensure that hits to off-target areas are not counted. During a contest, the fencers' wheelchairs are fastened into metal frames on the floor at an angle of 110 degrees. This allows freedom of the upper body only and allows the fencers' sword arms to oppose each other. The distance between the fencers is dependent on the fighter with the shorter arm reach. Bouts last a maximum of three minutes in the preliminary pool stages of the competition, with victory going to the first fencer to score five valid hits or the one with the most hits at the end of the three minutes. The preliminary round results form the seedings for the knockout stages. Here, bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes. The winner is the first to score 15 hits, or the highest scorer at the completion of the contest. In the event of a tie, an extra one-minute sudden death bout is held, with the first person to score a valid hit taking the contest. In team events, teams are made up of three fencers. Each fencer faces each opponent in the other team in a single bout of three minutes. The winning team is the one with the most points when the time is up, or the first to reach a cumulative score of 45 points. Classification divisions are based on impairment. Category A fencers have good trunk control, whereas Category B athletes have an impairment that impacts their trunk or their fencing arm. Piers Gilliver and Dimitri Coutya will both be hoping to add to their Paralympic medal haul. Gilliver's victory in the Epee A event in Tokyo gave GB their first gold medal in the sport since 1988 and he goes into Paris as world and European champion. Coutya, who won two individual bronzes three years ago, is a challenger in the Epee B and Foil B events where he is European champion and world medallist and will be hoping to improve on his Tokyo performance. Gilliver and Coutya will combine with Oliver Lam-Watson as GB chase team medals while Gemma Collis has a chance of a medal in the women's epee A event. China won 11 of the 16 gold medals on offer at Tokyo 2020 with Tan Shumei leading the charge with three (two individual and one team) and they were dominant again at last year's World Championships in Italy. Italy's Beatrice (Bebe) Vio Grandis, one of the stars of the Rising Phoenix documentary, returned from two years out to win gold in the Foil B event and will be hoping to retain her Paralympic crown. Elsewhere, France's Maxime Valet (Foil B) and Poland's Adrian Castro (Sabre B) will be among those hoping to stop the Chinese dominance. Thailand's Saysunee Jana created sporting history at the Athens Paralympics in 2004 when she became her nation's first female gold medallist when she triumphed in the Epee B event. Since then, she has gone on to win a medal at each subsequent Games - another gold at London 2012, silver in Rio and bronze in Beijing and Tokyo - and she will be aiming to keep up that medal record in Paris.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y832nyl2po,Defence firms 'need reassuring' that big orders will be long-term,"Western military production has ramped up due to Ukraine, but will it continue after the war ends?",26 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:01.123388,China News,BBC,China,"After years of declining defence spending in many Western countries, the war in Ukraine since 2022 has led to a huge increase. While Nato member states are not directly involved in the conflict, support for Kyiv has ramped up production of weapons and other military equipment. And longer-term concerns about Russia has meant that Nato countries are continuing to increase their own armament stockpiles. For defence firms like the UK’s BAE Systems, it has meant a surge in sales over the past three years. This month the company announced that its latest half-year revenues were up to £13.4bn, 13% higher than the same period in 2023. Meanwhile, its order backlog now stands at £74.1bn, its highest ever. “We will keep investing in new technologies, facilities and our people, so that we can deliver on our record order backlog, and help our government customers stay ahead in an uncertain world,” said BAE’s chief executive Charles Woodburn. But how easy or otherwise has it been for Western defence firms to increase production? And how long will the demand boom last? To boost armament production since 2022 it has mainly been a matter of increasing output at existing factories. But this is not quite as easy as it sounds. Many sites had only really been ticking over, if that, for years. This made expanding production not something that could be done quickly or easily. Andrew Kinniburgh, director general of Make UK Defence, one of the industry’s trade bodies gives me an example. “If you look at the Nlaw [a shoulder-fired anti-tank missile system] designed by [Swedish firm] Saab, and built by Thales in Belfast, they hadn’t had any new orders for many years, and the production line was basically mothballed.” Then in 2022, Saab got a £229m contract from the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) for thousands more Nlaws, with many of these to be assembled in Belfast by Thales over the next four years. Going from “mothballed” to fulfilling an order of that size is quite the challenge for any factory. The facility has more recently won a £176m order from the MoD for a separate weapon, Thales' lightweight multi-role missiles. “I’m incredibly proud of our Belfast workforce, who have massively stepped up to the challenge,"" says Alex Cresswell, chief executive of Thales in the UK. ""This has included new shift patterns, and processes being implemented to maximise working time. “Since just before the invasion of Ukraine up to this year, just a little over two years, factory outputs have doubled. It’s doubled to the most this factory has produced in living memory. And then in the next couple of years it will double again.” Much of the West’s armed forces have not been prepared for the possibility of fighting a major conflict since the end of the Cold War. The only ammunition they really use is during training, and stockpiles of weapons are very low. A sizeable chunk of what they did have in storage has been given to Ukraine, and now needs replacing. And future stockpiles need to be much larger. Mr Kinniburg says that Western governments are going to have to help defence firms significantly invest in both new production facilities and storage space for armaments. Building more weapons and increasing ammunition supplies is very expensive, but Nato nations are finding the money. As the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported recently: “Overall, total Nato spending increased by 11% in 2024, compared to 3% in 2023. Growth was even stronger among Nato’s European members, “who increased their combined military spending by 19% in real terms in 2024”, said the study. In the UK, Kier Starmer, the new Labour Prime Minister, has reaffirmed the government’s commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, up from 2%. It comes as Russia has significantly ramped up its arms production, and increased imports from North Korea and Iran. Meanwhile, although China denies sending Russia weapons, it does supply Moscow with ""dual-use items"" - those with both commercial and military applications. Stuart Dee, research leader in defence and security at the Rand Europe think tank, says that increased military spending across Nato members is unlikely to be a temporary phenomenon. “More than two years in, the conflict in Ukraine is increasingly unlikely to be a short. “Moreover, the security situation that emerges after the Ukraine conflict, whenever that is, is increasingly unclear, with potential security challenges across the globe. We are likely to see a sustainment of the increased defence spending across the board, as states around the globe adjust away from what has been a relatively benign period.” But defence manufacturers do not seem convinced yet, they have spent decades being rather unloved. Mr Dee says that means Western governments are trying to persuade them they are now back in favour and will stay in favour. “Governments are attempting to give surety, that this is a long-term supply deal,” he says. “That this is not just a two-second thing, and then you will be back to another 30 years of decline.” Governments are trying to press home that message. Dr Cynthia Cook is a senior fellow at the International Security programme, and the head of the defence industry initiatives group at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. She says one way for governments to do this is by placing long-term orders now. “The challenge for defence firms is not really solely how long the war in Ukraine is going to last, and whether it is worthwhile investing, but who is going to pay? “One of the signals that governments can send is to have long-term, multi-year contracts that tells industry they are going to get the money back from these investments.” But that is not defence firms’ only problem. New investments and capacities push up costs, and the next time the government is tendering for supplies of ammunition, the company that didn’t invest to increase production, might well be able to undercut the company that did. Knowing which way to jump is difficult. Then there is the problem of recruitment, people are wary of joining an industry that was ignored and run down until the war in Ukraine broke out. People are not exactly queuing to join an industry and devote their lives to it, when it has been in the doldrums for so long. Even so, defence manufacturers from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics in the US, German’s Rheinmetall, Sweden’s Saab, and the UK’s BAE Systems, are continuing to see a boom in orders. This is reflected in their soaring share prices. Meanwhile, the FTSE All-Share Defence and Aerospace index has risen by more than half over the past year.  Then, of course, there are the lessons to be learnt from the war in Ukraine. Experts from the world’s armed forces and their suppliers are poring over the data from the battlefield. Makers of military drones, seem to be the first major gainers from this analysis, it is a new technology which is cheap, easy to use and is having a decisive effect on the future of warfare. It is a sector where small and medium-sized companies are making a name for themselves. That in turns means there will be more spending on anti-drone capability. No country can afford to shoot down £500 drones with missiles that cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and take months to replace for very long. War is good for business, but it has also usually been good too for developing new technologies and weapons, and then developing the response to those new weapons. Ukraine is just accelerating that process, if at a huge cost in human lives and misery."

Of the 13 Paralympic shooting events, seven are mixed while there are three competitions each for men and women. Air pistol is shot over 10 metres (male and female), 25m and 50m (both mixed events): P1 - Men's 10m air pistol SH1 P2 - Women's 10m air pistol SH1 P3 - Mixed 25m pistol SH1 P4 - Mixed 50m pistol SH1 In rifle there are 10m events in both standing and prone positions plus prone and three-position events (standing, prone and kneeling) over 50m: R1 - Men's 10m air rifle standing SH1 R2 - Women's 10m air rifle standing SH1 R3 - Mixed 10m air rifle prone SH1 R4 - Mixed 10m air rifle standing SH2 R5 - Mixed 10m air rifle prone SH2 R6 - Mixed 50m rifle prone SH1 R7 - Men's 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 R8 - Women's 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 R9 - Mixed 50m rifle prone SH2 Shooting uses a classification system which enables athletes from different impairment groups with the same level of functional ability to compete together. Pistol shooters compete in the SH1 category and will have upper and/or lower limb impairment. Rifle shooters compete in either the SH1 or SH2 category. SH1 athletes have lower limb impairments while SH2 have upper limb impairments which mean they use a shooting stand to support the rifle and may also have lower limb impairments In qualification, each competitor takes a specified number of shots at the target - 120 in the three-position events and 60 in the remaining events - in a set time period. Qualifying for the three-position events takes a maximum of two hours and 45 minutes while the other events are around an hour to an hour and a quarter. The target consists of 10 concentric scoring rings, with the central ring worth 10 points and the outside ring worth one. Targets vary in size depending on the event. In the 10m air rifle event the whole target is 4.5cm in diameter and the central ring is just half a millimetre across. After the qualification round the eight top-scoring athletes go through to the final where all scores are reset to zero. The shots in the final are scored to one decimal place, with a top score of 10.9. After the first 12 shots, and every two shots thereafter, the lowest place shooter is eliminated until only two remain for the final two shots. Beijing gold medallist Matt Skelhon admitted that he found the experience of Tokyo tough to deal with and he struggled with his performance.  But he has regrouped well and goes to France as the world and European champion in the R6 mixed 50m rifle prone SH1 event. Ryan Cockbill claimed a bronze medal in the R4 mixed 10m air rifle standing SH2 event at the 2022 Worlds and will aim to add to that while Tim Jeffrey, who reached three finals in Tokyo, will also aim for a first medal. And the squad's sole pistol shooter Issy Bailey will be aiming to impress at her third Games. China, Serbia and India filled the top three places in the sport's medal table at the Tokyo Games with Avani Lekhara becoming the first Indian woman to win Paralympic gold thanks to her victory in the R2 10m air rifle SH1 event. French hopes are high with Tanguy de la Forest a double world champion but the veteran, who will be competing in his sixth Games, has yet to win a Paralympic medal. His team-mates Cedric Fevre, Didier Richard and Pierre Guillaume-Sage will also be hoping to make home advantage count. And expect big performances from seasoned campaigners like Slovakia's Veronika Vadovicova, Sweden's Anna Benson and Korea's Jinho Park and Jangho Lee. The United Arab Emirates have only won five Paralympic gold medals since they made their Games debut in 1992 with shooter Abdullah Sultan Alaryani winning two of those along with three silver medals. Alaryani was a member of his country's shooting team before a car accident in 2001. He later moved to Para-sport and will be aiming to retain his R7 Men's 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 title in France.

The W1 classification is for the most impaired archers, who may have an impairment in their legs and use a wheelchair. They may shoot either a recurve or compound bow modified from standard rules but there are not separate competitions for the two disciplines. The open classification is for competitors with an impairment in either the top or bottom halves of their bodies. Some athletes may use a wheelchair but others who have balance issues may shoot resting on a stool or standing. The recurve bow is the more traditional style of bow - when the string is drawn back, the curves of the bow straighten to give leverage when it is released - while the compound bow uses a system of levers and pulleys in order to fire the arrows. In W1 competition, the compound bow draw weight is limited to 45lbs and archers are not allowed to use magnifying scopes or levelling bubbles in their sight but competitors in the compound open division can use them and the draw weight is 60lbs. Targets have a diameter of 122cm and open recurve competitors shoot from a distance of 70 metres while open compound and W1 competitors shoot from 50 metres. The target is marked with 10 concentric rings which increase in points value the smaller and the closer they get to the centre. A hit in the outermost zone is worth one point while a hit in the centre, the 'gold', is worth 10 points. Each event includes a ranking round where each archer shoots 72 arrows (12 ends of six arrows each) before the archers enter the elimination rounds. The winner in the elimination phase in the open compound and W1 events is the athlete who scores the most points across the five ends of three arrows in each head-to-head match. In the open recurve event, the winner is the first archer to score to six points with two points given to the one who gets the highest score over each end of three arrows. In the event of a tie, an arrow-by-arrow shoot-off will be held, creating the possibility of a gold medal being decided by a single shot. In the individual events, the top performers in the ranking round will receive a bye in the first elimination round because of the number of entries. For the team events, teams are ranked according to the combined scores from the ranking round before proceeding to the knockout stages. Defending women's compound champion Phoebe Patterson-Pine will be hoping to retain her Tokyo title but among her challengers will be GB team-mate Jodie Grinham, who will be 28 weeks pregnant when she competes in Paris. Grinham, a team silver medallist in Rio, won the European Para Cup title earlier this year while the GB pair won European Championship bronze in the women's doubles and although that event isn't on the Paralympic programme, they are both in strong form. Nathan MacQueen is world number two in the men's compound and took silver at the 2023 Worlds as the former rugby player chases a medal at his third Paralympics, while Victoria Kingstone will be hoping to shine in the women's W1 event on her Games debut. China led the medal table both at Tokyo 2020 and last year's World Championships in the Czech Republic - although that event had a bigger programme than we will see in Paris. Having won just one bronze in Tokyo, India is starting to emerge as a strong nation in the sport. Among their leading challengers is teenager Sheetal Devi, who was born without upper limbs and uses her feet to manoeuvre the bow and shoot arrows. The 17-year-old won world compound silver last year and will be a big threat to Patterson-Pine and Grinham. David Drahoninsky of the Czech Republic, who will be competing at his fifth Games, will be bidding to continue his record of a medal from each in the men's W1 while former Para skier Kevin Mather will hope to maintain his dominance in the men's recurve, where he is Paralympic and world champion.  Archery was part of the first edition of the Stoke Mandeville Games - the predecessor of the Paralympics. Sixteen injured servicemen and women competed in the event in July 1948 under the supervision of Ludwig Guttmann. Two - one gold (Phoebe Patterson-Pine) and one bronze (Victoria Rumary)"

Athletes competing in the track (T) and field (F) events are divided into classifications to ensure fair competition. Classes 11-13 cover visual impairment with 11 the most severe up to 13 for athletes with more vision. Athletes in these classes can be assisted by guides on the field or the track without giving the athletes any unfair advantages. Class 20 is for athletes with a learning disability. Classes 33-34 are for athletes with cerebral palsy (or similar neurological conditions) who are also wheelchair users. Classes 35-38 are for athletes with cerebral palsy (or similar) who are ambulant and have the ability to run. Classes 40-41 are for athletes of short stature. Classes 42-44 are for athletes with lower limb impairments who compete without a prosthesis. Classes 45-47 are for athletes with upper limb impairments. Classes 51-58 are for athletes with different levels of spinal injuries and amputations who compete in wheelchairs either on the track or in field events. Classes 61-64 are for athletes with lower limb impairments who compete with a prosthesis. Some events will allow athletes from multiple classes to compete against each other. The GB team features plenty of experienced competitors with six Tokyo gold medallists returning to defend their titles. Wheelchair racer Hannah Cockroft, who will be hoping to add to her seven Paralympic titles, shot putter Aled Sion Davies, javelin thrower Dan Pembroke and high jumper Jonathan Broom-Edwards are all current world and Paralympic champions. Sprinters Thomas Young and Sophie Hahn are also back - Young has struggled with injury since Tokyo but won silver at the Worlds in Kobe in May while Hahn has seen the emergence of some new athletes to challenge her in her category as she chases a third T38 100m crown in a row. Sabrina Fortune (F20 shot put), Hollie Arnold (F46 javelin), Sammi Kinghorn (T53 100m and 400m) and two-time Paralympic champion Jonnie Peacock (T64 100m) are among those with medal chances. And discus thrower Dan Greaves and wheelchair racer David Weir will both be competing at their seventh Games with Greaves hoping to keep up his record of winning a medal every time since his debut in Sydney in 2000. Having topped the medal table in Tokyo, China repeated the feat at last yearâs World Championships in Paris, ahead of the United States. They were followed by Brazil, Great Britain and Ukraine but a total of 62 nations won at least one medal in Paris and the sport features a host of stars across all distances, disciplines and impairments. 'Blade Jumper' Markus Rehm of Germany will be hoping to win his fourth consecutive long jump title and extend his world record of 8.72m â a distance which would have won gold at every Olympics since Seoul in 1988. Swiss wheelchair racer Marcel Hug will hope to maintain his dominance in the T54 division having won four golds in Tokyo, while compatriot Catherine Debrunner will aim to do the same in the womenâs T53 class. Chinaâs Wen Xiaoyan, a winner of three golds in Tokyo, starts as favourite in the womenâs T37 sprints while Cubaâs Omara Durand will hope to recover from injury in the T12 event. The fastest Paralympian in the world, Brazil's Petrucio Ferreira, will aim for a third T47 100m title in a row. In Paris last year, France could only manage four bronzes but will be hoping that visually impaired sprinter Timothee Adolphe and T53 wheelchair racer Pierre Fairbank can spark celebrations. American 19-year-old Ezra Frech, who competes in the high jump, long jump and 100m, and T38 sprinter Jaydin Blackwell will be among those hoping to put the 2028 Games hosts in a strong position. And there will be plenty of interest in Italy's Valentina Petrillo, the first openly transgender athlete to compete at the Paralympic Games. She will feature in the women's T12 200m and 400m for athletes with a visual impairment. Marcel Hug was the sport's most successful competitor in Tokyo with four wins from his four races and the man known as the 'Silver Bullet', for his helmet, will be chasing his seventh Paralympic gold at his sixth Games in Paris. Away from the track, Hug is a keen reader of philosophy books and likes to swim in Lake Sempach near his home in Nottwil, but says he has struggled when it comes to another hobby - learning to play the guitar. 24 - nine gold, five silver and 10 bronze Hannah Cockroft & Hollie Arnold are also ambassadors to the Super Movers for Every Body campaign from BBC Teach.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdk5l94p1zo,"Behave yourselves, China tells its Olympic fans","Beijing says ""aggressive fan culture"" affects atheletes' performance and mars the country's reputation.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:01.511417,China News,BBC,China,"Beijing is cracking down on ""aggressive fans"" who it says are affecting the performance of Chinese athletes at the Paris Olympics - the latest in its years-long war against celebrity worship. In recent days, state media reports have called out ""inappropriate"" behaviour, such as fans booing during events or accusing referees of being unfair. This ""fan culture"", they said, reached a peak on 3 August when paddler Chen Meng defeated teammate Sun Yingsha to win gold in the table tennis women's singles. The Chinese internet exploded with support for Ms Sun despite her loss, with some denouncing Ms Chen's victory,  saying she won only because Ms Sun was exhausted from three earlier events. Chinese social media platforms have collectively removed tens of thousands of posts and banned over 800 accounts for allegedly ""spreading negativity and fomenting conflict"" about the event. One of Ms Sun's fans wrote that she ""wishes Chen tests positive for a banned substance, then the gold medal can go to [Sun],"" sparking anger online.  A 29-year-old woman has also been arrested for posting defamatory comments about the match. It's not clear what she had said but police said on Tuesday that she “maliciously fabricated information and blatantly defamed others, resulting in an adverse impact on society”. This is the latest in Beijing's crackdown on what it calls ""toxic"" celebrity culture. Previously,  China has seen the banning of celebrity rankings, the restructuring of fan clubs, and  the regular scrubbing of ""harmful"" content from fan pages. In the last few days, the state-run Global Times newspaper published several articles denouncing ""fan culture"" in sports.  One of its reports said ""numerous Chinese people"" were now worried about ""the visibly aggressive fan culture that threatens to erode the sporting world"". In addition to inflammatory comments directed at sporting personalities, authorities have also criticised fans who cheer loudly or use flash photography during matches, and those who profit by selling memorabilia signed by athletes. ""The [fan culture] not only affects the training and competition of Chinese athletes, but also seriously affects the reputation of Chinese sports,"" state news agency Xinhua said in a video report on Wednesday. Shanghai Daily published a commentary urging social media platforms to ""enforce strict policies against malicious behaviours"" and sporting organisations to ""take a firm stance against... fan mania"". Chinese authorities had warned against ""fan culture"" even before the Paris Olympics. Late last year, the Chinese Olympic Committee and General Administration of Sport of China told fans off after repeated incidents of them filming and following athletes. “It seems that these ‘low-level fans’ are driven by their love for idols and impulsively make irrational actions that endanger the normal order of events, public order and good customs, sportsmanship and social morality,” they had said in a joint statement. Ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, the committee warned Chinese Olympians not to get involved in fan clubs, adding that it wants to ""resolutely put an end to the spread of the chaos of fan culture to the field of sports"".  The athletes themselves have said they want to be treated with ""respect"". Veteran table tennis player Deng Yaping, for instance, had urged fans to ""express our preferences without attacking others"". She added: ""We must respect each other and leave space for everyone.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w658z4403o,Venezuelan court upholds Maduro’s disputed victory,The country's highest court agrees with election authorities despite the absence of full voting tallies.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:01.691509,China News,BBC,China,"Venezuela’s highest court has upheld the re-election of Nicolás Maduro as president following accusations of widespread voter fraud in July's poll. The decision by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ) comes as the United Nations warned that the court lacked independence and impartiality. The TSJ said it had reviewed material from the country’s election authority, which said Mr Maduro had won just over half of the vote, and agreed he had been victorious. Mr Maduro hailed Thursday's court decision as a ""historic and forceful ruling"".  Announcing the court ruling, TSJ head Caryslia Rodríguez said: “The electoral material assessed is certified unobjectionably and the results of the presidential election of 28 July released by the National Electoral Council (CNE), where Nicolás Maduro was elected president of the republic, are validated.”  The decision could not be appealed, she said. Marta Valiñas, chair of the fact-finding mission organised by the UN Human Rights Council, said the government had “exerted undue influence over TSJ decisions” through the use of “direct messages to judges and public statements”. Francisco Cox Vial, another member of the UN’s fact-finding mission, said Ms Rodríguez was a member of Mr Maduro’s ruling party and had held elected positions within it. Mr Maduro has led the country since 2013 and his re-election means he can serve another six-year term. At least 23 protesters have been killed at anti-government demonstrations since last month’s election and approximately 2,400 more have been arrested, the UN says. Protests erupted after the CNE declared Mr Maduro the winner on election night without publishing detailed voting tallies. The opposition says the tallies prove that its candidate, Edmundo González, won comfortably and they have published copies collected by their election observers on the internet. These documents, which have been reviewed by independent experts and media, suggest Mr González won 67% of the vote compared with Mr Maduro's 30%. Several Western countries have urged the Venezuelan authorities to publish the voting tallies in full while others, including Russia and China, have congratulated Mr Maduro on his victory. As well as the deaths and arrests of protesters in the last few weeks, the Maduro government has also started an investigation into opposition leaders for allegedly inciting the country’s military to commit crimes. They have also started passing a law through the National Assembly which would tighten rules on non-governmental organisations and forced the resignations of state employees who allegedly declared pro-opposition views. The presidential contest in 2018 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair after opposition candidates were jailed, barred from running or forced into exile. ""You have to be very careful nowadays who you are talking to, what you’re saying to people around you,” Dina tells the BBC World Service. ""They can ask you for your phone, if they see something that they consider suspicious you can go to prison."" BBC OS Conversations - Life in Venezuela"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ydg5lqgwxo,Scottish government suspends meetings with Israel,Minister Angus Robertson had faced criticism over talks with the deputy ambassador to the UK.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:01.790395,China News,BBC,China,"The Scottish government has announced it will not hold any more meetings with Israeli ambassadors until ""real progress"" is made in peace talks over the Gaza conflict. The SNP administration has faced criticism after External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson met Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky. Mr Robertson said he was sorry that the meeting was not ""strictly limited"" to talks about a ceasefire. He said the government would not accept further invitations from Israel until ""real progress"" had been made towards peace, on humanitarian assistance and until Israel ""co-operates fully with its international obligations on the investigation of genocide and war crimes"".  The meeting prompted a backlash from many SNP figures who have been highly critical of Israel’s conduct in the Middle East. But after the fallout last week, First Minister John Swinney defended the face-to-face meeting in a statement posted online. He acknowledged that some felt a meeting was “not appropriate”, but stood by the decision to accept the Israeli request. Mr Robertson said the meeting was not an attempt to legitimatise the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza.  ""The Scottish government has been consistent in our unequivocal condemnation of the atrocities we have witnessed in Gaza,"" he said. “The reality, however, is that this meeting has been taken by many to represent a normalisation of relations between the Israeli and Scottish governments. “As such, it is clear that it would have been better to ensure that the meeting was strictly limited to the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the appalling loss of life in the region. I apologise for the fact that this did not happen."" He said it would ""not be appropriate to accept any invitation"" for future meetings until ""real progress has been made towards peace"". The apology follows remarks on the conflict from SNP MSP John Mason who posted on X that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza. Mr Mason was suspended from the party's Holyrood group but has said he ""completely"" stands by his remarks. He told BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the situation in Gaza was ""nothing like"" previous examples of genocide. Mr Robertson met Ms Grudsky on 8 August, but it was four days later before the Scottish government released a statement about it. The statement referenced areas of “mutual interest” between Scotland and Israel, and said that Mr Robertson had “reiterated the Scottish government’s position in calling for an immediate ceasefire by all sides"". It said that he had called for “the unconditional release of all hostages and the opening of safe routes to allow more humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza"". A spokesperson has since said the delay in going public about the meeting was at the request of the Israeli Embassy on ""security grounds"". In his apology, Mr Robertson said it was his decision to take the meeting, which had been requested by Israel, but the first minister was made aware before it happened. The external affairs minister said: ""My view was that given the Israeli UK Deputy Ambassador had requested a meeting it was an opportunity to express the Scottish government's clear and unwavering position on the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and I did exactly that."" However SNP figures - including former ministers Emma Roddick, Kevin Stewart and Elena Whitham - criticised the decision to take the meeting. Mr Robertson said it was really important for a country like Scotland ""where we are aspiring to have an independent state"" to have diplomatic relations and lay out any differences ""when we are in dialogue with countries we are in disagreement with"". Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, welcomed the apology for the diplomatic encounter which was “clearly an astonishing error of judgement”. “Holding a meeting of this kind with the state of Israel at this time looks like normalising acts of genocide,” he said. “It’s really important that the Scottish government has acknowledged what a serious mistake they made holding a meeting of that kind. “But I want this to be about more than the optics of a single meeting, I want it to be about a change of practice.” He urged the Scottish government to ensure financial support was not given to arms companies which supplied weapons to Israel or were “complicit in illegal settlements”. A spokesperson of the Israel Embassy previously told BBC Scotland News that it was the work of foreign diplomats to engage and foster relations ""as part of the longstanding and positive relationship between Israel and the UK"". They said it remained ""resolute in fulfilling our duty to represent the state of Israel"". Last year Mr Robertson faced similar criticism after some SNP members felt he should have taken a firmer position on China."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240827-how-water-buffalo-can-bring-back-nature-to-abandoned-land,The 'living tractors' reviving Europe's wastelands,"When water buffalo make a home for themselves in abandoned spaces, they can bring with them a rich array of frogs, bats and plant life.",29 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:01.886741,China News,BBC,China,"When water buffalo make a home for themselves in abandoned spaces, they can bring with them a rich array of frogs, bats and plant life. Each autumn, as tadpoles outgrow their tails, the Kizilirmak Delta on Turkey's Black Sea erupts into chaotic commotion with the emergence of marsh frogs. While the fist-sized frogs are at home in the delta's wetlands, dozens can be seen hopping out of the muddy waters to exploit one particularly strange and unusually lively hunting ground. Climbing up a hillside of thick fur, the frogs encounter terrain that's warm underfoot and an atmosphere that buzzes with flies. But there are risks to foraging here. The surface beneath their webbed feet twitches and shakes, and the entire floor is prone to lurching unpredictably through the air and collapsing into the mud. This moving mountain of brawn and bugs is the muscular back of a massive water buffalo. On each of these giants roaming the delta, as many as 20 frogs or more can be found hitching a ride to their next meal. In this – the first observed example of amphibians foraging on the body of a large mammal – Turkey's marsh frogs have capitalised on one of the peculiar benefits that these huge animals bring to their wetland environments: their knack for attracting flies. Yet the frogs are just one of countless species worldwide, from bats to bog grasses, finding their surroundings transformed and their fates improved by the presence of buffalo. Over the course of more than 3,000 years since the water buffalo were first domesticated in Asia, these half-tonne mammals have spread around the world. Today they are estimated to number more than 200 million across 77 countries on five continents. For generations they were prized as powerful plough-pulling draft animals and providers of nutritious milk. In recent years buffalo have begun to earn a reputation among conservationists as handy landscape managers and a crucially important ecosystem engineer. Not to be confused with the bison of the American plains (often known as ""buffalo"" in North America), Asian water buffalo evolved to thrive in wetlands. They have wide, splayed hooves ""like mini-shovels that spread out"" to give them traction in damp and boggy land, says Alan McElligott, an associate professor of animal behaviour and welfare at City University of Hong Kong. This solid footing, plus flexible joints around their ankles, allows them to comfortably cross swamps, marshes and floodplains where most domesticated animals, like cows and horses, fear to tread. In thousands of years since domestication, buffalo have been selectively bred and today the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization recognises more than 100 specially adapted breeds. Buffalo can be broadly divided into river buffalo, which are common in India, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and smaller swamp buffalo, found across Bangladesh, China and Southeast Asia. River buffalo have often been bred for milk and typically prefer deep water, while swamp buffalo are usually bred as draft animals and are happiest wallowing in mud puddles. Breeds range from the heavy, hairy Romania buffalo (a river breed that can survive hard winters) to the Buffalypso, the swamp-river crossbreed that was bred to live on sugar plantation scraps in the hot Caribbean climate of Trinidad. Much like Arabian camels – which are so well suited to deserts that humans have transported them to deserts the world over – buffalo's fitness on challenging terrain has been their passport to travel widely. Introduced by farmers into wetlands from Brazil to Australia, their hardiness owes as much to their eating habits. ""They're big. They're not selective feeders. They have a very broad mouth,"" says McElligott. This helps them make light work of a variety of nutritionally poor aquatic plants and grasses, he says. Domesticated buffalo have long had a justified reputation as gentle giants, McElligott says, which remains largely true of Hong Kong's population, the ""feral"" descendants of farmed buffalo which now roam free. Conflicts with humans do happen, such as when males fight during mating season, McElligott says. But water buffalo can be docile enough to ride, as demonstrated by one Brazilian police force. McElligott leads City University's feral buffalo project, which is piecing together research that shows how feral buffalo on Lantau Island in west Hong Kong interact with human neighbours and impact these ecosystems. Ecological monitoring in areas where buffalo roam has found that they help trees grow by grazing back grasses, clear invasive plants, and create biodiverse wetland clearings. In Hong Kong, where many rice paddies have been abandoned amid intense urbanisation, former rice farms that are now grazed by buffalo have been found to have greater biodiversity than rice fields without the bovines. But City University's project aims to build a better picture of how free-roaming feral buffalo – the escaped descendants from livestock that pulled ploughs on rice paddies – act as keystone engineers of Hong Kong's wetlands. On a walk around Lantau Island, a short subway ride from the skyscrapers of central Hong Kong, McElligott sees buffalo traces all around. The animals dig wallows – ponds or mud puddles – to keep cool and protect them from biting insects. During the rainy season, these are filled with small insects, amphibians and fish, McElligott says. ""In the summer, lots of invertebrates are probably breeding in those things."" The invertebrates are food sources for frogs and likely by reptiles such as snakes, he adds. Despite the water buffalo's global spread, crucial information about the bovines, such as population distribution and their precise impacts on aquatic systems, remains unknown. When feral populations grow to excessive numbers, with few predators to keep numbers in check, the ecological impacts can be disastrous. In Australia's Northern Territories, there are estimated to be more than 200,000 feral buffalo, which can damage and divert waterways and disturb native geese. Along with feral horses, donkeys and cows, they have contributed to declining biodiversity. Indeed, the disturbance that buffalo bring isn't always welcome – as one family in Essex, eastern England, found out when they awoke to find 20 wallowing in their swimming pool – but for some landscapes it can make a critical difference. In the right environmental context, buffalo act as ""conservation grazers"", says Sara King, an ecologist at Rewilding Britain. In England and Wales buffalo are kept behind fences to manage wetland and pasture that has become overrun with reeds or scrub forest. There, they can chew back vegetation that would otherwise smother biodiversity. ""They create this mosaic of open areas through their grazing,"" says King. By eating, wallowing, trampling and spreading dung, they further increase the diversity of microhabitats on offer for species, including invertebrates and water birds, she adds. ""So it really does bring back quite a lot of life."" In many places, conservation projects are bringing back animals that fell from favour as livestock in the 20th Century. In Ukraine's Danube Delta, a breed of Carpathian buffalo was employed as an all-purpose ""living tractor"" for centuries until the Soviet Union implemented mechanised collective farming in the 1930s. By the turn of the millennium, their numbers had dwindled. But two Ukrainian projects have restocked the herd to help bring wetlands back to an island in the Danube, which had been drained for farming, and support the return of rare daffodil species. Elsewhere, including post-industrial landscapes of Slovenia, conservation projects have transported buffalo onto unfamiliar terrain. Damijan Denac, chief executive of the nonprofit Birdlife Slovenia, was one of a group of environmentalists who took on a major challenge when the Ormož Sugar Factory, on the Drava River, closed in 2006. During its heyday in the 1990s, the factory became an unusual haven for birdlife, with cooling ponds that received a steady supply of wastewater from cleaning raw sugar beets. These ponds, which carried heat and residual sugars from the factory, provided a bug buffet and ideal resting spot for migratory waterbirds, including the Common Tern and the Black-headed Gull. After the factory closed, its owners donated the site to environmentalists, who developed a set of thrifty tactics to turn this 55-hectare (140-acre) wetland into a nature park, such as hacking shipping containers to become bird-spotting posts. After a few seasons when volunteers laboriously mowed fast-growing foliage around the basins, it was clear that this task would be impossible without the assistance of large grazing animals, says Denac. ""And we knew that we would need a lot of animals – 30-plus."" Denac says the project considered importing Camargue horses, a breed of ""water horses"" that lives in marshes in southern France, which had been used on coastal restoration projects in Slovenia. But he was convinced to opt for buffalos by conservationists working on similar wetlands in Neusiedler-See National Park in neighbouring Hungary, and soon recruited four females and one male as conservation grazers. This bet on bovines paid off as buffalo waded through thick scrub and silty ponds to eat plants that had choked the water, wallowed on banks that had become overgrown with reeds, and cleared ditches that were previously dredged with industrial machinery. As in neighbouring Hungary, buffalo suppressed an invasive species of American goldenrod, allowing diverse native grassland species to return. In addition to saving on mowing costs, it is possible to see the direct impact they have in attracting animals: cattle egrets follow them around, eating everything from ticks to the frogs and insects they flush out as they move. Yet the indirect impacts of the ecosystem engineering are often the most dramatic, says Denac. Last summer, camera traps showed the new occupants of an open area cleared by buffalo, with visits from badgers, otters, cormorants, herons and more. While some projects, like the Ormož reserve, are relatively closely managed (using moveable fences to guide buffalo to graze certain areas), others aim to let buffalo run loose. Rewilding projects – which typically aim to restore ecosystem functioning by returning wild megafauna – often see water buffalo to be a worthy stand-in for the many large animals that have vanished from the landscape, King says. According to Rewilding Europe, a pan-European rewilding charity, the water buffalo's physical impacts – as well as transporting seeds around in their fur and gut – can fill in roles left absent by the extinction of massive wild herbivores, including the ​​European water buffalo, which died out more than 10,000 years ago, and more recently disappeared creatures. ""We used to have wild cattle called the aurochs. They were big, they were wild. They would roam across our landscape and create a whole load of different habitats through their actions,"" says King. (Read how the ancient Tauros cattle breed is mimicking the aurochs in Portugal.) When looking at countries like the UK, one of the most nature-depleted nations on the planet, conservation science is increasingly finding evidence that it can be better to introduce certain non-native animals, like buffalo, that have similar traits to extinct animals than to leave the landscapes without. In north Wales, King has found the arrival of water buffalo has boosted numbers of native invertebrates and bats – two species monitored to give an indication of the overall health of the ecosystem. King is also keenly observing an emerging alliance at one site in Cumbria where non-native water buffalo have been introduced alongside Eurasian beaver, which was native to the UK but has been absent for hundreds of years. Where the rodent's dam-building creates pools, buffalo then wallow, adding further complexity to the habitat. ""It's going to be really interesting to see those interactions and see how the two species complement each other,"" says King. ""And also to see how the two of them in a wetland system then support opportunities for other species as well."" Globally more than one third of wetlands have disappeared in the last 50 years. But with buffalos' help, more post-industrial spaces could have potential to develop into semi-natural swamps. CARBON COUNT The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

In Turkey, some 500 miles (800km) along the Black Sea coast from Kızılırmak, abandoned 20th Century coal mines have been filled with rainwater. For decades, local herders, who farm buffalo for their milk, released the animals to traverse this area carving channels between pits for fish, frogs and other species, which in turn fed the area's flocks of migrating birds, explains artist Alon Schwabe. Schwabe co-leads Cooking Sections, a London-based creative duo that has researched the Istanbul marshes and organised a yearly water buffalo festival to highlight the herding communities' struggle for survival in the face of Istanbul's sprawling development. With heavy development in the area already, and a planned 45km (28-mile) canal through this area that would allow ships to bypass the busy Bosphorus shipping corridor, pastoralists' way of life is precarious. Despite being greenlit by Turkey's environment ministry in 2021, the plan to cut a 400 metre-wide canal will cut through farmland, marshes and forests, would cause irreparable damage to the environment and water systems, as well as worsening traffic congestion,an Istanbul court ruled in February. A spokesperson for the Turkish government declined to comment due to ongoing legal proceedings. The unique relationships that buffalo have developed with both Kızılırmak's frogs and Istanbul's herders have emerged as a result of winding histories in which buffalo have crossed continents, provided food sources and ploughing power, and been released to roam free. By helping to rehabilitate post-industrial landscapes and rewild the countryside, the world's 200 million buffalo are cementing now their place as the gentle giants, destructive creators, and the introduced species that feels at home across so much of the planet. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l81rykd55o,‘That little devil is filming’: Director’s time with the Taliban,Ibrahim Nash’at succeeded in getting permission to film with the Taliban for a year.,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:07.002025,China News,BBC,China,"In August 2021, the world watched desperate scenes of multitudes fleeing Afghanistan as the Taliban swept into the capital, Kabul.  Having regrouped in the decades after being driven out by the invasion that followed the 11 September attacks, and emboldened by the agreed withdrawal of the remaining US forces, the Taliban deposed the elected government. But while thousands left, some had been trying to get into the country – including Ibrahim Nash’at, an Egyptian journalist and film-maker based in Germany. After much persistence, Nash’at succeeded in getting permission to stay in Afghanistan for up to a year to film primarily with the country’s then newly appointed Commander of the Air Force, Malawi Mansour, along with a young Talib lieutenant, MJ Mukhtar, who in the film dreams of joining the air force and longs to avenge himself against the Americans. Now, three years on from the Taliban’s return to power, the result is the documentary Hollywoodgate, named after the abandoned CIA military base where much of the filming took place. But in seeking to tell the tale of the country’s new era, Nash’at found himself in an uncomfortable and often fraught position with a new government that had become known for execution and repression during its first stint in power. ""That little devil is filming,” an unknown Taliban military figure comments to Mukhtar in Nash’at’s presence. “I hope he doesn’t bring us shame in front of China.” On another occasion, Mansour says casually in front of Nash’at that “if his intentions are bad, he will die soon.” Asked about it, Nash’at says: ""I actually didn’t understand what they were saying at the time. I’d asked the translator not to tell me bad things they said about me. I didn’t want to freak out."" Although frequently told to stop filming, he acquired more than enough footage for this fly-on-the-wall style story, where audiences see the vestiges of American troop life such as treadmills (Mansour asks in the film for one to be sent to his house), signs for unisex toilets and a fridge containing alcohol, but also some of the $7bn (£5.4bn) stockpile of weapons that the US confirmed later it had left behind, including around 73 aircraft and 100 military vehicles. “These monsters spent their last days here destroying everything,” says one of them about the Americans, as Mansour and his team inspect the former CIA base for the first time by torchlight. The US military command said at the time that military equipment had been rendered ""impossible” to use again, although Nash’at films some aircraft repairs being carried out and the documentary features scenes where his officials assure Mansour that some are fixed and ready to be tested in the air. Nash’at tells BBC News he was ""shocked"" to discover all that had been left behind. ""When I first saw the word 'Hollywoodgate' on the base from the road, that was it for me,"" he says. ""I thought I would make a movie about this crazy space that was American, and then it’s occupied by the Taliban Air Force. I thought it might be about how they sleep in American beds, but it’s become much more about the weapons."" ""It’s unbelievable these things even exist,"" he continues. ""It's really a question for the American authorities, why did they leave all of this behind? How many more warehouses did they leave full? And right until the end of my filming, I never thought they [the Taliban] would be able to fix them."" However, later scenes of the film, filmed one year later in August 2022, show a military parade at Bagram Air Base in front of the Afghan prime minister and minister of defence, with much of the US weaponry on triumphant display, as they host diplomatic visitors from countries including Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran. Mansour orders a flypast of several aircraft. US media networks have since reported that weapons left behind in Afghanistan have surfaced in other conflicts around the world. ""The movie really shows the transformation of the Taliban from being a militia into a military regime,"" the director claims. Nash’at didn’t get to film anything after that parade, he says, because immediately afterwards the film-maker felt he had to flee, as he was told to report to intelligence officials and have his footage inspected. He went to Kabul airport instead. ""They said to me, ‘Hey, come to our office tomorrow with all your material, we want to check it,’"" he recalls. ""For me, this was a huge alert. So I left Afghanistan at once."" ""I know from these kinds of regimes the moment you go down that road, it’s going to be a downward spiral, it’s never going to be something good,"" he says. Nash'at explains that he went into the country as most others were trying to leave, ""because as a journalist, I learned when something is no longer the hot story, no-one cares about it any more. I wanted to go in and do the opposite."" What ultimately got him access, he adds, was that in during his career, he had ""filmed with world leaders, and they [the Taliban] saw images of me with presidents"". And the film comes with a prestigious pedigree, as two of the producers are Odessa Rae and Shane Boris, who were also behind the Oscar-winning documentary Navalny. Nash’at argues that ""for me, the name Hollywoodgate is a representation of what this movie is about. It’s a film about the Taliban trying to show that they understand propaganda. ""It’s also about the Hollywood stories that we’ve been told about this kind of military world. It has so many layers for me, I feel that it’s a scandal sponsored by Hollywood itself. It functions like a Greek theatre where the failure of the US-led occupation of Afghanistan is played out.” Nash’at’s filming was restricted according to the orders of the Taliban commanders he filmed with. The New York Times review of the film calls it a ""frustrating documentary"" as a result. ""There is no question that the director... faced tremendous danger in shooting... but the risks required to make this documentary also highlight its limitations,"" it says. However, the Guardian's review of the film points out: ""If his finished film is light on probing interviews and rigorous analysis, there’s an obvious reason: his subjects all hate him.” Ibrahim is philosophical about this. “I think with these kinds of situations, when you take such a risk, know that there's risk involved, then you'll live the rest of your life knowing that there's a risk involved. And it's something I've come to accept.” He also emphasises that his voiceover at the start of the movie tells the audience that the Taliban wanted the audience to see some of the images he filmed. ""I ask the audience, despite that, ‘may I show you what I saw?’"" he says. ""My job as a filmmaker is to raise questions and hope the spectators will pick up these questions and try to find answers for them. My goal is that we can see through the ways they present themselves and understand the truth of their ambitions for control—of women, of their countrymen, of their larger geo-political region.” Ordinary Afghans are usually portrayed in the film observed from a car or truck. There are no women in this film at all – just a couple filmed in passing. One particularly poignant image is of a woman dressed in a burka, sitting in an icy road. Other women, shapes in burkas, sit outside a shop. It looks like they are begging, but it is not clear. In the three years since the Taliban took control in Afghanistan restrictions on women’s lives have increased: girls have been excluded from secondary schools, prevented from sitting most university entrance exams and women restricted in the work they can do, with beauty salons being closed, as well as being stopped from going to parks, gyms and sport clubs. Mansour talks about how his wife was a doctor before their marriage, but that he made her give it up. The UN estimates that more than two-thirds of the country does not have enough food, and that the situation has got worse because of the economic sanctions on women. ""It’s painful to watch these images and know this is the reality. It’s very ugly. What’s happening there, it’s just painful,"" Nash'at says. ""When I left, I was haunted by the futility of the material I had, thinking I might not be able to convey the pain of the Afghan people. ""Even if I was with the Taliban, I can see in people’s eyes the fear they have, the sadness, the tiredness. The poverty levels are on a scale I’ve never seen in any other country, and I’ve travelled a lot. It’s really sad that this country is where it is today and that nobody really cares about what’s happening to it."" “I did choose to go to Afghanistan. I did choose to make this from Afghanistan,” he admits. “All of the suffering that I've gone through in making the film, this is nothing compared to the daily suffering of the Afghans.” Hollywoodgate is in UK cinemas and available on Curzon Home Cinema now.

Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said after the race that Norrisâ victory was ""alarming"", external - and made it clear that he was speaking not only about the constructorsâ championship, in which it was already very clear that Red Bull were in trouble, but also the driversâ, in which Verstappen still has a huge 70-point lead. And Verstappen himself, who has now not won since the Spanish Grand Prix in June five races ago, did not disagree. ""This weekend was just a bad weekend in general,"" Verstappen said. ""So we need to understand that. ""But the last few races already, they haven't really been fantastic. So that, I think in a sense, was already a bit alarming. ""But we know that we don't need to panic. We are just trying to improve the situation. And that's what we are working on. But F1 is very complicated."" Norrisâ victory was the second-most dominant of the year, in terms of the winnerâs gap to his closest rival. Only Verstappenâs victory in the opening race of the season in Bahrain, when he was 25 seconds clear of the first non-Red Bull, saw the victor cross the line further ahead than the 22.9 seconds by which Norris headed the Dutchman. It was the manner of it that was so impressive. Norris and McLaren somehow fluffed the start, not for the first time this year, gifting Verstappen the lead. But while before - in Spain, in Hungary and in Belgium - this has ruined Norrisâ chances of victory, it soon became clear that would not be the case in Zandvoort. Norris clung to Verstappen like a limpet and then overtook him with imperious ease before the first pit stops, cruising off into the middle distance thereafter. To rub salt into his rivalsâ wounds, he then set the fastest lap on the final lap of the race, securing an extra point. That made the amount he clawed back on Verstappen eight points, not seven. Significantly, both in figurative and literal terms, that was slightly over the 7.8 points per race Norris needed on average to claw back on Verstappen over the remaining 10 races to win the title before arriving in the Netherlands. Norris, though, was not about to get carried away. ""I mean, I've been fighting for the championship since the first race of the year,"" he said. ""There's no sudden decision of, now I need to do better. ""I've been working hard the whole year and I'm still 70 points behind Max. So it's pretty stupid to think of anything at the minute. ""I just take one race at a time and just keep doing what I'm doing now because there's no point to think ahead and think of the rest. I don't care about it at the minute. So it's not a question that I need to get asked every single weekend."" This video can not be played F1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris on his vision for the future of Formula One It was hard, though, not to see the potential importance of this victory. McLaren, Norris admitted, had already had the fastest car on average since the Miami Grand Prix back in May, when he took his maiden victory, following an upgrade that transformed the car from the third fastest into a regular competitor with Red Bull. Since then, though, Norris had not managed to secure another win - and he admitted after his win on Sunday that ""we probably should have won two, three more races as a team, but we didnât"". The pressure to convert that form into wins was growing, and McLaren arrived at Zandvoort after the summer break with their first performance upgrade since Miami. They played it down, to a degree, saying it was not as big as the Miami one. About 30% of that size, it seemed. But it still seemed to make a marked difference. Norris took pole by the stunning margin of 0.356 seconds on the second-shortest track of the year. In percentage terms, it was the largest margin for a pole-winning driver since Verstappenâs in the fourth race of the season in China. And that was at a time when Red Bull appeared to have picked up from where they left off in 2023 and looked set for another dominant season. And then came the race. ""We worked hard over the summer break to just try and take a step back and reset and go again,"" Norris said. ""So yes, we've had a great car. This was our first time we bought some good upgrades to the car since Miami. They worked very well then. They've worked once again now. ""But itâs still a long way to go. So we still have to keep working hard because this is just Zandvoort. Monza (this coming weekend) is a completely different circuit. So we'll keep our heads down and keep chipping away."" The contrast with Red Bull was marked. In contrast with McLaren, they have not had such great success with the reliability of upgrades. Back in Canada in June, Mercedes technical director James Allison said it looked to him as if an upgrade Red Bull had introduced in Imola in May had actually been a downgrade. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner rejected that claim. And yet in Zandvoort, Verstappen was using a version of the first floor design used this year, not any of the subsequent changes. And team-mate Sergio Perez a later version. It underlined the impression that Red Bull are struggling to improve their car this year. Verstappen underlined it further. After the race, he talked about some ""balance issues"" with the car.  ""It wasn't there in the first few races,"" he said. ""But yeah, something in the car has made it more difficult to drive. And it's very hard to pinpoint where that is coming from at the moment. ""That is then hurting, of course, our one-lap performance, but also our long run."" Dominant Norris fights back to win Dutch GP Alpine F1 team 'not for sale,' says Briatore Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions McLaren team principal Andrea Stella emphasised that Zandvoort was a circuit where he expected his teamâs car to shine. He said the performance team to team ""seems to be very track-dependent"". ""If we go to tracks which belong to this kind of family of tracks, then we can be confident we will perform strongly, like high downforce, long corners,"" Stella said. ""If we go to tracks that have very high-speed corners like Silverstone, then we know Red Bull are very strong in this kind of layout. ""And still I think if we go back to Austria they would be faster because in Austria they pulled off a 0.4secs advantage in qualifying. ""But I think thanks to the upgrades now we would be more competitive even where Red Bull were faster than us potentially."" McLaren still have frailties, too. Losing the start did not cost Norris this time; his pace was too strong and he was able to make amends. But it did hurt team-mate Oscar Piastri. Both McLarens made bad starts - and the Australian, who started third, lost out to George Russellâs Mercedes as Norris was passed by Verstappen. Piastri never quite recovered. Ferrari got Charles Leclerc ahead of him at the pit stops by stopping first. McLaren ran long, giving Piastri a tyre advantage. He swept by Russell no problem and for a while Red Bull were worried that he could catch Verstappen - he had the pace. But he became stuck behind Leclerc and finished fourth. McLaren know they have a problem with first laps. The problem is, every situation has been different. Norris, who this time simply got too much wheel spin, said: ""We know what's required to do a perfect start. Weâre talking about fine margins here. ""Because we both didnât get it right, it seems like maybe there was an underlying issue or something wasn't how it was supposed to be, or we've clearly misjudged something more than what others did. ""But Oscar's one of the best starters on the grid. I'm not as good as him, but Iâm there or thereabouts. I'm not a bad starter, but not as good as obviously what we need to be. ""Again, it was a race which almost slipped away off the line, but today was, again, different to every other thing that's happened. So, kind of like I said before the weekend, we need to find a bit more consistency, but we've worked on it and I feel like I've done better procedurally, but obviously didn't turn into the correct thing."" Norris took McLaren's third win of the season Overall, though, McLaren are beginning to look formidable. It will take a couple of races to see whether this upgrade has really made a big difference. But if Norris can keep winning, he has a real chance of making life difficult for Verstappen in a season that, in terms of the driversâ, had looked locked for months. Add in the fact that Piastri could also get in the mix - after all, he did win in Hungary - and that Mercedes, off form in Zandvoort for reasons they admitted they didnât yet understand, but winners of three of the four races before that, can also beat Verstappen, and that 70-point margin begins to look less formidable. And in three racesâ time, F1 returns to Singapore, where Red Bull struggled badly even last year, when they were putting together the most dominant season in history, and where there is no reason to believe the same thing wonât happen again. Stella said: ""In the constructorsâ championship, the game was on even before this event. On the driversâ championship, we definitely wanted to keep our head and focus on the fact that it was possible. ""We think the car in the current configuration is possibly not enough in terms of the performance required to be the best car at every single event. Thatâs why we plan to deliver more upgrades before the end of the season."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj621kk020lo,Pakistan blames users for slow internet as firewall rumours grow,"Authorities have blamed widespread VPN use for the crawling connections, which have caused concern.",19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:07.186702,China News,BBC,China,"Pakistan has for weeks been experiencing painfully slow internet - but who, or what, is to blame is a matter for debate. Activists say the state is building a China-style internet firewall as it looks to exert further control over the online space.  Officials have disputed these claims and instead blamed the widespread use of secure connections or VPN (virtual private networks) for the crawling speeds. Shutting down the internet to crush dissent is a familiar move in regulators' playbooks in Pakistan and other parts of Asia.  Since the riots sparked by former prime minister Imran Khan last year, the government has blocked social media platforms and throttled connection speeds as the battle for public support spilled over from the streets to the digital space. The micro-blogging platform X has been blocked since the February elections due to ""national security"" concerns. Mr Khan's party supporters are big users of X and he is the most popular Pakistani on the platformn, with nearly 21 million followers. But Minister of State for Information Technology Shaza Fatima said on Sunday that the government was not behind the recent slowdown. She said her team has been ""working tirelessly"" with internet service providers and telcos to resolve the issue.  Ms Fatima said a ""large population"" had been using VPNs and ""this strained the network, causing the internet to go slow"". She said reports that the state was behind the slow connections were ""completely false"". However Ms Fatima said the government had been upgrading its systems to improve cyber security. ""It is the right of the government to [take such measures] given the cyber security attacks that this country has to go through,"" she said. Activists however accuse the minister of ""dodging criticism like a usual politician"".  Shahzad Ahmad, director of local digital watchdog Bytes for All, told the BBC his organisation has ""ample tech evident"" to prove the existence of a firewall.  ""It seems its purpose is to monitor online traffic... and limit dissemination [of information] in online spaces, particularly curbing political expression,"" Mr Ahmad said. ""Even if civil liberties don't matter, this is now about people's livelihood and the economy as well,"" said Farieha Aziz, co-founder of Bolo Bhi, a local non-profit that advocates for free speech online. Business leaders and associations have warned that the slow connections could endanger Pakistan's business potential.  ""The imposition of the firewall has triggered a perfect storm of challenges, with prolonged internet disconnections and erratic VPN performance threatening a complete meltdown of business operations,"" said the Pakistan Software Houses Association.  This could cost the IT sector up to $300 million, the association said, calling it a ""direct, tangible and aggressive assault on the industry’s viability"". ""A mass exodus of IT companies is not just a possibility but an imminent reality if immediate and decisive action is not taken,"" it said. Activists have filed a petition before the Islamabad High Court, calling for access to the internet to be declared a fundamental right under Pakistan's constitution.

Western airlines have been banned from flying over Russia since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This has forced them to fly longer routes, leading to extended flight times and higher costs, including for fuel and crew.  Chinese airlines are still able to fly over Russia, giving them a commercial advantage. When British Airways (BA) resumed flights last year, after pausing during the Covid-19 pandemic, it said Heathrow to Beijing was ""one of our most important routes"". However, in a call with investors last month, Nicholas Cadbury, the chief financial officer of BA's parent company IAG, said it faced ""weak demand"" in China.  The airline now says Beijing flights will be suspended until November 2025, but schedules will remain under review. BA is also dropping one of its two daily flights to Hong Kong. It will continue flying to Shanghai. Air traffic between Europe and China has been slow to recover since the pandemic, with Chinese carriers taking a majority of the market. Last month Virgin Atlantic also announced plans to cancel its flights from Shanghai, its only destination in China, from October.  It said ""significant challenges and complexities on this route have contributed to the commercial decision to suspend flying to Shanghai."" It said flight times were approximately one hour longer to Shanghai, and two hours longer on the way back to London."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8dy437pdno,China's rhetoric turns dangerously real for Taiwanese,"China wants people to report Taiwanese ""separatists"", with the threat of death penalties for some.",16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:07.470577,China News,BBC,China,"Calls to denounce “die hard"" Taiwanese secessionists, a tipline to report them and punishments that include the death penalty for “ringleaders” –  Beijing’s familiar rhetoric against Taiwan is turning dangerously real. The democratically-governed island has grown used to China’s claims. Even the planes and ships that test its defences have become a routine provocation. But the recent moves to criminalise support for it are unnerving Taiwanese who live and work in China, and those back home. “I am currently planning to speed up my departure,” a Taiwanese businesswoman based in China said – this was soon after the Supreme Court ushered in changes allowing life imprisonment and even the death penalty for those guilty of advocating for Taiwanese independence. “I don’t think that is making a mountain out of a molehill. The line is now very unclear,” says Prof Chen Yu-Jie, a legal scholar at Taiwan’s Academia Sinica. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office was quick to assure the 23 million Taiwanese that this is not targeted at them, but at an “extremely small number of hard-line independence activists”. The “vast majority of Taiwanese compatriots have nothing to fear,” the office said. But wary Taiwanese say they don’t want to test that claim. The BBC has spoken to several Taiwanese who live and work in China who said they were either planning to leave soon or had already left. Few were willing to be interviewed on record; none wanted to be named. “Any statement you make now could be misinterpreted and you could be reported. Even before this new law China was already encouraging people to report on others,” the businesswoman said. That was made official last week when Chinese authorities launched a website identifying Taiwanese public figures deemed “die hard” separatists. The site included an email address where people could send “clues and crimes” about those who had been named, or anyone else they suspected. Scholars believe Beijing hopes to emulate the success of Hong Kong’s national security laws, which it said were necessary for stability - but they have crushed the city’s pro-democracy movement as former lawmakers, activists and ordinary citizens critical of the government have been jailed under them. By making pro-Taiwanese sentiments a matter of national security, Beijing hopes to “cut off the movement’s ties with the outside world and to divide society in Taiwan between those who support Taiwan independence and those who do not”, Prof Chen says. She believes the guidance from the Supreme Court will almost certainly result in prosecutions of some Taiwanese living in China. “This opinion has been sent to all levels of law enforcement nationwide. So this is a way of saying to them – we want to see more cases like this being prosecuted, so go and find one.” “We must be even more cautious,” said a Taiwanese man based in Macau. He said he had always been prepared for threats, but the new legal guidance had made his friends “express concern” about his future in the Chinese city. “In recent years, patriotic education has become prevalent in Macau, with more assertive statements on Taiwan creating a more tense atmosphere compared to pre-pandemic times,” he added. Taiwan, which has powerful allies in the US, the EU and Japan, rejects Beijing’s plans for “reunification” – but fears have been growing that China’s Xi Jinping has sped up the timeline to take the island, an avowed goal of the Chinese Communist Party. For more than 30 years Taiwanese companies - iPhone-maker Foxconn, advanced chips giant TSMC and electronics behemoth Acer – have played a key role in China’s growth. The prosperity also brought Taiwanese from across the strait who were in search of jobs and brighter prospects. “I absolutely loved Shanghai when I first moved there. It felt so much bigger, more exciting, more cosmopolitan than Taipei,” says Zoe Chu*. She spent more than a decade in Shanghai managing foreign musicians who were in high demand from clubs and venues in cities across China. This was the mid-2000s when China was booming, drawing money and people from across the globe. Shanghai was at the heart of it - bigger, shinier and trendier than any other Chinese city. “My Shanghainese friends were dismissive of Beijing. They called it the big northern village,” Ms Chu recalls. “Shanghai was the place to be. It had the best restaurants, the best nightclubs, the coolest people. I felt like such a country bumpkin, but I learned fast.” By the end of that decade – in 2009 - more than 400,000 Taiwanese lived in China. By 2022, that number had plummeted to 177,000, according to official figures from Taiwan. “China had changed,” says Ms Chu, who left Shanghai in 2019. She now works for a medical company in Taipei and has no plans to return. “I am Taiwanese,” she explains. “It’s no longer safe for us there.” The Taiwanese exodus has been driven by the same things that have pushed huge numbers of foreigners to leave China – a sluggish economy, growing hostility between Beijing and Washington and, most of all, the sudden and sweeping lockdowns during the Covid pandemic. But Taiwanese in China have also been worried because the government doesn’t see them as “foreigners”, which makes them especially vulnerable to state repression. Senior Taiwanese officials have told the BBC that 15 Taiwanese nationals are currently being held in China for various alleged crimes, “including violations of the anti-secession law”. In 2019, China jailed a Taiwanese businessman for espionage after he was caught taking photos of police officers in Shenzen – a charge he denied. He was only released last year. In April 2023, China confirmed that it had arrested a Taiwan-based publisher for “endangering national security”. He still remains in custody. Amy Hsu*, who once lived and worked in China, says she is now scared to even visit because of her job. After returning to Taiwan, she began volunteering at an NGO which helped people who had fled Hong Kong to settle in Taiwan. “It is definitely more dangerous for me now,” she says.  “In 2018, they began using surveillance cameras to fine people for jaywalking and the system could identify your face and send the fine directly to your address.” She says the extent of surveillance disturbed her – and she worries it can be used to go after even visitors, especially those on a list of potential offenders. “Oh I am definitely on the list. I am a hardline pro-independence [guy] with lots of ideas,” chuckles Robert Tsao, a 77-year-old tech billionaire, who founded one of Taiwan’s largest chip-makers, United Micro-electronics Corporation (UMC). Mr Tsao was born in Beijing, but today he supports Taiwan independence and avoids not just China, but also Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand and even Singapore. Mr Tsao was not always hostile to China. He was one of the first Taiwanese investors to set up advanced chip-making factories in China. But he says the crackdown in Hong Kong changed his mind: “It was so free and vibrant and now it’s gone. And they want to do the same to us here.” “This new ruling is actually helping people like me,” he says. He believes it will backfire, increasing the resolve of Taiwanese people to resist China. “They say the new law will only affect a few hard-line independence supporters like me, but so many Taiwanese people either support independence or the status quo [keep things as they are], which is the same thing, so we have all become criminals.” * Names changed on request of contributors "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/c5yk93jkj4xo,How a Facebook advert changed a life and the look of a sport,"Phoebe Schecter had watched two Super Bowls and found them both ""boring"" before a move to the UK sparked an unlikely NFL career",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:07.571820,China News,BBC,China,"How a Facebook advert changed a life and the look of a sport Phoebe Schecter was still getting used to life in a new country. At the age of 22, she had moved on her own from the United States to the United Kingdom. She had been living and working in rural Cheshire for about two months and was starting to feel a little homesick, a little lonely. She then chanced upon an advert on social media and made a bold decision. ""It changed the complete trajectory of my life,"" she says. ""It's been the best decision Iâve ever made."" That decision has taken the 34-year-old into the world of the NFL. It may yet take her to the Olympics. Schecter has become one of the key figures in the NFL's international broadcast operation Growing up in Connecticut, Schecter's main passion was horse riding and, after studying equine business management, she began working with horses. Schecter, whose mother is British, made use of her dual citizenship in 2012, accepting a job at an equestrian centre near Congleton and opening out her horizons. ""I needed something new in my life,"" she says. ""I needed a change of scenery, a new challenge."" It was a challenge. Schecter was working six days a week, but during her limited downtime she began scrolling online and saw something about a women's American football team.  In February 2013, she attended a trial in Manchester and a new passion was born. ""I had moved by myself so was definitely missing home,"" she says. ""I really wanted to meet new people and get a bit of American culture. ""I saw the ad and just went for it. When you're out of your comfort zone, you're so much more willing to take risks, and that's kind of what happened with me. ""Because of my accent they thought I could throw the ball, but there was no correlation at all. I had no idea what I was doing. ""But I was enthusiastic, I was passionate. I'd never played a contact sport before but there seemed to be some sort of calling towards it."" Schecter didn't just find a new community, she found a new way of life, which has taken her all over the world. She has become a role model and a trailblazer, going inside an NFL locker room as a coach and to the Super Bowl sidelines as a broadcaster. And she could even go to the Olympics as a player, as this week she represents Great Britain at the Flag Football World Championships. Schecter (left) on the sidelines of one of the NFL's international games in Frankfurt last season, with fellow analyst Jason Bell More than a decade after seeing that social media ad, Schecter is one of the UK's biggest American football personalities. But don't let her accent fool you. Her love of American football blossomed in the UK. ""When I was in the States, I watched maybe two Super Bowls,"" she says. ""I hate to say it now, but I thought the sport was so boring. I didn't understand it at all. ""So now, to think I was able to work my way up and go to the NFL, it's kind of one of those pinch-me things, that you don't believe is real."" Soon after the trial in Manchester, Schecter became one of the founding members of the GB women's tackle football team. She also started playing flag football - the non-contact version of the game, which will make its Olympic debut at Los Angeles 2028 - and with the Staffordshire Surge, a men's tackle team. She took an interest in coaching and in 2016 did the first of three internships at American universities. Then in 2017, she did the first of two internships with the Buffalo Bills, becoming Britain's first female coach in the NFL. Having not grown up with the game, Schecter says she ""came into this whole experience knowing I was behind the eight ball - I had to fast-track my learning"". She created her own glossary to help herself with the game's terminology. She printed pictures of the Bills' coaching staff so she'd know who was who. She joined as many meetings as possible and continually asked questions. ""It was a baptism of fire,"" she says. ""It was definitely a huge learning curve. But being curious has been really helpful for me. I was doing whatever I could to build my experience and absorb as much information as possible. ""I wanted to learn and was so passionate. I had consistent, positive energy - every single day, no matter what the result was at the weekend. It may seem like nothing, but itâs actually really important. ""Once you understand the value you bring to a team, it gives you that boost of confidence of 'I know why Iâm here, I know what I can do'."" The NFL is a male-dominated environment but Schecter tried to ignore the fact she was one of the few women clocking in at the Bills' training facility each day. ""If you go into that experience thinking 'oh my gosh, I'm the only woman here', you already have the wrong mindset, your focus is going to be on the wrong thing,"" she says. ""I was there to be the best educator and coach I can be, regardless of my background. ""Some of the guys were saying 'hey, what can't I say around you?' But I said 'in order to get the best version of you, I need you to be your authentic self, to speak freely'. If it's not something you'd say in front of your mother or grandmother, perhaps it's something you shouldnât be saying in a professional environment anyway. ""But being a woman was also a super power in some ways. Having those inter-personal skills, a lot of my athletes felt more comfortable speaking to me because they grew up in single-mother homes, so to have a female around wasnât a bad thing.  ""They just werenât used to it in a coaching capacity."" Schecter remembers the moment she truly felt that she belonged.  The Bills' offensive unit had a meeting each morning and everyone would sit in the same seat. When a new player came in mid-season and sat in Schecterâs seat he was told 'youâve got to get up, this is her seat'. ""That meant so much,"" she says. ""It was only a little thing but the feeling of belonging was huge. I was really a part of that team. They really saw me as one of them."" Schecter has enjoyed a similar feeling in her broadcasting career, which also began by chance. Schecter became Britain's first female coach in the NFL when she interned on the Buffalo Bills' backroom staff Schecter had already done some radio work when she began appearing on Sky Sports' American football coverage during the Covid lockdown. When the broadcaster's main NFL host Neil Reynolds was ill over Christmas 2022, Schecter and Hannah Wilkes were asked to present the live Sunday show. It was the first time that women had been on.  Schecter is now a regular analyst, appearing alongside Reynolds and former NFL player Jason Bell. ""Broadcasting was never anything I was looking to do,"" she says. ""I was so nervous to sit on a couch with an ex-player and Neil, who's an NFL legend in the UK, and give my opinion. ""At first in particular, lots of people had lots to say [on social media]: 'What does she know? Why is she here?' I would never want someone to think: 'Oh, sheâs been put there because sheâs a woman.' ""So when Neil or Jason back up what I say, all those that perhaps don't believe in me see that and are like: 'Yeah, youâre right.' That's been massive for my development, to help build my confidence and show the audience 'this girl knows what sheâs talking about'."" Besides criticism on social media, Schecter faced hostility at a coaching event where an older male coach said she didn't deserve her position with the Bills. ""He said he'd been working for something like that for so long,"" she says. ""In the past, something like that would probably have gotten to me but already, by his attitude towards me, he showed that he wouldn't be the right fit for a professional NFL team.  ""They just want the best person possible and whoever will help them win. ""The NFL is trying to get more females involved in the sport in general, but you still have to earn your place - you still have to prove that you belong, to be given these opportunities."" Because of Schecterâs attitude and work ethic, she continues to earn them.  ""You can never learn enough,"" she says. Schecter, who will write a BBC Sport column during this year's NFL season, has developed her media career alongside playing and coaching Schecter delivers coaching clinics across Europe; she is a committee member for both the British American Football Association (Bafa) and International Federation of American Football (Ifaf); she is a global flag football ambassador for the NFL. ""My schedule is nuts,"" she says. ""It's a lot, but I love it. I love the energy. You've got to take advantage of every minute in the day. ""Before I moved to the UK, if anyone said I'd ever be doing any of what I'm doing now, or be half the person I am now, I wouldn't have believed them. It's been absolutely insane. ""The sport has completely changed my life, and all I want to do now is give back, as much as possible."" Having played her last tackle game for Great Britain earlier this month, she is now preparing to represent them at the Flag World Championships in Finland. Flag is the most inclusive and accessible form of American football. According to Ifaf, it is played by about 20 million people in more than 100 countries and the rapid growth of the women's game was key to it being chosen as one of five sports to be added to Olympic programme for 2028. Great Britain's women's team, who won the 2023 European Championship, are ranked fourth in the world. They make their World Championships debut on Tuesday (12:00 BST), taking on Czech Republic in their opening group game before meetings with Israel and Panama. The top three teams in the pool will progress to the last 16. The US are the worldâs top-ranked team - followed by Mexico and Japan - having won the past two World Championships, but they were beaten 39-6 by Mexico in the final of the 2022 World Games. A top-seven finish will ensure Great Britain a place at the 2025 World Games in China, and a strong performance in Finland would strengthen their claim for better funding. Kate Bruinvels, Ellie Thorpe and Kellie Barrett, three of Schecter's Great Britain flag football team-mates Great Britain coach Dean Whittingslow says it costs ""thousands each year for players to train, participate and travel"", and the GB programme launched a crowdfunding page to help cover team costs for the World Championships. Schecter is one of the longest-serving members of the 12-player squad in Finland.  While she discovered the sport at that trial in Manchester, many of her team-mates first tried it at school or university. A few of the others previously played soccer, netball or even ultimate frisbee. Schecter has also added 'scout' to her many roles. A conversation with one of the NFL's flag football suppliers revealed that his daughter is not only a flag quarterback, but also a British passport holder. Brittany Botterill came aboard and was named the tournament Most Valuable Player as Great Britain became European champions last year. The newest member of the team is Emily Kemp, who previously played flag at college in the US. That makes it three US-born players on the GB squad, but coach Whittingslow is ""not specifically looking for talent in America, that's happened naturally"". He is also not focused on recruiting athletes from certain sports. ""There is plenty of interest in flag football, and there are transferable skills from a multitude of other sports,"" he says.

Inverness Harriers middle distance runner Davidson had wanted to run the 1500m at Grangemouth but would not compete on a Sunday, the Christian Sabbath. He instead competed in Saturday's event over the shorter distance and finished in one minute 53 seconds, ahead of 2023 World Para T20 1500m champion Ben Sandilands. Scottish sprinter and rugby player Liddell famously refused to run the 100m heats at the 1924 Olympics as they were held on a Sunday but went on to win the 400m in Paris. He died while working as a missionary in China in 1945. Scottish Athletics renamed their track and field championships after Liddell - a century after his Olympic gold and in the year when the Games returned to the French capital. ""He has always been an inspiration of mine - so I felt like him at Grangemouth in that 800m final,"" Davidson told Scottish Athletics. ""I am trying to follow his footsteps as best I can. ""I don't think I was a favourite going into the 800m but middle distance races can go any way on the day. ""My faith is number one for me.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75nqv16k92o,'We learnt to speak to each other through music',A musical group combining traditional Indian and Irish music is among the highlights of Mela Day.,25 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:07.766981,China News,BBC,China,"Music is known for its ability to bring together many different cultures, cross barriers and create something unique. One group, Citadels of the Sun, have found a pairing that you might not expect - traditional Irish folk music and traditional Indian folk music blended together. The group, who are taking part in Belfast Mela, said that is something they use as a focus when songwriting and performing. The festival has been taking place over the past week with final celebrations taking place on Sunday at Botanic Gardens. The musicians are performing at the Showcase Stage after performing to a sell-out crowd at The Mac on Friday. The distinctive name for the group, Citadels of the Sun, refers to two sun forts: Grianán of Aileach in Donegal and Mehrangarh in Jodhpur and was set up in 2019 as a joint collaboration with Earagail Arts Festival and Jodhpur RIFF (Rajasthan International Folk Festival). The group is made up of Martin Coyle, Paul Cutliffe, Sarah E Cullen, Asin Khan Langa and Sawai Khan Manganiyar. Asin and Sawai told BBC News NI they loved performing worldwide and ""can’t wait for our performance at Belfast Mela”. Martin Coyle, from Londonderry, plays the Irish Bouzouki – a stringed instrument which is similar to a mandolin. “Initially I found the project very daunting as we didn’t know how it was going to gel together but after spending more time with Asin and Sawai, we found out we had much more in common than what we thought,” he said. “It turns out Indian and Irish culture is much more similar than you would believe as a lot of it is based on folk tales, so this gave us a strong base to write some lyrical narratives for our music.” “Our collaboration has highlighted the universal beauty of music - Sawai and Asin’s English was not very strong at the start so we could only communicate through music. ""However, this developed the project really well and quickly,” Martin continued. “Music was our only form of expression and we learnt to speak to each other through music as it was our only form of expression. Now, language barriers do not hold us back,” he added. “It feels amazing to perform in Northern Ireland to new audiences who have not heard this type of music before,"" Martin explained. ""It’s a pleasure to tell the story of these two sun forts and how they feel each other’s presence while being worlds apart. “We let the traditional folk instruments from each country talk to each other throughout the performance and blend together just as we are."" Nisha Tandon is the chief executive of ArtsEkta, the group behind the Belfast Mela festival. “The word Mela comes from South East Asia and it means ‘getting together’ and that is what we really try to do here,"" she said. ""There are no barriers and everyone is equal, no matter what. “Mela brings a sense of pride to many diverse communities who call Northern Ireland their home and celebrates what the bring to the island. Nisha continued that Northern Ireland has been ""so welcoming"" to many different cultures, ""however, recently there has been a lot of issues"". The organiser was referring to recent race hate violence, particularly in Belfast, which followed anti-immigration protests.  A number of homes and businesses belonging to ethnic minorities have been targeted, with police making dozens of arrests. “Mela is a time to forget about these issues, celebrate inclusivity and work together to be united,” Nisha added. Belfast Mela has been running for 18 years in Northern Ireland and attracts thousands of people each year. “Citadels of the Sun is the perfect example of interweaving cultures together and that is what we are all about at Mela,"" Nisha said. ""By mixing Irish and Indian culture, something unique and special is created, giving a platform for people to mingle and collaborate."" Asin and Sawai have both travelled from India to Belfast to perform in the group for Mela.  Asin plays the Sindhi Sarangi (a stringed instrument not unlike a fiddle) and performs vocals. Sawai plays a long list of traditional Indian instruments including Dholak (a two-headed drum), Khartal (a percussion instrument similar to the cymbals) and Morchang (similar to the mouth harp). “We come from different communities in India– one Hindu and one Muslim. But through our traditional Indian instruments we have come together,” Asin said. “We took inspiration from both Indian soil and Irish soil, both cultures love storytelling and that is why it has worked so well,” he continued. Sunday is Mela day.  It is the finale of the festival and is taking place from 12:00 - 18:00 BST at Botanic Gardens. The event's website promised that the venue would be ""transformed into a wonderland of world music, dance, food and art"". The event was opened with a procession, led by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Micky Murray, and Nisha Tandon. Attendees have been able to sample food from around the world, with cook-along sessions and other dancers performing from as far afield as China and Mexico.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyw1l4lgnlo,Kamala Harris convention speech fact-checked,BBC Verify has looked into some of the claims made by Kamala Harris at the DNC in Chicago.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:12.223408,China News,BBC,China,"The Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has given her acceptance speech at the party's national convention in Chicago. She spoke about her upbringing, her career and made a number of claims about Donald Trump's record and what he would do if he won the election. BBC Verify has looked into some of these. CLAIM:  Trump would ""enact a nationwide abortion ban”. VERDICT: This is misleading. Trump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban and that he believes the issue should be left to individual states. While president, Trump appointed three conservative justices to the Supreme Court who voted to overturn Roe v Wade. Roe v Wade was a ruling that protected the federal constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years until it was overturned in June 2022. Subsequently, 22 states banned abortion or restricted the procedure to earlier in a pregnancy than had been set by Roe v Wade. In 14 of these states, abortion is banned in almost all circumstances, with 10 not making an exception for rape or incest. CLAIM: “As a part of his [Trump’s] agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control.” VERDICT: This is misleading. Trump has not said he would do this. Ms Harris appears to be referring to Project 2025, a document published by a right-wing research group, the Heritage Foundation.   It outlines policies it would like Trump to implement, including limiting access to some contraceptive pills and ending taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood.  The former president responded on his social media platform Truth Social, saying: “I do not limit access to birth control - that is a lie.” Ms Harris has repeatedly tried to link Project 2025 to Trump but he has distanced himself from it, saying: “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.” However, according to an investigation by CNN, at least 140 former Trump administration officials have been involved in the project.  CLAIM: “Trump tax… would raise prices on middle class families by almost $4,000 a year."" VERDICT: This is based on one estimate of how much Trump's plan to impose tariffs - or taxes - on imported goods might cost US households. Other estimates are smaller.  The ""almost $4,000"" figure comes from analysis by the left-of-centre think tank the Centre for American Progress of Trump’s pledge to increase tariffs on all imported goods to 10-20% and all goods imported from China to 60%. They took the amount the US buys in goods from abroad annually, figured out how much the new taxes on these goods would be and divided this by the number of households in the US. It works out at $4,600 per household, but when you look at “middle income” families you get a figure of $3,900 a year. Other estimates are lower. The Peterson Institute reckons the impact would be closer to $1,700 a year. Trump insists the cost of his tariffs would be felt by foreign countries instead. It is difficult to assess the exact impact of these taxes but studies, on previous tariffs, have suggested that some of the cost was passed on to American businesses and consumers.  CLAIM: ""Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign. So he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal."" VERDICT: Trump did publicly call for Republicans to vote against the Biden administration's immigration bill and took credit when it failed. The immigration bill aimed to tighten asylum standards, increase spending on Border Patrol, and allow for the automatic closure of the southern border to illegal crossings if a certain daily threshold was reached. The majority of lawmakers in the US Senate opposed the proposed measures. Trump did not have a vote, but he did call for his Republican lawmakers to oppose it. Trump said the bill was “horrendous” as he thought it was not tough enough on immigration. At a Fox News event in February 2024, he said he was against the deal as passing it would have “made it much better for the opposing side”. The bill was blocked in the Senate for a second time in May. CLAIM: “Trump … threatened to abandon Nato.” VERDICT: This is true. Trump did threaten to leave the alliance. He has also said the US will remain a member as long as European allies increase their defence spending. As president, Trump recalled saying “yes, I will leave you” when asked whether the US would quit Nato if other members didn’t commit to more defence spending. In an interview with GB News earlier this year, he said that the US under his watch would be “100%” committed to Nato as long as European members paid their ""fair share"" of defence costs. During his time in office, Trump did put “tough demands” on Nato members to meet their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defence, according to Rose Gottemoeller, who was Nato deputy secretary general during Trump’s presidency. In 2016, the year Trump was elected, five countries were spending 2% or more of their GDP on defence. That increased to nine by 2020, the year Biden was elected. And it has now gone up to 23 countries, according to Nato’s 2024 estimates. Additional reporting by Joseph Cassidy & Gerry Georgieva. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86ljyv38vxo,"What to know about US election hacking, Iran and other countries","The vote will have major global implications, meaning many nations have an incentive to interfere.",16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:12.328395,China News,BBC,China,"The recent claim by Donald Trump's campaign that they were hacked by Iran is one sign that foreign interference may become a prominent issue in this year's US election. The election result will have major implications around the world, meaning many countries have an incentive to try and interfere to either support a particular candidate or just to destabilise America.  And the nature of America’s open democracy and media, coupled with new forms of technology, provides many potential avenues to try and shape the eventual outcome. “Our adversaries do look at American elections as points to try to influence, to try to undermine confidence in our democracy, to try to put their thumb on the scale,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last month. “We are clear eyed about that. And we are doing a lot to push back against it"". So who might be trying to interfere? Three countries are most widely cited: Iran, Russia and China. “Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,” US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in July.  The Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran, although it has not been confirmed that an offer of stolen campaign documents to news outlets was definitely linked to this. Microsoft recently said it had seen ""the emergence of significant influence activity"" by groups linked to Iran, and Google has said Iranian hackers targeted the Biden campaign (before he dropped out of the race) as well as that of Donald Trump. The assessment is that the Iranians are more likely to be opposed to a return of Trump to the White House.  He and his advisers are seen as more hawkish in their rhetoric as well as in their past actions, which include pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and killing top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.  On social media, Iran has also been accused of stoking tensions over Gaza. “Russia remains the predominant threat to US elections,” according to the most recent assessment by US intelligence.  But so far it has been less visible than Iran. Russia has a long track record of using what it calls ""active measures"" to influence public opinion back through the Cold War.  And in 2016, the US was caught largely unaware by a Russian operation which saw the Democratic Party as well as Hillary Clinton's campaign operatives have their emails hacked and then leaked. Russian hackers – likely from both the foreign intelligence agency the SVR and the military intelligence agency the GRU – are among the most skilled and may try to compromise accounts.  Russian social media campaigns have also moved on from 2016 when fake profiles were used to organise real-world demonstrations against Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Moscow is thought to be outsourcing some efforts to commercial firms in order to distance itself and look for more effective ways of reaching audiences. If Moscow does get involved, security analysts believe it it would most likely be to favour Trump. The former president has been more friendly to Moscow and more critical of the NATO defence alliance. Russia's Vladimir Putin recently denied he was backing Trump, but even that was seen as a diversionary tactic. China is the wildcard in terms of interference.  It has hacked US campaigns to gather intelligence all the way back to 2008. But it tends to be less active than the other two in trying to influence a particular result. US intelligence currently believe it ""probably does not plan to influence the outcome"" of the election. There is also less confidence as to who China’s preferred candidate might be should it decide to do anything.  Donald Trump can be unpredictable and confrontational with Beijing but is less likely to continue the Biden administration’s policy of building a web of alliances, which has worried Beijing.  Beijing may also be wary of antagonising the US at this point by being seen to interfere, something neither Iran nor Russia worry so much about. But China is accused of trying to target candidates at a local or congressional level because of their backgrounds or positions on issues of concern to China. In the 2022 mid-terms it was assessed of doing so in a handful of races involving both Democrats and Republicans. All three countries have consistently denied carrying out election interference operations. Back in 2016, material hacked by Russia received extensive media coverage. But that seems to have changed now with media outlets more cautious about giving prominence to stolen data.  And there there are more people now looking for influence operations as well as improved cybersecurity defences around campaigns. But despite this, the challenge has evolved. One complexity is that it can be harder to disentangle foreign interference from domestic free speech. Some countries may use Americans to seed or spread their messages. Sometimes those Americans will be willing collaborators, but sometimes they will be unwitting, perhaps even engaged to write for websites which they do not know work for Moscow or someone else. And there are new worries because there has been a step change in the technology on offer to those seeking to interfere thanks to artificial intelligence and deepfakes. These potentially allow more tailored approaches to individuals over social media, and the creation of more convincing faked content. This could lead people to doubt what is real and what is not.  However, in other elections around the world this year, the general consensus is that these techniques have not been deployed as much as some feared.  But America’s election is by far the most consequential globally (and also likely a tight race) meaning new techniques might be deployed for the first time. And given the political atmosphere this time is more combustible and polarised than in the past. A further risk, too, is that even the claim that there has been foreign interference can be politicised and used to cast doubt on an election result. "

The birth is a ""true rarity"" as their mother is the oldest giant panda on record to give birth for the first time. Ying Ying delivered the cubs on Thursday, one day before her 19th birthday. If she were a human, she would be the equivalent of a 57-year-old. A photo of the twins - a male and a female - has received over a thousand congratulatory comments on Facebook. The cubs are currently ""very fragile and need time to stabilise"" under 24-hour intensive care, according to their caretakers. ""We are all looking forward to meet the giant panda cubs. Please wait a few months patiently to make their debut and officially meet everyone!"" Ocean Park Hong Kong said. Of Ying Ying's twins, the female cub appears to be more fragile because her body temperature is lower and her cries are weaker compared to her brother, the park operator said. She weighs just 122g. Ying Ying was ""understandably nervous"" during birth and spent most of the time lying and twisting on the ground, Ocean Park said. Giant pandas are notoriously reluctant to mate. Ying Ying and the twins' father, Le Le, have been housed at Ocean Park since 2007, when they were gifted to Hong Kong by Beijing. They mated successfully in March. China's long-term conservation effort has reversed the population decline of giant pandas. They are now considered a vulnerable species and no longer endangered. Aside from serving as theme park attractions, pandas have also figured in China's diplomatic efforts. "

Lecanemab has been licensed for use in Great Britain by the medicines regulator, the MHRA, which means it can be prescribed privately. In trials, the drug was shown to slow cognitive decline by about a quarter in patients in the early stages of Alzheimer’s over the course of 18 months.   But in draft guidance, NICE said there was a significant cost to the treatment including intensive monitoring for side effects and fortnightly trips to hospital for patients. Alzheimer’s Research UK said it was ""a bittersweet moment"".   ""The approval of lecanemab is a milestone moment but the decision by NICE not to approve it for the NHS is deeply disappointing,” said head of policy, David Thomas. Dr Samantha Roberts, chief executive of NICE, said the body had rigorously evaluated the available evidence, including the benefit for carers, but could only recommend treatments that ""offer good value to the taxpayer”. “Lecanemab provides on average four to six months' slowing in the rate of progression from mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, but this is just not enough benefit to justify the additional cost to the NHS,” said Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE. A final decision by NICE will come towards the end of the year following a public consultation. About 70,000 adults in England would have been eligible for treatment with lecanemab. Wales and Northern Ireland often follow medical guidance in England. The body which assesses newly licensed medicines in Scotland has not yet made a decision on the value of the drug. NHS England said a dedicated team was looking at 27 other Alzheimer's drugs currently in advanced trials that could be approved in the coming years. Lecanemab works by clearing a rogue protein called amyloid, which builds up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. It is given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks. Alzheimer’s researchers hailed the trial results as historic because no previous drug had convincingly shown that the underlying mechanism of the disease could be slowed. However, there were concerns over the frequent occurrence of what are known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) which show up in MRI scans, such as small brain bleeds and temporary swelling.   Although most of these in trials were mild or without symptoms, in some cases participants required hospital treatment. No price for the drug has been publicly announced in the UK, but in the US it costs about £20,000 per patient per year.  Fiona Carragher, of the Alzheimer’s Society, told BBC News the decision would ""lead to uncertainty and confusion for the nearly one million people living with dementia"".  Although the MHRA has approved the drug in Great Britain - England, Wales and Scotland - it has set out some restrictions on patients who can receive it because of the risk of side effects. People who carry two copies of the apolipoprotein E4 gene (ApoE4), about 15% of those diagnosed with Alzheimer's, will not be eligible, nor will those who are on blood thinners. Lecanemab, whose brand name is Leqembi, has already been approved in the US, Japan and China.  But last month the European Medicines Agency (EMA) rejected a licence, saying that the benefits were small and did not counterbalance the risk of serious side effects, especially bleeding and swelling in the brain. In order to assess a patient’s eligibility for lecanemab they have to have the levels of amyloid in their brain measured. This is done either via a PET brain scan or by having a lumbar puncture.   Neither of these is a standard diagnostic tool for patients with suspected dementia and they are used only in research settings. It has been estimated that only 2% of Alzheimer’s patients have access to one of these ""gold standard"" diagnostic methods. Mavis Guinn, 90, is one of only a few dozen people in the UK receiving lecanemab as part of a clinical trial. Her husband Rodney says it has enabled Mavis to keep her personality. ""We've had some wonderful years since you came on this drug and some great times,"" he tells her. ""And I’m grateful for it too, my goodness, because it’s making a difference to your life isn’t it,"" Mavis says. She receives the drug every two weeks by infusion, but her short-term memory remains badly affected.  The benefits of lecanemab are modest - indeed some argue they are barely noticeable. Then there are the potential side effects.   Yet many in the field regard this as a key moment, showing that Alzheimer’s is not unstoppable. Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, which is the leading cause of death in the UK. The BBC’s Panorama followed patients on lecanemab and another new drug, donanemab.   In the programme, broadcast early this year, Prof Cath Mummery, consultant neurologist and head of clinical trials at the Dementia Research Centre, University College London, said although the benefits of the drugs were small, they represented a turning point. ""For the first time, we've got drugs that show that you can alter the course of Alzheimer’s disease, and that's an extraordinary thing."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdeyz89rwdro,Will sorry save Robertson after Israeli meeting?,BBC Scotland's Lynsey Bews considers the political fallout of the Scottish government's meeting with Israel's ambassador to the UK.,20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:12.704575,China News,BBC,China,"Just over a week ago, the Israeli deputy ambassador to the UK posted a photograph on social media that sparked fury within the SNP. Daniela Grudsky smiled as she posed with Scotland's external affairs secretary. She thanked Angus Robertson for ""welcoming us to wonderful Scotland"", adding that she was ""looking forward to cooperating in the fields of technology, culture and renewable energy"". This, to many both inside and outside the party, was an outrage. SNP politicians had spent months pushing their position on Gaza - pressing for an immediate ceasefire, an end of arms sales to Israel, and the recognition of the Palestinian state. They had urged others to ""find their moral compass"", and yet here was a senior member of the Scottish government discussing areas of ""mutual interest"" with a representative of the Israeli administration. Criticism has been widespread inside the party, and expressed both publicly and privately at all levels. From grassroots members, to MSPs, MPs, former - and even current - ministers. For some, the decision to take the meeting at all was wrong. Others accept - as Mr Robertson argues - that this was an opportunity to put the government's views directly to the Israelis. However, they were concerned about the scope of the discussions, and the notion there could be any cooperation between the two countries. Certainly there has been immense pressure on the Scottish government to explain itself. And its handling of the row has undoutedly prolonged it. For more than a week after the deputy ambassador's post, the criticism grew. The first minister had intervened, acknowledging the anger but doubling down on the decision to take the meeting. But questions remained over just how robust Mr Robertson had been in his condemnation of Israel's conduct. Comments from the SNP backbench MSP John Mason - who held his own meeting with the deputy ambassador  - that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza resulted in him being suspended from the party, and only served to heighten things. While the anger was certainly palpable, there was no sense in government that Mr Robertson's position was becoming untenable. It was clear however that he would need to speak out. And so came an apology for not limiting the talks to a call for an immediate ceasefire, with confirmation no further meetings would take place until the situation in Gaza changes. It was an attempt to get on the front foot ahead of the SNP's conference at the end of this month - to be contrite and to take the heat out of what was becoming an increasingly public backlash. So will it be enough? Mr Robertson says he has not considered quitting his ministerial post. And, given he has the backing of the first minister, it would seem unlikely he's going anywhere soon. Former First Minister Humza Yousaf, who was praised for his own handling of the Gaza issue, said Mr Robertson had ""clearly listened and reflected on the anger and upset"". Aside from the Scottish Greens, most of that anger has come from within his own party, so the external affairs secretary is unlikely to come under cross-party pressure when Holyrood returns in September. Labour doesn't have its own troubles to seek when it comes to Gaza, with Sir Keir Starmer facing protests during a recent visit to Scotland for his handling of the issue. To criticise the Scottish government would leave it open to accusations of hypocrisy. The Conservatives have also stayed out of the row. Indeed Scottish Tory leadership hopeful Russell Findlay said he would also have taken the meeting. It's not the first time Mr Robertson has faced criticism over his handling of his brief. A visit to China last year to promote business and tourism was called into question by one of the SNP's MPs, given the country's human rights record. Some argue that engaging with those who you don't agree with is part and parcel of diplomacy - all part of the external affairs secretary's job. However, sensitivities around the politics of the Middle East are such that some won't be satisfied with a pledge of no further meetings with the Israelis. And Mr Robertson might find the criticism from this particular incident difficult to shake off. The party conference could be another flashpoint, with one SNP branch reportedly planning to put pressure on him with a condemnatory motion. It's unclear whether it will reach the conference floor, but at a time when the SNP leadership wants to unite its party, it will be keen to move on from another issue that has caused further division."

MAGA War Room, an influential X account supporting Donald Trump, unearthed a 2016 video in which Mr Walz told the farming policy outlet Agri-Pulse that the US and China did not need to have an ""adversarial relationship"". But what does the record show? Republicans may want to weaponise Mr Walz's links to China, but it's pretty slim pickings. Mr Walz's personal relationship with China does indeed extend back decades.  It began in 1989 when, fresh out of college, Mr Walz began a Harvard University volunteer programme teaching American history and English at the Foshan No 1 High School in southern China. He later set up a business with his wife Gwen organising annual summer educational trips to China. The venture lasted more than a decade and by his own estimation, Mr Walz returned to the country around 30 times.  But if anything, Mr Walz has been pretty hawkish towards its government, particularly on human rights. As a congressman, he met the Dalai Lama and – before his jailing – the high-profile Hong Kong democracy activist, Joshua Wong. Both men would place at the top of the Chinese government’s list of public enemies. In terms of his congressional record, there is not much for China to like. He spent over a decade on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China – a body focused on scrutinising the Chinese government’s human rights abuses. In 2016, the same year he met the Dalai Lama, he also invited the then leader of Tibet's government in exile, Lobsang Sangay, into his congressional office to meet a group of Minnesota high-schoolers. Mr Walz lent his strong backing to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which imposed sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials for human rights abuses during the city's democracy protests. Jeffrey Ngo, a democracy activist now based in the US, has praised Mr Walz's commitment to getting the legislation passed in 2019. ""We knocked on every door when the #HKHRDA lacked momentum,"" he wrote on X after Mr Walz was confirmed as the Harris VP choice. ""Only Walz answered his.""  Mr Ngo praised Mr Walz as ""the sole House Democrat willing to keep co-sponsoring the bill"". Republican Chris Smith was the bill's other sponsor. Mr Walz's elevation to the Democratic ticket has prompted interest on Chinese social media. He once described his decision to teach in China as ""one of the best things I've ever done"", and there were signs of hope in some of the comments that, if he wins, it may signal better US-China ties. One Weibo user pointed out that Walz's ""unique background gives him a real perspective on China"", and he could ""promote cultural exchanges when... relations are extremely difficult"". But others wondered whether that may be assuming too much. The fact that his teaching posting took place in 1989 - the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing - was not lost on some. The Chinese cannot say much about the massacre for risk of getting censored. They refer to it obliquely - one comment simply said ""if you know, you know"". Foreigners who were in China at that time ""are the most anti-China"", said another user. Indeed, Mr Walz has often spoken publicly about his horror at the crushing of the Tiananmen protests, and in 2009 he co-sponsored a resolution in Congress marking its 20th anniversary. His wife Gwen has said that the events had such an effect on Walz, that he chose 4 June - the day Beijing sent the troops in - as the date of their wedding five years later. She said that ""he wanted to have a date he'll always remember"". For more than two decades after Tiananmen, America's foreign policy was founded on a deep, bipartisan agreement that trade and engagement with China was broadly a good thing. It is no surprise that evidence can be found of Mr Walz expressing views that align with that consensus. On the flip side, Donald Trump's own-brand suits and ties were made in China, and he and his daughter Ivanka registered dozens of trademarks there. Far from being pro-China, Mr Walz's record marks him out as someone who has taken a more nuanced view.  He has spoken of the need for dialogue and cooperation on issues such as trade and climate change - but remains fiercely critical when it comes to human rights. That stance was in evidence from the very start of the relationship. When returning to Nebraska after his year in China, he told a local newspaper that there were ""no limits"" to what the Chinese could accomplish. ""If they had proper leadership,"" he added."

Chinese social media users have been discussing how Mr Walz spent a year teaching in the south-eastern province of Guangdong in 1989 - a topic that was trending on Weibo with 12 million views. He and his wife, fellow teacher Gwen Whipple, later honeymooned in the country. Mr Walz once described his decision to teach in China as ""one of the best things I've ever done"". The 60-year-old Minnesota governor was a history teacher and football coach before he joined politics. He was fresh out of college when he moved to China to teach English and American history at a high school. The fact that it happened in 1989 - the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre - was not lost on those commenting on Chinese social media. On 4 June that year, Chinese tanks rolled into Beijing's central square, where hundreds of thousands had gathered demanding political reforms. The day ended in bloodshed and to this day it is unclear exactly how many died. Some estimates put the death toll upwards of 10,000. Chinese social media users cannot say much about 1989 or risk getting censored. They refer to it obliquely - one comment simply said ""If you know, you know"". Foreigners who were in China at that time ""are the most anti-China"", said one user. Others pointed out that China in 1989 was a vastly different country. It was well before China became the world's largest manufacturing hub, then its second-largest economy and finally, a powerful US rival. ""This candidate was in China at a very different time. The atmosphere was very different,"" one comment read. And yet they hoped that if he wins, he may signal better US-China ties. The two countries have been at loggerheads on trade, advanced technology, and China's geopolitical ambitions. One Weibo user pointed out that Mr Walz's ""unique background gives him a real perspective on China"", and he could ""promote cultural exchanges between China and the United States at a time when... relations are extremely difficult"". Back then, Mr Walz spent a year teaching at the Foshan No 1 High School under a Harvard University volunteer programme.  When he returned to the US, he told a local newspaper that there were ""no limits"" on what the Chinese could accomplish ""if they had proper leadership"". ""They are such kind, generous, capable people,"" he said. Mr Walz and his wife were married on 4 June 1994 - the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen uprising. She said in an interview that ""he wanted to have a date he'll always remember"". The couple then started a business which organised summer educational trips to China for US students. There hasn't been much official reaction yet from the Republicans to Mr Walz's time in China. But some allies of Trump have said Mr Walz's nomination would be welcomed in China, although Beijing has not commented on it. ""Communist China is very happy with @GovTimWalz as Kamala’s VP pick,"" Richard Grenell, a former acting director of National Intelligence in the previous Trump administration, said on X."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3wzkx8k8o,North Korea to reopen for tourism after five years,Two China-based tour operators say tourists will soon be allowed to visit Samjiyon city in the north.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:12.984237,China News,BBC,China,"North Korea will reopen one city to foreign tourists in December after nearly five years of border closures due to the Covid pandemic, according to tour operators. At least two China-based operators announced that tourists will soon be allowed to visit the mountainous northern city of Samjiyon. Reclusive North Korea sealed itself off at the start of the pandemic in early 2020, and started to scale back restrictions only in the middle of last year. The border closures also cut off imports of essential goods, leading to food shortages that were made worse by international sanctions because of the country's nuclear programme. ""So far just Samjiyon has been officially confirmed but we think that Pyongyang and other places will open too!!!"" Shenyang's KTG Tours wrote on its Facebook page on Wednesday. Beijing's Koryo Tour said tourists could ""potentially"" visit other parts of North Korea in December. ""Having waited for over four years to make this announcement, Koryo Tours is very excited for the opening of North Korean tourism once again,"" it said Wednesday on its website.  Koryo Tours told the BBC that the North Korean authorities were allowing tourists from any country to join the trips, apart from South Korea. However, the US bans its citizens from travelling to North Korea. Chad O'Carroll, CEO of US-based analysis firm Korea Risk Group, flagged doubts around the reopening announcement. ""I will believe it when I see it,"" he told the BBC. ""For now, I am quite sceptical we will see any real movement in December."" Samjiyon has been undergoing major redevelopment in recent years, with Mr Kim revealing plans in July to rebuild its airport, convert a military ski base into a resort, and build new railways and hotels for foreign tourists, according to state media. Mr Kim said at the time that plans to “revitalise international tourism” would be aimed at visitors from “friendly” nations. Mr O'Carroll pointed out, however, that Samjiyong's redevelopment is incomplete. ""If it does get completed in time, I can imagine only Russian tourists and possibly Chinese visiting in any real numbers at first,"" he said. ""Unless [the Democratic Republic of Korea] offers direct Samjiyon flights to a neutral connection country like Mongolia."" Samjiyon lies on the foot of North Korea's tallest mountain Paektu, which straddles the China-North Korea border, and is known for its winter attractions. Pyongyang's propaganda says the mountain is where North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung battled Japanese occupation forces and launched the revolution. He is the grandfather of current president Kim Jong Un. It also claims Paektu is where the incumbent's father, Kim Jong Il, was born. KCNA reported in July that the Mount Paektu-Samjiyon zone was envisioned to be a “four-season mountainous tourist area to meet the cultural and emotional needs of the people on the highest level and revitalise international tourism.” North Korea has only allowed Russian tourists to enter the country since early 2024, amid warming ties between the two nations. It was only in August last year that North Korea allowed the return of citizens who were locked out because of border controls, one of the last few countries to do so."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240820-eight-of-the-worlds-most-extraordinary-tiny-hotel-rooms,The world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms,"From upcycled sewer pipes to spheres suspended in the sky, capsule hotels have been reinvented for a new generation of travellers.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:17.496083,China News,BBC,China,"From Colombia's upcycled sewer pipes to spheres suspended in the sky in Canada, capsule hotels have been reinvented for a new generation of travellers. By night, the world's first capsule hotel (founded in Osaka, Japan in 1979) must have looked like a morgue, with neat rows of narrow sleeping capsules each containing a recumbent body. But the following day, the occupants – mostly businessmen who had worked late - would rise up and head back to the office, grateful for this efficient sleep solution that had saved them a commute home in the early hours.   As the concept spread, tourists happy to sleep in a room no bigger than its bed began to bunk up alongside them, eager to sample this unusual aspect of Japanese culture. Fast-forward to today, and high hotel room rates, fuelled by years of rising real estate prices, have supercharged this typically low-cost concept, which offers budget travellers priced out of traditional hotels more privacy than a hostel dormitory and more comfort and connectivity than camping. The capsules, which are predominantly single-occupancy, also answer the current boom in solo travel, with single-sex capsule hotels providing additional security. With the global capsule hotel market projected to reach $327m by 2031, curious hybrids have emerged to sustain the trend and attract new customers. They're tempting the TikTok generation with increasingly outlandish forms, from upcycled sewer pipes in the Colombian desert to space-age pods with a dashboard of ambient controls in downtown Sydney, Australia – all promising a unique experience and shareable stories for social media. Meanwhile capsule-cum-bookstores invite book lovers to snooze among the shelves, and boutique versions bring luxury to a traditionally no-frills market with fancy decor or promises of fluffy duck-feather duvets. As the concept continues to reinvent itself, here are eight of the most extraordinary examples. Nine Hours, a chain of 13 hotels across Japan, from Fukuoka in the west to the north-east island of Hokkaido, has an unusual by-product: sleep data. In the Shinagawa Station (men only) and Akasaka branches, guests can sign up for a ""9h sleep fitscan"" service, where sensors detect everything from breathing to facial expressions to generate a sleep report that tracks their heart rate, identifies sleep apnea and even monitors snoring. In a sector where a novel or low-budget stay is often prioritised over comfort, Nine Hours' interest in how well its guests are sleeping sets it apart. Across the franchise, the white, minimalist decor continues this clinical theme, while its rows of sleek, shiny sleeping pods would not look out of place on the set of a science-fiction movie. The name refers to the hotel's cost-cutting concept that reduces room rental to the essential nine hours, allowing seven hours for sleep and an hour on either side for washing and dressing. Just need a nap? Hourly rates are also available. A night in a transparent sleeping pod clinging to a cliff face above Peru's Sacred Valley is not everyone's idea of a relaxing stay, but for adrenaline-lovers, it's hard to beat – not least for the incredible 300-degree views of the surrounding mountains and the formidable condors that inhabit them. A near-vertical climb of 400m is the only way to reach the Skylodge Adventure Suites, but climbing experience is not necessary – only good health and a head for heights – and descending is speedier thanks to a series of zip wires. Each capsule includes a private bathroom ensuring that night trips to the toilet are not life-threatening, and when the sun rises, you can enjoy a cup of tea on your private deck. Looking for a little more luxury? A little further down the Urubamba river, sister site, Starlodge, adds hillside hot tubs to the capsule hotel experience. The Tubo Hotel, La Tatacoa is just a 10-minute drive from Colombia's second-largest desert, the eponymous Tatacoa, famous for its clear starry skies. When you've taken in the giant cacti and curious rock formations of the Tatacoa's cinnamon-coloured sands, this rainbow of tiny, air-conditioned rooms with a shared swimming pool offers a welcome oasis. The 37 capsules are fashioned from concrete sewer pipes painted in candy colours, providing just enough room for a double bed. Almost half of the rooms have a shared bathroom, but the room rate is a snip and you've a shady garden, bar and restaurant on your doorstep. ""This innovative and colourful place offers you a unique experience,"" says Ambar Quintana, the hotel's administrator. ""It has everything you need to rest in a natural environment of fresh air and vegetation."" Suspended among the conifers like oversized Christmas baubles, the Free Spirit Spheres on Vancouver Island, Canada, feel ""like you are floating in the canopy among the sleeping birds"", according to owner Tom Chudleigh. The first sphere was introduced 25 years ago, driven by a desire to promote ecotourism and preserve Canada's ancient forests. More like this: • The UK's five most beautiful national parks • The best travel photographs from around the globe • The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world There are currently three spheres, each based on the principle of biomimicry and shaped with a giant seed pod or nutshell in mind: light but with a strong shell. ""Eryn"" is fashioned from Sitka spruce and has a dining area, sink and slightly undersized double bed inside; while more recent additions, ""Melody"" and ""Luna"", are fibreglass and have similar amenities but with full-size double beds that can be stowed. Each sphere is accessed via a spiral staircase wrapped around a tree, and is available to rent in temperatures as low as -20C, when even a trip to the composting toilet at the accommodation's base will feel intrepid. The shape makes bespoke fittings a prerequisite, and every little detail has been meticulously crafted by Chudleigh, from walnut fold-out furniture that maximises the space, to door handles cast from bronze. Inside a Brutalist building in Singapore's Chinatown lies a surprisingly serene interior. Opened in 2021 and based on an aesthetic it describes as ""soft minimalist"", KINN Capsule offers a Zen take on the capsule concept with walls painted in calming peachy tones and pale wood sleeping chambers fitted with crisp white bed linen. Even the smell of the place seems an antidote to its urban location as a special house fragrance designed to evoke the wildflowers of a Nordic forest hangs in the air. There are 72 capsules in total, sealed off with blackout blinds and spread across seven rooms, but the vibe is more boutique than bunkhouse. A traditional mud and wood farmhouse in eastern China's Zhejiang Province got a prize-winning makeover in 2019 when it reopened as a capsule hostel, bookstore and community library, sleeping 20 in tiny single bed-sized compartments concealed between bookshelves made of local bamboo. A smattering of small landings are connected by zigzagging stairways that recall the serpentine paths of the surrounding forests of Tonglu. It's hard to know which is more dramatic: the remote building's transparent floor-to-ceiling panels that light it up like a cathedral at night, or the lush mountainous scenery that's visible through them. In Oud Zuid, one of Amsterdam's most upscale neighbourhoods, guests are paying to sleep in cupboards. The quirky De Bedstee Hotel draws on the 17th-Century tradition of the Dutch bedstee (box bed), a bed concealed behind cupboard doors to create a cosy sleeping nook. The hotel's Art Deco features and acid-coloured wallpapers downstairs give way to a shabby-chic design in the first-floor dormitories, where the bedstee windows are framed by red gingham curtains and little wooden ladders lead to the capsules above. Relax in the hotel's small terrace garden or take a half-hour stroll to the Rembrandt House Museum in the city centre to see several historic box beds in situ. Another hotel with a signature smell is the Resol Poshtel in Tokyo's Asakusa district – the Resol Hotel chain's first venture into capsule sleeping. The aroma, which includes orange, chamomile and neroli, is said to induce ""a feeling of gentle calm"" – of benefit, perhaps, given the communal sleeping arrangements. At bedtime, there's nothing but a curtain between you and fellow visitors, but few one-star establishments can match this hotel's cleanliness and functionality, with hairbrushes, slippers and razors included in the freebies. The Edo-era styling − such as the sleeping cubicles' arched entrance reminiscent of tea ceremony rooms, and the traditional Japanese murals surrounding the bed − add a hint of heritage to the hotel's modern lines. The city's oldest Buddhist temple, Sensō-ji, is a five-minute walk away, as is the lantern-lined Nakamise-dori street, home to a parade of colourful shops selling souvenirs and street food. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce4qp5ny0eeo,'Our gold medals are squeaky clean' - China slams doping doubts,The team's medals were received with doubts from their peers from other countries at Paris 2024.,6 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:17.586100,China News,BBC,China,"""Any doubt is just a joke. Stress only makes us stronger,"" Qin Haiyang - a part of China's history-making men’s 4x100m medley quartet posted after their unprecedented victory over the US on Monday.  Qin's seeming defiance came at the tail end of what has been a challenging time for China in the pool.  Some of the country's top swimmers - including Qin and his relay teammate Sun Jiajun- have faced a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) was covering it up.  They were among 23 Chinese swimmers who returned positive doping tests ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. And although Chinese swimmers have been drug-tested twice as much as some other nations this year before heading to Paris, their performance has been met with scepticism. After the medley event on Monday, Team GB's Adam Peaty opened fire on the Chinese team, saying ""there's no point winning if you're not winning fair"". Swim legend Michael Phelps, who has been vocal about doping issues, also doubled down: ""If you test positive, you should never be allowed to come back and compete again, cut and dry. I believe one and done,"" he told the Associated Press news agency. To the Chinese swimming team and their millions of fans back home, however, the historic victory brought joy and vindication.  The hashtag ""China wins gold medal at 4x100m medley relay"" was viewed 760 million times on Weibo. One comment racked up more than 8,000 likes on Weibo: ""China's gold medals are squeaky clean, we won it with our competence!""  ""It's been so hard for the Chinese swimming team,"" read another top comment.  The immense pressure the team has been under was reflected in comments by China's new breakout star Pan Zhanle, who swam the crucial anchor leg of the relay, and also won the men's 100m freestyle final, setting a new world record.  After his win last week, Pan, who was not among those who tested positive for doping, told Chinese media that he felt that the whole team was ""looked down on"" by some foreign swimmers. He also said that Australia's Kyle Chalmers had snubbed him when he tried to say hello - which Chalmers denied.   Pan's record-breaking swim was questioned by former Australian Olympic swimmer Brett Hawke who posted on Instagram that it's not ""humanly possible to beat that field"". It wasn't the first comment of its kind. German athlete Angelina Köhler cast doubt on Zhang Yufei's bronze win in the women's 100m butterfly -  she too was among the 23 who had tested positive in 2021.  Afte the swim, Köhler, who did not make the podium, reportedly told media that ""stories like that always have a bad flavour"",  Zhang, who won a silver and five bronzes in Paris, was defiant.  ""Why should Chinese swimmers be questioned when they swim fast? Why did no one dare to question USA's Michael Phelps when he got eight gold medals?"" she asked in a press conference. The tension has spilled beyond the pool. China's anti-doping agency (Chinada) released a statement on Tuesday, accusing its US counterpart Usada of displaying double standards.  The press release highlighted the case of US sprinter Erriyon Knighton, a world silver medallist who is competing in the men's 200m sprint this week. He was not suspended after testing positive for the banned substance trenbolone earlier this year. Like in the case of the Chinese swimmers, the arbitrator had found the result was likely caused by contaminated meat. Chinese fans, meanwhile, have been reacting furiously, to the accusations against the country's swimmers.    Adam Peaty's Instagram account was flooded with angry comments - even his girlfriend's account was not spared.  ""Curious why you're only attacking China but none of the other countries that won ahead of you... pretty weird,"" a top comment under Peaty's most recent post reads.  Following a barrage of critcism from Chinese fans,  Brett Hawke, the former Olympic swimmer who is now a coach, deleted the video he had posted about Pan. He also limited comments on his posts.  And a recent post about the men's medley results says: ""Chinese men are victorious!"""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx6ld55xnzo,Clean Bandit: We were told to stop making pop music,"After four billion streams, the band were pushed to change direction. Here's what happened next.",21 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:17.672771,China News,BBC,China,"Discovering a signature sound is the holy grail of pop music. There’s no Pink Floyd without David Gilmour’s sweeping guitar lines. Remove Dr Dre's incendiary production, and NWA's lyrics lose some of their potency. Billie Eilish’s vocal delivery is so distinctive she can jump between genres without losing her essence. For Clean Bandit, their signature sound is a simple, but effective, mixture of chamber music and dance beats. It’s a formula they came up with at university. Cellist Grace Chatto was dating architecture student Jack Patterson, who started splicing samples of her string quartet into his instrumentals. It wasn’t exactly a new idea. In 1976, Walter Murphy turned Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 into a thumping disco track; and in 1995, Madonna's producer William Orbit made an album, Pieces In A Modern Style, that took Ravel, Vivaldi and Handel to an all-night rave. But Clean Bandit weren’t interested in remixes. They wrote big pop hits like Solo and Rockabye, using their classical chops to give the songs emotional heft. “It’s a delicate balance,” says Patterson. “If you added a sax solo, for example, it’d be one element too far. You might as well put on a waistcoat and go home.” But when it works, it works. Clean Bandit’s trademark sound earned them four UK number one singles, two Ivor Novello songwriting awards and a Grammy.  Then, with grim inevitability, their record label told them to ditch it. “There was a push for us to stop having strings in our music,” grimaces Chatto. “We were told to stop making pop music, as well,” says Patterson. “We were sent dance music playlists on Spotify and told ‘your music has to sit on here - only Harry Styles can make pop music’.”  Part of the concern was that the band are, in their own words, “shy and unassuming people”.  Their songs are fronted by pop titans from Demi Lovato and Ellie Goulding to Charli XCX and Lizzo - but the trio (completed by Jack's brother Luke) can still catch the Tube without being bothered. “We were told ‘you don’t have a face, you need to make club music',” recalls Patterson. The demands were so frequent and insistent that the band began to mistrust their instincts. They erased the violins and went for a darker sound, more indebted to house than pop. It did not go well: Since 2020, none of their records has made the top 10.   “We allowed it to happen because we were like, ‘We'd rather release something than nothing’,” says Chatto. “But the music didn’t feel like our music. Our fans were feeling it. We were feeling it.  ""In the end, we were like, what's the point in doing anything?’ Eventually, they negotiated an “amicable” exit from Atlantic Records that allowed them to retain the rights to all of their unreleased songs. “It couldn’t have ended in a better way,” says Chatto.  “We’re still friends with those people... I just think the more success we had, the more pressure they felt. Their jobs were on the line.” The band jumped over to the Sony Music label B1/Ministry of Sound, whose head honcho is Wolfgang Boss - one of the first people to champion Clean Bandit back in the 2010s. He encouraged them to release Cry Baby – a collaboration with Anne-Marie and David Guetta that they’d been sitting on for four years after Atlantic rejected it. From the opening bars, it’s undeniably a Clean Bandit song. Chatto whistles a Spaghetti Western hook over sweeping strings, before Anne-Marie delivers a salty lyric about a cheating boyfriend over a breezy, tropical beat . “It feels like a comeback,” says Chatto. It’s not just the music. The band got back into the habit of directing and filming their own videos - something they’d not done for a couple of years. For Cry Baby, they dreamt up an epic storyline, in which Anne-Marie flees her disloyal partner on a long distance luxury train. But when they brought the storyboards to production companies, they turned it down. “They said it would cost at least a quarter of a million pounds,” says Chatto, “so I ended up producing it myself, which is a first.” That meant commissioning and building the sets at their own expense. Luckily, Chatto’s father is a carpenter, who not only built her first cello, but also happens to work on the London Underground (“It was his idea to put sliding doors on the platform of the Jubilee line,” says Patterson). And so Ricky Chatto found himself constructing a complete dining car and sleeper carriage inside Clean Bandit’s studio in Finsbury Park. “He didn’t realise what we were letting him in for,” laughs Chatto. “We tried about a million different varnishes. It was epic.” Patterson directed and edited the video, which also features a horseback-riding stuntman who dives through a train window; and a near-death experience for David Guetta, after a contraption that was supposed to simulate tears malfunctioned while strapped to his face. Undeterred, the group are planning an even bigger shoot for their next single, which sees them reunite with Swedish pop star Zara Larsson.   “Zara’s been learning to fly helicopters,” reveals Patterson. “So we're devising a story where she works for the RAF search and rescue as a helicopter pilot.” The band seem creatively reinvigorated after a period they politely describe as “pretty challenging”. They have two albums-worth of material ready to go, including unreleased collaborations with Elton John and Raye that may (or may not) see the light of day. They’ve also been spreading their wings, collaborating with artists from South America, Jamaica and Africa on a number of spontaneous sessions earlier this year. Unexpectedly, those sessions were inspired by another teeth-grinding setback the band endured in 2019. It all started when the band signed a deal with a major beer company, who offered to sponsor the band as they travelled to China, Russia, Nepal, India and Vietnam, making new songs with local artists. “They approached us and said ‘you have total creative freedom’,” says Patterson. “As long as you drink a bit of the beer in the studio, we'll pay for it all and film it.” “It felt like it was going to be a really creative thing – but we’d been tricked,” adds Chatto. The penny didn’t drop until their third recording session, when the band were handed a translation of the lyrics by Vietnamese singers JustaTee and Phương Ly. “I was like ‘that’s weird, the chorus says “open to more” again’,” recalls Patterson. It transpired that, although Clean Bandit had been given artistic freedom, the brewery had signed separate contracts with their collaborators, forcing them to use the company’s slogan in their lyrics. ‘We were like, ‘hang on, that’s the Tuborg strapline, why are you writing that in the chorus?’” Patterson recalls. “And they're like, ‘oh, we have to. If we don't do that, we don't get paid’.” The whole experience was a “devastating waste of energy”, he says. The songs essentially vanished, unable to be played on radio stations where they’d be considered in breach of advertising guidelines. But, says Chatto, “it made us realise that if we were doing this on our own terms, it would be a fantastic way to live - just going around the world, making music.” That’s what they did at the start of 2024, with writing sessions in Miami, Lagos and Jamaica that have produced “two entire records” of material. Some of those songs have already come out – including the sublime summer jam Mar Azul, written with Colombian pop group Piso 21. “I hate to keep coming back to it, but our previous label was based in the UK,” says Patterson, “so their priority was always what would work over here. “If it wasn’t going to be played on Capital [Radio], they weren’t interested. “Now, if we work with someone in Mumbai, that’s ok. The fact that we don’t have a singer means we can be light on our feet and work anywhere in the world.” That’s where Clean Bandit see their future: Concentrating on quality, rather than  the demands of streaming algorithms, in the hope their fans will follow them. “That’s the hope,” says Chatto. “Because it’s already been the case that our songs have gone around the world and reached a lot of people.” In other words: There’s no place they’d rather be."

We also answer questions from our readers, on topics ranging from carbon emissions and clean technologies to volcanic activity and the impact of war on climate change. We’ve compiled some of our favourite questions and answers so far below.  If you’re in the UK and want to sign up for the newsletter, you can do that here. If you're outside the UK, sign up here. First and foremost, the war in Ukraine has been a humanitarian disaster. But it has also had implications for the climate. There are extra greenhouse gas emissions associated with war itself, such as warfare materials, fires triggered by the conflict, and rebuilding of destroyed infrastructure. The damage also greatly hampers efforts for Ukraine to prepare itself for extreme weather events, potentially making the impacts of climate change on the country even worse. But there have been consequences for global energy trends too. After Russia invaded in February 2022, energy prices spiked and many Western countries pledged to wean themselves off Russian gas. In some countries this has led to a sharper focus on deploying renewables and reducing reliance on fossil fuels, in a bid to enhance long-term energy security. But to replace gas piped in from Russia in the shorter term, some countries have also begun expanding infrastructure to ship in liquified natural gas from other parts of the world. Liquified natural gas is often far more carbon-intensive than piped gas, because of the energy required to compress the gas into liquid form and transport it. Volcanic eruptions can have significant effects on the global climate. One of the most famous cases is Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which erupted in 1991. It released nearly 20 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere, which formed sulphate aerosols. These tiny particles reflected some of the Sun’s energy back into space, cooling the planet by an estimated 0.5C over the following two years or so. When it comes to long-term warming, human activities are unquestionably to blame. Natural factors such as volcanic eruptions made effectively no difference to global temperatures averaged over the past decade. There has been much speculation about the massive eruption of the underwater Hunga Tonga volcano at the start of 2022. But it is thought that it had at most a minor effect on global temperatures, and certainly cannot explain the record temperatures of 2023. China is currently the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases per year, at nearly 14 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent in 2022.  That is more than double the next highest, the US, at six billion. But when you consider emissions per head of the population, the picture is reversed.  The US emitted 17.7 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per head in 2022, comfortably ahead of China, at 9.8 tonnes. (Actually, countries such as Qatar, which produce large amounts of oil and gas relative to their population size, are at the top of that list.) It is also worth considering historical emissions, as greenhouse gases (especially CO2) stay in the atmosphere for a long time.  Since 1850, the US also comes out on top – responsible for about 17.3% of warming – with China next on 12.7%. The UK is in eighth place on 2.4%. UK emissions of tiny health-harming airborne particles have fallen considerably since the 1970s. But improvements have slowed over the last decade, despite reductions from cars and other sources. The recent increase in wood burning in homes and industry is a key factor in this, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Wood-burning stoves generate much higher levels of particle pollution than a gas boiler or electric heat pump. As wood burns, it releases tiny particles which can stay in the atmosphere for a few days and drift in the wind. This means that wood burning can affect outdoor air quality over large areas. Wood-burning stoves can also worsen air quality within the home, particularly when the stove door is opened. The particle pollution from any given stove can vary significantly though, depending on its design and how it is used. Wet wood is much more polluting than dry wood, for example. Aviation is responsible for roughly 4% of all human-caused warming. Perhaps the most obvious effect on the climate is that burning jet fuel releases planet-warming gases like CO2. Flying generally emits much more CO2 per passenger than train travel, for example. A large proportion of warming from aviation actually comes from the effects of contrails. These are the wispy white lines you might see left behind a plane in the sky, formed as water vapour from jet engines condenses and freezes. There is an aspirational global target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by 2050.  But reducing the climate impact of flying is going to be very difficult. There are currently no widely available alternatives to traditional jet fuels. Aviation groups hope that new, cleaner technologies will come good. But many scientists warn that flying less is the only sure-fire way to get emissions down. Electric vehicle (EV) sales are currently far ahead of hydrogen-powered vehicles. In 2023, around 9.5 million battery electric cars were sold worldwide. The number of hydrogen-powered cars sold was around 1,000 times smaller, and actually fell compared with 2022. Not only are hydrogen cars very expensive, the infrastructure is also lacking. The hydrogen economy is in its very early stages – and most hydrogen production currently comes from fossil fuels, so is not “clean”. While there are clearly challenges of upgrading the electricity grid to cope with demand of EVs – and installing charging points – this is seen as much more realistic, at least in the short-term. Hydrogen might have a role to play in future, for example in heavy-duty vehicles. But the current evidence strongly suggests that EVs will play the main role in decarbonising transport. As for the question about fires, the UK government says there “is no evidence to suggest that fires in EVs are more likely to occur than in petrol or diesel vehicles”. It also says that while “EVs tend to be heavier than equivalent petrol or diesel vehicles, on average passenger cars have been increasing in weight for many years” and that many petrol and diesel cars “are as heavy as EVs”. World population is not as important for global warming as it might initially appear. The real key is the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per person, which varies hugely around the world. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is a region with one of the fastest growing populations - but makes a very small contribution to climate change compared with richer countries like the United States. The disparity in carbon emissions was highlighted by UN Secretary General António Guterres in a major speech earlier this year. “The richest 1% emit as much as [the poorest] two-thirds of humanity,” he said. So tackling high levels of carbon consumption would make a big difference - while still allowing poorer countries to develop and meet their needs. It could mean that global emissions start to fall, even with the world’s population still rising."

China took gold in a thrilling men's 4x100m medley relay race, beating the United States into second and France third, with the British quartet finishing fourth. Two of the four gold medallists, Qin Haiyang and Sun Jiajun, were among the 23 Chinese swimmers who reportedly returned positive doping tests prior to the Tokyo Olympics. They were not banned because the China Anti-Doping Agency determined they had unintentionally ingested the substance because of contamination. ""If you touch and you know that you're cheating, you're not winning, right?"" said Peaty, who has won three gold and three silver medals for Team GB over his Olympics career. ""I don't want to paint a whole nation or group of people with one brush, I think that's very unfair.  ""To the people that need to do their job - wake up and do your job."" Dressel has doping fears over Olympic swimming Details of the China case were first made public by the New York Times in April, which shared reporting with German broadcaster ARD. The positive tests in 2021 were not made public at the time. The World Anti-doping Agency (Wada) said it was ""not in a position to disprove"" the conclusion made by the Chinada and opted not to appeal after consulting independent experts as well as external legal counsel. An independent report has since found Wada did not show bias in its handling of the case and Chinese athletes were drug tested up to twice as much as other athletes in the run up to the Paris Games. In its initial report, the New York Times also said Qin, who won three breaststroke titles at the World Championships last year, had previously tested positive for another substance. Although it did not name Qin, 25, specifically, Wada said the levels were below the current threshold for reporting and came from eating contaminated meat. Peaty, 29, added: ""One of my favourite quotes I've seen lately is that there's no point winning if you're not winning fair. ""I think you know that truth in your heart. ""For me, if you've been on that and you have been contaminated twice, I think as an honourable person you should be out of the sport. But we know sport isn't that simple."" Following the allegations, the row spread as the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) chief executive Travis Tygart suggested a cover-up - a claim Wada rejected as ""completely false and defamatory"". A criminal investigation is under way in the US over the issue, while a different report into World Aquatics' handling of the case also found there was no mismanagement or cover-up. ""We have to have faith in the system but we also don't,"" said Peaty, who lined up with Ollie Morgan, Duncan Scott and Matt Richards. ""The Americans have been very vocal. We didn't want to get distracted with that. ""But I think it's got to be stricter. What I've said from the start is that it's fraud. If you're cheating, it's fraud."" Peaty won silver in the 100m breaststroke individual event last Sunday Peaty was swimming after what he said was the ""worst week"" of his life physically. He tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, a day after taking silver in the 100m breaststroke event. He did not commit to his future in the sport after the relay, but said ""it could have been"" his last swim. ""I don't know what the answer is,"" he added. Elsewhere, the US set a new world record in the women's 4x100m medley relay, beating great rivals Australia into silver to pip them to topping the swimming medal table for most golds. The Americans leave the pool with eight from 28 medals, while Australia end with seven golds and 18 overall. One of those American golds came in the final individual race as Bobby Finke broke the world record to successfully defend his 1500m freestyle title. He led from the gun to win in 14 minutes 30.67 seconds, taking the record held by Sun Yang â the Chinese swimmer who was given an eight-year doping ban in 2020. Ireland's Dan Wiffen took bronze, his second medal of the week after gold in the 800m freestyle. The star of the meet has undoubtedly been Leon Marchand. He was part of the French relay team beaten by China, but the third place means he adds bronze to his haul of four individual golds. Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom completed the freestyle sprint double by adding the 50m title to the 100m crown she won earlier in the meet. Team GB finished with five medals â the 4x200m freestyle relay their only gold, having set a target of beating or equalling the eight medals won in Tokyo at the previous Games. For the first time since 2004, no British women were on the podium. Today's Olympics guide Full Paris Olympics schedule BBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule"

The Earl of Abergavenny sank off the coast of Weymouth, Dorset, with the loss of some 250 lives, in what is considered one of the UK’s worst maritime disasters. It was carrying more than 60 chests of silver bullion that have never been found. John Wordsworth, the brother of renowned Romantic poet William Wordsworth, was the ship's captain. The 1,300-tonne ship set sail from Portsmouth to Bengal and China in 1805 but during a storm it struck a sandbank and foundered about a mile off the shores of Weymouth. On the recommendation of Historic England, the government gave the wreck special protected status on Wednesday. This means the site, which includes planking, frames, fixtures and fittings, can be dived on but should remain untouched. ""We can’t protect shipwrecks against tides and ocean currents, but we can protect them against human activity"", Duncan Wilson, Chief Executive of Historic England, told Radio 4's Today programme. David Carter from the Portland Museum in Dorset was among those who discovered the wreck and welcomed its new protected status. He described the Earl of Abergavenny as the ""finest and largest"" of the East India Company ships. The ship was built to collect tea from China, Mr Wilson said.  The East India Company had a close association with the Wordsworth family, with Mr Wilson telling the BBC that John Wordsworth embarked on a life at sea to help support his brother's writing career. After John Wordsworth's death, the poet's style ""became a lot bleaker"", the historian said.  References to John can be found in some of his brother's works, such as in The Character of the Happy Warrior, Stepping Westward and Elegiac Stanzas. John captained two successful voyages on the Earl of Abergavenny to China before the tragic incident which took his life and that of around 250 crewmen and passengers. ""It was absolutely a national tragedy,"" Mr Wilson said.  The ship's cargo was estimated to be worth £70,000 at the time - approximately £7.5 million today. Many of the artefacts from the wreck are housed at the Portland Museum."

The team, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, will take part in a series of air shows in late August and September, including in Nova Scotia and Toronto. A number of flypasts are also planned, including Montreal and Niagara Falls, subject to final approvals, the team said. The tour coincides with the team's 60th anniversary celebrations. The visit to Canada, the first since 2019, follows an invitation made by the Royal Canadian Air Force. Wing Cdr Adam Collins said it was an honour to be invited to be part of the celebrations. “We’re looking forward to the prospect of meeting countless people, performing our new diamond season display and creating many memories and great moments at airshows and events,"" he said. Lieutenant General E.J. Kenny, Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force, echoed the sentiments. He said the tour ""not only underscores the strength of our enduring relationship, but promises Canadians an incredible showcase of precision and flying skill"". The display routine features nine of the team’s distinctive red-livered BAE Systems Hawk fast-jets, with new artwork to mark the team's diamond anniversary. As well as thrilling the crowds, the team will also be taking part in a number of ground events and engagements aimed at inspiring the next generation.  The RAF had several aerobatic display teams in the 1950s and 1960s, but decided to disband them and form a single, full-time professional team. The name Red Arrows was chosen to combine the appeal and expertise of two earlier teams, the Black Arrows and the Red Pelicans. The team was founded in 1965 at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire. Since its formation, the team has performed displays in 57 countries, including  China, India and the United States. In June, the team also took part in the UK's national commemorative event for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Zheng, who lost in the Australian Open final in January, was a 6-2 6-3 winner on Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros. The 21-year-old raced into a 3-0 lead in the first set against Croatian world number 21 Vekic and converted her first set point, also on the Vekic serve. The second set was a much tighter affair, but Zheng - ranked seventh in the world - broke in a pivotal eighth game before serving out the match. Vekic, 28, was appearing in the gold medal match less than a month after narrowly missing out on the Wimbledon final, losing her semi-final to Jasmine Paolini in a deciding set tie-break. In the men's bronze medal match, Italian Lorenzo Musetti came out victorious in a deciding third set. Musetti took a tight opening set 6-4, before Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime emphatically took the second 6-1. But, after seeing a number of break opportunities saved midway through the final set, Musetti eventually broke in the eighth game to serve it out 6-3 and take the bronze medal.

They will travel to South Asia later this month to help develop advanced life-support skills among medical staff. Consultant cardiologist Dinal Taleyratne, who was born in Sri Lanka, said high-quality resuscitation training was not easily accessible in the country. Mr Taleyratne, who helped plan the trip, added: ""I have always wanted to return and offer my support."" He will be joined by Prof David O’Brien, a fellow consultant cardiologist, and Monique Loveday, a lead resuscitation practitioner. They will instruct staff on a ""train-the-trainer"" course, which they have helped to develop, in order to share their knowledge of specialised cardiac care. It is hoped that the Sri Lankan clinicians who take part in the training will go on to share their knowledge with colleagues at local hospitals around the country. The trip has been funded by the Lincoln staff outside of NHS budgets. Ms Loveday said she had a ""real passion"" for training and was ""excited"" to be involved in improving skills in Sri Lanka. She said: “We take so much for granted with the NHS. We have the benefit of its history and all of the hard work and experience that has got us where we are today."" Prof O’Brien has been teaching advanced life support for 25 years, including in China and India.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vd9k33r00o,Rarely seen Titanic artefacts kept in secret warehouse,"A handbag, perfume and other precious items recovered from the Titanic tell stories of the doomed ship’s passengers.",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:24.642648,China News,BBC,China,"A handbag made from alligator skin and tiny vials of perfume that still release a potent scent are just some of the precious artefacts recovered from the world’s most famous shipwreck - the Titanic. The exact location of the warehouse where they are stored is a closely guarded secret, because of the value of its contents. All we can say is that it is somewhere in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States. Inside, the shelves are packed with thousands of items: from an upturned bathtub and dented porthole, to intricately etched glassware and tiny buttons. The BBC was given a rare chance to look around the storage facility and discover the stories behind some of these objects. “It's a really beautiful, fashionable little bag,” says Tomasina Ray, director of collections for RMS Titanic Inc, the company that has recovered these artefacts. The US firm has the salvage rights to the ship and over the years has retrieved 5,500 items from the wreck site, a selection of which are put on display around the world. The bag is made from alligator skin, which has survived decades in the depths of the North Atlantic. The delicate items inside have been preserved too, revealing details of the life of its owner - a third-class passenger called Marian Meanwell. “She was a 63-year-old milliner,” says Tomasina. “And she was travelling to the US to be with her daughter who was recently widowed.” Among the mementos inside was a faded photograph, thought to be Marian Meanwell’s mother. There was also paperwork she would need for her new life in America, including a handwritten reference letter from her former landlord in London. It states: “We have always found Miss Meanwell to be a good tenant, prompt with payment.” Her medical inspection card was inside too, as all third-class passengers needed to prove they weren’t bringing disease into the US. But this water-stained document reveals a tragic twist of fate. Marian Meanwell was booked on the Majestic - another White Star Line ship. But it didn’t sail, so on the card, Majestic is crossed out and her passage shows that she was transferred to the Titanic and became one of 1,500 people to lose their lives. “Being able to tell her story and have these objects is really important,” says Tomasina. “Otherwise she’s just another name on the list.” Items that belonged to survivors have also been brought back from the deep. Tomasina opens a plastic container and a sickly-sweet smell fills the air. “It’s very potent,” she admits. Inside are tiny vials of perfume. They are sealed, but their strong aroma escapes, even after decades on the seafloor. “There was a perfume salesman on board and he had over 90 of these little perfume vials,” Tomasina explains. His name was Adolphe Saalfeld and he had been travelling as a first-class passenger. Saalfeld was one of the 700 people who survived. But with women and children prioritised during the evacuation, some men who made it off the ship were left troubled. “He had passed by the time we found this,” says Tomasina. “But it's my understanding that he did live with a bit of guilt - survivor's guilt.” Also in the collection is a champagne bottle - complete with champagne inside and a cork in the top. “A little bit of water probably would have gotten in through the cork as it compressed and equalised the pressure. And then it just sat on the bottom of the ocean,” says Tomasina. When the Titanic sank in 1912, after striking an iceberg, the ship split apart and its contents spilled out, creating a vast debris field. “There are a lot of bottles on the ocean floor and a lot of stock pots and kitchen pots too, because Titanic actually broke up around one of the kitchens,” says Tomasina. There were thousands of bottles of champagne on board. The liner’s owner wanted its first-class passengers to experience the ultimate in opulence, with sumptuous surroundings and the finest food and drink. “It was like a floating palace and Titanic was supposed to be the most luxurious liner,” says Tomasina. “So having champagne, having a gym, having all these amenities and these great things for the passengers would have been really important to them.” The Titanic was on her maiden voyage, travelling from Southampton to the US, when she hit the iceberg. The ship had advanced safety features for the time and was famously said to be unsinkable. Tomasina shows us some of the ship’s rivets, chunky metal pins that held its thick steel plates together. There would have been more than three million of them. “When Titanic sank, there was a theory that they were using substandard materials perhaps, and that's what caused it to sink faster,” Tomasina explains. Some of these rivets have been tested to see if they contain any impurities. “There were high concentrations of slag in these, which is a glass-like material that makes them maybe a little bit more brittle in the cold,” she says. “If these rivets were brittle, and one of the rivet heads popped off more easily, then it could have allowed the seam to open up where the iceberg hit and made it bigger than it otherwise would have been.” Tomasina says there is still much to learn about exactly how the ship sank. “We're able to help look into the theories, so being able to contribute to the science and that story behind it is something that we're very happy to do.” Life on board was different for the social classes - even down to the cups and plates they would drink from and eat off. A white third-class mug is simple and sturdy, with a bright red White Star logo. A second-class plate has a pretty blue floral decoration and looks a little finer. But a first-class dinner plate is made of more delicate china. It has a gold trim and, under the light, you can catch a glimpse of an intricate garland pattern. “That pattern would have been coloured but, because it was coloured over the glaze, it was able to wash away,” says Tomasina. The wealthy first-class passengers were given silver service for their meals - but in third class, it was a different story. “Third-class passengers would have probably handled the china themselves - it was definitely meant to be much more stable and much more roughly handled than the other china,” explains Tomasina. RMS Titanic Inc is the only company legally allowed to recover items from the site - it was granted this right by a US court in 1994. But it has to do this under strict conditions - the items must always remain together, so they cannot be sold off separately, and they have to be properly conserved. Until now, all of the artefacts have been collected from the debris field. But recently the firm has stirred up controversy stating its desire to retrieve an object from the ship itself - the Marconi radio equipment which transmitted the Titanic’s distress calls on the night of the sinking.  Some believe the wreck is a grave site and should be left alone. “Titanic is something that we want to respect,” Tomasina says in response. “We want to make sure that we're preserving the memory, because not everyone can go down to Titanic, and we want to be able to bring that to the public.” More room could soon be needed on the shelves of this secret warehouse. The company’s latest expedition to the site has involved taking millions of images of the wreck to create a detailed 3D scan. And, as well as surveying the current condition of the Marconi radio room, the team have also been identifying objects in the debris field that they would like to retrieve in future dives. Who knows what they will find and what untold stories each item may reveal about the ill-fated Titanic and her passengers.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3w71mkxwo,A new Kashmir rail bridge that could be a game-changer for India,The bridge is part of an all-weather rail project aimed at connecting Kashmir valley with the rest of India.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:24.733156,China News,BBC,China,"The world’s highest single-arch rail bridge is set to connect the valley region in Indian-administered Kashmir with the rest of the country by train for the first time. It took more than 20 years for the Indian railways to finish the bridge over the River Chenab in the Reasi district of Jammu. The showpiece infrastructure project is 35m taller than the Eiffel Tower and the first train on the bridge is set to run soon between Bakkal and Kauri areas.  The bridge is part of a 272km (169 miles) all-weather railway line that will pass through Jammu, ultimately going all the way to the Kashmir valley (there is no definite timeline yet for the completion). Currently, the road link to Kashmir valley is often cut off during winter months when heavy snowfall leads to blockages on the highway from Jammu. Experts say the new railway line will give India a strategic advantage along the troubled border region. The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for decades. The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over it since independence in 1947. Both claim Kashmir in full but control only parts of it.  An armed insurgency against Delhi's rule in the Indian-administered region since 1989 has claimed thousands of lives and there is heavy military presence in the area. ""The rail bridge will permit the transport of military personnel and equipment around the year to the border areas,” said Giridhar Rajagopalan, deputy managing director of Afcons Infrastructure, the contractor for the Indian railways that constructed the bridge. This will help India exploit a “strategic goal of managing any adventurism by Pakistan and China [with whom it shares tense relations] on the western and northern borders”, said Shruti Pandalai, a strategic affairs expert. On the ground, sentiment about the project is more nuanced. Some locals, who did not want to be named, said the move would definitely help improve transport links, which would benefit them. But they also worry it would be a way for the Indian government to exert more control over the valley.  The railway line is part of a larger infrastructural expansion - along with more than 50 other highway, railway and power projects - by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and divided the state into two federally administered territories in 2019.  The controversial move was accompanied by a months-long security clampdown which sparked massive anger in the region. Since then, the government has brought in several administrative changes that are seen as attempts to integrate Kashmir more closely with the rest of India. Ms Pandalai adds that while India's plans for the region would naturally be guided by its ""strategic aims"", it also needs to take ""local needs and context"" into account. The construction of the Chenab bridge was approved in 2003, but faced delays and missed deadlines because of the region's treacherous topography, safety concerns and court cases. Engineers working on the project had to reach the remote location on foot or by mule during the early stages of construction. The Himalayas are a young mountain range and their geo-technical features have still not been fully understood. The bridge is located in a highly seismic zone and the Indian railways had to carry out extensive exploration studies, modifying its shape and arches to ensure the bridge could withstand simulated wind speeds of up to 266km/h. “Logistics was another major challenge given the inaccessibility of the location and the narrow roads. Many of the components of the bridge were built and fabricated on site,” said Mr Rajagopalan. Besides the engineering complications, the railways had to design a blast-proof structure. Afcons claims the bridge can withstand a strong ""explosion of up to 40kg of TNT"" and trains would continue to ply, albeit at slower speeds, even if there was damage or a pillar was knocked out. Experts say that enabling all-weather connectivity to the Kashmir valley could give the region’s economy a much-needed boost. Poor connectivity during winter months has been a major bugbear for the valley’s largely farm-dependent businesses.  Seven in 10 Kashmiris live off perishable fruit cultivation, according to think-tank Observer Research Foundation. Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir’s largest cold storage facilities in Pulwama district in south Kashmir, said the impact of the rail link could be “huge”. Right now, most of the plums and apples stored in his facility make their way to markets in northern states like Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. The new railway line would give farmers access to southern India which could eventually help increase their incomes, he said. Yet without better last-mile connectivity, he doesn’t expect a quick shift to railway cargo. “The nearest station is 50km away. We’ll have to first send the produce to the station, then unload it and load it onto the train again. It’s too much handling. With perishables you have to try and minimise that,” Mr Shah said. The project is also expected to boost the region's tourism revenue. Kashmir’s spectacular tourist spots have seen a recent surge in arrivals despite the remoteness of the region. A direct train between Jammu and Kashmir's Srinagar would not only be cheaper, but also halve travel time, which could give tourism a further shot in the arm. There will be several challenges too.  Kashmir continues to be dogged by incidents of violence. A recent spurt in militant activity - which seems to have shifted from the Kashmir valley to the relatively calmer Jammu region - is a particular cause for concern. In June, nine Hindu pilgrims were killed and dozens injured after militants opened fire on a bus in Reasi - where the bridge is located - in one of the deadliest militant attacks in recent years. There have been several other attacks on the army and civilians. Experts say such incidents are a reminder of the fragility of peace here - and without stability, connectivity projects would go only so far in reviving the region’s economy."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xl705q2eo,Viral US TikToker's mission to prove British food isn't bland after all,"Kalani Smith, from Tennessee, reviews staples of British cuisine to his three million followers.",24 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:24.822833,China News,BBC,China,"A TikTok star from a small city in Tennessee has made it his mission to show the world British food is not all that bad.  Food reviewer Kalani Smith, who goes by Kalani Ghost Hunter (KGH) online, racks up millions of views posting his reviews on social media - from Welsh cakes to Greggs. After initially building up a following investigating the paranormal, a pivot to reviewing British culinary staples has seen Mr Smith's follower count balloon to more than three million on TikTok alone.  Having recently toured south Wales, Mr Smith boldly declared Cardiff Market's food beats London's Camden Market's ""10 times out of 10"". “The most interesting thing about this journey… is that the perception around the world, especially in the US, is that the food in the UK is bland, it's bad,"" said Mr Smith. “I think my whole objective up until this point has been is to document that this is not the case. ""There's obviously things that are not good in every country, but there's also some things that are absolutely incredible."" ""A lot of people come to the UK and they visit London, and that's their extent of visiting the UK,"" said Mr Smith, who hails from Mount Juliet in Tennessee.  ""Whereas I've been to so many cities in the UK that I've got a pretty good perception and understanding of the majority of food… I've had so many of the regional dishes."" Mr Smith's social media career as a ghost hunter took an unexpected turn when, on a trip to the UK earlier this year, he decided to review arguably the most British meal of them all - a roast dinner.  ""Things really took a change for me after that point,"" said Mr Smith, who has been a food reviewer ever since.  Throughout his travels in the UK, the almost-exclusive setting for his reviews, he found one cuisine particularly stood out.  ""The UK's curry scene is untouchable,"" he said.  ""You can go to so many different parts of the UK and get a really good curry."" However, Mr Smith does not have such kind words for all of the UK's traditional dishes, saying pie, mash and liquor was the worst thing he had. ""That's a London thing... but that liquor sauce is just not something that I would ever want to eat again."" On a recent whistle-stop tour of south Wales, Mr Smith visited Newport, Cardiff, Port Talbot and Swansea.  ""One of the highlights of the trip definitely had to be the Welsh cake... absolutely incredible,"" said Mr Smith, after visiting Cardiff Bakestones in the city's market.  ""My first trip here, I had a horrible Welsh cake from Morrisons out of a package, and everyone told me, you have to get a fresh one. ""We went to the Cardiff market and had some incredible food, Welsh cake being one of those."" Another highlight of Welsh cuisine was our famed traditional Welsh... tacos?  ""Some of the best tacos I've had in the UK can be found in Cardiff Market,"" he said of the market's The Bearded Taco.  In Swansea, he said he had a ""really good experience"" with cockles and laverbread and Welsh rarebit. ""I had to get laverbread from Wales. I had this cockles and laverbread concoction that actually was really good. ""Laverbread by itself, without cooking. It was not a good idea."" He did, however, tempt the wrath of Swansea natives with a less than perfect, but still positive, review of Joe's Ice Cream.  ""Joe's Ice Cream in Swansea is one that I've had commented hundreds and hundreds of times, and everyone from Swansea talks about Joe's Ice Cream.  ""Joe's Ice Cream is good, but it doesn't rank in the top 10 for best ice cream I've ever had. ""It's not something that I would drive or stand in line for."" Mr Smith said the skill of balancing locals' passion for their signature dishes with giving an honest review was an important part of the job. ""The key is - you have to be respectful, right? - If you watch any video that I do, even if it is negative, most of the time, I try my best to be respectful. ""Each city in each region has a dish that they kind of cling to and and they're proud of this dish. ""If I don't think something tastes good, I'm not going to say [it does] to, you know, save someone's feelings. “Just because it's not my taste and it's not something I enjoy doesn't mean that someone else out there doesn't… I will always be honest with people.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjwlrx8n8xo,France seizes three Nigerian jets for Chinese firm,Three presidential jets are grounded in Paris following a long-running business disagreement.,16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:24.908065,China News,BBC,China,"A French court has seized three jets owned by the Nigerian government amid a long-standing dispute with a Chinese company. The row stems from a 2007 contract between Zhongshan Fucheng Industrial Investment and Nigeria's south-western Ogun State to develop a free-trade zone where a massive industrial park was to be developed to attract investors. The agreement was terminated between 2015 and 2016. According to the Financial Times, Zhongshan said it was forced out of the deal through a ""campaign of illegal acts"". The authorities in Nigeria have fiercely condemned the seizure of its planes, suggesting Zhongshan had a sole objective of ""undercutting and scamming"" an African government. A total of three presidential planes have been grounded in France after Zhongshan obtained orders from the Judicial Court of Paris. The planes were receiving ""routine maintenance"" at the time, Nigeria's government said. In a statement by spokesperson Bayo Onanuga, Nigeria's presidential office accused Zhongshan of mounting a wider campaign to seize its assets overseas. ""This arm-twisting tactic by the Chinese company is the latest in a long list of failed moves to attach Nigerian government-owned assets in foreign jurisdictions,"" he said. In March 2021 an arbitration tribunal - chaired by the president of the UK Supreme Court - awarded $74.5m (£57.8m) in compensation to the Chinese firm. Ogun State reportedly refused to pay this amount. Nigerian-owned buildings in the British city of Liverpool were recently seized by a UK court in relation to the same dispute, Nigerian newspaper Premium Times reported. Last Friday, the United States Court of Appeals ruled that Zhongshan could proceed with its efforts to confiscate Nigeria's assets abroad. The court also rejected Nigeria's defence of ""sovereign immunity"".  On Thursday, Nigeria accused Zhongshan of misrepresenting facts to courts in the UK, the US and France. Mr Onanuga said that when the Ogun State contract was revoked, Zhongshan had done no more than erect a perimeter fence on the land earmarked for the free-trade zone. A free-trade zone is an area where goods can be moved in and out of a country for reduced or no taxes or fees. Other such zones exist in Nigeria, such as one in Lagos where the Dangote Petroleum Refinery - built by Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote - has recently opened. In a statement issued to Nigerian media, Zhongshan said: ""Far from being just a fence, the Ogun Free Trade Zone was featured as a significant international investment by the Economist Intelligence Unit."" The Nigerian authorities sought to assure its people that it was working to discharge the French court's ""frivolous order"". ""Nigerian government will always work to protect our national assets from predators and shylocks who masquerade as investors,"" the statement said. The regional government in Ogun State released a similar statement, accusing Zhongshan of making a ""series of  ill-advised attempts"" to seize Nigerian assets. China is Nigeria's largest import partner and the two have strong trade relations. The situation has also renewed public debate about whether President Bola Tinubu should have multiple, taxpayer-funded jets when ordinary Nigerians struggle against an intense economic crisis. Peter Obi, an opposition politician who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2023, said the news of three jets being seized was ""embarrassing"" and exposed an “insensitivity to the plight of the growing poor class in our midst”.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn63rq8n2o,Angus Robertson criticised by SNP colleagues for Israel meeting,Ambassador Daniela Grudsky posted a photo on social media of the meeting with Angus Robertson.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:24.993747,China News,BBC,China,"It's a social media photo that has gone down badly with many in SNP circles.  External Affairs Secretary, Angus Robertson, standing alongside Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky In a social media post, Ms Grudsky said they had discussed the release of Israeli hostages and that Israel was “looking forward to cooperating” with Scotland in areas including culture and renewables. Many SNP figures are highly critical of Israel’s conduct in the Middle East, and this diplomatic encounter prompted an internal backlash. But Scotland's First Minister John Swinney defended the face-to-face meeting with an Israeli government representative.  Mr Robertson met Ms Grudsky on the 8 August, but it was four days later that the Scottish government released a statement about it. A spokesperson made reference to areas of “mutual interest” between Scotland and Israel. The Gaza conflict was addressed in this press release, but not in as strong terms as we’ve heard Scottish government ministers use in the recent past. It outlined that Angus Robertson had “reiterated the Scottish government’s position in calling for an immediate ceasefire by all sides in Gaza.” And the statement went on to explain that the External Affairs Secretary had called for “the unconditional release of all hostages and the opening of safe routes to allow more humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza.” But there was no specific mention, for example, of civilian deaths in Gaza or of weapons sales to Israel. There’s criticism of both the meeting itself and the tone of announcements made in its wake. Emma Roddick was an SNP Government minister until earlier this year. Before John Swinney posted his justification for the meeting, she told me that she wanted more information about how it came about. The Highland MSP said her “heart just sank” when she saw the photo on social media, adding that she was not comfortable with the engagement. In private, some SNP insiders have expressed their anger in much stronger terms. One MSP told me that Angus Robertson was “an absolute disgrace” for taking part in the meeting, and that he should be sacked from his role as External Affairs Secretary. This simply wasn’t robust enough for a number of SNP figures, who have now gone public with their criticism. The former minister Kevin Stewart branded the meeting a mistake. The Aberdeen Central MSP posted on social media: “I hope Angus Robertson also demanded an immediate ceasefire, castigated the IDF for bombing hospitals and schools and told you that Israel should comply with all of the UN Resolutions that have been passed over decades”. That was reposted by Ivan McKee, a serving Scottish Government minister. Another former SNP minister, Elena Whitham, shared the original photo with a sad emoji face posted alongside it. John Swinney posted a statement online earlier, acknowledging that some felt a meeting was “not appropriate”. But he stood by the decision to accept the Israeli request. The First Minister explained that he saw it as an opportunity to convey the Scottish Government’s “consistent position on the killing and suffering of innocent civilians in the region.” It may be the case that Angus Robertson raised this with the Israeli deputy ambassador in private.  But it’s not something that was touched upon in detail in the statement the Scottish Government published after the meeting. It’s not the first time that Mr Robertson has prompted a backlash over engagements with foreign officials. Last year he faced criticism after some felt he should have taken a firmer position on China. Unlike in other parties – such as Labour – the conflict in the Middle-East hasn’t sparked division in the SNP. But this diplomatic encounter has prompted real anger in the party. A big part of diplomacy is striking the right tone. But many within the SNP think that the Scottish Government has been tone deaf when it comes to this engagement with Israel. A spokesperson of the Israel Embassy told BBC Scotland News: ""As part of the longstanding and positive relationship between Israel and the UK, it is the work of foreign diplomats to engage and foster relations, including with the Scottish Government, through partnerships and frank dialogue. ""It is unfortunate that the core principles of diplomacy are being called into question. ""We remain resolute in fulfilling our duty to represent the state of Israel, including through advocating for the return of our 115 Israeli hostages who continue to be held by Hamas in Gaza."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kj5yvwd74o,UN chief calls for permanent Africa Security Council seat,"The world has changed since 1945, but the UN Security Council has not kept pace, says António Guterres.",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:25.072608,China News,BBC,China,"UN chief António Guterres has called for Africa to be given a permanent seat at the UN Security Council as part of reforms to correct historical injustices. The Security Council - the five permanent members of which are China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - has long been criticised for representing the realities that prevailed at the end of World War Two when much of Africa was still under colonial rule. “The world has changed since 1945. But the composition of the Council, despite a few changes, has not kept pace,” Mr Guterres said. The 10 non-permanent members of the body are allocated by region, but unlike the five permanent members, they do not have the power of veto. The African Union has long been pushing for the continent to have two permanent representatives on the council and an additional two seats as non-permanent representatives. The debate on Monday was convened by Sierra Leone - and its President Julius Maada Bio made the case for the continent. “The time for half-measures and incremental progress is over. Africa must be heard, and its demands for justice and equity must be met,” he said. The UN Security Council has significant responsibilities, including authorising peacekeeping operations, imposing international sanctions and determining how the UN should respond to conflicts around the world. Other UN officials echoed the sentiments for reform, including Dennis Francis - the president of the UN General Assembly, as well as Mr Guterres. “We cannot accept that the world’s preeminent peace and security body lacks a permanent voice for a continent of well over a billion people - a young and rapidly growing population - making up 28% of the membership of the United Nations,” the UN chief said. Africa was under-represented at the UN Security Council and international financial institutions but “over-represented in the very challenges these structures are designed to address”, he added. Africa has often been at the centre of conflicts fuelled by greed for the continent’s resources, necessary to the global economy, Mr Guterres said. He also pointed out that almost half of all UN peacekeeping operations were in Africa and 40% of UN peacekeepers were African. The UN chief added that the body had failed to adequately align African representation with the continent’s efforts and contributions. The UN was set up after the end of World War Two to spare succeeding generations from the scourge of armed conflict. Only four African nations - Egypt, Liberia, Ethiopia, and South Africa - were amongst the founding members. For Mr Guterres, the need for change was not only about ethics and justice. “It is also a strategic imperative that can increase global acceptance of the council’s decisions - benefitting Africa and the world,"" he said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrj34d14wxo,Hong Kong loves to hate its cabbies - can polite ambassadors help?,Ask anyone in Hong Kong what they like least about their city - taxi drivers will likely be high on the list.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:25.170071,China News,BBC,China,"Business owner Louis Ho remembers how so many of Hong Kong's taxi drivers refused to take him and his mother - who was a wheelchair user - to hospital for routine check-ups. “I didn’t even need the driver to carry my mum or the wheelchair. I did everything myself,” says the 64-year-old whose mother passed away in 2018. He is one of many Hong Kongers who have a story to tell about their city's infamous cabbies. Ask them what they like least about Hong Kong, and taxi drivers will likely be high on the list. The most common complaints: drivers are rude, refuse to accept rides and often take longer routes so customers have to pay more. But now the Hong Kong Taxi Council is on a mission to transform this image. They will despatch “courtesy ambassadors” armed with ""best-practice"" pamphlets to taxi stands.  Will that really help? That depends on who you ask. A single campaign cannot school rude or misbehaving drivers overnight - there are about 46,000 cabbies in the city, cautions Ryan Wong, the chairman of the council. But he is hopeful: ""This is not the first time that we have done this, and the feedback from drivers has been positive."" Hong Kongers are more sceptical. An interview clip of a taxi driver saying that passengers, rather than drivers, are the ones to be educated has gone viral in the city - many point to it as evidence that nothing will change. Many of them are also still smarting from past experiences.  Amy Ho, in her 30s, said she stopped taking taxis a few years ago after an encounter that she found particularly unpleasant.  “I didn’t realise I had asked for a very short journey. As soon as I reached the destination, I scrambled for cash to pay,"" she says.  ""It was merely five seconds or so, and the driver said, ‘Can you stop dragging on, auntie? I can’t believe you need a ride for such a short distance and you can’t even afford it!'.” IT worker Kenny Tong now only take a cab about three times a month, preferring to avoid the ordeal where he can. To hail one, he says, he often has to “bow, wait for the driver to lower the car window” and check if his destination is on the driver's route for the day.  “Some taxi drivers grumble throughout the journey after I have boarded,” he adds. He also finds it frustrating when drivers do not use GPS and ask him how to reach the destination – even though they have “multiple phones on the dashboard”. Most disgruntled passengers do not file complaints because it's time-consuming. Still, there there were about 11,500 complaints last year - a 11% increase from 2019, according to the Transport Advisory Committee. Only a tiny fraction were prosecuted.  Then there is the problem of dishonest drivers - with tourists especially vulnerable. In early July, a visitor from the China's eastern province of Zhejiang took to social media to complain that she was only given HK$44 ($5.6; £4.5) in change after giving a cabbie HK$1,000 for a HK$56 ride. She reported the incident to the police, but couldn’t get her money back because of insufficient evidence. But poor behaviour is only a symptom of the deeper issues that beset the city’s taxi industry, which is struggling with high costs, increased competition and bureaucracy. There are about 18,000 taxi licenses in the city, and this number has been largely capped since 1994, apart from 2016 when just 25 licenses were issued. Many holders see the licenses as an investment and rent them to drivers.  Leung Tat Chong – who has worked as a taxi driver for more than two decades – says the rent of the licenses has kept rising and a driver has to pay about HK$500 for a 12-hour daytime shift – which does not include fuel. On a typical day, a driver can make HK$500 to HK$800. “We can only do more business during rush hours, and sometimes we wait for up to 25 minutes and there is not even one single passenger,” he says. “To make a living, some drivers are not as patient and they have no capacity to improve their services.”  This is not an excuse for poor behaviour, he adds, but the “reality” of the industry. Taxis also face intense competition from Uber which has been hugely popular since its entry into the Hong Kong market in 2014. The company says half of the city’s 7.5 million population have used it at least once.  The taxi industry has called on the government to crack down on the platform, which remains officially illegal in the city, arguing that it is unfair because Uber drivers are not subjected to the same laws - including needing special licences to run. In late May, some taxi drivers even launched a vigilante sting operation to expose Uber drivers – but that attracted backlash from the public, many of whom say they prefer the ride hailing app precisely because of the issues they have with cab drivers.  “We underestimated the impact of ride-hailing apps,” says Chau Kwok-keung, the chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association. “Passengers are willing to pay more for a better riding experience.” While Mr Chau is against Uber, he concedes that there are fewer conflicts on that platform because drivers can pick the passengers and fares are agreed before the journey. He also admits that the industry has been slow to adapt to online hailing systems and digital payment. Most taxi drivers still only accept cash. The taxi industry also struggles to attract new blood. The average age of drivers is close to 60. Mr Chau argues that the lack of prospects is an important factor, as taxi fare has only been raised four times in the past decade. In 2023, the average income of an urban taxi driver was about HK$22,000, about 10% higher than the city’s median income. Hong Kong ranks 45th in terms of taxi fare in the world, according to living-cost online database Numbeo. Mr Chau says it’s very low considering Hong Kong is an expensive city. “Many think that only poor people become cabbies, and it’s the last resort when one meets financial difficulties,” says Mr Leung, who thinks that the government should tighten requirements and provide more training for taxi drivers to improve the profession’s image. But big changes are afoot for the city’s taxi industry. A demerit-point system will take effect in September, and misbehaviour could lead to a license suspension after a court conviction. A taxi fleet system will be introduced and authorities have issued five new licenses. It will allow flexible pricing, but in return, these fleets, which include 3,500 taxis, have to provide online booking, personal rating systems and digital payment. For now, drivers and passengers say they are waiting to see if these reforms can take hold. “If we provide good service, the industry will grow and there will be more passengers,” says Mr Leung."

Dartmoor Zoo welcomed a female Amur leopard called Lena to the Sparkwell site on Wednesday as part of plans to get her to breed with another Amur leopard called Freddo. Lena is heading to Dartmoor as she is believed to be an ideal breeding partner for Freddo, the zoo has said. Her arrival from Colchester Zoo comes after Freddo was listed on the Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS), described as a ""dating site for animals"". Mainly found in border areas between Russia, China and North Korea, Amur leopards are considered to be one of the world's rarest cats, with about 200 in captivity and 100 in the wild, Dartmoor Zoo said. Lena - who has been described by her Colchester keepers as a ""big personality"" - was currently in an off-show enclosure at Dartmoor Zoo after arriving from Essex, a spokesperson said. They added Lena had come with a spices package containing her favourite scents which included Chinese five spice to help her adjust to new surroundings. David Gibson, Dartmoor Zoo's chief executive, said Lena's arrival was part of the site's efforts with animal conservation. ""One of the many essential roles that modern zoos perform is the conservation breeding of critically endangered species such as Amur leopards,"" he said. ""We are delighted to be able to play our part in the continued conservation of this iconic and charismatic species."" Freddo arrived at Dartmoor Zoo in November 2023 with bosses at the site having the ambition of breeding more of the Amur species. He was placed on ZIMS, run by US-based firm Species360, as part of plans to find a suitable mate for Freddo. Zookeepers at Dartmoor said they would observe Lena and Freddo's interactions before embarking on the breeding programme. Senior keeper Ashley Matthews said: ""Introductions can often take a while, and this is not something we want to rush."" Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240813-decoding-a-4000-year-old-dinner-recipe,Decoding the oldest recipes on Earth,"In Ancient Babylonia, soups and stews reigned supreme. Food historians are now using taste-tests to recover their forgotten flavours.",14 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:29.446718,China News,BBC,China,"In Ancient Babylonia, soups and stews reigned supreme. Food historians are now using taste-tests to recover their forgotten flavours. No-one knows exactly where they came from; for a long time, no-one really understood what they said. The little slabs of clay covered with dense, wedge-shaped cuneiform writing were thought by Yale University scholars to involve medicines. Unearthed in an archaeological dig in the Middle East, they have probably been in the Yale Babylonian Collection since 1911. It wasn't until the early 1980s, however, that French scholar Jean Bottéro finally figured out what the tablets were saying. In their understated way, for nearly 4,000 years, they've been talking about dinner. The four tablets – the larger ones the size of a large bar of soap, the smallest, more than a thousand years younger, a mere round handful of clay – are inscribed with the ingredients not of pharmaceuticals but of dishes. Dated to at least 1730 BC, the three larger tablets mostly contain descriptions of stews; the smallest, from a later period, speaks of a broth.   The mere fact of their existence is a mystery. In ancient Mesopotamia, people rarely wrote about preparing food, said Agnete Lassen, the assistant curator of the collection. ""Out of hundreds of thousands of cuneiform documents, they are the only food recipes that exist,"" she said. ""We don't have an explanation."" And indeed, in many cuneiform texts, when ancient scribes put stylus to clay and incised stories and accounts that happen to mention food, they use words that are themselves sometimes mysterious to modern scholars. Ingredients pop up whose identity is still unknown, said Gojko Barjamovic, an Assyriologist at Harvard University. Asum is myrtle, salu is cress seeds, but what is hurrium? Reading the list of unknown spices alone, from a paper by Barjamovic, Lassen, and their collaborators, conjures visions of a lost garden, nestled between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers: Kurullu, kuruš, nīnu. Silaru, zanzar, zibibianu. The Yale culinary tablets, as the four slabs of clay are known, have the same curious assumption as many recipes do, ancient or modern: the writer expects that the reader basically already knows what they are aiming for. The instructions are terse, clipped. And as is the case for many old recipes, from all vintages of the human relationship with cuisine, amounts are not specified. With all of this lying between us and the experience of dinner in Babylon long, long ago, it can be difficult to imagine clearly what the food was like. But some years ago, Barjamovic, Lassen, and their colleagues, including Iraqi food historian Nawal Nasrallah, made some gestures in that direction. They updated the translations of recipes made by Bottéro, using new understandings of some words. They performed careful experimentation, altering ingredients one by one. They could eliminate one potential ingredient by virtue of the fact that it made the resulting dish unbearably bitter, to the point where none of the other carefully incorporated seasonings were detectable. While it is possible that this was the intended effect, it doesn't seem likely. It is striking, however, that stews and broths make up the entirety of the recipes, Nasrallah, author of the cookbook Delights from the Garden of Eden, has noted. Stew – meat and vegetables in a broth – is a staple of modern Iraqi food. It was also a major feature of food in medieval Iraq, described in a 10th-Century cookbook Nasrallah has translated. And when the research group cooked their updated and tested translations of four of the culinary tablet recipes, they yielded something that must be at least redolent of that long-ago tradition. Here is how one of the stews is made: for the lamb stew known as tu'hu, first you get water. Then you sear leg meat in fat. In go salt, beer, onion, rocket, coriander, Persian shallot, cumin, beets, water. Crushed leek and garlic and more coriander, for a fiery taste. Then add kurrat, an Egyptian leek. The beets turn it an electric red, and of the four, it's Lassen's favorite. ""It's pungent and it's very nicely spiced,"" she said. ""It has good flavours."" Even with all this care, there remains the fact that people's tastes might have been quite different back then. A famous example of a food that is not so popular on the far side of several millennia is the Roman fish sauce garum– this potent, fermented, umami goo is not a common part of modern Italian cuisine. The researchers acknowledge this difficulty: using the tastes and impressions of people alive today to try to set bounds on what dishes this old taste like is a fraught business. More like this: • The food that could last 2,000 years • The world's oldest beer recipe is experiencing a revival • What we owe the humble lentil Between then and now, Islam also arrived in the Middle East, making pork a less popular ingredient, and the Colombian Exchange (the trade between the Americas and Europe from the 15th Century) brought tomatoes and potatoes from the New World. Modern Iraqi cuisine is not a replica of what was eaten in Babylon. Who knows if, 3,000 years from now, people sat where you are now will be eating anything like what you have today? In a modern food system where what we eat is not particularly dependent on where we are, it feels like the connection between food and local geography has evaporated. Thousands of years from now, on the far side of who knows what changes, perhaps that link will have returned. Perhaps the climate will be so different that the British Isles will be growing lentils. Maybe in what was once Siberia there will be a booming business in coconuts.     Barjamovic points out that as far as these ancient recipes are concerned, the story is also not over. Each archaeological field season brings with it the possibility of new texts being dug up, shedding new light on mysterious words for spices and other ingredients. The Mesopotamian way of thought was not copied or passed on as Greek texts were. It fell out of human knowledge in the 1st Century BC. ""But because they wrote in clay,"" he said, ""it's there in the soil, indestructible."" * An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that aubergines were brought from the New World. This has been corrected as aubergines are thought to have been originally domesticated in China and India, and some wild relatives have been found in Africa.  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn8vk4g42o,"Phone taps, sabotage and an assassination plot: Is Germany in Cold War 2.0?","As a hot war rages between Russia and Ukraine, there are fears Europe has slipped into a new Cold War.",18 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:29.606670,China News,BBC,China,"Holes mysteriously found cut in army base fences. An alleged plot to assassinate Germany’s top weapons manufacturer. Phone taps on a high-level Luftwaffe call. These aren’t storylines lifted from a 1960s spy novel but real-life events in Germany, this year. Not all of these events can definitively be blamed on Moscow, but Germany is on heightened alert for possible acts of Russian sabotage, because of Berlin’s continued military support for Kyiv. As a hot war rages between Russia and Ukraine, there are fears that Europe has slipped into a new Cold War. “When we think of the Cold War, we have a tendency to think of the 1970s by which point the rules of the game had become established and accepted,” says Mark Galeotti, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) and director of Mayak Intelligence. “In some way, we’re in the early Cold War – the Fifties and Sixties, so a much rawer time.” But what does a rekindled Cold War look like for Europe’s biggest economy and a country that was once itself cut in half by the Iron Curtain? The biggest bombshell dropped just last month when CNN reported that US officials had told Berlin of an alleged Russian plot to kill the chief executive of Germany’s biggest arms company Rheinmetall. The Kremlin denied the report but German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who strikes a hawkish figure next to the more hesitant Chancellor Olaf Scholz, hit out at Russia for “waging a hybrid war of aggression"". I met Rheinmetall’s CEO, Armin Papperger, at a ground-breaking ceremony for a new ammunition factory in February. The 61-year-old is, to use a crude term, a real “somebody”, particularly in a world where Nato countries are spending billions to re-supply Ukraine and boost their own security. His prominent position was clear as he stood alongside Chancellor Scholz, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen as they plunged spades into the earth in Lower Saxony. Had a plot to kill him been successful, it would have sent shockwaves through the West. A security blunder not long afterwards allowed spies to eavesdrop on a highly sensitive conversation between senior German air force officials, later broadcast on Russian TV. It was a cause of acute embarrassment for Berlin given that a brigadier general in the Luftwaffe appeared to allow spies into the secure call by dialling in on an insecure line. The mega-blip, however isolated, fuelled accusations that Germany has long been a “weak link” within the European counter-intelligence due to a fragmented, federalised system that’s underpinned by a strong emphasis on individuals’ privacy. Weeks later, two German-Russian nationals were arrested on suspicion of planning to sabotage US military facilities in Bavaria. Annalena Baerbock summoned the Russian ambassador to complain and announced: “We will not allow Putin to bring his terror to Germany.” Only last week, holes were found cut into the fences of water facilities supplying two military bases in North Rhine-Westphalia, with concerns that someone has been seeking to contaminate supplies.  Germany is not the only European country being targeted by apparent acts of sabotage, but it has a lot of US military bases that were established in the wake of World War Two. Mark Galeotti believes Moscow views Germany as a large but “flabby” power, making it the ideal pressure point. By anyone’s measure, the greatest act of known sabotage to affect Germany in recent years was when the Nord Stream gas pipelines, running under the Baltic Sea from Russia, were blown up in 2022. Speculation over who ordered the attack has been rife ever since, but in a dramatic development Germany has now issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor. Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that the “shoestring” operation had been privately funded but overseen from Ukraine. Kyiv rejected the report as nonsense, and while there was always scepticism that President Putin would order the destruction of his own pipeline, it does show that the murky world of espionage can be full of twists and turns. Each incident of apparent sabotage cannot, by any means, be immediately and certainly attributed to Russia. In France it was far-left activists, not Russian agents, who were accused of targeting the country’s high-speed rail network on the eve of the Olympics. And Germany has had its own, extensive, history of far-left militant attacks. The fact that Ukrainian figures are now under the spotlight for the Nord Stream blasts has fuelled fresh criticism from familiar political wings, within Germany, about the government’s support for Kyiv. Co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Deutschland, Alice Weidel, has called for “aid payments” to Kyiv to be halted and the damage to Nord Stream “billed” to Ukraine. The AfD enjoys much of its support in the former communist east, where beyond Berlin you’re more likely to find lingering affection for Russia and dissatisfaction with the main parties that have, since reunification, dominated national politics. So as Cold War comparisons hover over European security, the politics of that period has also renewed itself in Germany in a stark and unexpected way. In a bid to bolster security, the German government is working on a new law aimed at boosting resilience of critical infrastructure. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser says there must be “maximum protective measures in all areas”. Operators in critical sectors such as energy, transport and water will have to follow minimum security standards, under the Kritis Umbrella Act. It’s the first federal law of its kind in Germany but yet to gain final approval despite heightened tensions surrounding the war. German-made armoured Marder vehicles are reportedly being used in Ukraine’s surprise operation inside Russian territory. That would mark yet another German foreign policy taboo being broken since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Add to that contentious plans for the US to station long-range missiles in Germany from 2026. When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, Chancellor Sholz promised a “Zeitenwende”, or turning point in national defence and security policy. But supporters and critics of the government alike acknowledge that reversing years of underinvestment in defence will take time – as will adjusting a mentality so influenced by Germany’s dark past. Given recent developments, there’s a question mark over how long Berlin has. Mark Galeotti says it is not just rebuilding defence but upgrading cyber-security and improving counter-intelligence. “Security planning doesn’t happen over weeks or months but years.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yd4j4lnvo,Is this the end for the magnetic stripe?,Once common on tickets and cardkeys the magnetic stripe is being phased out.,16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:29.700948,China News,BBC,China,"As he slipped the key card into the reader on his hotel room door and tried the handle - to no avail - he realised what he had done. For years, Steven Murdoch, a security researcher at University College London, had taken care not to put tickets or cards with magnetic stripes in his pocket next to his smartphone. This is because the magnets in smartphones are sometimes strong enough to wipe the data on magnetic stripes. But so-called magstripe hotel key cards are rare these days, increasingly superseded by contactless cards with radio frequency identification (RFID) chips inside them. As such, during his hotel visit in January this year, Prof Murdoch forgot to take precautions and, he concludes, wiped his room key – having used it only once. “I should have known better, this is the sort of thing I do know about,” he says. Upon arriving back at reception, he realised he was not alone. “There was a queue of people with exactly the same problem as me,” he recalls. The magnetic stripe was invented by an IBM engineer in the 1960s – his wife was instrumental in the process as it was she who suggested melting a strip of magnetic tape onto a card using a clothes iron. In the decades since, magstripes have been used on bank cards, rail tickets, IDs and even cards containing medical information, to set up hospital machines. But that murky brown strip of plastic usually made with polluting heavy metals may not be around for much longer.  From this year onwards, for instance, Mastercard will not require banks to put a magnetic stripe on debit and credit cards. For ticketing, new technologies including printable barcodes and reusable contactless cards are considered more environmentally friendly and potentially more convenient.  You also can’t wipe them by accidentally putting them too close to your iPhone. There are, broadly, two kinds of magnetic stripe, called HiCo and LoCo. The latter is cheaper, less durable, and more susceptible to disruption from magnets, says Lee Minter, head of global operations at Nagels, which makes magstripe tickets and other products. Recently, the company investigated reports from a customer who said multiple magstripe tickets they had bought had got corrupted. Mr Minter says he can’t be 100% sure but he and his colleagues are of the opinion that it was caused by part of a circular magnet within the customer’s iPhone. “It matched perfectly to the area which had been wiped,” he says. In response, Apple says: ""Smartphones and other items contain magnets or components that may have a risk of demagnetizing low coercivity cards. To prevent this from happening, users should keep these cards stored separately."" While such disruption remains relatively rare, Mr Minter says that the magnetic stripe is declining in popularity either way. Of the five billion tickets Nagels prints every year, less than one-fifth now have magnetic stripes, he estimates. Mr Minter is keen to stress the potential of thermally printed paper tickets, much like receipts, which are now being used in trials at multiple rail stations around the UK. These come with a QR code that can be used on ticket barrier scanners. There is a separate code on the back to stop people forging tickets. Stuart Taylor, head of commercial development at Northern, a train operator, says 70% of his firm’s customers now buy digital tickets and that Northern could axe the familiar orange-trimmed, magstripe-sporting versions in just five years’ time. “There is a clear environmental benefit,” says Mr Taylor. “Times change, I guess.” Northern is now trialling the thermally printed paper tickets made by Nagels as an alternative. There have been some issues with printer jams and the tickets getting stuck in ticketing machines but these problems have largely been addressed, says Mr Taylor. He emphasises that there are no plans to withdraw paper tickets, nor to cut any staff involved in ticket sales. Are there any benefits to keeping magstripe cards or tokens around?  “No,” says Sue Walnut, product director for intelligent transportation systems at Vix Technology, bluntly.  She argues there are now so many different ways of validating a rail ticket - for example, QR codes presented on phone screens, tickets printed at home, prepaid contactless cards - that there is less need to retain magstripe technology than ever before. But magstripe tickets and entry cards do slot conveniently into credit card holders in wallets and purses. The new paper tickets being trialled by Northern and other rail firms are larger. “They are a bit unwieldy and cumbersome,” says Ms Walnut. Magstripe has hung around for so long partly because it is relatively cheap and the specifications for reading machines were put in place many decades ago, says Stephen Cranfield at Barnes International, which makes equipment for magnetic stripe testing. “If you took your card today and used it in a magstripe reader from 1970, it would still be able to read it,” he says. His firm has worked on a variety of systems - including one designed to allow kidney failure patients to use a magstripe card for setting up their dialysis machine. Despite the ubiquity of dark brown or black magstripes, they can actually come in a whole range of colours. “It’s quite popular in China, actually – gold stripes,” explains Mr Cranfield. But now that US banks are finally switching to chip and PIN cards, the market for magstripe is clearly dwindling. Prof Murdoch says although magstripe technology is extremely well established, it is “inevitable” that it will gradually disappear. One downside to that, he suggests, is that magnetic stripe failures and fraud are currently well understood. Newer technologies, while in theory more secure, may also be more complex - and therefore exploitable by criminals using novel methods. Sometimes, members of the public contact Prof Murdoch when they are having trouble proving to their bank that they have been the victim of fraud. “If the transaction was done by magstripe, then it’s a very easy argument to say someone copied it,” says Prof Murdoch as he points out the irony. “But if the transaction was one of the more secure methods - then it’s much harder.”"

Chief executive Laxman Narasimhan is stepping down and will be replaced by Brian Niccol, the head of Mexican grill chain Chipotle, the company said.  The shake-up comes as Starbucks is grappling with a slump in sales amid a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war. Howard Schultz, a former executive who oversaw the growth of the coffee chain into a global powerhouse, said he believed Mr Niccol was ""the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history"".  ""He has my respect and full support,"" Mr Schultz said. Shares in Starbucks jumped more than 20% following the announcement. A change in leadership at the coffee chain has been brewing for the last two months, Starbucks board member Mellody Hobson told the Wall Street Journal. Last month, the firm said global sales fell 3% annually in the three months to the end of June amid weakness in the US and China. The company has faced criticism for long waits for drinks and a sharp rise in prices. Activist investors such as Elliott Investment Management, a firm known for taking stakes in companies and pushing for leadership and other changes, have also been piling on pressure. Mr Schultz had selected Mr Narasimhan, a former executive at PepsiCo and Reckitt, as his successor in 2022, who took up the reins full-time in March 2023. But despite his choice, Mr Schultz voiced concerns publicly about the direction of the company in the spring, after it reported an unexpectedly severe sales fall. Incoming boss Mr Niccol has led Chipotle since 2018, helping the brand recover from a crisis after food poisoning outbreaks.  Sales doubled during his tenure and the chain's share price surged from less than $7 to more than $50, as the burrito-maker opened nearly 1,000 new stores and introduced robotic grills and automated processors to make guacamole.  In recent months, it has been seen as a bright spot in the restaurant industry, where many businesses have reported customers cutting back. ""It's hard to leave such a great company and all of the talented people I've had the pleasure to work with, but I depart knowing the business is in great shape and poised for growth with a strong, experienced leadership team,"" Mr Niccol said.  Shares in Chipotle dropped more than 9% after his departure was announced. But Sharon Zackfia, an analyst at investment bank William Blair, said the new chief executive could be inheriting a tougher challenge at Starbucks than at Chipotle, noting that the company is both bigger and its problems more complex. ""While we cannot help but be more optimistic on today's news, we suspect the path to recapturing lost sales will be less linear than it was at Chipotle, which did not face boycott pressures, perceived value questions or material speed of service issues,"" she wrote. Starbucks saw its sales boom as the economy re-opened from the Covid pandemic lockdowns.  But the firm soon found itself embroiled in fight with staff in the US, thousands of whom have voted to join a union, tarnishing its progressive reputation.  Last year, after Starbucks sued the union for a social media post expressing ""solidarity"" with Palestinians, the dispute landed it in the middle of debates over Israel's war in Gaza, sparking global boycott calls. Starbucks has blamed misinformation about its views, after issuing a blanket statement condemning violence in the region."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240226-a-brief-history-of-panda-diplomacy---with-new-additions-to-global-zoos,A brief history of 'panda diplomacy',"With the latest panda additions to the San Diego Zoo, 'panda diplomacy' is back in the vernacular. Here's what it means and why it's so important.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15 10:38:30.123156,China News,BBC,China,"With the latest panda additions to the San Diego Zoo, 'panda diplomacy' is back in the vernacular. Here's what it means and why it's so important. After a month and a half of settling into their new home at San Diego Zoo, two giant pandas – Yun Chuan and Xin Bao – are receiving their first visits from the public. Their arrival in the United States at the end of June 2024 marked the latest twist in China's use of its charismatic, bamboo-munching black-and-white bears as part of its international relations. This ""panda diplomacy"" has a long history, that dates perhaps as far as the Tang Dynasty, which ruled from 618 through 907 CE. The movement of the animals around the world offers some insights into the ebb and flow of China's relationships with other nations. The arrival of Yun Chuan and Zin Bao follows the recent recall of three giant pandas that had been living at the National Zoo in Washington DC and one living at the Memphis Zoo in Tennessee. Until June 2024, it left only four pandas in the US, all at the zoo in Atlanta, Georgia. Similarly, in the UK, two giant pandas that had lived at Edinburgh Zoo since 2011 were recalled in 2023. Those decisions arrived at a time when relations between Beijing and the West reached a particularly rocky phase. China and the US, for example, were navigating some decidedly tense security, humanitarian and economic challenges, according to an article about animal diplomacy from Georgetown University's Barbara Bodine, a distinguished professor of diplomacy and director of Georgetown's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. Following the agreement to send the pandas to San Diego Zoo, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also offered to send pandas to Australia as the two countries restored relations following a diplomatic dispute over agricultural and mineral exports. The renewed flurry of panda diplomacy may be part of China’s pursuit of ""soft power"", explains Susan Brownell, a professor of anthropology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a member of the National Committee on US-China Relations, which works to promote understanding and cooperation between the two countries. Researchers at the University of Oxford have even gone so far as to chart the trajectory of China's ""soft cuddly power"" through its use of pandas in an academic paper published in 2013. Since it was founded in 1949, the People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as a gesture of goodwill towards its international allies and competitors. The animals are native to the high, bamboo-covered mountain slopes in south-central China but now only exist in the wild in six isolated valleys within protected nature reserves, where their numbers have dwindled to just 33 populations. Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong sent his first ""panda ambassadors"" as gifts to the Soviet Union in 1957 when he gifted the Ping Ping and Qi Qi to the USSR to mark the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in Russia. He also gifted pandas to other socialist allies such as North Korea, in an effort to strengthen ties. A major diplomatic milestone was reached, however, in 1972 – just two months after US President Richard Nixon made his historic journey to China in an attempt to end more than two decades of frosty relations between the two countries – when an 18-month-old pair of pandas arrived in the US as a gift. The pair, named Hsing-Hsing and Ling Ling, remained in the US until they died. Ling Ling suffered heart failure in 1992. while Hsing-Hising lived to be 28 years old before he was put to sleep due to failing health in 1999. But Hsing-Hsing and Ling Ling were far from the first pandas to be gifted to the US. In 1941, two pandas were sent to the US as a ""thank you"" gift from China by Chiang Kai-Shek for assisting Chinese refugees during the country's war with Japan. It wasn't until 1972 that China gifted Japan two pandas – Kang Kang and Lan Lan – when the two countries normalised diplomatic ties. Then in 1984 the ""gifts"" changed to ""loans"" where zoos would pay substantial fees towards panda conservation projects in China. It can cost zoos up to $1m (£790,000) a year to host a pair of pandas, plus the costs of housing the animals, keeping them in fresh bamboo and in good health. More recently, panda loan deals have coincided with lucrative trade agreements – something the Oxford University academics associated with the Chinese concept of ""guanxi"", which is the development of deep relationships and networks of influence built on trust, loyalty and reciprocity. Australia, for example, was loaned pandas in 2009, while Canada and France received pandas in 2012. The timing appeared to coincide follow lucrative uranium deals and contracts between China and these countries, suggests Kathleen Buckingham and colleagues at the Oxford University in their paper. The loan of two pandas ­– Tian Tian and Yang Guang – to Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland was agreed during negotiations over contracts to supply salmon meat, Land Rover vehicles and energy technology to China.  This flurry of panda loans followed the devastating earthquake in 2008 in China's Sichuan Province, which badly damaged the Wolong Nature Reserve and Breeding Centre, meaning the animals living there needed to be rehomed. But there are still examples where pandas are used as a way of repairing strains between China and its global neighbours. Following the March 2014 disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, relations between China and Malaysia became fraught. The arrival of two pandas that same year in Malaysia was seen as a peace offering. China also seems happy to use its pandas to signal displeasure too – what it gives, it can take away. In 2010, two US-born panda cubs were on an aircraft back to China two days after Chinese officials warned President Barack Obama ahead of a planned meeting between Obama and the Dalia Lama that they could take ""corresponding action"". The pandas were due to be returned to China two years earlier but stayed in the US due to their popularity with visitors. The arrival of San Diego's new pandas – Yun Chuan and Xin Bao – makes them the first of the Chinese bears to enter the US in 21 years. They are expected to be followed by another pair of two-year-old pandas – Bao Li and Qing Bao – who are to be housed at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington DC, around a year after the zoo returned three of its pandas to China. The loan agreement formed part of a 10-year research and breeding cooperation agreement. As for what the pandas may be promising today, Brownell suggests China is hoping to broaden its influence around the world. ""They know very well that their growing economic and military strength is viewed as a threat, particularly by the political leadership of the US,"" says Brownell. ""They also understand that a big factor [of US] influence in the world comes from the appeal of its cultural products, whether it's Hollywood movies or NBA stars. ""Their use of the lovable pandas, as well as the state promotion of Olympic sports, is part of their effort to develop that kind of appeal and influence in the world."" San Diego Zoo's newest residents will be in the US for 10 years under the loan agreement, which will help to support conservation breeding efforts in China. The male – Yun Chuan – is the son of Zhen Zhen, a cub born at San Diego Zoo in 2007 before being returned to China in 2010, and is due to turn five years old later this year. The new female panda at San Diego Zoo, whose name Xin Bao means ""previous treasure of prosperity and abundance"", is due to turn four years old. Since arriving in the US in June, the pair have spent their first weeks away from public view, settling into their new enclosure, which features trees for climbing and rolling ""hillsides"" inspired by the mountains and canyons of China's native panda habitats. Veterinary experts from the US and China have been tracking the pandas' health after their long flight to San Diego, regularly measuring their weight, appetite and blood samples. They have also been having regular ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans in an effort to pick up on any health problems early. Visitors to the zoo were able to get their first look at the two pandas on 8 August when they made their public debut. San Diego Zoo was previously home to giant pandas from 1996 until their departure in 2019 and during that time a total of six pandas were born. Bai Yun and Shi Shi gave birth to the first panda cub to survive in captivity in the US, and later Bi Yung and Gao Gao gave birth to five more cubs. There was also a substantial body of research published as a result of the breeding programme. ""There was a steady flow back and forth [between San Diego and China] of researchers, scientists and graduate students coming here and going there,"" according to Greg Vicino, vice president of wildlife care at the San Diego Zoo. ""That collaboration – when you look at the list of publications that came out of that – is overwhelming. It was a big win for conservation."" And ultimately, says Vicino, conservation boils down to relationships. ""I can tell you from my own experience, having worked in this field for over 20 years now, that I naively thought conservation was about saving habitats and saving species. But I immediately found out it is about forming relationships."" Joking that diplomacy is something he'll ""leave to the pros"", Vicino adds: ""This is really about one-on-one contact between true conservationists from different countries."" * This article was originally published on 26 February 2024.
