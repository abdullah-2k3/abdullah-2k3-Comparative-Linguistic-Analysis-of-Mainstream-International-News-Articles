BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kjrr44mvdo,"Religious hate crime at record high, figures show","The Israel-Hamas war has led to an increase in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents, the Home Office says.",5 days ago,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Religious hate crime recorded by police in England and Wales has risen by 25% over the past year, driven by a rise in offences against Jews and Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Home Office figures show. The vast majority of the 140,561 hate crime offences recorded - about seven in 10 - are shown to have been motivated by race, according to the data. But the increase in religious hate crimes is mainly driven by a rise in antisemitic offences, the department said. Hate crimes targeted at Jewish people more than doubled, while incidents against Muslims were up 13% on the previous 12 months, according to data. The Home Office said this is the highest annual count in religious hate crime offences since the department began collecting data in the year ending March 2012. More recent figures, recorded by community organisations rather than police, have shown record highs in antisemitism and Islamophobia up to the end of September. Publishing the statistics on Thursday, the Home Office said the 25% increase ""was driven by a rise in hate crimes against Jewish people and to a lesser extent Muslims and has occurred since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict"". The hate crimes figures, supplied to the Home Office by the 43 territorial police forces across England and Wales and British Transport Police, showed a 5% decline in the overall number of hate crimes. But over the year ending March 2024 there were 3,282 religious hate crimes targeting Jews, more than double the previous year (1,543). The spike in such incidents coincided with the start of the conflict in the Middle East, and though the number decreased, by the spring it had not returned to levels identified before the conflict. The data corresponds to what has been reported by Jewish charities over the past year, with the highest number of offences reported in Greater London. Jewish charity the Community Security Trust (CST) said the 5,583 incidents recorded across the UK between 7 October 2023 and 30 September is the highest total of any 12-month period and was three times that of the previous 12-month period, which saw 1,830 incidents recorded. The figures also show there were 3,866 religious hate crimes targeting Muslims, up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year. It means 38% of recorded religious hate crimes were targeted against Muslims, and the figures do not yet include the unrest following events in Southport in the summer. Tell Mama - which records anti-Muslim incidents - said it had recorded 4,971 incidents of hate and discrimination across the UK in the year since the 7 October 2023 attacks, the highest total it had noted in more than a decade. ""The appalling levels of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crimes outlined in today’s figures are a stain on our society, and this government will work tirelessly to tackle this toxic hatred wherever it is found,"" said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. ""We must not allow events unfolding in the Middle East to play out in increased hatred and tension here on our streets and those who push this poison - offline or online - must face the full force of the law,"" she said. The police numbers do show that there were decreases in recorded disability hate crimes (down 18%) and those targeting people for their sexual orientation (down 8%), and a 2% fall in transgender hate crimes. But they also show that while there was a 5% fall in race hate crimes, 98,799 were still recorded over 12 months, and it remains by far the most common motivation in such offenses. Hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation have fallen for the second year in a row to 22,839 reported incidents. It means that these types of hate crime have fallen a total of 13% since March 2022 - which was the highest number on record. The Home Office says these decreases have been driven by falls in malicious communications offences, as well as reports of incidents causing public fear, alarm or distress. Simon Blake, CEO of LGBT campaigning charity Stonewall, told BBC News that hate crime reported to police ""is only part of the picture"". He said: ""It’s vital that all those affected have access to support. The fight against hatred is shared, so we must work together to build a society where everyone is safe and respected and free from harm."" Danielle St James, chief executive of trans charity Not A Phase, told the BBC that trans people are often reluctant to report hate crimes. She said: ""After many years in which hate crimes against trans people have soared, the news that these are down by 2% is certainly welcome. ""That being said, we know all too well that there is a reluctance to report these crimes on the part of the community, so it’s always worth taking stats such as these with a pinch of salt."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxrv2200veo,'We couldn't leave our home for a week after riots',Community groups come together to support better cohesion in the wake of far right riots.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Outside the mosque he manages in Stoke-on-Trent, Farouk Farage is reflecting on a ""horrifying"" few days in August, when riots unfolded in the streets. “It was very hard...with my daughters, my son and my wife, we effectively stayed inside our house for a week.   ""For some kids it must have felt like jail,"" he said. The scenes they witnessed on 3 August were terrifying, with riot police deployed when hundreds of people protested in the wake of the deaths of three young girls in Southport. Missiles were thrown at officers and Islamophobic chants directed towards the mosque, Sallahuddin Masjid. Children in a dance show were locked inside a theatre for their safety. Mr Farag said those who targeted them – yelling abuse and throwing stones at cars - have left a fear that is still being felt, an anxiety that can’t easily be shaken off. “There are around 3,000 Kurdish people in our community in Stoke-on-Trent who felt they couldn’t leave their homes for days”, he said. More than £1.5m had been raised for a community centre and, when news of the disorder spread on social media, dozens of worshippers came to surround the mosque. A rapid response security team was brought into Sallahuddin Masjid to guard the site day and night. “We hope it won’t happen again and know that the police will do their best to prevent disorder,"" Mr Farage said. ""We are grateful to Staffordshire Police.  Ever since we came here in 2016, we have had no trouble.  We are all in this together, we love Stoke and try to build the city up."" BBC Midlands Today spoke to community groups about the impact of the riots, which followed the fatal stabbings of three girls in Southport on 29 July.  Eight more children and two adults were also injured.  Anecdotally, they said they were aware of a rise in reports of hate crime offences, targeting Muslims in particular. The Crown Prosecution Service reported that in the year to December 2023, 12,737 hate crime offences were prosecuted, of which 9,245 were on grounds of racial abuse.  “It needs to be taken more seriously, Islamophobia is increasing since the riots”, said Shazia Nasreen, a Hate Crime Ambassador in Walsall. She said she suffered verbal abuse just days after the riots while walking past a bus stop. “A lot of people don’t have the confidence [to report it], first of all they feel it’s not a hate crime and secondly they think nothing is going to be done about it”. She credited the police for their response to the riots but said she remained anxious leaving home for work.  Her experience is helping to shape a new hate crime strategy in Walsall. She works with Black Country Innovate, a social enterprise, who have helped to form a ‘hate crime pledge’. Signed by the Leader of Walsall Council, senior police officers and multiple faith organisations, it promises an integrated approach to helping vulnerable people, who may be experiencing hate crime on grounds of race, religion, disability and sexual orientation. “To protect the vulnerable we need to build trust with authorities and victims need to see justice”, said founder Nasar Iqbal. “The fact that events occurred elsewhere but we felt an impact in Walsall is very common.  A lot of people were suffering from anxiety – people we spoke to had cancelled their travel plans and holidays as a result of the summer disorder”. After conducting research on hate crime with De Montfort University, Black Country Innovate will start free trauma coaching sessions for hate crime victims. It must be the start of a new approach, recognising that people are experiencing abuse in person and online, Mr Iqbal said. “The narratives have changed from 20 years ago.  It’s become more complicated, and more people may be impacted."" Follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly311el04go,"Hate crime rise abhorrent, Sadiq Khan says","The mayor is urging Londoners to be united against hate, as the conflict in the Middle East deepens.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Sadiq Khan has urged Londoners to remain united “against all forms of hate” as the conflict in the Middle East deepens. The mayor has announced a further £875,000 investment in grass-roots community projects working to tackle hate, extremism and radicalisation. The funding comes just ahead of the first anniversary of the outbreak of war in Gaza on 7 October. “We know that an escalation in conflict in the Middle East often leads to an increase in hate crime here in London,” Mr Khan said at an event bringing together organisations that work to combat hate crime and extremism. “With the appalling further escalation of the conflict in Lebanon, Israel, Gaza and the region, I’m appealing to Londoners to continue to look out for their friends and neighbours, whatever their faith and backgrounds, and stand united against all forms of hate. “We have seen an abhorrent and completely unacceptable rise in hate crime over the last year – particularly antisemitism and Islamophobia – which has profoundly impacted our Jewish and Muslim communities in London. ""I’m determined to continue to work in partnership with community, faith and police leaders to ensure everyone in the capital feels safe and is safe.” The Met Police recorded a 286% rise in antisemitic hate crime from September 2023 to August, compared to the same period in the 12 months before, and a 67% increase in anti-Muslim hate crime. The need for early intervention to prevent radicalisation was highlighted earlier this month, when Home Office data revealed that a record number of children were arrested as terror suspects in the year to June. Police detained 242 people on suspicion of terror offences during the 12-month period, of whom 40 were aged 17 or under.  According to City Hall, the £875,000 investment will support 20 groups, among them the Anne Frank Trust UK, to deliver workshops that challenge anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate. Another recipient of funding is Exit Hate, which works with people aged 14-18 to help them understand the dangers posed by extreme ideologies. The latest funding package forms part of the mayor’s Shared Endeavour Fund, and is expected to benefit about 50,000 Londoners. Met Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said: “Our work, which is underpinned by engagement with community representatives and with our key partners, will continue.  ""Together, we are determined to demonstrate that there will be no tolerance for hate crime in London.” Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Public disorder broke out in several towns and cities following the fatal stabbing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July. Burnley Council Leader Afrasiab Anwar said he was ""proud with how our communities came together... to send a clear message that there is no place for such racism and anarchy in our borough"". Mr Anwar said he was pleased the government had invited members of council staff to contribute to a review of the summer's events and help shape any subsequent reforms. At Wednesday's full council meeting, he said: ""The violence we witnessed across the UK last month was deeply concerning. ""Although we escaped violence locally, we witnessed a lot of fear and anxiety as well as several heinous provocations, including the desecration of Muslim graves at Burnley cemetery and the mural at Valley Street Community Centre."" Mr Anwar said he wanted to ""put on record my gratitude to all the police officers who kept us safe during those difficult times"", adding: ""Sadly, some officers were injured and I wish them a speedy recovery."" He also thanked police and council staff for keeping residents informed about what was happening and providing them with reassurance.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e1q5w0q9po,Baroness Warsi quits Conservatives in the Lords,She accuses the party of “hypocrisy and double standards in its treatment of different communities”.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Former Conservative Party chairwoman Baroness Warsi has resigned from the party in the House of Lords, claiming it has moved to the “far right”. The peer, who was Britain's first Muslim cabinet minister during David Cameron's premiership, accused the party of “hypocrisy and double standards in its treatment of different communities”. But the Conservatives say she was about to be investigated for allegedly using ""divisive language"". “Baroness Warsi was informed an investigation was about to begin earlier this week,” a party spokesperson said.  “We have a responsibility to ensure that all complaints are investigated without prejudice.” The BBC has been told the complaints were in relation to a post about Marieha Hussain. Ms Hussain was found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence after holding a placard at a pro-Palestine protest depicting Conservative leader Rishi Sunak and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman as coconuts. In one post on X, Baroness Warsi congratulated Ms Hussain on her acquittal. On Thursday, after announcing her resignation, Baroness Warsi wrote: ""It was the right decision and I rightly congratulated Marieha on her acquittal. ""I was subsequently asked to delete my public support for Marieha - I refused to do so. ""That is the basis of the complaint. No other comments or language is the basis of the complaint."" She said the case was ""due to be conducted in private behind closed doors"" and so she ""felt it appropriate in the circumstances to resign my whip and look forward to dealing with these issues openly and transparently"". Her resignation comes on the eve of the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. Baroness Warsi has previously criticised Tory leadership contenders Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch. She has also been a vocal critic of the party’s approach to allegations of Islamophobia and language used by Conservative politicians, including Ms Braverman. She wrote on X: “It is with a heavy heart that I have today informed my whip and decided for now to no longer take the Conservative whip. “This is a sad day for me. I am a Conservative and remain so but sadly the current party are far removed from the party I joined and served in cabinet.” She added: “My decision is a reflection of how far right my party has moved and the hypocrisy and double standards in its treatment of different communities.” Baroness Warsi suggested she would raise some of these issues in her new book, Muslims Don’t Matter. Responding on social media, Tory leadership candidate James Cleverly said: ""'You’re not properly black if you’re a Tory' is a particularly pernicious attack. ""I’ve been called a coconut too many times to laugh it off.  ""It hasn’t held me back or brought me down, but a Conservative peer not recognising the abuse of other black colleagues is unacceptable."" After the 2010 general election, Baroness Warsi made history by becoming the first Muslim woman in the cabinet as co-chair of the Conservative Party. A former solicitor with the Crown Prosecution Service, she then served as a minister in David Cameron’s government. But she quit as the minister for faith and communities in 2014 over the government’s policy on the Israel-Gaza conflict. She has since criticised the party's inquiry into Islamophobia inquiry and called it “institutionally xenophobic and racist”. Resigning the Conservative whip means she will no longer be affiliated with the party in the House of Lords, where she has sat as a peer since 2007. The party is still choosing its next leader, with the final four candidates set to make speeches at the conference in Birmingham. An intensive round of hustings and multiple votes will follow the conference from 8 October, lasting three days, until only two candidates are left. Conservative Party members will then choose which of the final two candidates they want as the new leader, with the result announced on 2 November."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lw0081e1yo,Sweden blames Iran for cyber-attack after Quran burnings,"Sweden's security service says 15,000 messages were sent after several Quran-burning incidents.",24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Sweden's security service Sapo has accused Iranian intelligence of hacking into a text messaging service to send 15,000 messages to Swedes. Sapo said the data breach in summer last year involved SMS messages calling for ""revenge against Quran-burners"", after several anti-Islam activists set fire to copies of the Islamic holy book. Iran's embassy in Stockholm has rejected the accusations, calling them ""baseless"" and harmful to the two countries' relations. But Sweden says investigators found a cyber group called Anzu, acting for Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), that had sought to create division in society and paint Sweden as an Islamophobic country. Sweden's government condemned the Quran burnings at the time and police tried to ban them, but they were allowed by the courts under freedom of expression laws. The incidents led to outrage in several Muslim-majority countries, and Sweden's embassy in Iraq was set alight by protesters. Last month, Swedish prosecutors charged an Iraqi activist and an accomplice with incitement against an ethnic group in connection with the book-burnings. Both men deny wrongdoing. According to a preliminary investigation led by prosecutors, the Anzu group were said to have hacked into a Swedish company's SMS-service and taken over passwords, usernames and other tools at the end of July 2023, before sending a message to private individuals on 1 August that ""those who insulted the Quran must be punished for their work"". Fredrik Hallstrom of Sapo told the Dagens Nyheter website that a number of people involved in the operation were linked to the Revolutionary Guards and that the text messages had partially succeeded in adding further fuel to the threat against Sweden. Prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said that investigators had succeeded in identifying the Iranian hackers' identities, but that there was no way they could be extradited and their preliminary inquiry had been shelved. The security service warned that foreign powers such as Iran were seizing on opportunities to create division and bolster their own regimes. Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said in a statement that it was very serious that a state actor such as Iran was aiming to ""destabilise Sweden or increase polarisation in our country"". This is not the first time that Sweden's security service has accused Iran's government of carrying out hostile acts on its territory. Last May Sapo said Tehran had used criminal networks in Sweden to carry out violent acts against other states, groups or individuals in Sweden that Iran considered a threat. It identified Iran, alongside Russia and China, as posing the greatest security threats to Sweden."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvglk3md4e3o,"Iran may be behind attacks on Israeli embassies, Sweden says",Blasts and gunfire were reported near the Israeli embassies in Copenhagen and Stockholm earlier this week.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Sweden's security service Sapo has said that Iran may have been involved in the explosions and gunfire that took place near the Israeli embassies in Stockholm and Copenhagen earlier this week. Fredrik Hallstrom of Sapo said that choice of targets and methods pointed in the direction of Iran, but added this was an “assumption rather than pure knowledge”. On Monday evening, shots were fired at the Israeli embassy in Stockholm. Nobody was injured. Two explosions were then reported near the Israeli embassy in central Copenhagen in the early hours of Wednesday.  Two Swedish teenagers aged 16 and 19 were arrested at the Copenhagen train station later that afternoon. One of them had reportedly bought tickets to Amsterdam. On Thursday, the two were charged with possessing hand grenades and denotating them near the embassy.  They have pleaded not guilty and have been remanded in custody until 30 October. A third Swedish national who was arrested near the embassy was later released. Danish police have not confirmed whether the Israeli embassy was the target of the explosions. There are other embassies close to the road junction were the blasts were heard. This is not the first time that incidents of this kind take place near Israeli embassies in a Nordic capital. In January, a ""dangerous object"" was found outside the Israeli embassy in Stockholm and destroyed in what the Israeli ambassador called an ""attempted attack"". At the time, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the situation was ""very serious"" and promised to tighten the surveillance of the embassy and of Jewish institutions. And in May, gunshots were heard around the same embassy. A number of teenagers were investigated in connection with the shooting, although several were later released. After that incident, Sapo warned that the Iranian government was recruiting Swedish gang members to carry out violent acts against other groups and individuals in Sweden. Last month, Sapo also accused Iranian intelligence of hacking into a text messaging service to send 15,000 messages to Swedes aimed at creating divisions in society and painting Sweden as an Islamophobic country.  The messages were sent around the time that Swedish anti-Islam activists set fire to copies of the Islamic holy book. Iran's embassy in Stockholm rejected the accusations, calling them ""baseless"" and harmful to the two countries' relations."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced0vp2z38jo,Ex-minister suggests Welsh Tory leader should go,Ex-Welsh secretary says his party in the Senedd needs a refresh and suggests its leader should go.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Conservative former cabinet minister has cast doubt on whether Andrew RT Davies should lead the Tories into the next Senedd election. Stephen Crabb warned that the 2026 vote would be ""tough"" for the party, and that it ""probably"" needed a leadership ""refresh"". ""If the party needs to change in order to survive, it's harder to do that when you always have the same personalities in place,"" said Crabb, who was in the cabinet as Welsh secretary and also work and pensions secretary. The Senedd Tory leader rejected Crabb's comments, saying he was ""up for the fight in 2026"". Davies is currently on his second stint as leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd: his first ran from 2012 to 2018, and he returned in 2021. He has been under pressure in recent months after he was accused of ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by a Muslim group, and over inappropriate language from one of his politicians. Speaking to James Williams on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Crabb warned that the Conservatives were not well positioned for the next Senedd election in 2026. ""I think it's going to be a tough Senedd election. Reform will be looking to build on the gains they've made electorally... there was an awful lot of people voting for Reform in July."" He said the party had not been ""good enough at providing alternative policies"". Asked if Davies was the right leader for the next Senedd election, Crabb said: ""I don't like making it about personalities."" But he added: ""If you're asking me do I think there needs to be refresh of the Welsh party and the Welsh leadership, probably yes. ""If the party needs to change in order to survive, it's harder to do that when you always have the same personalities in place."" He ruled himself out of standing in the 2026 Senedd election: ""I spent the last couple of months pursuing other options. ""I think to do that, you've got to do it with a single mind and not with one foot stuck in the past."" Andrew RT Davies told BBC Wales he is still the right person to lead the Welsh Conservatives into the next Senedd election. He refuted Stephen Crabb’s comments and said he was “up for the fight in 2026”. Asked if he was the right man for the election, he said: “Very much so. I’m up for making that change agenda resonating in communities across the whole of Wales.” He added: “I never need to look over my shoulder because I’ve got a mirror to look in all the time [to see] whose behind me. “Because politics is always about making sure that no one gets too close to you, otherwise the knife might go in.” One former MP said it was ""not a time for further turmoil and infighting"" in the party. Asked if she agreed with the suggestion from former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb that Andrew RT Davies should go, the former Tory MP for Wrexham Sarah Atherton said: ""We need to prove to the country that we are unified and cohesive going forward."" The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd group chairman, Sam Kurtz, said he and the Senedd group had ""full confidence"" in Davies. ""I think we're working tirelessly to come forward with a plethora of policies that will be attractive to all voters in Wales in 2026,"" the Member of the Senedd for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire added. The discussion comes after former Downing Street PR chief Guto Harri said the Conservatives in the Senedd needed ""new leadership"" . He said they were not just ""there to draw a pay cheque"". Crabb was MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire until the summer general election, when he lost his seat, as did all other Welsh Conservatives. He had served as chairman of the Commons' Welsh Affairs Select Committee, and in frontbench roles under David Cameron and Theresa May. The former MP spoke as his party met in Birmingham for its annual UK party conference, amid a leadership contest to replace former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Crabb said it had been clear the party was going to suffer a ""massive defeat  in July"" because of a ""huge loss of trust in the Conservative government"". He hoped the next Tory leader would ""occupy the centre ground"". ""Culture wars, the war on woke,"" he said, ""isn't the thing that's going to persuade somebody languishing on a hospital waiting list that they'll see public services improve."" Separately on Monday, UK Tory leadership contender Tom Tugendhat promised that he would include a Conservative Senedd member in his shadow cabinet, alongside others from the Scottish Parliament and councils in England, if he was to win."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wkxv9d99vo,Antisemitic incidents in US surge to record high - report,"The Anti-Defamation League identified 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the year after the 7 October attacks.",7 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Reports of antisemitic incidents in the US have reached a record high since last year's Hamas attack in Israel, according to a preliminary report from the Anti-Defamation League Center for Extremism (ADL). The group found more than 10,000 incidents from 7 October 2023 to 24 September of this year, more than a 200% increase compared to the same period a year earlier.  It is the highest ever since the ADL began tracking such incidents in 1979.  The report comes just days after the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a joint statement warning of possible violent threats amid the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East.  Since last October’s Hamas attack on Israel which saw around 1,200 people killed ""Jewish Americans haven’t had a single moment of respite,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.  “Instead, we’ve faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere.” The more than 10,000 episodes of antisemitism reported by the ADL included roughly 8,015 incidents of verbal or written harassment, 1,840 incidents of vandalism and 150 incidents of physical assault. The states with the highest number of recorded cases in the report were California, with 1,266 incidents, New York with 1,218, New Jersey with 830, and Florida with 463.  The ADL said that it expected its preliminary numbers to increase as it receives more data. The final report for 2024 will be published in the spring of 2025. Part of the overall increase comes from a change in methodology to include ""expressions of opposition to Zionism, as well as support for resistance against Israel or Zionists that could be perceived as supporting terrorism"", the ADL said.  The ADL's preliminary report tallied more than 3,000 of incidents that took place during anti-Israel rallies ""which featured regular explicit expressions of support for terrorist groups"", including Hamas and Hezbollah.  Excluding these incidents, the ADL counted 7,523 episodes of antisemitism, a 103% increase from 2022.  Following the 7 October attack, Israel launched a massive military operation in the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.  Since then, 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and more than 97,000 injured in Gaza, most of them women and children, the Hamas-run health ministry says.  The war inspired a wave of demonstrations across the US, particularly at college campuses, with many protesting against the growing humanitarian toll.  In Lebanon, more than 1,000 people have been killed while up to a million people may have been displaced since Israel launched its attack against Iran-backed Hezbollah.  The continued violence in the region has led to a surge in anti-Muslim and Islamophobic incidents as well across the US.  Anti-Muslim incidents reached 8,061 in 2023, according to a report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released in April. The report marked the highest level since CAIR began tallying nearly 30 years ago, with nearly half coming after the 7 October attack."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj47p4lnepo,ITV says Balls interview with wife Cooper was fair,"Ofcom will not investigate 16,000 complaints made about a Good Morning Britain episode in August.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"ITV's chief executive has defended Ed Balls' interview with his wife, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, on Good Morning Britain - but said they would not do it again. Dame Carolyn McCall was speaking after media regulator Ofcom announced it will not investigate more than 16,000 complaints about an episode of the ITV breakfast show on 5 August. That morning, Balls and co-host Kate Garraway interviewed Cooper about the government's response to violent unrest in parts of the UK. ""It was a very, very tricky morning, there was a national emergency almost being called, and so we got very short notice that the home secretary was coming on the show,"" Dame Carolyn said. ""She was doing a whole round [of interviews], but it was unexpected, and we believe that it was fair and impartial,"" she told the Royal Television Society London Conference on Tuesday. ""And actually Ofcom just ruled, but amazingly no-one has picked up on the fact, that Ofcom are not pursuing these complaints, because they believe it's fair, balanced and impartial. ""So would we do it again? No. Was it impartial, fair and balanced? And did they behave professionally? Yes. ""I mean, he asked her a few questions, but I think Kate was leading on that wasn't she? And so I do think you've just got to say, if Ofcom have looked at it and they're not pursuing this any further because they thought it was fair balanced and impartial, you know, that's it."" Balls, a former Labour minister, is now a regular GMB presenter; Cooper, his wife, was appointed home secretary following the general election in July. They have been married since 1998. Ofcom said it carefully considered the complaints of a conflict of interest. But a spokesperson said: ""Taking into account that their relationship was made clear twice, that a range of views about Labour's handling of the riots were included in the programme as a whole, and given the vast majority of the interview was conducted by co-presenter, Kate Garraway, we will not be pursuing further."" Ofcom added that it had issued guidance warning ITV to ""take particular care over the compliance of such interviews in future to ensure due impartiality"". Some of the complaints about the episode related to how Balls and Garraway questioned Coventry South MP Zarah Sultana in a separate interview. In response, Ofcom said: ""In our view, Ms Sultana was given ample opportunity to express her views and respond to the questions put to her, while we consider the robust line of questioning would be consistent with regular viewers' expectations of interviews with political figures on this programme."" In the item, Sultana, who previously sat as a Labour MP before she had the whip suspended in July, said the government should describe the riots as Islamophobic as well as racist, and challenged Balls on an article he had previously written about immigration. Writing afterwards on X, she said: ""The sneering contempt of 'journalists' will never stop me from calling out racism and Islamophobic hate."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9qlzl310o,School shuts X account over 'racism' on platform,"The head says young people on the app ""were drawn into lies and racism"" during the summer riots.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Welsh secondary school has said it is closing its account on X - formerly known as Twitter - over concerns about racism on the social media platform. The head teacher of Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf in Cardiff said a decision was made by governors to ""move away from the platform"".  Matthew HT Evans also called for other organisations such as the Welsh government and school inspectors Estyn to consider if they should remain on it.  X, which was bought for $44bn (£38.1bn) in 2022 by the billionaire Elon Musk, has been contacted for a response.  Speaking to BBC Cymru Fyw, Mr Evans said he was ""shocked"" over messages appearing on the platform during the summer, when rioting broke out in several areas of England and Northern Ireland following the murder of three girls in Southport. ""During the hate riots in the summer, we were able to see young people and children on the streets who were drawn into the lies and racism that was going on, which was disturbing,"" he said. ""You were seeing comments that made you feel uncomfortable about the clear racism that was going on that platform,"" he said.  After the killings in Southport, a false name - attributed to the 17-year-old suspect - spread like wildfire across X. There were false claims the attacker was a refugee who arrived in the UK by boat in 2023 and unfounded speculation he is Muslim - some of these posts were accompanied by Islamophobic and racist hate. The site's owner Mr Musk also shared a post from far-right activist and convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson. Yaxley-Lennon, who had been banned on the platform until Musk took over, had taken aim at Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for his comments after riots broke out. Mr Musk also posted on X predicting civil war in the UK and repeatedly attacking the prime minister. The head of Glantaf said that since the school returned in September, concerns had been reflected in conversations with staff and with parents who felt uncomfortable. However, he said the school has also received ""very vehement"" messages about freedom of speech and freedom of information.   ""As far as we were concerned, it was not a matter of freedom of speech. Messages of hate and racism are another matter,"" he added.  The school was Cardiff's first Welsh-medium secondary school when it opened in 1978, and according to its latest Estyn report, has more than 1,300 pupils. It has decided that it will use now start using the social platform Instagram,  although that will remain under scrutiny.  ""We will review it, as I'm not sure if Instagram is the right platform and ultimately we may have to consider that social platforms are not suitable for schools to communicate on,"" said Mr Evans.  He also wondered if other organisations using X will follow suit.  ""My feeling is you've got a large number of organisations that are on this platform – Estyn, Welsh government, county councils – and I think there's a question for them all to how long they're going to continue on this platform?"" he said.  The Welsh government said it keeps the accounts it uses ""under ongoing review."" ""We recognise the concerns raised about the management of X in recent months, but believe it is important to continue to engage with as many people as possible and provide clear, trusted information.” A spokesperson for Estyn said: ""Our social media is an important way in which we share effective practice across education providers. ""We regularly review our social media channels and continue to monitor our engagement on X as part of this review activity."" The Welsh Local Government Association, which represents councils, declined to comment."

Organisations across Merseyside have been invited to apply for a share of £100,000 to run projects which would promote diversity, equality and inclusion in the wake of recent violent disorder. The funding comes from money taken from criminals through the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) which is then invested into good causes in communities through the Community Cashback Fund. Emily Spurrell said the move would ""tackle hate crime at the earliest opportunity and focus on building and improving community cohesion and resilience"". ""The scenes of violence we saw in our region last month were shocking and appalling,"" Ms Spurrell said. ""It was not protest. It was mindless crime and disorder motivated and manipulated by racism and islamophobia and all those involved are now feeling the full force of the law."" She said it was ""a sad reminder that if stereotypes and hate-fuelled attitudes are allowed to fester it can lead to very serious crimes that have devastating consequences on many lives"". But she added in the wake of the riots people ""saw the very best of our region as communities came together to help each other to cope and recover"". She said: ""Through this funding we want to support those brilliant local organisations which are working to prevent crime and make their areas safer and stronger. ""By taking the cash out of the pockets of those who bring misery to our communities and investing it into these projects, we can effectively turn bad money into good."" About 20 grants have been made available for projects which have a focus on improving understanding of minority communities, raising awareness of the impact of hate crime and challenging harmful attitudes towards other people. The fund is being managed by the Community Foundation for Merseyside and applications can be made until 14 October.

The Executive Office committee has been hearing from local groups on how racist violence has affected their communities. It was also told that some ethnic minority groups have been ""advised by the PSNI to consult, negotiate or listen to community leaders with a link to paramilitary organisations"". The focus comes after a summer of racially motivated violence including disorder, street violence and targeted attacks. The PSNI has described a recent rise in the number of reported race hate crimes as ""stark"". One of the witnesses was Beverly Simpson, representing the North West Migrants' Forum, she told the committee ""whether it is one member or a hundred members, proscribed organisations are engaged in repeat harassment, intimidation and attacks against ethnic minorities communities"". She said it ""is not acceptable"" to be told to negotiate with leaders with paramilitary links.  ""Our community members report being advised by the PSNI to consult, negotiate or listen to community leaders with a link to paramilitary organisations. This is not acceptable in any democratic, peaceful society."" She went on to say the executive has ""a duty protect the human rights of all its citizens. We need robust action on paramilitary violence"". The PSNI have been contacted for a response.  Dr Naomi Green, from the Belfast Islamic Centre said there are nearly 12,000 Muslims in Northern Ireland and that 4000 of them are children. She said that because of violence and disorder ""many are now contemplating leaving Northern Ireland"". When speaking about the disorder in August she said: ""The initial police response was disappointing but we are grateful that the police have responded swiftly since. ""It's not enough to react when hate surfaces, the underlying causes that allow it to fester must be addressed. Racism and islamophobia intersect and there is a longstanding failure to address either of these in NI."" She also called out superficial responses with the issue of racism and said there needs to be ""real meaningful engagement to tackle racism...not tick box exercises"". Dr Green also spoke about the discourse surrounding the August protests and violence. She said: ""There are voices within the political and media space who continue to speak of legitimate concerns in a way that subtly excuses attacks and prejudice on minority communities in NI.  ""There is nothing legitimate about fuelling resentment and scapegoating Muslims or other minorities for complex issues like housing shortages or economic difficulties and you will not resolve them by scapegoating us."" Mr Takura Donald Makoni, from the African and Caribbean Support Organisation NI, told the committee that funding is not getting to the organisations run by and for migrants and ethnic minority groups. ""What benefit is an Open Botanic event, which is a cultural event, which costs £40,000...it's not for us, it's making yourself feel good for doing something which actually has no outcome for the community that you're being funded to service. ""This is ubiquitous in the third sector,"" he added. Mr Muhammed Atif is a representative of the Belfast Multi-Cultural Association. He asked the committee: ""When do I stop being an immigrant, is there a timeline? It's been 16 years. My kids have not seen any other country. ""Please do not call us immigrants anymore."" Mr Atif is a business owner and said he has invested a lot in Northern Ireland: ""200 jobs I've created...I've opened and successfully run multiple business, I'm proud of that"". ""Do you know how many locals I employ? 99%, but I am not local,"" he added."

Alex Hutton, 19, left the victim hospitalised after using mixed martial arts moves on her, said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It said Hutton, from Morriston, Swansea, held extreme racist, transphobic and homophobic views. Hutton, also known as Alex Edwards, appeared before Winchester Crown Court in Hampshire after pleading guilty to terror offences and an assault motivated by hostility toward the victim because she was trans. He was sentenced to a total of five years and four months in custody, plus an extended sentence with a further five years on licence. Hutton had previously been convicted of offences under the Terrorism Act and arrested last November. The arrest came after South Wales Police received a report from a member of the public that they had seen a video on Hutton’s Instagram in which he claimed to have kicked an unidentified person in the head. The video also contained far right imagery. Hutton was subject to a Criminal Behaviour Order restricting his use of the internet and mobile phones after previous convictions for possessing terrorist documents and publishing statements that encouraged terrorism, the CPS said. It added that police investigated his phone use and found he had distributed extreme videos encouraging and glorifying terrorism. There were references to ""cleansing London"" of non-white people and Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, homophobic and transphobic messages.  He shared Nazi extremism and racist videos from the Ku Klux Klan, and bragged about planning terrorist attacks, the CPS said. He spread messages on Instagram and messaging app Telegram where he talked  of wanting to kill anybody who was not white. ""Alex Hutton, motivated by hate, engaged in a horrendous and unprovoked attack on a defenceless young girl who was minding her own business one afternoon in a Swansea park in May 2023,"" said Counter Terrorism Policing Wales investigations chief Det Ch Insp Leanne Williams. ""There is no doubt that the attack will have lasting effects on this young person and I really hope today’s outcome provides her with some comfort."" Hutton, she said, demonstrated a ""clear intention"" to spread his hatred across the internet encouraging acts of terrorism.  Bethan David, of the CPS, said Hutton was a ""dangerous young man"", adding that his ""unprovoked attack was driven by hate and he poses a substantial risk to other groups and society as a whole"". ""He celebrated terrorist acts of white supremacy and encouraged his friends and associates on various social media and messaging platforms to join him in his extreme and disturbing views,"" she added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevjvw9jl8eo,Double killer wins compensation for solitary confinement,"Fuad Awale suffered ""severe depression"" when he was denied contact with other inmates, judges hear.",16 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A double murderer who also held a prison officer hostage has been awarded compensation after suffering ""severe depression"" when he was denied contact with other inmates.  Fuad Awale is serving a life sentence for shooting two men in the head in 2011 in what a judge described as a planned ""execution"".  Awale had been transferred to a special unit for the UK's most dangerous prisoners in 2013 after he and another inmate ambushed the officer and threatened to kill him.  However, a court heard he experienced mental health issues after being denied association with other inmates in the unit, partly due to risks reportedly posed by the so-called Death Before Dishonour anti-Muslim prison gang.   Awale, from Milton Keynes, claimed the gang stopped him from associating with other inmates in HMP Manchester and other prisons.  In a judgment from the High Court, judge Mrs Justice Ellenbogan concluded that Awale's rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been breached.  ""The degree of interference with the claimant's private life which has resulted from his removal from association has been of some significance and duration,"" she wrote. Awale, then 25, was sentenced to a minimum of 38 years in January 2013 after shooting Abdi Farah, 19, and Amin Ahmed Ismail, 18, in an alleyway in Milton Keynes over a drugs dispute.  The court heard Awale was also assessed to ""hold extremist beliefs"" following the 2013 hostage attempt, in which demands were made to release the radical cleric Abu Qatada.  At one stage, Awale requested to be allowed to associate with one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby, the Manchester soldier murdered in 2013 by Islamic extremists Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale in Woolwich.  That request was denied owing to ""counter-terrorism concerns"", the court heard.  However Awale's lawyers argued he had been classed as suitable for association with other prisoners within the tightly controlled units known as the Close Supervision Centre - which consists of 68 places across the UK's prison estate. For several years he was able to mix with several other pre-assessed prisoners and attend Friday Prayers, until a fight among the group meant it was disbanded.  Awale was told he could join another association group with a prisoner referred to as GV - however the court heard that man was a member of Death Before Dishonour and had attacked Muslims before.  In October 2019, Awale was moved to HMP Manchester and was told he would be able to associate with two other prisoners in the supervision centre area.  However after his arrival, he was told the men ""posed a threat to him"" and there were no prisoners suitable for him to associate with in that unit.  He told the court he later heard the men were also members of the Death Before Dishonour gang - which the court heard are dedicated to the ""eradication of Muslims from the prison system"".  Awale remained in Manchester throughout 2020 and initially ""engaged with staff"", but that relationship deteriorated due to what Awale described as his ""depressed state"".  In January 2021, Awale punched a prison officer in the face - a strike he claimed he made in ""self-defence"" - and a series of moves across the prison estate began.  Awale has been held in HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes since 2021 and had not associated with any other prisoners since 17 March, 2023.  His lawyers argued the decisions to deny association were ""opaque"", that he had been denied the chance to argue his case and prison managers had failed to regularly review his segregated conditions as required by law.  Awale also argued that the Secretary of State for Justice had failed to take into account the high numbers of racist and Islamophobic prisoners in the supervision centre, making it difficult to find suitable groups for him to associate with.  Justice Ellenbogan allowed the claim on all grounds.  The court ruled that Awale would be entitled to non-pecuniary damages at an amount to be determined later.  The Ministry of Justice said: ""We acknowledge the court’s judgement and will carefully consider the findings.""

The Women’s Empowered Minds project was set up by Abbas Najib, chief executive officer of Better Communities Bradford (BCB).  It is a charitable incorporated organisation (CIO) which has offered free therapy and group sessions to women for the past five years. Mr Najib said grants of £600,000 from the Henry Smith Foundation and the National Lottery Better Communities Fund will enable it to run for another three years and hold five classes each week. ""The funding equals about £200,000 a year,"" Mr Najib said. ""It provides sewing classes for about 100 women a week plus about fifty hours of mental health therapy for one-on-one sessions and group therapy for the same women."" He said the project started off small providing services for women in the BD7 area. ""It was a demand that had been expressed by the local residents. ""We've been providing them for about five years now and this year we've secured funding for the next three years and are able to run five classes a week."" According to BCB, 150 to 200 women benefit each month from some kind of mental health therapy. Referrals can be from GPs, friends or family and by direct contact. Mr Najib said issues tackled included isolation, depression, anxiety, couples' and family counselling, as well as bereavement.  ""The majority of our beneficiaries are from BD7 - Lidget Green, Scholemoor and the like,"" he said. ""Around 90 to 95% of the users are from the South Asian community. That reflects the area's demographic.  ""Of course we also have users who are white English, Eastern European, and we have users who are from African heritage."" Mr Najib said many of the issues experienced by those who use BCB's services were similar to those of other women across the country. ""When the recent Islamophobic riots happened, South Asian women were more isolated as a result,"" he said.  ""Mosques being targeted, people of colour being singled out and anti-Muslim chants being expressed.

The announcement follows posts on social media by the far-right leader Tommy Robinson, who said in July that a ""pro-UK peaceful protest"" would be held in Glasgow this month. An anti-racism rally is being organised in response. Scotland's prosecution service is instructing police to remand suspects in custody and cases will be fast-tracked through the courts. Police Scotland said it had no specific intelligence to suggest any disorder was going to take place. A letter from the Solicitor General for Scotland, Ruth Charteris, to Audrey Nicoll MSP, the convener of the Scottish Parliament's criminal justice committee, commented on the disorder and riots seen in England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport. She said the disorder was ""motivated by hate, racism and prejudice"" and called for a robust response to ensure that public confidence was maintained and further offending deterred. She said those arrested should expect to be remanded in custody to appear in court at the earliest opportunity. They can also expect prosecutors to oppose their release on bail to ""ensure that public safety is prioritised"". ""To ensure that justice is delivered swiftly, prosecutors will prioritise such cases ahead of existing investigations in order to bring the accused before the court at the earliest opportunity,"" she said. ""These arrangements will be kept under review for as long as necessary and it is my hope that there continues to be no such offending in Scotland."" She added that Scottish prosecutors were committed to tackling crimes motivated by hatred and prejudice, whether committed on social media or in person, and had a range of tools available to deal with reports of that nature robustly. ""In the event that such offending takes place in Scotland, I will ensure that the committee is updated on the actions taken by prosecutors to deliver swift and robust justice,"" she said. First Minister John Swinney told the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday that the disorder seen in England and Northern Ireland should not be classed as protests. ""This was violence and thuggery pure and simple, perpetrated by those with a far-right ideology, by those who had been taken in by that rhetoric, and by criminals,"" he said. ""Far from having legitimate concerns, those indulging in these mindless acts were doing so from a place of racism, Islamophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment. ""This cannot, and should not, be tolerated anywhere."" He added: ""We cannot take the view that we may be immune from related disorder occurring on our own doorstep. ""We must guard against prejudice, discrimination and misinformation that aim to incite hatred and violence. ""Let me be clear to anyone in Scotland considering mimicking the kind of vile behaviour we have witnessed in parts of England and Northern Ireland this summer that their actions will not be tolerated, they will be dealt with robustly and criminal actions online will be taken just as seriously."""

The 310 bus runs every 20 minutes between Stamford Hill in Hackney and Golders Green in Barnet. It was launched in response to longstanding requests from the Jewish community for a service connecting the neighbourhoods, the mayor's office said. Sadiq Khan said that creating the route, which operates from 07:00 to 19:00 daily, was one of his re-election pledges. Mr Khan told BBC London: ""For 16 years now the Jewish communities in Stamford Hill and Golders Green have been lobbying for a direct link between those two communities. ""I was struck by the conversations I've had in recent months with the Jewish community. ""They were frightened because of a massive increase of antisemitism since October 7 last year.  ""I was told stories by families who, where they changed buses from Stamford Hill to Golders Green at Finsbury Park, they were frightened about the abuse they had received."" The Met Police recorded 2,065 antisemitic hate crime incidents between October  and July. Of the 2,065 reports, 390 took place in Barnet, 277 in Westminster, 250 in Hackney and 190 in Camden. Mr Khan said the new bus route ""connects communities, connects congregations"" and would reassure Jewish Londoners they would be ""safe when they travel between these two communities"". ""We have heard stories of Jewish Londoners receiving verbal abuse,"" Mr Khan added. ""We've also heard stories about Jewish Londoners not leaving their homes... because they're worried about their safety. ""I don't want any Londoner to be scared to leave their home because they're worried about public transport. ""I think we've got to recognise the fear that Londoners feel who are Jewish, we've got to recognise the tremors of hate that are felt by Jewish people across the country. ""We've got to be good allies to our Jewish friends and neighbours."" Antisemitic hate crimes rose by 278.9% - with 2,068 offences recorded - in the 12 months to July, compared with the preceding year, according to Met Police data. In the same time frame, according to the force's data, it recorded a total of 3,869 faith-related hate crime incidents, including 1,370 Islamophobic hate crime incidents. There were also 2,642 homophobic-related hate crime offences in that period. According to the data, in total the Met Police dealt with just under 21,000 offences treated as hate crime incidents. The London Jewish Forum and the Board of Deputies of British Jews said they were ""delighted"" with the bus route. ""This bus provides a significant enhancement for our strictly Orthodox community,"" they said in a statement. The 310 trial is the first direct bus service connecting Stamford Hill and Golders Green and has cost Transport for London (TfL) more than £3,160,000.  It runs parallel to the 253 between Stamford Hill and Finsbury Park station, and the 210 between Finsbury Park station and Golders Green. TfL is running a public consultation on the route over the next 12 months. Geoff Hobbs, TfL’s director of public transport service planning, urged passengers to provide feedback on the service via its consultation. Route 310 includes stops at Highgate Village, Whittington Hospital and Finsbury Park.  05/09/2024: This story has been updated to reflect the latest Metropolitan Police data on levels of hate crime in London.

Nathan Thompson, 25, from Newcastle, had previously admitted nine counts of inciting racial hatred and two malicious communications offences between April and July last year. Using two accounts on Twitter, now known as X, he shared and reposted offensive, extreme right-wing messages about religious groups, ethnic minorities and the LGBTQ+ community, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Thompson thanked Judge Julie Clemitson for giving him a chance, to which she replied: ""Make sure you don't waste it."" Sentencing, Judge Clemiston told Thompson his posts celebrated Hitler, fascists and those who had committed terror attacks around the world. She said: ""Each homophobic, transphobic, Islamophobic, antisemitic, racist or fascist tweet fans the flames of division and hatred."" But she did not impose an immediate custodial sentence, saying Thompson had ""borderline"" learning difficulties and was isolated, spending a great deal of time in his bedroom on his computer. The judge imposed a 16-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, with a series of requirements including that his use of the internet should be closely monitored by police or probation officers. At a previous hearing, Gregg Stephens, defending, said: ""He is a young lad who is quite isolated and socially vulnerable. ""He has mental health issues, doesn't mix with people and spends a lot of time on his computer. ""He has got himself connected to this right-wing stuff which you can find online.""

After watching the footage in court, district judge Sunil Khanna concluded Dixon had thrown ""the first punch"" and sentenced him to four months in prison. Campion, of Whitcombe Gardens, Nottingham, was the second man to be sentenced in relation to the incident, the CPS said. He was jailed for four months after pleading guilty to the same charge on 16 August. A third man charged with the same offence, Witney, of Tennyson Avenue, Gedling, was handed a suspended sentence on Friday. He was given a three-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Nine people have so far appeared in court following their part in the unrest in the Nottingham city centre. They were among 20 people arrested during the demonstrations, when rival groups were separated by officers. The events in the city, however, were described by police as ""largely peaceful"" at the time. Janine McKinney, from the CPS, said: ""The arrests, charges, convictions and sentences we have seen over the last weeks make clear the consequences for those criminals on our streets and on social media. These individuals have paid the penalty that awaits anyone caught wreaking such havoc. ""We will continue to work at pace, alongside partners in the criminal justice system, to put anyone whose conduct has crossed the line into criminal behaviour before the courts to face the full consequences of their actions.""

Sadiq Khan said the city was “united against all forms of hate”, as he pledged £10,000 to help protect Muslims against Islamophobic attacks. The extra support comes as people shared their safety fears following the recent racist riots and disorder across the country. City Hall said the mayoral funding will be used to provide the sessions on protective security, safety processes and online safety. Mr Khan had been urged earlier this month to ensure places of worship had extra security. Hina Bokhari, the London Assembly’s Liberal Democrat group leader, said many Muslims had become “extremely worried” by the “unacceptable” spread of hate crimes. Tell MAMA, the organisation working to tackle anti-Muslim hatred, told Reuters that it had received more than 500 calls and online reports of Islamophobic incidents from across the UK since the start of the disorder two weeks ago. The mayor said: “I’m proud that last week Londoners sent a clear message that we are an open and welcoming city that is united against all forms of hate."" He praised the ""peaceful shows of unity on our streets"", which he said were ""inspiring and comforting"". ""However, the violence and disorder that was seen across the country has left many Londoners afraid,"" added Mr Khan.  ""There is no room for complacency. We can never stop being vigilant."" He said he was working ""closely"" with the government, the Metropolitan Police and community leaders ""to ensure that Londoners feel safe, and are safe"".

Paul Dixon, 35, had been drinking with friends on 3 August, when thousands gathered in the city centre for a pre-planned protest, a court heard. The railway safety supervisor, of Broadwood Road in Bestwood, Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty at Nottingham Magistrates' Court to the charge of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. Dixon, who was identified by police from a YouTube video, was arrested on Wednesday at his girlfriend's home where officers found him in possession of cannabis, which he also pleaded guilty to. After watching the footage in court, district judge Sunil Khanna concluded Dixon had thrown ""the first punch"" and sentenced him to four months in prison. ""You were very, very lucky this was not affray,"" he told Dixon, adding his sentencing powers were ""limited"". Mr Khanna said: ""I also have to bear in mind that thankfully it did not get any worse but there was a chance it could have."" Earlier on Thursday, another defendant charged with offences during the Nottingham protests appeared in court. Kevin Musgrave, 37, admitted grabbing a police officer's arm as his girlfriend was detained when hundreds of people gathered near the Brian Clough Statue in King Street. The court heard that Musgrave, of Derbyshire, was not involved in the protest itself, but was arrested for assault and criminal damage after he spat in a police vehicle. The self-employed roofer was given a six-month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. Mr Khanna told Musgrave: ""I must say, Mr Musgrave, it was touch and go. ""Had you been part of the main group, I would have sent you straight to prison."" Musgrave, of High Lane East in Ilkeston, was arrested after his partner Victoria Gray pushed a police officer and spat on another during the Nottingham protest - one of a number to take place across the UK on August 3. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had said Gray was detained after pushing an officer policing the protest in Long Row. The 42-year-old, also of High Lane East, shouted a series of offensive racist and homophobic comments and went on to spit on one of the officers arresting her, the CPS added. She pleaded guilty to a series of charges, including assaults and possession of a weapon, after she took a can of pepper spray to the scene.

Earlier this month, Clive Lewis, who represents Norwich South, claimed a link between attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and what he called ""rising Islamophobia"" in the UK. In response to Mr Lewis's comment, which he made in a post on X, the campaign group Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS) called for him to be suspended from the party. Now Mr Lewis has said attempts to ""shut down and silence"" politicians is a ""dangerous path"" and ""fundamentally wrong"". In a new post on X, he said: ""Combatting antisemitism and advocating for Palestinian human rights and addressing broader Islamophobia, are not mutually exclusive goals. ""We have a responsibility as politicians to ensure all minorities feel safe here in the UK and to advocate for the upholding of human rights abroad. ""Differences of opinion as how best to do this should, of course, always be encouraged. But attempting to shut down and silence those seeking to highlight these issues is a dangerous path and one that is fundamentally, wrong."" LAAS made an official complaint to UK Labour over Mr Lewis's original post, claiming it was ""highly irresponsible"" and breached the official definition of antisemitism. However, it is understood no further action would be taken by the party, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. A Labour spokesperson previously said all complaints were treated seriously and ""thoroughly assessed in line with its rules and procedures"". In his original post, Mr Lewis had written: ""The link between the daily inhumanity being metted [sic] out to Palestinians and rising Islamophobia in the UK, are not unconnected. ""The inhumanity being shown to one is giving 'permission' for the other. These actions diminish us all."" He also linked to a Guardian newspaper article about how dozens of people were reported dead after an Israeli attack on a school in Gaza. Mr Lewis’s comment came after the arrests of hundreds of people in connection with riots and anti-immigration protests across the UK. Alex Hearn, LAAS co-director, described the comments as ""extremely irresponsible"" and a ""conspiracy fantasy"". ""I put in the complaint because we have been seeing a pattern from the far right and across elements of the left that have been blaming Zionists and Israelis for the unrest that has been going on across the country,” he said. “The conflict going on thousands of miles away has no connection to the domestic cases that we have.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4yezz3v1po,Mum fears for children's safety after racist disorder,A Muslim mother in Northern Ireland said recent racist disorder has made parents concerned for children's safety.,28 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A mother-of-three has said she is ""hesitant and worried"" for her children's safety after recent protests and racist disorder in Northern Ireland. Faiza Ahmed, who lives in Bangor, is part of a group of 400 Muslim women across Northern Ireland that wrote a letter to Education Minister Paul Givan with concerns.  ""As mothers we were worried, we have young children and soon they will be going to school and we are worried about their safety, they are worried about their safety,"" she told BBC News NI. Mr Givan said risk assessments are being carried out at schools near to recent protests and racist disorder in Belfast. It follows recent racist disorder in Belfast which saw many ethnic minority owned businesses attacked.  The Muslim Mothers Collective wrote to Mr Givan to say they were ""deeply concerned"" following the incidents. A number of people, including under 18s, have since been charged in connection to the disorder. Ms Ahmed told BBC News NI that ""psychologically"" her children have been affected by the recent racist disorder.  Having enjoyed their school in Northern Ireland so far, Ms Ahmed said that ""it won't be the same, now they go back to school thinking, wondering and worrying"". Speaking earlier on BBC Radio Ulster’s Good Morning Ulster, Ms Ahmed said some parents were hesitant to send their children to school.  “We are not sure whether they will be safe or not,"" she said. “The children themselves are looking forward to going back to school, because we are not sure whether they will be safe or not.” Ms Ahmed said the summer months were “terrible” due to the disorder. “We could not go out because we were worried and this is the time when we thought we were going to spend with our children,” she added. “I have only been in Bangor for a year, so this was my opportunity to make memories, but after the events we couldn’t do that.” She said her youngest child was starting school on Wednesday. “I’m a little bit anxious, as she was leaving this morning she said to me: ’Mum is it safe?’. “I said it should be safe and she says ‘you know what the first thing I will do when I get to school is to hug my friends’. “It is very difficult, our children should be safe, they should be children, it’s not their duty to look into their security, it’s not their responsibility.” In a letter to Democratic Unionist Party politician Mr Givan, the Muslim Mothers Collective said they had been shocked by the intensity of recent events. They requested ""strong assurances"" their children will be safe when they return to school, and that schools take ""proactive measures to prevent racist and Islamophobic bullying"". In response, the minister set out plans including risk assessments. He said his department was working with principals to identify schools that ""may be vulnerable dependent on location, school cohort (i.e high numbers of newcomers) and nature of building"". Mr Givan acknowledged ""recent events may make it more difficult for children from ethnic minority communities"" to be happy, learning and succeeding at school. In response, Mr Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party said his department was involved with the Education Authority carrying out risk assessments ""on a number of schools located close to recent unrest and protests"".  He added they were working with principals to identify schools that ""may be vulnerable dependent on location, school cohort (i.e high numbers of newcomers) and nature of building"". ""Where necessary, maintenance work will be prioritised as well as guidance provided on managing emergency incidents,"" he said. The minister also said officials were working with Translink to ""reinforce transport guidance and the need for reasonable adjustments for potentially vulnerable pupils"". Mr Givan said he hoped his response would assure the Muslim Mothers Collective that the department would ensure schools were ""safe for all children within our community, irrespective of race or religion"" and added he would be happy to meet with them to discuss their concerns.  Ms Ahmed said she thought it was a “good response” from Mr Givan, but that it was important it delivered. “It gives us some reassurance that at least someone is looking into the matter, but again the real test is in the results, is it going to work..is it going to address the issues on the ground?” The secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers in Northern Ireland (NAHT) said that the prospect of risk assessments in schools is ""unthinkable"" and ""absolutely abhorrent"".  Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Graham Gault said that ""every single school leader in every single school across Northern Ireland would stand wholly behind the minister’s position on this issue"". ""All of our children must be free to enjoy their educational experiences in all of our schools in total uncompromised safety fully free from any threats."" Mr Gault told BBC News NI that school leaders will ""do whatever they can to work with whoever they can to protect our children"" and make all of their experiences ""safe and joyful""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj08mjmq107o,News Corp boss apologises for doing Nazi salute,"Patrick Delaney tried to explain the context of an old photo that showed him ""demonstrating"" the gesture.",19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The boss of Foxtel - a majority News Corp-owned cable television company in Australia - has ""unreservedly"" apologised after an image surfaced of him performing a Nazi salute.  Patrick Delaney said he believed he was showing ""the similarity"" between the gesture and one used by some fans of a Western Sydney soccer club when the photo was taken a decade ago. ""Regardless of the context, the fact I demonstrated this offensive salute was wrong,"" he said in an email to staff seen by the BBC. The Jewish Council of Australia condemned Mr Delaney's actions as ""deeply concerning"". “Equally [concerning] is that he operates in a media industry where he felt this was somehow okay,"" Sarah Schwartz, the council's executive officer, said in a statement on Monday. ""It shouldn't need to be said that the salute is an offensive and violent act not only for Jews, but also for other racialised groups."" In his internal memo, Mr Delaney said that he had been ""searching [his] mind"" for a circumstance where ""a photo capturing me in this pose could ever be possible"". He then explained that he believed he was impersonating a threatening gesture made by a group of Western Sydney Wanderers fans during the 2014-15 season, while visiting the set of a Fox Sports television program during his tenure as the channel’s CEO. Mr Delaney said the photograph - first published by Crikey - was ""completely inconsistent"" with his ""values, beliefs, and family connections"". He also condemned ""racism in all its forms"", pointing to his commitment to the 'Say No to Antisemitism letter' which he signed along with other prominent Australian leaders in the wake of the unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed in that attack, and 251 others were taken hostage. Mr Delaney added that he would continue to meet with Jewish leaders to ""express"" his ""deep remorse"". But Ms Schwartz said the idea that Mr Delaney could sign a letter condemning antisemitism, while also feeling comfortable doing a Nazi salute, was proof the nation needed ""more than superficial pledges"". The scandal comes at a time when Australia is grappling with a sharp uptick in both antisemitism and Islamophobia, amid rising community tension over the Israel-Gaza war. In July, the federal government installed a special envoy to combat antisemitism, while promising to appoint an Islamophobia equivalent in the coming months. During a visit to Sydney in November, Lachlan Murdoch called on News Corp's staff in Australia to ""address and tackle"" all forms of antisemitism and said there was ""no room for equivocation"" or fence-sitting on the issue.  Once a mainstay across the nation's homes, Foxtel's business model has been in sharp decline in recent years, after being displaced by the rise of cheaper international streaming services. Earlier this month, News Corp said it was considering selling the ailing pay TV company."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w69p2vz0lo,Scale of Rotherham abuse shocked man who exposed it,Journalist Andrew Norfolk says grooming gangs were brought to justice because of 'mainstream media'.,26 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The journalist who uncovered the Rotherham grooming gangs scandal has said that even he massively underestimated the scale of the abuse. Andrew Norfolk told the BBC on the 10th anniversary of the Jay Report that he had ""absolutely no idea"" it would name 1,400 girls as victims before the figure was announced at a bombshell press conference. Mr Norfolk had been putting pressure on Rotherham Council and South Yorkshire Police to answer questions about child sexual exploitation by predominantly Asian men since he started receiving tip-offs in 2011. His subsequent investigation for The Times had ""seismic"" ramifications and led to a major inquiry. Looking back at the impact of Professor Alexis Jay's findings in 2014, Mr Norfolk said that the outcome of his investigative work proved the value of the ""mainstream media"" in exposing crime and the failings of authorities. He admitted that he had had to balance his instinct to reveal the abuse with concerns that the story's publication would both stoke the reaction of the far-right and lead to accusations of racism. ""If you’d asked me the day before that press conference how many young teenage girls had been groomed and exploited in Rotherham over the time period the report covered, I would have guessed 150,” he said. He was “staggered” to hear Prof Jay reveal how 1,400 girls had been abused, trafficked to other cities, or had petrol poured on them. “They were treated like sub-human species for the pleasure of these men,” he added. Mr Norfolk had first identified a ""pattern"" of Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs exploiting white girls in the north of England and the Midlands in 2010, but came up against a ""conspiracy of silence"" when he tried to elicit responses from police forces and councils. He said that hearing Prof Jay explicitly refer to the perpetrators' ethnic backgrounds was an ""extraordinary"" moment. “It was so hard-hitting, she didn’t mince her words. The response was seismic across the world.” He added: “When the leader of Rotherham Council was asked by the Home Affairs Select Committee why it had ordered that inquiry, he said: ‘Because The Times wouldn't leave us alone’. That in itself, in 35 years of journalism, is vindication for being a journalist.” The Times had been called racist and Islamophobic for pursuing the investigation. “It was a very difficult story to cover because it was a story about white British girls, aged typically between 12 to 15, being groomed and abused by men who, as the pattern seemed to become more clear, were overwhelmingly of Pakistani and Muslim heritage,” he said. “It's not fun being regarded as somebody with abhorrent views, when in your heart, you know the opposite is the case.”  There were also fears about how far-right groups would react to the story, which did eventually lead to protests and marches descending on Rotherham. “It was a dream story for the far-right,” he said. “They had no interest in solutions, they were interested in exploiting the situation."" Ten years on, tensions remain in the town and recently came to the fore at the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers, near Rotherham, when a riot broke out outside the hotel, which housed asylum seekers, in the wake of the Southport knife attack. “There is such a danger in allowing people to blame ‘the other’, especially when your life itself isn't great,” he said. Mr Norfolk first became aware of cases in West Yorkshire when Ann Cryer, at the time the MP for Keighley, publicly raised concerns about the abuse of two girls in her constituency. “I'd noticed a handful of cases from local newspaper reports. Initially, I wanted to look away, which is shame on me, but then one particular incident happened.” Mr Norfolk heard a BBC radio report from Manchester Crown Court about nine men who had been convicted of offences against a 14-year-old girl who lived in a care home. He discovered the men were Asian. His editor granted him five months to research the cases across the north. In January 2011, The Times ran its first story. Days later, a concerned Rotherham grandfather contacted him and told him his 12-year-old granddaughter had been found drunk and half-naked, with a group of Asian men. When police attended the house, the schoolgirl was arrested for being drunk and disorderly. This was a “key introduction” into how girls and their parents had been so badly let down in the town. “It became my full-time job until we felt everybody knew what was happening, the system had been changed and the perpetrators held to account”, he added. In 2012, grooming victim ""Amy’s"" story was the first of several Rotherham case studies to be published in the newspaper. Her confidential files given to Mr Norfolk detailed how authorities had failed to respond after she reported being abused by 10 men, who were eventually jailed in 2018. “We'd thought when that story was published, Rotherham Council and South Yorkshire Police would have to respond by saying, ‘this is appalling, we will take action',” he said. “Instead, what they did was ask South Yorkshire Police to launch a criminal inquiry into who had leaked the material to me. They remained in total denial and were telling us they were a model example of how to deal with child sexual exploitation - and so we just carried on. “A year later, another very brave young woman contacted me. She was being serially abused by a man who is now serving a 35-year prison sentence.” Mr Norfolk said he was proud of the legacy of his investigation, which resulted in child sexual exploitation being made a national policing priority. He believes authorities no longer ""shy away"" from tackling the problem, even if it had not been eradicated.  “It’s thanks to journalism. Sometimes the most difficult stories are the ones that only journalists can tell. People turn to the ""mainstream media"" when they've tried everywhere else and the people who should have been helping, didn't.” The government said lessons had been learned from ""past mistakes"" around the handling of abuse. Jess Phillips MP, the new minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said: “My heart goes out to the brave survivors from Rotherham and other communities. I have met many of these victims and worked with them over the years I have been involved in the issue of grooming and sexual exploitation. They must live not only with the unimaginable horror of what happened to them as children, but with the woeful failures and indifference of the adults who were supposed to protect them. “In the decade since Prof Jay’s report was published, we have seen some positive strides on addressing her recommendations. For example, the work of the Child Sexual Exploitation Taskforce which has led to hundreds of arrests and helped to identify and protect thousands of victims. But much remains to be done. “Everyone who is responsible for children must learn from past mistakes. I am committed to working with the police and wider partners to identify more perpetrators of these heinous crimes and bring them to justice. I want to ensure child and adult survivors are treated with compassion so they feel safe and believed; that authorities take these types of reports seriously; and that victims and their families can access the support they need.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq827855x5vo,Brother of Hamas victim accuses SNP of double standards on Israel,"Colin Cowan said the SNP displayed ""double standards"" in the fallout of Angus Robertson's meeting with an Israeli diplomat.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The brother of a British-Israeli man killed by Hamas has accused the SNP of double standards in its stance on Israel.  Bernard Cowan, originally from Glasgow, was killed by Hamas gunmen in his home on a kibbutz in Southern Israel during the 7 October attack. The 57-year-old left his family in Scotland when he was just 19 to move to Israel. Then first minister Humza Yousaf was widely praised after he embraced Mr Cowan's grieving mother during a visit to Giffnock Newton Mearns Synagogue in East Renfrewshire a few days after his death.   Mr Cowan's brother, Colin Cowan, said he now believed Mr Yousaf had merely used the meeting with his mother as a photo opportunity and questioned how sincere he has been in his comments at the time. He also said he had been angered by criticism of External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson, who apologised after meeting an Israeli diplomat earlier this month.  Mr Cowan said Scottish Jews wanted First Minister John Swinney to acknowledge the “legitimate fears” of the community and to meet them. An SNP spokesperson said the party stood ""entirely against"" antisemitism, and the first minister said he would be grateful for the opportunity to meet Mr Cowan and his family. Mr Robertson was heavily criticised by several senior members of his own party - including former SNP ministers Emma Roddick, Kevin Stewart and Elena Whitham - after he met Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK Daniela Grudsky on 8 August. Mr Robertson subsequently said he was sorry that the meeting was not ""strictly limited"" to talks about a ceasefire.  He said the Scottish government would not accept further invitations to meet Israeli diplomats until ""real progress"" had been made towards peace and humanitarian assistance, and until Israel ""co-operates fully with its international obligations on the investigation of genocide and war crimes"". The SNP also withdrew the party whip from MSP John Mason over social media posts in which he questioned whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, the Hamas-run health ministry has said. That equates to about 1.7% of the 2.3 million population of the territory, with satellite image analysis suggesting nearly 60% of buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war. Mr Cowan said he believed Israel was being ""targeted"" as the Scottish government had met with representatives from other countries with ""terrible civil rights"" such as Turkey. ""Israel is the only Jewish state in the world,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland. ""The definition of antisemitism is prejudice against Jewish people. ""So if the Scottish government aren’t willing to talk to Israel, is that not being prejudiced against Jewish people? ""Why is it that Israel is being targeted when every other Western country is quite happy to talk to Israel? If you want a balanced, impartial view, you should meet with both sides."" Speaking at the service on 12 October at the Giffnock Newton Mearns Synogogue at which he met Mr Cowan's mother, Mr Yousaf said he stood in solidarity with Scotland’s Jewish community. He added: ""I want you to know that this first minister, who is proudly Muslim, shares the pain of our Jewish communities. ""Your heartbreak is my heartbreak. Your loss is my loss. Your tears are my tears."" Mr Yousaf has been a vocal critic of the Israeli military action in Gaza, which says has gone ""way beyond a legitimate response"" and has been ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"".  Mr Cowan said he now believed Mr Yousaf had used the service at the synogogue as a ""photo opportunity"" and questioned how genuine he had been. “At the time, it seemed quite genuine,"" he said. ""But some of what he said recently, it doesn't seem so genuine anymore. It seems a bit biased, what he did at the time.” Mr Yousaf said his thoughts were with all of the families impacted by the 7 October attack, as well as families in Gaza ""who have been devastated by Israel’s horrendous actions"". He said: “When I participated in the service of solidarity at Giffnock Shul in October last year, it was at a time of extreme personal grief as my in-laws continued to be trapped in a warzone in Gaza, not knowing whether they would live or die day-by-day.  ""My commitment to the Jewish community then, and now, is to be an ally in the face of antisemitism, and I am proud of my lifelong campaigning against hatred in all of its forms, and believe that Islamaphobia and antisemitism are two sides of the same coin."" But he said that criticism of the actions of the government of Israel was not antisemitism. “While I support diplomacy, even with countries we fundamentally disagree with, there must be limits,"" he said. ""That is why I support the Scottish government ensuring there are not normal diplomatic relationships with the government of Israel until they comply with their international obligations and cease killing civilians with impunity.” Mr Cowan said he had noticed a spike in antisemitism since the escalation between Israel and Gaza following the 7 October attacks.  ""I’ve never felt so unsafe in Scotland as I have in the last year,"" he said.  ""Walking down the street, would I be targeted if they knew I was Jewish? It’s definitely an unsafe feeling at the moment. ""There have been numerous incidents of buildings being attacked, people being attacked since 7 October. The Palestinian support that we see, the protests on a weekly basis, makes us feel unsafe."" He told BBC Scotland that his relatives living in Israel had been displaced amid the ongoing violence.  ""They’re not living in their home, they’re living somewhere else,"" he said.  ""They are distraught. They’ve lost a father, husband, grandfather, we’ve lost a brother, my mum’s lost a son. It’s hard.  ""It’s not easy when someone so young is taken. We’re still reeling from it.” An SNP spokesperson said the party stood ""entirely against"" antisemitism. They said: ""Following last year’s horrific attacks by Hamas, SNP policy has been consistent and clear that hostages must be released, an immediate ceasefire must be put in place and that a viable Palestine state must be recognised within a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live alongside each other in peace.”"

Screenshots shared with the BBC showed comments from a profile in the name of Stockton councillor Susan Scott suggesting Muslims would ""do whatever it takes"" to make the whole world Islamic. Stockton Borough Council's Labour leader Bob Cook said the Tory councillor had ""done the right thing and resigned"" in the wake of criticism. The authority's Conservative group leader Tony Riordan confirmed Ms Scott's resignation following ""a recent social media post"", with a by-election now being arranged. The post, which also said ""we ignore this threat at our peril"", was made on a Facebook page dedicated to local politics. The Stockton Liberal Democrats group expressed ""deep concern and disappointment"" in relation to the comments and said they came at a particularly volatile time. Chair Mo Waqas said: ""In light of the recent riots and attacks on mosques, it is especially irresponsible for Councillor Scott to be making such harmful statements."" Calling for a retraction of the comments and an apology from Ms Scott, he said Islamophobia should be addressed and ""condemned unequivocally"" as he called on the community to come together to reject all forms of hate speech. A council spokesman confirmed the formal resignation of Ms Scott, who represented the Fairfield ward, and said a by-election would be organised. The BBC has attempted to contact Ms Scott.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clygnk7mlnxo,'I used to hide that I am a son of refugees - now I'm proud of it',Rustam Wahab speaks about his family's journey from a comfortable life in Kabul to fleeing to England.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Rustam Wahab is the proud son of refugees - but only a few people knew until recently. His parents and older brother, who was two at the time, risked their lives in 2001 to flee war and persecution in Afghanistan and seek refuge in England.   Mr Wahab, 22, was in his mum's stomach when she made the journey to England in the hope of finding a better life.  The family, who now live in London and Essex, were used to a comfortable lifestyle when they lived in central Kabul, but were catapulted into extreme poverty when they first arrived in the country. Mr Wahab said: ""The first time I told people that I was a son of refugees was a year ago, so it's not been a long time."" Mr Wahab said: ""The earliest example I have of us being very poor as a result of being an asylum seeker was when me and my older brother went to school and it was a funfair day. ""We only had 50p [and] we didn't have money to go on the bouncy castle."" Mr Wahab said his older brother gave him the 50p as they did not have enough money for them both to have a go. ""One teacher saw and let us both go onto the bouncy castle, and stuff like that has stuck with me and my older brother. ""That's the first time we had experienced the kindness of other people and them treating us with fairness and love."" Mr Wahab said his family used to live near the presidential palace in the Afghan capital, but their life had been destroyed due to the war and left his parents with no other choice but to risk everything and flee. He said: ""It was a middle class life, my dad worked from the age of 12, he helped out his dad while still going to school. ""My dad was a really, really hard worker and he still is now, to support his family right now he is working crazy hours. ""So the transition from middle class life to them being at the bottom of society - it was really difficult for my parents. ""Not only did they flee war and persecution, [but] then they came to the UK and went through poverty and being dirt poor and [not being able] to afford certain stuff. ""The people who come here illegally don't want to come here, they have to come here and as soon as people realise that the whole narrative on asylum seekers coming here... will change."" Mr Wahab is studying for a degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Southampton University. Alongside his studies he runs an Instagram page, on which he shares videos that give an insight into events taking place across the world to more than 700,000 followers.  Mr Wahab has recently focused on sharing informative videos that reference the riots that took place after disinformation was spread online about the circumstances of an attack in which three young girls were fatally stabbed in Southport.  Following the disorder that followed the incident, he said: ""Of course, I have been subject to a little bit of racism and Islamophobia. ""But seeing that with my own eyes, a mass amount of people just rioting and attacking people of colour - it made me feel frightened, scared and unwelcomed. ""I really thought about immigrating to a different country because of it."" Yet he added he found the counter-protests ""heartwarming"".  Mr Wahab added: ""It just goes to show that there is a small minority who share those racist, far-right views, but the majority of the country actually want us here."" However, growing up Mr Wahab said he had kept his family's history a secret. Hostility was rampant towards people of colour after 9/11 and Mr Wahab's parents hoped to protect their children by telling them to hide who they were. Mr Wahab said: ""The first time I told people that I was a son of refugees was a year ago, so it's not been a long time."" He launched his Instagram page in 2019 and it started to grow quickly during 2020, but he felt his identity ""was sort of like a secret"". ""I saw that the hate towards people of colour and refugees was getting so bad, that I thought I should share my story and the person running this account is actually a son of refugees. ""We're just normal people, not a threat to anyone. We're just here living the same as them, paying their taxes."" ""We sort of had to hide our identity up until maybe our teenage years, when we kind of got fed up of it and we didn't want to hide who we were anymore. ""We used to say we were Pakistani or Turkish instead of saying we were Afghan. ""It was difficult really because my parents were always quite protective and a bit ashamed because of the connotations that come with [being a] refugee as well."" But now he said: ""I am pretty proud of it."" ""My parents have worked hard to give us good decent lives after they got their British status in 2007."" Moving forward he said he hoped to finish his degree and and wants to pursue a career as an MP.  ""I do want to be an MP, I do believe that to cause real change is through Parliament.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynl828yp0o,Row over Tory MP's Allahu Akbar arrest call,The Tory leadership hopeful says police should “immediately arrest” any protesters shouting Allahu Akbar.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Conservative MP Robert Jenrick has defended himself after being accused of Islamophobia for saying police should have “immediately arrested” any protesters shouting Allahu Akbar during last year’s Gaza ceasefire protests. Speaking on Sky News, the Tory leadership candidate accused police of treating far-right marches and violence more harshly than the pro-Palestinian demonstrations that began after the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year. Several Muslim MPs have argued Mr Jenrick's claim linked all Muslims to extremism and fuelled violent groups. But Mr Jenrick said the Arabic phrase - meaning God is great - had been “abused” by “extremists” to intimidate people. He told Sky News he had been angered by the way pro-Palestinian demonstrations had been policed. “I have been very critical of police in the past, particularly around the attitude of some police forces to the protests we saw since 7 October. “I thought it was quite wrong that somebody could shout Allahu Akbar on the streets of London and not be immediately arrested, project genocidal chants on to Big Ben and not be immediately arrested.  ""That attitude is wrong and I’ll always call out the police for it.” Mr Jenrick said he stood by earlier comments that ""our streets to be dominated by Islamist extremists"". Pressed further, he said: ""There were instances back then where we saw Islamist extremists on our streets. ""I've just given you one example where you literally had somebody chanting or shouting Allahu Akbar off Oxford Street."" Mr Jenrick, a former home office minister, was criticised by former Conservative party chair Baroness Sayeeda Warsi and Labour MPs Naz Shah and Afzal Khan, among others.  In a social media post, Baroness Warsi said: ""Every day before we start parliamentary business in the Commons and Lords we say a prayer and praise God - we say our parliamentary version of Allahu Akbars at the heart of democracy - a process Robert Jenrick is a part of.  ""This language from Jenrick is more of his usual nasty divisive rhetoric - he is such a tool."" Ms Shah, the MP for Bradford West, called Mr Jenrick's comments ""textbook Islamophobia"". His comments ""literally equates every Muslim in the world with extremism"" she argued.  In a social media post she said: “Imagine in this climate, either being that ignorant or deliberately trying to stigmatise all Muslims. He should apologise and speak to Muslim communities and learn more about our faith.” Afzal Khan, another Labour MP, said: “Another day, another senior Tory being Islamophobic.  ""Allahu Akbar means God is great – the Muslim equivalent of hallelujah. Jenrick’s confidence in going on national TV to say people should be arrested for saying Allahu Akbar exposes his deep-seated prejudice against Muslims.” Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said: “People like Robert Jenrick have been stirring up some of the problems that we’ve seen in our communities.   ""Actually, what we want to see is communities come together, and the vast majority of the community want to see that.” Mr Jenrick stood by his comments in a later social media post. He said: ""Allahu Akbar is spoken peacefully and spiritually by millions of British Muslims in their daily lives”. But “aggressive chanting” of the phrase as seen by gangs of men in balaclavas in Birmingham was “an offence under Section 4 and 5 of the Public Order Act”. A spokesperson for Mr Jenrick said: ""Robert has called out all disorder in the strongest possible terms, whether from the far-right or retaliatory violence from sectarian mobs. ""We are yet to see one Labour politician do the same. The country needs strong leadership, not squeamishness."" But Baroness Warsi accused Mr Jenrick of being dishonest and called on him to apologise. ""You do not get to go on national broadcasters and say one thing and try and pretend you said something else after,"" she said. Mr Jenrick is one of six candidates vying to replace Rishi Sunak as leader of the Conservative Party. He is facing: A winner will be announced on 2 November."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v5zgelqjyo,Cancelling show over Gaza remarks an 'error': Orchestra,Jayson Gillham premiered a piece that was dedicated to the journalists of Gaza.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) has admitted it made an ""error"" in cancelling an acclaimed pianist’s performance due to comments he made on the Israel-Gaza war. On Sunday, Jayson Gillham premiered a five-minute piece called Witness, written by composer Connor D’Netto, which was dedicated to the journalists of Gaza. Before starting the recital, Mr Gillham said Israel had killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists. The MSO subsequently removed the British-Australian pianist from an upcoming concert on Thursday, saying he put them in a ""difficult situation"". Now the entire concert, due to be held at Melbourne Town Hall, has been cancelled due to safety concerns. The MSO says they are trying to reschedule the performance. At Sunday’s concert, which was held at the Iwaki Auditorium in Melbourne, Jayson Gillham performed a range of other works, from Beethoven to Chopin.  Witness was a last-minute addition, according to the MSO. ""The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world,"" Mr Gillham claimed before starting to play Witness. In an apologetic statement on Thursday, the MSO said “While the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra maintains that a concert platform is not an appropriate stage for political comment, we acknowledge Jayson’s concerns for those in the Middle East and elsewhere."" “We recognise the strength of feelings of all parties on this matter and particularly acknowledge the dedication and commitment demonstrated by all our musicians and staff this week.” Mr Gillham has accepted the MSO’s apology. “I hold my relationship with the MSO, its players and audience with the highest regard and look forward to our continued working relationship in years to come,” he said in a statement. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. Nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. At least 113 of those were journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom. The decision by the MSO and their subsequent apology have caused a stir on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was “truly appalling,” later adding that “art is often powerful because it’s political”. Arts critic and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said of the MSO’s apology, “Not before time. How I wish Gillham was giving a concert in Sydney. He would get a standing ovation here from supporters who admire his courage almost as much as they admire his talent.” The Israel-Gaza war has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. As has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as sharp upticks in Islamophobia and anti-semitism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjwd033n0ko,We're inclusive says senior Tory after race rows,Shadow Welsh secretary urges Senedd Conservatives to be clear that they welcome all.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A senior Conservative has urged its Welsh Parliament group to make clear it is inclusive, after its leader was accused of ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" and another member used racist language about Chinese people. Shadow Welsh secretary Lord Byron Davies of Gower said the Tory party ""embraces all cultures, ethnic groups and religions"". “There is no other party view,"" he added. He spoke after Tory group leader Andrew RT Davies rejected criticism of his comments about halal meat in schools, and Laura Anne Jones apologised for using the racist slur on WhatsApp. Andrew RT Davies wrote that ""children should not be forced to eat halal school lunches"", in an article for GB News, after a constituent alleged she was told non-halal meat was not available at her daughter's school in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan. The school said on social media ""the statement that all meat options are halal-only is incorrect"". On Monday, he called allegations that this was race-baiting, made by the Muslim Council of Wales, ""completely untrue"", and said his concerns were focused on choice. He was speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. South Wales East Tory Senedd member Laura Anne Jones apologised last week for using a racist slur about Chinese people in an exchange about Chinese-owned TikTok. Ms Jones said the word was ""unacceptable and I deeply regret using it"". On Tuesday, Lord Davies said: ""The Conservative Party as a whole embraces all cultures, ethnic groups and religions. ""We are proud to have amongst our membership and representatives at all levels people from these groups. “There is no other party view. We are a broad church."" “The Muslim community have my absolute assurance that the Welsh Conservative Party are an inclusive party and the Senedd Conservative group should also make this absolutely clear.” On Sunday, Conservative peer Nick Bourne, a former Tory leader in Cardiff Bay, warned Andrew RT Davies against going down a ""blind alley"" of trying to debate the abolition of the Welsh Parliament. It followed a post on X, formerly Twitter, by Mr Davies saying he raised the issue at the Vale of Glamorgan agricultural show as he was ""keen to find out people's views"". On Tuesday, Lord Davies of Gower made the same point. “On the issue of abolishing the Senedd, the Conservative Party has no plans to support a move towards this and I see any action to test public opinion on this as completely futile,” he said. In Monday's radio interview Andrew RT Davies agreed that abolishing the Welsh Parliament ""certainly isn't our position, and it's not my position either"". ""But if you want to engage with a group of society that do hold a view contrary to yours you pose a question and then you engage with them on a one-to-one basis,"" he added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9l33pz493o,Call for Labour to suspend Clive Lewis over X post,An antisemitism group is calling for the suspension of an MP after comments he made on social media.,12 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"An antisemitism group has called for the Labour MP, Clive Lewis, to be suspended from his party. It follows a post Mr Lewis wrote on X, in which he claimed a link between attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and what he called “rising Islamophobia” in the UK.  The co-director of the Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS) group has described the comment as ""incendiary"" and ""inflammatory"". Mr Lewis declined to comment. A Labour spokesperson said: “All complaints are treated seriously and thoroughly assessed in line with our rules and procedures.” In the post on Saturday, Mr Lewis, who is the MP for Norwich South, shared a link to a report in the Guardian newspaper. The article said dozens of people had been reported dead following an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza.  Alongside the link, Mr Lewis wrote: “The link between the daily inhumanity being (sic) metted out to Palestinians and rising Islamophobia in the UK, are not unconnected. “The inhumanity being shown to one is giving ‘permission’ for the other. These actions diminish us all.” Alex Hearn is the co-director of LAAS, which was started by Labour members to combat what they saw as the rise of anti-Jewish sentiment in the Labour Party. He said he had written to the Labour Party, calling for Mr Lewis to be suspended. “I put in the complaint because we have been seeing a pattern from the far right and across elements of the left that have been blaming Zionists and Israelis for the unrest that has been going on across the country,” he said. “The conflict going on thousands of miles away has no connection to the domestic cases that we have. “In my opinion this is conspiracy fantasy. It’s extremely irresponsible that a Labour official should be pouring fuel on the fire in this way.” Mr Lewis’s comment came after the arrests of hundreds of people in connection with riots and anti-immigration protests across the UK. The unrest followed the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July. Mr Hearn said: “I think his [Mr Lewis’s] comments are dangerous because it’s a fantasy that blames racism against Muslims on Jews thousands of miles away in a different country. “When communities are attacking each other it’s awful. What our officials should be doing is calming things down. Mr Lewis took part in an anti-racism protest in Norwich on Saturday, in which up to 400 people gathered in the city centre. The demonstration was organised as part of a national day of protest by Norwich Stand Up to Racism and Protest with Pride Mr Lewis addressed the crowd, three days after attending another counter-protest near a hotel housing asylum seekers on the outskirts of Norwich. A spokesperson for the Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, was questioned by the BBC about Mr Lewis's comments. They said it was ""explicitly clear that violence has no place in UK society"". When asked if Mr Lewis's comments were antisemitic, they said it was not their role to get into individual discipline.  They added: ""The UK’s position is that we must have more aid into Gaza."" It is understood the Labour Party is taking no further action in this case. Follow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."

Michael Mongan, 39, of Castle Road, Ealing, west London, attacked a Ladbrokes branch in Northolt on 27 July. While released on bail, he racially abused a bus driver on 7 August - an incident that was widely shared on social media. At Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, Judge Ian Comfort described the bus incident as an ""appalling racial and religious abuse over a sustained period of time"". He added: ""Your behaviour (occurred) when there was violent disorder in other parts of the country against Muslims and other groups."" On 27 July, Mongan repeatedly hit windows with a large stick and racially abused staff while under the influence of alcohol, the court heard. A member of the public had to restrain him before he was arrested by police. While in custody, Mongan racially abused a police officer who was driving a van. In relation to this incident, Mongan pleaded guilty to two counts of racially aggravated behaviour, one charge of criminal damage and one count of causing damage to a police vehicle. The second incident occurred on 7 August, while he was on bail for the previous offences, after a bus driver refused to let him board as he did not have the money to pay for his journey. Mongan spat at the bus driver's cab a number of times while shouting Islamophobic abuse and other threats, the court was told. His lawyer, Giovanna Fiorentino, said Mongan had claimed a member of the public had offered to pay for his fare but the bus driver refused to let him board. After the video was posted on social media, Mongan was identified and arrested on Friday. He was charged with a racially aggravated public order offence and criminal damage. Mongan was sentenced to: All charges will run concurrently. He was also told to pay £500 to the bus driver, £200 to the police officer he racially abused and £200 to a staff member at Ladbrokes. Mongan bowed his head as the sentence was read out in court and told the judge afterwards: ""They won't see a pound of it from me.""

Omid Djalili has been working on a pilot for a TV show that follows a has-been comedian who starts to teach comedy at the University of Suffolk. The 58-year-old, who lives in the town, screened a pilot episode of the show on campus earlier this week to an audience of 140 people. He said: ""There is no demand for this sitcom, but there was no demand for The Office or Cobra Kai. We've got something which possibly has global appeal."" The concept for the sitcom is loosely based on an invitation Djalili had from university bosses back in April 2023, to helm a comedy course at the site. Despite saying he would love the opportunity to mould the next generation of stand-ups the arrangement did not materialise, nor did the suggestion of a reality series. That is when Djalili came up with the idea of filming a new TV programme at the university instead. Speaking to Wayne Bavin on the BBC Radio Suffolk breakfast show, he said: ""We were going to shoot it with my production company as a reality show, but then we said, 'Why don't we just shoot it as a sitcom?' ""I told the university and they said they'd love it. So, we put something together. ""We had 140 people show up and they absolutely loved it - now we can go and pitch it. ""It's a new format about a comedian who goes in to teach comedy at the University of Suffolk, but the problem is he has to teach it with a comedy critic who hates him."" The critic is played by Tom Goodman Hill, who recently starred in the Netflix hit Baby Reindeer, while the show itself will be directed by Matt Lipsey.  Djalili, who plays the lead role, added: ""We have a top class team and I am not sure how it happened. ""I was looking for the one ingredient which would make it international – and that's  that it is set in Ipswich."" Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."

Shafeel Hussain, 35, who joined a counter-protest in Lincoln Road in Peterborough on Wednesday, said it was beautiful to see ""more than 600 people from diverse backgrounds come out to counter division peacefully"". Malika Speaks, 29, former Peterborough poet laureate, said the responsibility taken by communities ""serves as a reminder of the impact of unity and allyship"". Amir Suleman said that while the message of unity was strong, the unrest had affected him as a parent and said he feared the ""threat of menace to my family"". Violence and disorder organised by far-right groups broke out around the country after three girls were fatally stabbed by a 17-year-old in Southport on 29 July. Peterborough mosques reduced their opening hours this week as a precaution. A spokesperson from Cambridgeshire Constabulary said there was no reported disorder in Peterborough on Wednesday, ""but a peaceful counter-protest took place"". Mr Suleman, a presenter at BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, said: ""When Brexit happened there were similar fears of Islamophobia. ""My son is 18 and had to go to London for work today.  ""But we were reluctant. We have told him to take a taxi instead of public transport in London. Those are the choices, sadly, we are having to think about."" Sameena Aziz said as a British-born, Muslim woman of colour, born to migrant parents, she felt unsafe. ""I am a qualified teacher - all my three children are in the medical field including doctors and a dentist, and my daughter-in-law is a barrister. So that’s five people from just one family,"" she said. ""The racists thugs want us to leave the country - but whose loss would it be? ""Why should we justify our belonging to Britain? I think Muslims are finding their voice and they know they here to stay."" Malika Speaks said it was critical the anti-racism support encouraged sustainable action from policy makers. Raheema Ahmed, 29, was born in London but grew up in Peterborough. She said the incidents made her feel “at edge” and ""fear being a women of colour"" after she experienced racial abuse on Sunday. ""I was in a supermarket with my young daughter. She was crying so I took a banana from my shopping trolley and gave it to her - I was going to pay for it in the end.  ""But suddenly a woman screamed at me and said ‘it’s people like you who are always stealing’ and followed me around the store. ""This is not the first time. In 2015, I was called ISIS when France’s hijab ban was kicking off."" Ms Ahmed said she remained ""cautious"" going forward. ""I have been scared to expose my elderly mum, who wears a headscarf, for fear of her safety,"" she said. Mr Suleman added: ""I woke up this morning feeling more hopeful.  ""But, for days to come as a family we will be thinking before we go anywhere."" Malika Speaks said: ""It’s important to remain realistic about the impact the racist and Islamophobic violence is having on Muslims, people seeking asylum and global majority populations."" Peterborough’s MP Andrew Pakes said he was proud that Peterborough rejected hate and thanked faith leaders, the police and city council for working tirelessly to keep everyone safe.

Jayson Gillham premiered Witness at a show at the MSO on Sunday. The piece was penned by another composer as a tribute to the Palestinian press. The British-Australian was scheduled to perform again on Thursday, but the MSO has said it is reworking the programme after Gillham introduced the piece by saying  Israel had killed more than 100 journalists. A spokesperson for Gillham told the ABC he won't comment on the decision to drop him ""out of respect to the MSO and his ongoing relationship with them"". Gillham - who is billed on the MSO website as ""as one of the finest pianists of his generation"" - was born in Australia but lives in the UK. At the concert at the Iwaki Auditorium on Sunday, he performed a range of works, from Beethoven to Chopin. He also played Witness, written by Australian composer Connor D'Netto, which the MSO says was a last-minute addition. ""Over the last 10 months, Israel has killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists,"" Mr Gillham said before starting the piece. A number were ""targeted assassinations of prominent journalists"" who were travelling in marked press vehicles or wearing press jackets, he claimed. ""The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world,"" he added. In an email to patrons, the MSO said they were blindsided by Mr Gillham's comments and he had put them in a ""difficult situation"". “The MSO does not condone the use of our stage as a platform for expressing personal views”, it added. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.

More than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom, reports that 113 of those were journalists. Apologising for the ""offence and distress"" caused, the MSO said it had removed Gillham from the program and would update customers soon. In a statement given to local media, a spokesperson for the MSO said: ""Mr Gillham's remarks went beyond the remit of his contract."" The decision has caused a backlash on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was “truly appalling” while arts critics and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said “MSO management should hang its collective head in shame”. The Israel-Gaza war has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. As has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as a sharp uptick in Islamophobia and antisemitism."

Riley Adey, 19, and Reece Greenwood, 31, were both sentenced for violent disorder that was carried out in Sunderland on 2 August. Adey, of Washington, was filmed standing on top of an overturned car, which had been set alight, while he handed out weapons, and Greenwood, also of Washington, live-streamed himself ""actively encouraging violent disorder"" and ""verbally abusing police"". During sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge Paul Sloan KC said both men had ""brought shame upon the city of Sunderland"". The court heard Adey had thrown a scaffolding pole, a vape and bricks at police officers. Defence counsel Andrew Findlay said Adey had drunk ""six to seven pints"" before the riots and had become ""emotionally and physiologically swept along"" by the events. He added his client was ""remorseful for what happened"". Adey was sentenced to two years in a young offenders' institution, having previously pleaded guilty at Teesside Magistrates' Court. Greenwood was handed a 30-month sentence for his part in the riot. He had been driven to the protest by his friend Josh Kellet, who was jailed last week for violent disorder. The court heard how the father-to-be washed and put away his clothes so they could not be recovered by police. Judge Sloan said Greenwood, who also filmed a mob vandalising a police vehicle and was seen shouting racist and Islamophobic slurs, was ""revelling in the mayhem"". Shaun Routledge, defending, said his client was ""completely and utterly ashamed of his behaviour"". The judge condemned the pair for taking part in ""an orgy of mindless destruction, violence and disorder"". ""Those participating in mass disorder must expect severe sentences intended not only to punish but to deter others in copying their example,"" he added. Additional reporting by PA.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdkk5r9y3zo,Imam welcomes emergency security offer for mosques,"Qari Asim says Muslims in Leeds feel ""so anxious"" following protests in several towns and cities.",5 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Muslims have been ""heartened"" by the government's offer of emergency security for mosques following recent disorder in several towns and cities, an imam in Leeds has said. Mosques in Liverpool, Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Hastings were targeted by protesters after the fatal stabbing of three children in Southport last week.  On Sunday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that police and local authorities could ask for rapid security to be deployed if needed. Qari Asim, imam at Leeds Makkah Mosque, told the BBC: ""My community feels so anxious and deeply worried about their safety on the streets."" Mr Asim, who is also chairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, added: ""It is absolutely horrifying what happened. In this country we have mechanisms to deal with issues peacefully and democratically."" Mosques were considered by Muslims to be ""places of sanctuary"", so people should feel safe there, according to Mr Asim. The ""blatant Islamophobic slurs"" heard over the past few days from far-right groups were ""despicable and disgusting"", he said. The recent disorder followed the deaths in Southport on Monday 29 July of three girls aged six, seven and nine in a knife attack. False claims had spread online that the person responsible was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat and a Muslim. Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from the village of Banks in Lancashire, appeared in court last week charged with murdering the three girls. He was also charged with 10 counts of attempted murder after eight other children and two adults were seriously injured in the attack. In a statement on Sunday, the Home Office offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said ""rapid security"" deployment could be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible. According to the government, the extra security funding would be on top of the £24.9m already available as part of the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme.  Announcing the move, Ms Cooper said: “As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.” She added that anyone involved in violent disorder should expect to face the ""full force of the law"".  Mr Asim said Ms Cooper's announcement was ""welcome and heartening"" and the next step would be to roll out the scheme and determine who would benefit most from the funding.  He added that Britain was one of the most tolerant places in the world and praised its ""rich diversity"". ""But unfortunately some criminal thugs want to reverse the cycle of history and push the thinking that one race is superior to another. It goes against the grain of our country."" However, Mr Asim said that despite the unrest, people of all faiths had come together at the weekend to show solidarity, which proved ""we have a lot more in common than what divides us"". ""We need to listen to the legitimate concerns people have around immigration and start a dialogue,"" he said. ""But throwing bricks at mosques, attacking people of colour and chanting Islamophobic slurs is not the way forward and will not achieve anything except the full force of the law.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm23yl2kz7no,Humza Yousaf admits ending Greens deal was his mistake,The move led to the ex-first minister's resignation earlier this year as he faced motions of no confidence.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Former first minister Humza Yousaf has said terminating a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens was his mistake.  The move led to the ex-SNP leader’s resignation earlier this year as he faced motions of no confidence. Mr Yousaf told an LBC event at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe he was considering whether to continue as an MSP. He also said he could not say with ""certainty"" that his daughters would not be attacked because of the colour of their skin.  Mr Yousaf resigned as first minister in May as he faced motions of no confidence in him and his government. He said at the time he had ""underestimated"" the level of hurt caused by his decision to end a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens in April. The breakdown came after a Green backlash against the SNP government’s decision to row back on climate targets and gender policies. It left the SNP with a minority administration at Holyrood. Mr Yousaf said the relationship came under strain following an interview by Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie in which he says Mr Harvie refused to accept the Cass review into gender services for children in England was a scientific document. The former first minster said ordinarily ""reasonable, supportive"" people in his party -and not only the “usual malcontents” - told him that Mr Harvie's comments had made the Bute House Agreement “very difficult to sustain”. Mr Yousaf then used an expletive to take full blame for the decision to end the deal with the Greens, adding: ""It was my choice.” He said he had calculated his administration could fend off opposition votes of no confidence with the support of Alba MSP Ash Regan. He told the Edinburgh event that deal became “impossible” when Alba leader and former first minister Alex Salmond proposed an electoral pact with the SNP. “There was no way I was going to play a part in rehabilitating Alex Salmond in the political bubble,” he said. He then said: “I could have done a deal (with Alba) that went against my principles, that would have saved my skin. “It would have got me the votes I needed but I wasn’t going to do that.” A spokesperson for the Alba Party said: ""There was no reference to an electoral pact in the proposals that would have saved Humza’s job - he knows that because he described them as sensible at the time."" Asked about the SNP's heavy general election defeat to Scottish Labour, Mr Yousaf said he accepted an “element of responsibility”. He said that he was not dealt “the easiest hand” after taking over from Nicola Sturgeon in March 2023. “I think anybody who was a past leader of the SNP in recent years has got to reflect very seriously,"" he added.  Asked if he would consider running for first minister again, the 39-year-old replied: “No.” He said he did not know if he would stand to be an MSP in the 2026 Holyrood election, telling LBC: “I’ll make that decision probably next year.” Mr Yousaf, Scotland's first ethnic minority leader, said earlier this week he had questioned whether he and his family have a future in Scotland or the UK due to Islamophobia. It came after violent riots in other parts of the UK.  He said: “Scotland has not had race riots and long may that continue but let’s not pretend Scotland doesn’t have racism and Islamophobia.  ""In fact, people in Scotland have been charged on numerous occasions and found guilty of racism, death threats, Islamophobia against me.""  Mr Yousaf said he was not planning on leaving Scotland but that he and other Muslim people he had spoken to were considering their futures.  He added: “Could I say that my daughters would be safe as people of colour, as Muslims? ""If the girls choose to wear a hijab in the future could I say that they won’t get attacked because of the colour of their skin, or because of their faith? I can’t say that with any certainty.” Mr Yousaf also branded Elon Musk “one of the most dangerous men on the planet”. The billionaire owner has been highly critical of the UK authorities and the way the disorder has been handled. He has come under fire for promoting a conspiracy theory about the UK building ""detainment camps"" on the Falkland Islands for rioters. He later deleted the image from his page. Posted by the co-leader of the far-right Britain First party, the image was faked to look like it had come from the Daily Telegraph website.  Mr Musk has not acknowledged he published then deleted the post. The BBC has approached X for comment. Mr Yousaf accused the tech entrepreneur of ""using his wealth to amplify the far right""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjz9e9yl6o,Tory blasts Senedd leader's abolish stunt,"Andrew RT Davies warned against going down ""blind alley"" in trying to debate whether to scrap Senedd.",11 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader has been warned against going down a ""blind alley"" of trying to debate the abolition of the Welsh Parliament. Andrew RT Davies took to X, formerly Twitter, to say that he raised the issue at the Vale of Glamorgan agricultural show as he was ""keen to find out people's views"". But Tory peer Nick Bourne, a former leader of the party in Wales and a member of the then Welsh Assembly, said there were ""very many good things about devolved politics"". While the abolition of the Senedd is not a policy of the Conservatives, Mr Davies said he was keen to find out people's views.  ""Once the vote was taken over 25 years ago, we determined that the correct approach was to make the assembly work, now the Senedd, for the good of the people of Wales,"" said Lord Bourne on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme.  ""That remains very much the position. I don't understand why we're going down this blind alley. ""It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me."" Earlier in the week, Mr Davies shared a photo on X from the Vale of Glamorgan Show, showing how people were being asked to drop a ball into one of two buckets to highlight whether they wanted to abolish the Senedd or not, which he admitted was an ""unscientific poll"". Responding to criticism on X, Mr Davies said: ""We're just keen to find out people's views. It's important to find out what people think."" Lord Bourne also questioned why Mr Davies had raised an issue of the availability of  non halal food in Welsh schools, prompting the Welsh Tory leader to be accused of engaging in ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by the Muslim Council of Wales. Lord Bourne said: ""We do have to make clear that we're a one nation party."" In response, Mr Davies said: ""Welsh Conservatives stand against all forms of racism, including anti-Muslim hatred. ""Representations from across Wales have been made to me about the availability of non-halal meat in schools. ""These are legitimate queries and I make no apologies for taking them forward. ""It is important to have these discussions in a measured way and we will continue to do so."" Lord Bourne called for Conservative Members of the Senedd (MSs) to have a group meeting to discuss its ""one nation"" stance despite Welsh Parliament being in recess. He went on to say that his party's ""focus should be how are we going to make things better for the people of Wales"" after the Conservative general election wipe-out in Wales and with the Reform party setting their sights on the Senedd elections in 2026. ""I think there's a great danger of talking Reform up,"" he added.  ""We've had UKIP before, and they were represented in the Senedd previously, and then it fizzled out. ""The exposure that Reform is going to get now that they've got elected politicians in Westminster may well show what a busted flush they are. ""We're not that party.  ""We're a party of the moderate right, and that should be reflected in the way we approach politics in Wales."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gx010pk7no,"Welsh Tory 'race-baiting', says Muslim group",Muslim Council of Wales criticises Andrew RT Davies over article he wrote on halal meat in schools.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Welsh Conservative Senedd leader has been accused of engaging in ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by a Muslim group. Andrew RT Davies wrote ""children should not be forced to eat halal school lunches"", in an article for GB News, after a constituent alleged she was told non-halal meat was not available at her daughter's school in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan. The school said on social media ""the statement that all meat options are halal only is incorrect"". The Muslim Council of Wales has accused Mr Davies' of ""ham-fisted attempts at dog-whistle racism"" which have ""real consequences on our streets"". Mr Davies has said he ""entirely"" rejects the criticism. The article was posted on X, formerly Twitter, by controversial far-right activist and convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and was widely shared. In the GB News article, Mr Davies said: ""Children shouldn’t be forced to have to eat halal school lunches, but in the era of conformity, this common sense call is derided."" The Muslim Council of Wales has released a strongly-worded response, saying: ""Andrew RT Davies is engaging in Islamophobic race-baiting, at a time when we require politicians to be the voice of reason and show moral leadership."" It added: ""The ham-fisted attempts at dog-whistle racism may lead to more engagement online for Mr Davies, but have real consequences on our streets and in our mosques."" ""Many Muslim children face bullying and discrimination in schools, and Mr Davies' public and misleading campaign on halal meat will undoubtedly have an impact on returning Muslim pupils in September."" South Wales East Senedd member Natasha Asghar, a member of Mr Davies' shadow cabinet, told BBC Wales she had raised concerns with him. She is one of two Muslims in the Conservative group in Cardiff Bay. ""As a member of the Conservative Party since 2010, I can categorically say that the party is not Islamophobic,"" she said. ""Anybody with any concerns of any kind can reach out to myself or any other members of the Senedd, we are not inapproachable.  ""Right now I am striving for peace and on working tirelessly to create community cohesion and peace on our streets for everyone."" In a statement, Mr Davies said he had contacted the local authority on behalf of his constituent asking for assurances that the choice of a non-halal meat option would be provided. ""These were legitimate questions and as an elected member, I fulfilled my responsibilities by asking them,"" he said. ""Attempts to equate those legitimate concerns with the disorder we’ve seen on our streets is particularly irresponsible. ""Just as the thuggery we’ve seen cannot be justified by legitimate concerns on political issues, those same concerns must not be ignored by political leaders. ""Doing so risks leaving the field clear for extremists to exploit for their own, dangerous ends."" He added: ""For my part, I will continue to engage with a broad range of individuals and organisations across all religious and community groups. ""This includes the Sikh constituents who welcomed the clarification I sought on school meals, as for religious reasons Sikhs cannot consume meat that has been ritually slaughtered. ""As a politician it is my job to take forward concerns raised by constituents, and I will continue to do so."" Some members of the Conservative Senedd group have expressed concerns privately about Mr Davies' social media posts. One said his posts were becoming increasingly ""difficult to defend"", adding that if things continue as they are then his position would become “untenable” and he could face a leadership challenge. It follows a post this week asking whether the Senedd should be abolished? Several senior party Senedd members, past and present, disagreed publicly with the post and asked why the question was being posed. Mr Davies's predecessor as leader, Paul Davies, said on X: ""The Conservative Party is clear - it is not party policy to abolish the Senedd so not sure why this question is even being asked."" Former group leader Lord Nick Bourne, said: ""It has NEVER been the policy of the Welsh Conservative Party to abolish the assembly/Senedd. Why pose this question?"" Senedd members Natasha Asghar and Tom Giffard also posted their disagreement. Despite widespread unhappiness within the Senedd group, it is not thought that a challenge to his leadership is imminent, largely because there is no obvious candidate to replace him."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cred8770008o,Swinney condemns Musk over racism row with Yousaf,"Scotland's first minister defended his predecessor, who has traded accusations with the billionaire owner of X.",12 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Scotland's first minister has described Elon Musk's behaviour as ""completely and utterly unacceptable” after the billionaire owner of X branded Humza Yousaf ""racist"" and a ""scumbag"".  John Swinney defended his predecessor, who has described Mr Musk as a ""race baiter"" and ""one of the most dangerous men on the planet”. The tech entrepreneur suggested he would welcome legal action from Mr Yousaf. The former first minister declined to speak to BBC Scotland.  However, Mr Swinney said his predecessor had faced racist and Islamophobic abuse for many years. “I think that’s why he has taken such a strong stance about the unacceptable conduct and content that we’ve heard from Elon Musk,"" the first minister told BBC Scotland. Following anti-immigrant riots in England and Northern Ireland in recent weeks, Mr Swinney echoed calls from regulator Ofcom for social media firms to urgently protect users from content likely to incite violence or hatred. Mr Musk has been highly critical of the UK authorities and the way the disorder has been handled. Mr Swinney said he had not received a response from X to a letter he had written to social media companies on the riots. “The conduct of Elon Musk is wholly unacceptable and the conduct of the social media company is just as unacceptable and needs to be tackled,"" he said.  The first minister said that while the riots had not spread north of the border, he wanted to ensure social media firms ""do not behave in a fashion that creates difficulties"" for communities in Scotland.  Mr Swinney was asked if the SNP or the Scottish government could step in to financially assist his predecessor in a possible legal case against Mr Musk, but said that was a matter for Mr Yousaf.  The most recent spat between Mr Musk and Mr Yousaf began last Thursday. Speaking at an event at the Edinburgh Festival, the former first minister branded the X owner “one of the most dangerous men on the planet”. “He is not accountable to anybody, he has vast wealth at his fingertips and disposal and he uses it for some of the most wicked evil I have seen,” he told LBC. Mr Yousaf accused Mr Musk of using his wealth to amplify the far right and white supremacists. After the ex-SNP leader made similar comments to CNN, Mr Musk described him as ""super, super racist"".  He posted on X: ""Scotland gave him everything and yet he loathes white people.” In the Sunday Mail, Mr Yousaf’s lawyer Aamer Anwar said the X owner had “effectively painted a target on Humza Yousaf’s back with his completely unacceptable, untrue and inflammatory comments”. The newspaper reported that Mr Yousaf had not ruled out legal action and was “considering all options”. Mr Yousaf also posted on X: “Elon Musk is a dangerous race baiter who must be held to account for his actions. “I can't think what it is that upsets him so much about a Brown, Muslim, progressive politician? But his billions won't stop me calling out his support for the far-right.” Mr Musk again responded online, claiming Mr Yousaf was ""obviously super racist against white people"".  ""I dare that scumbag to sue me,"" he said. ""Go ahead, make my day…” Mr Musk added: “Legal discovery will show that however big a racist he’s been in public communications, he is vastly worse in private communications.” This is not the first public spat between the pair. In October last year, while Mr Yousaf was first minister, Mr Musk branded him a “blatant racist”. The billionaire made the comment in response to an edited clip of a speech Mr Yousaf gave in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. The clip has once again been shared widely by right-wing accounts in recent days. A fact check by the Reuters news agency concluded that the clip misrepresented Mr Yousaf's comments by suggesting he had been arguing that Scotland contained too many white people – when he had been about racial injustice and a lack of people of colour in positions of power. Responding last year, Mr Yousaf’s spokesperson said Mr Musk should instead ""tackle racism and hatred that goes unchecked on the social media platform he owns""."

Andrew RT Davies has faced criticism over his remarks on halal meat, the future of the Senedd and inappropriate language from one of his MSs. He appeared to rule out suspending Laura Anne Jones, who used a racist slur to describe Chinese people in a WhatsApp chat.  Ms Jones has already been removed from Mr Davies's shadow cabinet pending a police investigation into her expenses. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Davies said none of his colleagues had suggested Ms Jones be suspended. ""I note that Laura Anne Jones has made a full and wholesome apology for the use of wholly inappropriate language. ""What do we do these days? Do we take people out and tar and feather them or do we accept an apology, understand that people learn the lessons from their mistake and move on?"" Conservative MSs are not due to meet as a group again until after the summer recess in September. But at least one is considering whether to ask for an emergency meeting before then. Some members of the Conservative Senedd group have expressed concerns privately about Mr Davies's social media posts. One said they were becoming increasingly ""difficult to defend"" and if things continued as they were then his position would be ""untenable"" and he could face a leadership challenge. In a separate row, Mr Davies was accused of ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by the Muslim Council of Wales over a GB News article he wrote. In it, he said children ""should not be forced to eat halal school lunches"", after a constituent alleged she was told non-halal meat was not available at her daughter's school in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan. The school said on social media: ""The statement that all meat options are halal only is incorrect."" Mr Davies said allegations of race-baiting were ""completely untrue"" and his concerns revolved around choice. Mr Davies has also been criticised by one of his predecessors, Lord Nick Bourne, after a post on social media in which he asked whether the Senedd should be abolished. He later clarified that abolishing the Welsh Parliament was was neither his nor his party's position. ""Do I feel challenged? Do I feel threatened? No of course I don't because I am a politician that engages with the public,"" Mr Davies said.  ""What is wrong with putting a question to people at an agricultural show when you're trying to engage with people as they go past your stand? ""If you want to engage with a group of society that do hold a view contrary to yours you pose a question and then you engage with them on a one-to-one basis."" Despite unhappiness within the Conservative Senedd group, it is not thought a leadership challenge is imminent, largely because there is no obvious replacement for Mr Davies."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0r82pg7lxo,Why is Elon Musk in a racism row with Scotland's ex-first minister?,"A long-running feud, sparked by a misleading video clip, has led to personal jibes and claims of racism.",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A spat between the world's richest person and the former first minister of Scotland has reignited in recent days - but the feud between Elon Musk and Humza Yousaf has been building for years. Tensions escalated over the weekend, when the billionaire X owner called he ex-SNP leader a racist ""scumbag"", claiming he ""loathes"" white people.  It came after Mr Yousaf had called Mr Musk a ""dangerous race baiter"" and ""one of the most dangerous men on the planet”. The tech entrepreneur has been widely criticised for his management of X, and for his own posts during recent far-right riots in England and Northern Ireland However, the origins of the row lie back in the pandemic summer of 2020, and are linked to the murder of George Floyd.   On 10 June 2020, the Scottish Parliament held a debate on showing solidarity with anti-racism demonstrations held in response to Mr Floyd's murder.  Mr Yousaf, the then justice secretary, told MSPs it was evident that Scotland had ""a problem of structural racism"". He said: ""At 99% of the meetings that I go to, I am the only non-white person in the room."" Mr Yousaf read out a list of senior positions - including the lord advocate, solicitor general and Police Scotland's chief constable - and, after each, added: ""white"". He said the same was true for every high court judge, every deputy chief constable, every assistant chief constable and every prison governor in Scotland. The then SNP minister also highlighted senior positions in the health sector and the trade union movement. ""That is a collective failure that includes every single one of us,"" he told MSPs. ""I hope that we are sitting uncomfortably, because those should be uncomfortable truths for us all."" An edited version of the lengthy speech was widely shared by right-wing accounts on social media. By October 2023, it had reached the attention of Mr Musk on X, which he had rebranded from Twitter three months earlier. He called Mr Yousaf - who had become the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party - a ""blatant racist"".  A fact check by the Reuters news agency concluded that the clip misrepresented Mr Yousaf's comments by suggesting he had been arguing that Scotland contained too many white people – when he had been complaining about racial injustice and a lack of people of colour in positions of power. Shortly afterwards, Mr Yousaf posted: ""Racists foaming at the mouth at my very existence."" He then added: ""Me:"" and shared a gif from the BBC comedy Still Game, featuring the character Navid dancing in his shop. The then first minister's spokesperson said Mr Yousaf had suffered racist abuse his whole life, adding: ""Mr Musk should use his position to tackle racism and hatred that goes unchecked on the social media platform he owns."" Tensions between the pair flared again following days of far-right violence in cities in England and Northern Ireland in recent weeks.  Mr Musk was highly critical of the UK authorities and the way the disorder has been handled. He suggested that ""civil war is inevitable"" and promoted a conspiracy theory that far-right agitators were treated more harshly than minority groups.  A spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""no justification"" for the comments.  Mr Musk and other social media owners have been urged by regulator Ofcom to protect users from content likely to incite violence or hatred. Mr Yousaf was asked about the tech businessman's intervention during an LBC event at the Edinburgh Festival last Thursday.  He branded the X owner “one of the most dangerous men on the planet”, adding: “He is not accountable to anybody, he has vast wealth at his fingertips and disposal and he uses it for some of the most wicked evil I have seen."" Mr Yousaf accused Mr Musk of using his wealth to amplify the far right and white supremacists. After the ex-SNP leader made similar comments to CNN, Mr Musk described him as ""super, super racist"". He posted on X: ""Scotland gave him everything and yet he loathes white people.” The row escalated further when it was reported Mr Yousaf could take legal action.  His lawyer, Aamer Anwar, told the Sunday Mail that Mr Musk had “effectively painted a target on Humza Yousaf’s back with his completely unacceptable, untrue and inflammatory comments”. Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf posted on X: “Elon Musk is a dangerous race baiter who must be held to account for his actions. “I can't think what it is that upsets him so much about a Brown, Muslim, progressive politician? But his billions won't stop me calling out his support for the far-right.” The tech entrepreneur responded by claiming Mr Yousaf was ""obviously super racist against white people"". ""I dare that scumbag to sue me,"" he posted. ""Go ahead, make my day…” Mr Musk added: “Legal discovery will show that however big a racist he’s been in public communications, he is vastly worse in private communications.” He did not elaborate on what that comment referred to.  Mr Yousaf has declined to speak to BBC Scotland about the issue, while Mr Musk very rarely gives interviews to media.  Having sacked about 80% of former Twitter staff following his takeover, Mr Musk announced last year that requests to X's media department would be met with an automatic response: a poo emoji.  The response now reads ""busy now, please check back later"". It seems likely that the war of words might continue to play out on X, or possibly in a court room. Whatever happens next, it is fair to say the pair's differences are nowhere near being resolved."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77lxyz7702o,Police Scotland could send officers to Northern Ireland after riots,"The chief constable in Northern Ireland asks for 120 officers, saying his staff are ""exhausted"" after several nights of riots.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Police Scotland is considering a request to send 120 officers to Northern Ireland following several nights of anti-immigration riots in Belfast and other parts of the UK. Jon Boutcher, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), said his officers were exhausted and could not “stand alone to deal with disorder like this any more”. Seventeen people were arrested and 11 of them have been charged following outbreaks of violence and disorder in Belfast. Police Scotland said it had received ""a number of requests for mutual aid"" from UK forces which would be balanced against policing needs in Scotland. Mr Boutcher said the PSNI needed support as it had been allowed to ""decay"" in recent years. ""Having those additional resources is vital to helping us be prepared for any future disorder,"" he added. Earlier, First Minister John Swinney said Scotland would remain vigilant following several nights of disturbances in England and Northern Ireland. He said violence and Islamophobia had ""no place"" in Scotland - which has so far avoided any outbreaks of disorder. Thousands of counter protesters took to the streets for peaceful rallies in towns and cities across England on Wednesday evening. Met Police chief Mark Rowley called it a ""very successful night"", saying the fears of extreme-right disorder were ""abated"". The National Police Coordination Centre, which provides support to forces across the UK, said it was considering a request from the Police Service in Northern Ireland (PSNI) for back-up from other forces. ""As a national service, Police Scotland has the ability to flex resources where the need is greatest in order to keep people safe,"" said a Police Scotland spokesperson. Anti-immigration violence in towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland over the weekend had led to more than 400 arrests.  This was sparked by misinformation over a fatal stabbing attack in Southport. Mr Swinney said Police Scotland had “comprehensive” plans in place to deal with any riots. He said the force had identified the possibility of anti-immigrant gatherings in Scotland, based on social media posts.  Mr Swinney said “thankfully” there had not been riots in Scotland, but added: “We have to remain vigilant because of the unacceptable conduct that's taking place."" He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: “I want everyone to remain vigilant because we have communities that are experiencing a great deal of fear and anxiety as a consequence of what they're observing in other parts of the United Kingdom.” He said Police Scotland had “formidable” resources that could be deployed flexibly across the country if required.  Mr Swinney said the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service could deliver “swift justice” under a strategy developed for the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, that had been revisited after the UK riots. Following a meeting with Chief Constable Jo Farrell in Edinburgh on Wednesday, he said there had been no requests for Police Scotland officers to be deployed south of the border to help deal with disorder. Earlier this week, former first minister Humza Yousaf said he had questioned whether he and his family have a future in Scotland or the UK due to Islamophobia.  Mr Swinney said his predecessor’s comments were illustrative of a “deep sense of anxiety” in Muslim communities.  After meeting faith leaders on Wednesday, he said both the Muslim and Jewish communities were feeling “acutely anxious”. And asked about the spread of disinformation about the riots, Mr Swinney said social media companies had “a lot of improvement to undertake in their conduct”. He echoed calls from regulator Ofcom for social media firms to urgently protect users from content likely to incite violence or hatred. The first minister said disinformation can be “profoundly dangerous”, citing false information spread about the stabbing of a woman in Stirling over the weekend. He said Police Scotland “did absolutely the right thing to stamp on that misinformation and we will continue to do that where that is required”. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told BBC Scotland News that the vast majority of people would look at recent events and be horrified by the acts of a ""far right thuggery"". Mr Sarwar called on social media companies to crack down on the spread of misinformation and ""allowing the far right to organise, to recruit, to amplify and in some cases to fundraise."" Asked whether this would infringe on the right to freedom of speech, he said: ""I’m all for freedom of speech but there is a responsibility that comes on these platforms too and allowing known mistruths to be spread is not freedom of speech."" Mr Sarwar said Scotland could not be complacent and must send the far right a ""strong message to say they are not welcome here"". Following social media speculation about far-right activity in the city, Glasgow Central Mosque said Police Scotland had confirmed there was no intelligence to suggest it would be targeted. In a statement, it said people should be vigilant but cautioned against alarm. “We urge everyone to be wary of what you read on social media, avoid speculation and not to share unverified information,” the mosque added. Reports of antisemitic incidents in the UK reached a record high in the first half of this year, according to figures from Jewish charity the Community Security Trust. In Scotland there were 40 incidents from January to June, compared to 14 in the first six months of 2023. A total of 22 of these incidents were in Glasgow. In their meeting with Mr Swinney on Wednesday, faith leaders agreed to work together to support vulnerable communities."

South Wales East Tory Senedd member Laura Anne Jones used the highly offensive term in an exchange about Chinese-owned video app TikTok. Ms Jones has apologised and issued a statement saying the word was ""unacceptable and I deeply regret using it"".  ""I sincerely apologise for any offence this has caused,"" she said. Warning: This story contains strong racist language Ms Jones' Senedd colleague, Tory MS Natasha Asghar said she was ""positively livid"" and ""embarrassed"" by Ms Jones' use of the racist term. Ms Asghar, who represents the same region as Ms Jones, added: ""Language like this is unacceptable at every level"". In the meantime two Conservative MSs have told BBC Wales that Ms Jones should lose the whip and be removed from the Conservative group. The Welsh Conservative Party has declined to comment. Ms Jones has represented South Wales East for the Tories in the Senedd since July 2020. But in June she was stripped of her position as the party's culture spokesperson, after texts from her phone appeared to show an employee was asked to maximise expenses claims. In the WhatsApp exchange about TikTok, first revealed by the news website Nation.Cymru, a message from Ms Jones says: ""No chinky spies for me!"" It is unclear when the message was sent. The apology from Ms Jones comes after the Conservative Senedd leader has been accused of engaging in ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by a Muslim group. The Muslim Council of Wales has criticised Andrew RT Davies over an article he wrote about halal meat in schools. He has said he ""entirely"" rejects the criticism. Plaid Cymru said the language used in the WhatsApp conversation was ""vile"" and ""completely unacceptable,"" calling on the Conservative group in the Senedd to ""reflect on their recent behaviour and understand that their actions and words have consequences"". Ms Jones has been the subject of a police investigation over expenses allegations, which saw her removed from the shadow cabinet. One message about her expenses saw her ask a staff member: ""When doing petrol thing - always make more than I did – add in stuff please OK"". The context for the WhatsApp messages regarding her expenses was not evident. A solicitor on her behalf said at the time: ""Ms Jones is satisfied that any allegations in relation to impropriety surrounding expenses are entirely misconceived"". She remains a member of the Conservative group in Cardiff Bay."

The demos were in response to violence across England and Northern Ireland fuelled by far-right and anti-immigration sentiment. Thousands of police were deployed across the country poised for more than 100 possible events expected on Saturday.  All rallies were reported to be peaceful and one protester, Rachel Collins, said it was ""important to spread a message of love and kindness and inclusivity"". Ms Collins, who attended the rally in Southampton with about 250 other people, said: ""It's important that we really focus on being kind and polite to people of all societies rather than just our own.  ""[Southampton] feels like an inclusive place; it felt like that on Wednesday when everyone turned up; it feels like it today."" Retired academic Prof Ademuni-Odeke said he arrived in the UK as a refugee from Uganda in the 1970s after violence erupted during Idi Amin's dictatorship. ""This country is very welcoming to refugees and migrants and other people who have contributed,"" he said. ""I came to this country myself as a refugee and because I was welcomed here, I was allowed to go to school and become a professor in this country.  ""It's very important that this country remains the same."" In Weymouth, about 50 people attended a rally organised by Stand Up To Racism Dorset and other local anti-racism groups.  Two Dorset Police officers attended. Bishop Angie McLachlan, who belongs to the Liberal Catholic Church International, said: ""I'm here because I passionately feel that everything I stand for is being said today."" She added: ""I really cannot understand how anybody feels that racism and discrimination on any level is appropriate, kind, nice or even helpful to our country or our world at the moment and so I feel I have to be here in order to represent solidarity."" Candy Udwin, the joint secretary of Stand Up to Racism Dorset said the gathering sent a ""positive message that anti-racists will not stand for those horrible scenes of violence and hatred and division that we saw on the streets of Britain and Weymouth last week"". Luke Philpott said he attended his first rally in Oxford after being upset by the violence over recent weeks. He said: ""I have been really staggered by the fascism on the streets over the last week and really upset by it - from the point of view of someone who loves my country and doesn't want to see it taken over by what I believe is a small minority of people who feel this way about others.""

Jane, not her real name, says rising Islamophobia means parents are afraid to bring their children to play parks during the summer holidays. Similar fears have been expressed by a Nigeria-born community worker in Belfast, Israel Eguaogie. He said a summer scheme in the city had to be cancelled for security reasons. There have been a series of racially-motivated attacks and violent disorder since Saturday, following an anti-immigration protest in Belfast. Jane, who wears a hijab, told BBC News NI nowhere felt safe any more. “The prominent narrative has been against Muslims but it’s also people who are visibly different,"" she said. “Visible minorities - whether that’s black families, Asian families, anyone with a different skin colour, different accent - I think are thinking twice today about where they’re going to take their children … even to the park. “Even in the small regional towns that we haven’t heard so much about there’s been added graffiti, there’s been things said, there’s been maybe comments made that have just made people a little concerned … is there anywhere safe in Northern Ireland?"" Jane said some families were considering moving to Scotland, Wales or parts of England where there has not been unrest in recent days. She said there had been an escalation in racism in Northern Ireland in recent months, not just the past week. At the same time, she said she had been encouraged by offers of support. ""Don’t underestimate the small gestures, the people who have sent messages just saying: ‘I hope you’re safe, I hope your family are safe', offering to go to the shops with someone if they don’t feel safe,"" she said. “Those neighbourly, beautiful moments.  ""They mean a lot in a period like now.” Mr Eguaogie is involved with a number of organisations including Belfast City of Sanctuary and Diverse Youth NI, and has been in Northern Ireland for 14 years. He said the recent trouble had been “absolutely disgraceful” and “shocking”. “It has put everybody including myself in a state of fear and panic where people do not know what else to do,” he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra. “You have lived in a community for quite a long time that has been very peaceful and welcoming and all of a sudden your door is smashed in, that’s shocking.” He said a number of activities planned for young people from ethnic minorities had had to be cancelled. “We have had to reassure parents, please keep your children at home and Muslim women should stay at home because they are a target because of the hijab,” he added. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister said people involved in recent disorder in Northern Ireland were ""causing destruction to their own communities"". The Democratic Unionist Party Emma Little-Pengelly told reporters at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine that nothing was achieved by violence.  Police have made a number of arrests since the weekend. There has been widespread disorder across the UK - which erupted after the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport - with unrest fuelled by misinformation online."

They said it was completely unacceptable that far-right extremists ""feel emboldened to terrorise our streets, places of worship, asylum and refugee centres."" Anyone planning to take part in counter-protests has been urged not to wear face coverings, as they can suggest people are looking for trouble. Leaders of mosques in the city are also asking Muslims to be mindful of misinformation and fake news on social media platforms. There have been a number of disturbances in recent days, including in the Bordesley Green area, as well as groups gathering outside outside a mosque in Solihull.  In eight-point guidance issued by the mosques, they urge the community to show patience and restraint, and allow West Midlands Police do its job. ""Be responsible and conduct yourselves in the best of manner that epitomises our faith,"" state the leaders, warning against falling for ""bait"" shared on social media. Wait for verified information before ""reacting in a lawful manner"" or sharing news, they stressed. On Monday, a pub was attacked after rumours a far-right group was inside, with community activists later apologising to the venue. People considering getting involved in counter-protests should not wear balaclavas as they ""only portray negative connotations and cause aggravation."" There is no need to hide your face if your ""sincere intention is to protect and defend,"" added the statement.

A petrol bomb was thrown towards the centre on Greenwell Street on Saturday morning, while graffiti was written on the wall. It is one of a number of racially-motivated hate crimes being investigated by police across Northern Ireland over the past week. Abdul Rob said four generations of his family have used the centre. Cars were also set alight in Tavanagh Street and Sandhurst Gardens in Belfast in separate attacks. It follows a week of sporadic disorder which saw rioters attack police at various sites in Belfast and several members of the public reported they had been assaulted.  Thirty-four people have been arrested. On Friday night, the rear door of a restaurant on Ormeau Road was also kicked and racial slurs shouted to the workers inside. Speaking to BBC News NI on Saturday, Abdul Rob said his community is ""not going to leave"". ""This is our country, we’re going to stay there, why are we going to go,"" he said.  Strangford MP Jim Shannon condemned the ""heinous attack"". ""This attack is on, people, our neighbours, who live, work and school their children here, who work in the NHS, local shops and are a part of our community,"" he said in a social media post. ""It is unacceptable."" SDLP MP Claire Hanna said an attack on a place of worship is ""beneath and below contempt"" and that it would ""not be tolerated"". Speaking at the United Against Racism rally in Belfast, she added she hopes those responsible feel ""the full force of the law"". Sinn Féin assembly member Deirdre Hargey described the attack on the mosque as ""disheartening"". ""We need to show that if they carry out these actions then we will go after them,"" she continued. A statement from the Islamic Centres of Northern Ireland condemned the ""mindless Islamophobic and hate attack"" on the Newtownards mosque on Saturday. ""We know that those perpetrators represent only a small minority of individuals with a far right agenda which is detrimental to the prosperity of Northern Ireland,"" it added. The statement also thanked the community for the ""overwhelming support"" members have received and praised those who turned out to anti-racism rallies held in Belfast and Londonderry over recent days. A number of anti-racist rallies have been held following days of sporadic disorder. One man was seriously injured when  attackers stamped on his head during an assault in the Donegall Road/Oban Street area on Monday night. A number of family homes and businesses were damaged. These including an estate agency on Woodvale Road which was rammed by a gang in a hijacked car. People from ethnic minorities who have made Northern Ireland their home have spoken out about their fear of being targeted during the violence.  A trustee of the Belfast Multi-Cultural Association (BMCA) said on Friday that his own family had not left the house for a week.   In anticipation of the possibility of further disorder this weekend, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) cancelled leave and asked officers to work on rest days.  The PSNI is also receiving support from Police Scotland which is to send 120 officers to Belfast to help quell the threat of violence.  This article was amended on 27 August 2024 to include comments made at the time by the member of parliament for Strangford."

Sabir Zazai told BBC Scotland News that some people in communities his organisation works with were scared to go out.  The BBC understands some groups have planned protests and counter protests north of the border in the coming weeks.  Police Scotland said any disorder will be ""identified quickly"" and ""responded to immediately"". The force dismissed speculation of a protest in Glasgow's George Square earlier.  Mr Zazai spoke following a meeting with faith leaders and First Minister John Swinney at Bute House.  On Tuesday, former First Minister Humza Yousaf, who is of Muslim faith, said he questions whether he and his family have a future in Scotland or the UK due to Islamophobia.  Mr Zazai said there was “lots of anxiety and uncertainty” among communities the Scottish Refugee Council works with.  “These people are fearful already, they have fled dreadful situations,"" he said.  ""We don’t want them to be retraumatised.” The charity chief said Scotland was “fortunate” not to have seen riots but warned “nowhere is immune to racism”.  He told BBC Scotland News: “Yesterday we had somebody living in an asylum hotel saying should I stay in the hotel or should I leave? “We've had other people worried about their wellbeing, people not being able to travel to their appointments with their lawyers or getting advice from us and others. “This should all be avoided and that shouldn't happen, people should not feel that insecurity and fear in our streets."" Counter demonstrations in Scotland have been organised after far-right activist Tommy Robinson posted about a ""pro-UK"" rally to be held in Glasgow's George Square next month. The English Defence League founder, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had earlier promoted false claims about the Southport attacker. Mr Zazai said that misinformation about the violent riots ""is damaging to everyone"".  The Muslim Council of Scotland said it has ""full trust"" that police protection in Scotland is strong enough following disorder elsewhere.  Mr Swinney said he was “very concerned” about the riots in other parts of the UK. After meeting with faith leaders and Scottish political party chiefs, the first minister said they wanted to send a message of solidarity, adding: “Violence plays no part in our society, that the Islamophobia that we’ve seen has no place in our society and that we’ve got to stand together in representing cohesive communities in Scotland.” Mr Swinney also met with Chief Constable Jo Farrell and Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie in Edinburgh. Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said they understood the disorder in other parts of the UK was causing concern and the force is running ""enhanced patrols and direct engagement"" to provide reassurance to communities. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure any potential for violence or disorder in Scotland is identified quickly and responded to immediately,"" he said.  ""We are aware of a number of potential protests, and counter protests, over the coming weeks, which will be policed appropriately but we are not going to speculate on or add publicity to individual potential events. ""I would also encourage everyone to be responsible in their use of social media and not to share speculation or inaccurate information."" More than 400 people have been arrested, and 100 have now been charged, in connection with violent scenes in towns and cities such as Rotherham, Middlesbrough and Bolton over the weekend. There has been further disorder in London, Plymouth and Belfast.  In Tamworth, Staffordshire, a hotel used to house people in the asylum system was targeted by rioters using petrol bombs and fireworks.  The violence followed  the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport. Subsequent unrest has been fuelled by online misinformation relating to the attacker."

The complaints are focused on two controversial interviews in the same episode. There were accusations of a conflict of interest, after presenter Ed Balls interviewed his wife, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. And there was criticism of how Balls and co-host Kate Garraway questioned Coventry South MP Zarah Sultana. ITV said it considered its interviews to be ""balanced, fair and duly impartial"". An Ofcom spokesperson said: ""We are assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate."" Both interviews related to the wave of violent unrest that has broken out in parts of the UK over the past week. Following the interview with Cooper, Deadline reporter Jake Kanter said it was ""baffling it was allowed to happen"", while other viewers described the dynamic of the interview as ""absurd"" and ""untenable"". Balls, a former Labour minister, is now a regular GMB presenter; Cooper, his wife, was appointed home secretary following the general election last month. They have been married since 1998. In an earlier debate on the programme on Monday, there was a testy interview with Balls, Garraway and Sultana, the Independent MP for Coventry South. In the item, Sultana, who previously sat as a Labour MP before she had the whip suspended in July, said the government should describe the riots as Islamophobic as well as racist, and challenged Balls on an article he had previously written about immigration. Writing afterwards on X, she said: ""The sneering contempt of 'journalists' will never stop me from calling out racism and Islamophobic hate."" After the number of complaints to Ofcom was published on Wednesday, she posted: ""I appreciate the solidarity so much."" Following Monday's episode, an ITV spokesperson said: ""Following a weekend of rioting and national unrest, GMB featured a range of interviews and discussion around this national emergency on today’s programme. ""[These] included James Cleverly, Shadow Home Secretary and Yvette Cooper, Home Secretary. ""We are satisfied that these interviews were balanced, fair and duly impartial."""

Organisers said it was held to show solidarity with the migrant community of the north west in response to some of the violent scenes seen in Belfast and some areas in England in recent days. There have been no such violent scenes in Northern Ireland's north west. Derry City and Strabane District Mayor Lilian Seenoi-Barr, who is originally from Kenya and is Northern Ireland's first black mayor, was among those who addressed the crowd. The event was organised by United Against Racism Derry, as well as organisations such as the North West Islamic Association. Organiser Davy McAuley said it was great to see such a large turn-out in support of people who have come from all over the world to live in Derry. ""This is a city united against racism,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme. ""Events such as these are important because Derry has a rich history of standing up for people, this is a city of civil rights. ""When our friends and neighbours feel threatened, we want to tell people that we won't stand for this and it won't be tolerated."" Lilian Seenoi-Barr told the crowd that migrants, many of whom had fled persecution and war, should be made to feel welcome.  Ms Seenoi-Barr said she was deeply concerned by the ""escalating hate crimes, Islamophobia and racism on the island of Ireland"". She said she had met senior police officers, politicians and statutory agencies to reassure communities across Northern Ireland that everything is being done to make them feel safe. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the rally passed off peacefully and without incident. However, after the rally finished, police intercepted a number of individuals, some with their faces covered, on Magazine Street who were setting off smoke bombs.  The police said these individuals dispersed when officers intervened.  They said enquiries were ongoing and video footage would be reviewed. No injuries were reported and no arrests were made."

Police Scotland said any disorder will be ""identified quickly"" and ""responded to immediately"". Speaking to the News Agents podcast, Mr Yousaf said he was ""as Scottish as they come"" but he didn't know if he saw a future here for his wife and three children. The MSP for Glasgow Pollok said: ""I was born in Scotland, raised in Scotland, educated in Scotland, just welcomed my third child here in Scotland. Was leader of the Scottish government for just over a year, leader of the Scottish National Party.

He said he had been concerned about the rise of Islamophobia for some time. ""We are now seeing the culmination of not years, actually decades of anti-migrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric being normalised in our political discourse now playing out in the most violent way possible,"" he added. Mr Yousaf became the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party when he became first minister in March 2023. Police responded to violent scenes in towns and cities such as Rotherham, Middlesbrough and Bolton over the weekend. Disorder also occurred in Plymouth and Belfast on Monday. More than 400 people have been arrested in connection with the disorder and 100 have so far been charged. The disorder follows the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport. Subsequent unrest has been fuelled by misinformation online relating to the attacker. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned the violence, telling ministers: ""It is violent disorder and needs to be treated as such, as criminal activity.""

Thousands of counter-protesters have taken to the streets in towns and cities across the UK after rumours that far-right organised gatherings would target immigration centres and mosques. Haddi Malik, 25, joined a peaceful march in Accrington, Lancashire, walking between two mosques in the town to counter a potential right-wing march.  Mr Malik told the BBC it was a ""massive"" moment when pubgoers came up to some of the people marching and began hugging them.  ""We went to go and support the mosque that was under threat of violence,"" he said.  He said around 300 of the group gathered outside the Raza Jamia Masjid mosque before peacefully marching across town. Mr Malik said: ""We reflected on the history of the town, how South Asians, white people and Muslims have lived side-by-side there for decades."" In a video posted on X, patrons of a pub on Blackburn Road came out and embraced some of the group.  ""There were a few shouts of ‘respect’ which was fantastic, we need to see unity to stop all this far-right violence,"" Mr Malik said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l8pk0964no,Two men jailed after fight at Leeds protests,"Sameer Ali and Adnan Ghafoor, from Leeds, are jailed for their role in a fight following a protest.",9 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Two men from Leeds have been jailed after pleading guilty to affray following a protest. Sameer Ali, of West Park Drive, West Park, and Adnan Ghafoor, of Spen Bank, West Park, were sentenced at Leeds Crown Court on Friday. The offences took place following an anti-immigration protest and a counter- demonstration in Leeds city centre on 3 August. Ali, 21, was jailed for 20 months, while Ghafoor, 31, received a two-and-a-half-year sentence after the court heard he had breached a suspended sentence for driving offences. Ali and Ghafoor, who were not known to each other, had been walking in a group of about 17 people at about 16:40 BST after leaving the Headrow following the demonstrations outside Leeds Art Gallery. As they were walking, they encountered a group of four men on Great George Street, two of whom were draped in Union Jack flags while a third was wearing a Union Jack mask. Ali's solicitor, Graham O'Sullivan, said his client claimed a fight started when racist comments were made by one of the four men. CCTV footage played to the court showed Ali punching two of them before grabbing another man's flag and attacking him. He then returned to the other men and continued to attack them. Prosecutor Heather Gilmour said Ali played a ""leading role"" in the violence, while Ghafoor had hit one member of the group three times when he was in a chokehold. Defending Ali, Mr O'Sullivan said his client, who had no previous convictions, was ""provoked in this case by Islamophobic threats and abuse"". Ali appeared in court via video link from HMP Lincoln. He showed no emotion throughout the hearing. Mr O'Sullivan said his client ""recognises that what he did was very wrong"" and said the backdrop to the offence, amid recent heightened racial tensions throughout the UK, ""gives some explanation as to how he would behave this way, so out of character"". The Recorder of Leeds, His Honour Judge Guy Kearl, said it was not clear to him which group instigated the conflict. He told Ali: ""You walked away down the centre of the road, laughing and congratulating yourself and others in your group, turning towards those whom you had attacked with your arms out wide as you left through the traffic, which had stopped as a result of the disorder."" The court heard Ghafoor, a personal trainer, had two previous convictions for racially or religiously aggravated common assault and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. In April, he was given a 20-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for dangerous driving. His solicitor, Frances Penchton, said her client, who has an 18-month-old child, ""simply allowed himself to get caught up in a situation which unfolded and ended within 30 seconds"". His behaviour had been ""a short-lived moment of madness"", she added. Both men handed themselves in to police on Monday. Judge Kearl said Ghafoor had ""targeted a male who was being restrained by others and aimed punches at his head and body"". ""You then walked off, waving to the white males, inviting further confrontation,"" he added. Judge Kearl said Ali and Ghafoor's actions contributed to ""a heightened state of public concern and anxiety"". He told the court: ""Given the nationwide context of the violence and in order to provide punishment and deterrence in accordance with the overarching principles of sentencing, severe sentences will follow for those found to have participated in incidents of violence."" Meanwhile, another man was jailed for eight months at Leeds Crown Court on Friday after pleading guilty to using threatening or abusive words or behaviour with intent to cause alarm or distress at the same protest. The court heart that Jordan Plain, 30, from Horsforth, had made monkey noises and other racist gestures towards Sarata Sawo. In a victim impact statement, Ms Sawo told the court: ""Many people have defended Jordan for what he did to me and said it was right. It was not right. ""I was born in Leeds and I have lived here my whole life. It's such a beautiful, diverse city.  ""I don't even feel welcome in my own home. I don't even feel safe in my own house or area."" Ms Sawo, a full-time student, said she had taken time off work because of the impact of the incident. Plain, who the court heard had an eight-year-old child with a woman of mixed-race heritage, had been in attendance at an English Defence League protest on Saturday, Ms Gilmour said.  He had numerous previous convictions, including for racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage and fear or provocation of violence, the court was told. A probation officer said Plain had been drinking on the day of the protest and had been ""binge drinking"" while unemployed and in receipt of state benefits, having previously worked as a roofer. He had told a probation interview he was ""ashamed"" of his behaviour and added: ""I don't want to make any excuses for what I have done."" Defending, Mike Walsh said his client had shown ""genuine remorse, not just because he's finding himself in custody"". Judge Kearl told Plain: ""Given the context in which this incident occurred and the sustained nature of your conduct, which was designed to stir up racial hatred at a time of heightened social tension, an immediate custodial sentence cannot be avoided."" Like Ali and Ghafoor, he was told he must serve half of his sentence before he could be released on licence.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2r3lxzedo,'I thought days of race hatred were over' - Riots take British Asians back to 1970s,Scenes from the past week in England and Northern Ireland have sparked painful memories among British Asians who remember the 1970s and 80s.,10 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Mosques attacked with bricks and stones. Marchers chanting “we want our country back.” And a man’s head reportedly stamped on during a racist attack. These scenes from the past week in England and Northern Ireland have sparked painful memories among British Asians who remember the 1970s and 80s, when racist violence was widespread and the National Front was on the rise. Harish Patel, in his 70s, says it broke his heart. He says teenagers will have heard from their parents and grandparents about what life could be like in this country. “They’ll have thought it was all over. And now they are experiencing it for themselves.” The disorder was triggered by the fatal stabbing of three young girls in Southport - followed by false speculation that the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker. It sent a thunderbolt of fear down Asian and minority communities. Mungra, an elderly Asian woman who arrived from Kenya 50 years ago, was taken back to her early days in London. She worried the escalating violence would make it too frightening to get milk from the corner shop. “That’s how we felt in those days, and I worry.” Tens of thousands of South Asians came to work in the the UK's factories and public services in the 1950s, as the country rebuilt its post-war economy. By the early 1970s, the population had grown to around half a million - because of family reunions and Asians fleeing East Africa, many of whom had been expelled from Uganda. Immigration became a politically charged issue. In 1968, Conservative MP Enoch Powell had given his explosive “rivers of blood” speech, in which he said that by permitting mass immigration, the country was “heaping up its own funeral pyre”. The extreme right-wing National Front was at its most vocal and regularly held rallies. Asians had to contend with day-to-day harassment and police brutality. “The climate and fear of racism was so profound that it was hard to ignore that I was of coloured skin,” Mungra says. “It was the usual name-calling when walking on the street, the p-word.“ Mungra witnessed the riots in Southall, a predominantly Asian part of west London. They took place in 1979, three years after the racist murder of local Sikh teenager Gurdip Singh Chaggar. Weeks before a general election, the National Front decided to hold a meeting in Southall's town hall. Thousands - mainly Asians, but also anti-racist allies - took to the streets in protest against the far-right and police brutality. Forty were injured, including 21 police, 300 were arrested and a teacher was killed, probably by an officer who struck a fatal blow, according to a Met Police report. These were brutal times which left a lasting trauma on those who lived through them. And they bring me back to my own childhood. I was only a toddler when a lit firework was put through the letterbox of my parents’ home in Hampshire. Our neighbours didn’t like Asians living on the street. My mum recalls grabbing my brother - a hyperactive child a few years older than me - as he ran towards the front door. She was shaking for hours afterwards. She’ll never forget how frightened she felt in that moment. It happened months after the p-word was scrawled on our garage door. We were living with my Gujarati sari-wearing grandmother at the time, and my parents felt incredibly vulnerable. They felt they were being targeted for looking different when all they were doing was trying to live a happy life in 1980s Britain. We moved shortly afterwards. It’s striking that decades later, I’ve heard Asians - including members of my own family - saying they were again scared to leave their homes. Nervously tugging his fingers, Iqbal, a father from Bolton in his 50s, told me he was terrified and that his children had told him to not go outside. “I thought these days of race hatred were over,” he said. Over the seven days of riots, hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked, minority-owned businesses were looted and cars and buildings set alight. More than 400 arrests were made. Muslims were particularly targeted - with missiles hurled at mosques, Islamophobic chants and Muslim gravestones in Burnley vandalised. Police patrols were ramped up, but some younger people said they didn’t trust officers to protect them. “We don’t feel like they’ve got our back when they haven’t protected us so far. We feel vulnerable and feel like we’ve got to protect ourselves,” said Mohammad, in his 20s. But Wednesday felt like a turning point. As communities braced for a night of disorder, after names and addresses of immigration lawyers were spread online, the unrest largely failed to materialise. Instead, thousands of anti-racism protesters rallied in cities and towns across England. People chanted “racism off our streets”. In Accrington, Lancashire, Muslim anti-fascist protesters who went to protect a local mosque were embraced by pubgoers, in a “massive” moment of unity. ""There were a few shouts of ‘respect’ which was fantastic; we need to see unity to stop all this far-right violence,"" said Haddi Malik, who was in the group. The show of force has offered people a moment of hope and courage, and a sense of relief. But the ripples of intimidation haven’t yet settled. Some have been left wondering whether they’re really accepted in this country. “I don’t want to be made to feel like that,” says 20-year-old Muslim Hamza Moriss. “I’m a part of this country as much as they are.” Meanwhile, Mungra feels a deep sense of unease. “The last week has made me think that not much has really changed, that racism is still very much alive and we won’t ever actually be seen as the same… not really.” Top image shows a damaged shop on The Broadway in Southall following rioting in the area, taken on 4 July 1981."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ggw5r067o,ITV criticised after Balls interviews wife Cooper,"After criticism, a spokesman for ITV says they felt debates on Monday were ""fair and duly impartial"".",5 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"ITV has been criticised after Good Morning Britain presenter Ed Balls interviewed his wife, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, on Monday's programme. The former Labour MP and his co-host Kate Garraway interviewed Cooper  following the recent wave of violent unrest across England. Police officers have faced attacks in recent days, while shops have been broken into and cars set on fire. In response to accusations that the interview represented a conflict of interest, an ITV spokesman told the BBC it considered its interviews ""fair and duly impartial"". ""Following a weekend of rioting and national unrest, GMB featured a range of interviews and discussion around this national emergency on today’s programme,"" the broadcaster told BBC News. ""[These] included James Cleverly, Shadow Home Secretary and Yvette Cooper, Home Secretary. ""We are satisfied that these interviews were balanced, fair and duly impartial."" The programme attracted criticism on social media after it aired, with some viewers suggesting it raised issues of bias and conflict of interest. Deadline’s Jake Kanter posted on X: ""'Still to come, the home secretary will be joining us shortly, who Ed of course is married to.' Actual words said this morning on a TV channel with a legal duty to impartiality. ""Baffling it was allowed to happen."" Other viewers described the dynamic of the interview as ""absurd"" and ""untenable"". Over the last week, police have faced violence in Rotherham, Middlesbrough, Bristol, Bolton and other parts of the UK. Shops and hotels have been broken into, while cars and bins have been set on fire and officers attacked.  The exchange on Monday's programme aired before the government’s emergency Cobra meeting. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has since announced a ""standing army"" of specialist police officers to tackle violent protests. The unrest follows a stabbing attack in Southport last week in which three children attending a dance class were killed. Balls and Cooper have been married since 1998, and have three children. Earlier in the programme, Balls told Garraway he ""had not seen [Cooper] at all in the last week"", amid the fallout of the riots. ""When these events happen, and if you're the prime minister or the home secretary, it becomes pretty much 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so it's tough,"" he commented. When Garraway replied: ""So you have genuine questions you need answers to?"" He said: ""Absolutely."" After Garraway kicked off the interview, Balls said: ""Can I ask, because we've talked about this a few times in the last few days, like many of our viewers will have done at home since those terrible killings in Southport, there have been identifiable individuals on social media, who have been inciting not just riots but violence. ""They've been using racist language. They've been using falsehoods about what happened in Southport. ""This is this is happening on the social media platforms. What can be done, what should be done now by the social media companies and the police and the Government to stop this happening, because it's been happening for a week?"" Balls also questioned Cooper on whether there has been a ""two-tier approach"" to policing, and if police have been ""softer and more cautious"" when policing the Gaza demonstrations, compared to a ""tougher"" approach over the last week. Cooper replied that police have to operate ""without fear or favour, whatever the kinds of crimes it is that they face"". Viewers have also criticised an earlier debate on the programme, between Balls, Garraway and Labour MP Zarah Sultana. In the item, Sultana said the behaviour of riots should be considered Islamophobic as well as racist.  Nadine White, the Independent’s race correspondent, said Balls ""sneered at her"" in response, and criticised the rest of the panel, who she described as ""white commentators with no lived experience of racism"". BBC News has contacted a spokesperson for Balls for comment.  Islamophobic slurs were heard in the unrest on Saturday and Sunday, and mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers were targeted. Balls was a Labour MP from 2005 to 2015, and acted as shadow chancellor. He became a TV personality after competing in Strictly Come Dancing in 2016. He is one of several rotating hosts to have presented ITV's breakfast show in recent years, along with Richard Madeley, Adil Ray and Robert Rinder, following the departure of Piers Morgan. Balls first appeared as a guest presenter on Good Morning Britain in 2021, and joined their rotating presenter line-up regularly the following year."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84jjv7kp1wo,Mosque leaders find moments of hope after violent disorder,Photos of mosque worshippers reaching out to an angry mob have been widely shared on social media.,5 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Among the many stark images emerging from the recent wave of unrest across England were photos of Muslims embracing protesters outside the UK's oldest mosque. A demonstration was held outside the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque in Liverpool at the end of a week in which misinformation about the Southport attacks was blamed for stoking Islamophobia. A counter-demonstration drew a several hundred more people and, once the situation had calmed, mosque volunteer Adam Kelwick and other worshippers crossed over in an attempt to speak to those present. The mosque’s chairman Dr Abdul Hamid, a family doctor, believes there is a ""fear of the unknown"", adding: ""If they don’t get answers, they will try to find any excuse to label you."" Scratching below the surface of what was going on, Mr Kelwick said he found people not to have been motivated by anything in particular - rather just lashing out in a state of general frustration. He said: ""None of the people who I spoke to mentioned Southport. ""I don’t think they knew what they were protesting about - I think they’re just angry, fed up."" In fact, he said there were ""beautiful interactions"" as the group from the mosque were able to ""break bread"" and listen to some people's concerns in ""deep conversations"". Photographs showed the sharing of food, hugs and handshakes were among the more positive posts being shared widely on social media. ""Some of the most vocal protesters, after everyone else had gone, came inside the mosque for a little tour,"" Mr Kelwick added. Dr Hamid, who works as a GP in a deprived area of Liverpool, said: ""The far right are a spectrum so there are those who are very, very extreme but there are people who have certain issues, whether political or personal, and they need to vent that. ""If you don’t provide them with a platform to do that, they will go on to the streets."" Mr Kelwick, who became a Muslim in 1999, has engaged with several groups in open mosque forums during the past decade, discussing the impact of grooming gangs among other topics. And he said there was nearly always progress. ""Every single event has had people who are very angry - shouting sometimes - very upset, but everyone comes together after a time,"" he said. He remembered how one man nearly broke down in tears after being invited to a restaurant meal following an event. ""He said no one had treated him like that before. All we had done was buy him a kebab."" Mr Kelwick, who saw some of Saturday’s later clashes on the city’s Pier Head from a distance, said it was not a situation for ""bridge-building"". ""There are thugs among them but there are also genuine concerns,"" he said. ""The priority has to be safety and security and everyone needs to calm down."" However, mosque leaders are conscious that there is less hope for others. Ibrahim Syed, a coordinator with Liverpool Region Mosque Network, said engagement with some groups ""was encouraging to see"" but the more extreme far-right activists should be banned ""like other Islamist groups"". Speaking after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met religious leaders in the region, he said: “There is the argument that the police already have the powers to stop the violence.  ""But what I think it’s important to note is that actually their words of hate and polarisation also need to be controlled."" Initially set up in 1887, the Liverpool Muslim institute was recently renamed the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque after its founder William Quilliam, a lawyer born in the port city. While recovering from illness, he converted to Islam after a trip to Morocco and adopted the name Abdullah. Mr Kelwick told how the mosque faced angry mobs in the Victorian era but Quilliam had an ""open door"" policy, eager to engage with the wider city through charity and educational efforts. He said worshippers were still following in those footsteps by being involved in the ""ridding of ignorance and bringing people together"". Dr Hamid said the widely-shared images of the friendly exchanges could help ""drown out the negativity"". ""There might be people in that far-right spectrum that will think twice,"" he said. ""We’re not going to be able to change everyone’s mind, but that positivity can spread like wildfire."" Mr Kelwick said some people had been dismissive and sceptical about the mosque's efforts and dismissed the social media coverage as attention-seeking. But Mr Kelwick said perhaps they were missing the point. He added: ""Yes, I am doing this for publicity because I want this message of hope and coming together to get out as far as possible.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78l1x0d9zro,"No complacency over riots coming to Wales, says FM",Eluned Morgan says she has spoken to the prime minister about the possibility of riots in Wales.,7 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Wales' new first minister has said she is ""not complacent"" about the possibility of riots coming to Wales. Mass disorder broke out across England and Northern Ireland after false information spread across social media claiming the suspect in the murder of three children in Southport was an asylum seeker. Cardiff-born Axel Muganwa Rudakubana has been charged with three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murders and possession of a curved kitchen knife. ""We are a society and a nation that should be welcoming people... we cannot let those people who are determined to be destructive within our communities to get a hold,"" Eluned Morgan said. Ms Morgan officially became Wales' first female first minister on Tuesday, after the Senedd was recalled to vote in a replacement for Vaughan Gething.  Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, she said she had spoken to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Tuesday evening regarding the riots - one of her first duties as first minister. ""I am very concerned about it and I’m certainly not complacent about the possibility of that happening in Wales, which is why I have already asked for a meeting to be set up with the police and some community leaders,"" she said. ""I spoke to Keir Starmer about this last night and, clearly, policing is not a devolved issue so we do need to keep in close contact with them."" Posting to X, formerly known as Twitter, ex-Member of the Senedd for Plaid Cymru Bethan Sayed said Wales was ""not immune"" to the attitudes and views being channelled in the outbreaks of violence. She said a friend of her husband, who was from India, had recently been verbally abused while at a Cardiff petrol station. ""Guys came out of a car and went up to him as he was taking petrol, shouting, screaming at him to go home. He's so scared now,"" she wrote. Ms Morgan emphasised there was ""no place for racism within our communities"". She added: ""I think we have got to listen to communities and be sensitive to their needs, but there is a line where we must be intolerant of intolerance.  ""And that is a line I will not be prepared to cross."" Sir Keir promised communities they would be kept safe after he chaired an emergency Cobra meeting on Tuesday night. It is understood there are at least 30 potential gatherings planned for Wednesday that police are aware of. The prime minister praised the ""robust and swift response"" of the criminal justice system and said it should ""send a very powerful message"" to those considering further violence. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts MP, said: ""The behaviour of those people who seek to incite division, spread mistruths and pitch different groups of people against each other is beyond contempt.""  She added while there had been no reports of violence in Wales, ""we should all be mindful of the potential for racist and Islamophobic hatred to blight our communities and challenge those attitudes when they arise"". Andrew RT Davies MS, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""Thuggery is completely unacceptable, and all those responsible must face harsh punishment."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd05znr1xero,"'No place for racism in our society', says O'Neill","Since the weekend, there have been consecutive nights of violence in parts of Belfast.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Executive ministers condemned recent violence ahead of the Northern Ireland Assembly being recalled. First Minister Michelle O’Neill said the executive is “unequivocally” collective in its determination to say no to racism. She said there is “no place for racism in our society”, adding that it is “absolutely wrong”.  On Thursday afternoon during the recall, MLAs backed an Alliance motion condemning the recent disorder and rejecting “all forms of racism” in Northern Ireland. Ms O’Neill said people from ethnic minorities were afraid to go about their normal routines. “We have healthcare workers who are afraid to go to their work, we have nurses who are afraid to go home,” she said. That is “the real human impact” of this type of racist activity, she added.  Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said Northern Ireland's political parties were ""sending a strong and united message against violence, disorder and racism"". The fact that some healthcare workers are thinking of leaving as a result of the violence is ""deeply disturbing"", Ms Little-Pengelly said, emphasising their ""huge"" contribution. She also wanted to acknowledge the ""positive contribution of many ethnic minority people"" in Northern Ireland. Violence is always ""wrong"" and ""never the answer"", she added. Justice Minister Naomi Long said the disorder was not representative of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland. “We need to call it for what it is. It is racism; it is Islamophobia,"" she said.  ""If we’re going to deal with it, we need to name it what it is, and we need to challenge it.” The Alliance leader said the people being attacked are “part of our community” and “valued”. “It is incumbent on all of us in political leadership, but also all of us as a community to make them feel that they are welcome and safe,” she added. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent It's not often you hear a round of applause in the assembly chamber. But that happened on several occasions on Thursday as MLAs reflected on events of the past week. Members of minority community groups sat and watched in the public gallery as politicians addressed them directly, offering words of support and of condemnation against what has happened so far. While recall debates are often described as little more than talking shops, many felt the seriousness of the situation demanded our politicians' presence today. Politicians may struggle in the short-term to change attitudes, but there is pressure on the executive to act in certain policy areas, such as updating racial equality strategies. Strategies which at surface level may not mean much, have practical consequences for how those communities are represented and the access to services they get. There is also the question of better resources for the PSNI. Yesterday, when I asked the secretary of state could he commit to improved funding for the organisation, he said it was a matter for the executive to prioritise what they already have for this year. Today, the first and deputy first ministers told me they're still fighting to get the Treasury to improve our funding formula and insisted the PSNI will not be ""alone"" in tackling this issue. Speaking in the assembly, DUP MLA for Upper Bann, Jonathan Buckley, said he wanted to make it “crystal clear” that he condemned the violence “on our streets and across the United Kingdom”. He expressed his sympathy for the families of the victims of the knife attack in Southport on 29 July in which three young girls died. SDLP South Belfast MLA Matthew O’Toole welcomed members of the Muslim community to the assembly chamber. “We owe them an apology for what they and their community have had to endure in this society and city over recent weeks and days,” he said. Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken praised the work of ethnic minority health workers, saying he spent several hours in Antrim Area Hospital on Wednesday with one of his children. He said those in the emergency department were grateful for the ""professional medical care they were receiving"". Mr Aiken said some ""very misguided"" people thought it was appropriate to attack immigrants. ""It has to stop, it has to stop now,"" he stressed. The Northern Ireland Assembly was recalled following a successful petition, put forward by the Alliance Party. This meant MLAs have returned from their summer break to discuss recent disorder. It follows a spate of violence, with several businesses in the city attacked after an anti-immigration protest erupted into disorder. The first minister and deputy first ministers have said their joint priority is to face down racism and intimidation. There has been violent disorder in towns and cities across the UK since last Tuesday, the day after three young girls were killed in Southport. False claims on social media followed that someone who had arrived in the UK illegally was to blame. On Saturday, a cafe was set alight and several businesses were attacked after disorder broke out in Belfast. Violence also erupted on Monday, Tuesday and Wedsnesday night in the city. Assembly members debated a motion from the Alliance Party that called on the assembly to condemn the criminal damage and ""targeting of businesses"" at the weekend. It also called on MLAs to recognise that PSNI resources are stretched and ""could have been much more effectively deployed elsewhere"". The move by Alliance to recall the assembly from its summer break was backed by Sinn Féin, the SDLP and independent unionist Claire Sugden. On Monday, Sinn Féin's Deirdre Hargey said First Minister Michelle O'Neill was cutting short a family holiday to return to the assembly for the debate. Immigration is a matter largely reserved for Westminster, but there have been calls for the Executive Office to do more to help refugees living in Northern Ireland. The recall motion also called on the first minister and deputy first ministers to finalise a Refugee Integration Strategy by the end of this year, and replace an ""outdated"" Racial Equality Strategy. Unlike England, Scotland and Wales, Northern Ireland has no refugee integration strategy. A public consultation on a draft strategy took place in February 2022, but the power-sharing executive collapsed during that time and the institutions remained suspended for two years. On Thursday, an anti-racism rally also took place outside Parliament Buildings where politicians reconvened to discuss the recent disorder and racist attacks. The demonstration was organised by trade unions and community groups. Meanwhile, hundreds of people attended an anti-racism rally in Guildhall Square in Londonderry on Wednesday evening.  Organisers said it was held to show solidarity with the migrant community of the north west in response to some of the violent scenes seen in Belfast and some areas in England in recent days."

Former home secretary Dame Priti Patel, Labour MP Diane Abbott and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage are among the politicians urging Sir Keir to cut short the parliamentary recess. Dame Priti, who is running to be Conservative leader, said there were ""many practical things"" MPs could do if Parliament was recalled. But Sir Keir said his focus was on stopping the disorder and making sure the streets were safe.  The prime minister was speaking following an emergency Cobra meetings with ministers and law enforcement representatives. He said an ""army"" of specialist police officers were on standby and the criminal justice system would be ramped up to charge those involved in the disorder. He also emphasised that ""criminal law applies online as well as offline"". Earlier Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said social media firms were being too slow at removing ""criminal material"" from their platforms.  The House of Commons stopped sitting last week, but the government can ask the Speaker to recall MPs if there is an event thought to be of national importance Over the past decade, the House of Commons and Lords have been recalled from recess six times for events including western forces chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the death of Prince Philip. Following the 2011 riots in London and other English cities, Parliament was recalled for one day.  Speaking to Times Radio, Dame Priti said politicians needed to ""get some kind of grip on this, which is why I am calling for the recall of Parliament right now so that we can actually discuss these issues."" ""Local authorities are now under pressure, the police are under pressure to do more effectively, we need to find out what more do they need."" However, other Tory leadership hopefuls Kemi Badenoch and James Cleverly have said they do not back a recall.  Mr Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a recall was not necessary to ensure MPs were receiving a ""clear flow"" of information.  ""There's nothing that needs to be voted on, there are no additional powers (needed)."" Backing a recall, veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott said: ""This is an extraordinarily grave situation. You've got people trying to burn down hostels where asylum seekers are cowering. You've got people attacking black and Muslim people on the street. ""We need to be able to question ministers on what exactly is being done and we want to speak up for our communities."" Another Labour MP, Dawn Butler, said: ""It may be time to recall Parliament. This violence needs to stop."" Reform UK leader and MP Nigel Farage said there needed to be ""a more honest debate"" about immigration and policing was needed and that a recall of Parliament would be ""an appropriate start to this"".  Last week, Mr Farage rejected accusations he had ""whipped up"" rioters by asking whether ""the truth is being withheld from us"", after police said the Southport attack was not being treated as a terror incident. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey welcomed the measures taken by the government adding: ""People from all backgrounds and all walks of life have come together to condemn these riots and clean up the damage - it is they who truly represent Britain, not the rioters and those who have incited them."" Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP, has written to the home secretary calling for an urgent meeting to ""discuss what actions are planned to stamp out this racist terror"". In a joint letter with four other independent MPs Ayoub Khan (MP for Birmingham Perry Barr), Adnan Hussain (Blackburn), Iqbal Mohamed (Dewsbury and Batley) and Shockat Adam (Leicester South), Mr Corbyn urged the government not to ""give succour to those seeking to sow hatred and division"".  The Green Party said the disorder had been caused by ""racism and Islamophobia"" and urged the government to ""celebrate and defend our Muslim citizens and their place in our diverse society""."

It comes after two nights of violent protest in English towns this week, following a knife attack in Southport. In a statement, Ch Supt Stephen Murray said police are aware of social media posts calling for protests across Northern Ireland including ""specific calls to block roads using women and children"". ""It is unclear at this time what the actual provenance for these posts or appetite for this activity is,"" he added. ""We will continue to plan a proportionate policing response and will continue to engage with those groups likely to be affected by any protest activity."" The Bishop of Down and Connor, Alan McGuckian, said that in recent days there had been ""disturbing scenes of violence, rioting and protest, often motivated by Islamophobia, xenophobia and racism, organised and mobilised by social influencers"". ""It has come to my attention that there are also those in Northern Ireland, often cloaked with the anonymity of social media, that are similarly stoking the coals of fear and mistrust against Muslims,"" he added. ""I make an appeal calling for all to remain calm, to seek peace and to promote community harmony."" When asked about the potential protests at a meeting of the Policing Board on Thursday, Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said the police were still trying to establish who was behind them. ""There is no set organisation showing themselves on social media which defines the cowardly nature of the people who do this nonsense,"" he added. ""If there are to be any gatherings we will police them and we will police them effectively."" Rev Trevor Gribben, clerk of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said ""the pursuit of such hatred, and the incitement of others to hate and instil fear"" was ""abhorrent"". Mr Gribben added that it was his ""prayer"" that people ""seeking to undertake this misguided course of action think again"". Rev Dr John Alderdice, president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, also joined the criticism of those calling for protests. ""The shocking knife attack in Southport last Monday where three children were killed and many others injured, saddened, and horrified us all. ""However, to use this attack as a pretext for anti-immigration protests is abhorrent."" Speaking on the BBC’s Evening Extra programme Rev Alderdice said he was “gravely concerned that protests like this should take place that would stir fear and division and racism across our society”. Also speaking on the programme, the former moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Norman Hamilton said “we need to do a bit more than simply issue condemnations”. He said that “any group, any organisation, any church with self-respect would want to... put as much distance as they can between themselves and what’s proposed"". But he added that “we need to understand why people want to engage in these sorts of protests and deal with those underling angst and concerns”. More than 100 people have been arrested at demonstrations in England after violent disorder was sparked by the murder of three primary school age girls at a dance studio in Southport on Monday."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjww791xnlo,Police officer injured after second hotel targeted in Tamworth,"Missiles are thrown, windows smashed and fires lit at the Holiday Inn in Tamworth, police say.",5 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Three petrol bombs were thrown at a Holiday Inn Express hotel in Tamworth on Sunday night, Staffordshire Police said. One officer suffered a suspected broken arm in what the force described as ""targeted violence"", with projectiles and fireworks thrown from a ""hostile"" crowd. Extra officers were drafted in from neighbouring forces in order to deal with the incident - which ended after the crowd was ""successfully dispersed"", police said.  Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Ellison referred to the violence as ""despicable thuggery"" and said officers in Tamworth had shown ""tremendous courage"".  Mr Ellison added: ""The local community do not deserve to be subject to this behaviour, and neither do the brave officers putting themselves in harm’s way to keep everyone safe. ""We will be using footage from CCTV, air support and our officers’ body-worn video devices to identify those responsible and seek the toughest possible punishment for these acts of senseless violence."" No one inside the Holiday Inn Express was injured, police said, but added that windows were smashed and petrol bombs were used to start a series of fires. In July, Tamworth's MP Sarah Edwards told the House of Commons the Holiday Inn in the town had been ""used for asylum purposes for years"". A spokesperson for IHG, which owns the Holiday Inn Express brand, said: ""The safety and security of our guests and colleagues is always our priority."" A similar incident took place in Rotherham on Sunday when anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of a Holiday Inn Express before starting fires. Meanwhile, violence in Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday went against everything the city represents, according to the leader of the city council. Ten people were arrested and three police officers injured after hundreds of protesters gathered in Hanley in the wake of the Southport attacks, in which three girls were killed. ""We unequivocally condemn these protests and the violent behaviour associated with them,"" said councillor Jane Ashworth. ""Their message of division goes against everything we stand for in Stoke-on-Trent."" Two men were also treated in hospital after being struck by blunt objects that were thrown although their injuries were not believed to be serious. ""I'm furious, I'm horrified, I'm disappointed, we do not want this kind of thing going on in our city,"" said Ms Ashworth. She said it was fortunate there had been little physical damage in the city centre, which was partly down to ""an extremely good job"" by the police, but many businesses had seen their trade affected after closing early due to the ""horrendous physical violence."" The council leader said she was expecting to see prison sentences ""and some heavy ones"" for those found to be responsible. At least seven of those arrested are from the city or neighbouring Newcastle-under-Lyme. They include 15 and 16-year-old boys accused of violent disorder or possessing offensive weapons as well as men arrested on suspicion of attacking emergency workers or racially or religiously aggravated harassment. Islamophobic chants could be heard on footage posted online during the day but there have also been accusations of  double standards from police. Footage shared online appeared to show an officer with a loud hailer addressing a group outside a mosque in Stoke-on-Trent. ""If there's any weapons, get rid of them, we are not going to arrest anybody,"" he appears to say. In response, a spokesperson for Staffordshire Police said it recognised ""some edited footage"" shared on social media had ""gained traction"" and had an effect on public confidence.  ""We’re committed to fully investigating all of the material available, addressing any lessons to be learnt with proportionate action and continuing to reassure people in Stoke-on-Trent,"" they added. Videos shared on social media, along with police drone footage, were also being reviewed to identify those involved in the disorder, they added. As well as the violence on the streets, police have also had to contend with misinformation spread on social media platforms. The force said rumours of two men being stabbed on Saturday - perpetuated by videos shared online - were false.  It said no such stabbings were reported.  A special prayer vigil was held on Saturday for ""peace and all people of goodwill to do what they can to encourage mutual respect,"" said Lloyd Cooke from Christian charity Saltbox. Mr Cooke, who spoke on behalf of Stoke-on-Trent's Faith Leaders Forum following the protests in Stoke-on-Trent, said all faiths in the city were united in calling for peace and understanding. ""Ultimately, hate and violence will solve nothing,"" he said. Follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e5e59z49go,Police disperse protesters after missiles hurled,"Ten arrests are made and three police officers and two men are injured in the disorder, police say.",4 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Riot police were deployed in Stoke-on-Trent after hundreds of people protested in the wake of the Southport attacks. The demonstration was one of several across the UK on Saturday, some of which turned violent. Officers in Stoke-on-Trent city centre came under fire from missiles at one point and Staffordshire Police said two men were also hit by a blunt object that was thrown. Ten people were arrested in connection with the disorder and remained in custody on Saturday evening, the force said. The 10 arrested, aged from 15 to 52, were mostly from the Stoke-on-Trent or Staffordshire area, officers said. Three police officers were assaulted and suffered minor injuries. A crowd of about 400 people gathered at about 11:30 BST in Hanley along with other groups of counter-protesters, including one outside the now-closed Hanley Town Hall. Earlier in the day the protests were largely peaceful but Staffordshire Police said a number of demonstrators had been dispersed by officers during the day and a large-scale policing operation remained in place six hours on. A Section 34 dispersal notice was also authorised allowing police to disperse people who might return to the area. Misinformation had been common on several social media platforms during the day and in an evening update the force said claims of two stabbings were ""false"". It said no stabbings were reported to police ""despite videos fuelling speculation on social media"". One in particular, which showed a man being treated for an injury to his head, ""fuelled the speculation"", a spokesperson added. ""We would like to reiterate that two men involved in the incident were hit with a blunt object that was thrown in the air,"" they said and added their injuries were not thought to be serious. Islamophobic chants could be heard on some video footage while others showed officers coming under fire from missiles. Members of the North Staffordshire Campaign Against Racism staged a counter-protest. One of them, Sarah Breene-Crum, said: ""It's an insult to the families that have lost their children, the way that the far-right have behaved over the last few days."" Simon Crum added: ""There is a silent majority out there that are moderate and want a fairer society where we do allow immigrants and we look after refugees and we look after everyone."" As protesters made their way through Hanley, several buildings were closed for a time as well as a main route out of the city centre. A spokesperson for The Irish Woodman pub in Hanley said they and other firms in the area closed for the day due to the protests. ""Due to the terrible events in Hanley at the moment I've made the decision to close the pub for the rest of the day along with other businesses in Hanley,"" they said in a post on Facebook. Saturday’s protests, sparked by the death of three girls at a holiday dance session on Monday, came on the same day as a children’s dance production at Stoke-on-Trent's Regent Theatre. The presence of protesters outside following a matinee performance of Never Give Up forced the venue to go into lockdown, one parent said, to protect the children.  He said it was ""scary"" in the city centre, particularly knowing his daughter and other children were caught up in it. He added that while protesters had since moved on and the lockdown lifted, the evening performance was in the balance and might not go ahead. Another event, Summer Sounds at The Underground in the city centre ended early as a precaution. One person who was involved with the event said it was after taking advice from the police. On Saturday morning, the force had advised local people to stay indoors and if they needed to go out, not to do so alone.  Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Ellison said a large number of police officers would remain in Hanley on Saturday night. “Violent disorder of any form is completely unacceptable and those who are responsible will be met with the full force of the law,"" he added.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nggpp5nz7o,Police condemn violence and disorder on streets of Belfast,"Assistant Chief Constable Davy Beck said those who ""engaged in this behaviour bring nothing but shame to themselves and Belfast city"".",4 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has condemned the scenes of violence and disorder on ""the streets of Belfast"" on Saturday. The trouble happened after anti-immigration and anti-racism protesters faced off in tense scenes outside the city hall. Police are treating damage to several businesses as hate crimes.  Residents also had to leave an apartment block in south Belfast after it was set on fire.  The PSNI said four people have been arrested after 13 reports of criminal damage and five of arson. Three police officers were injured during the disorder - two remained on duty while the third was relieved from duty after suffering concussion. In a statement, First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said: ""Whilst people are entitled to peaceful protest, there is no justification for racism or the violence and intimidation that occurred on Saturday. ""Those involved should be quickly brought before the courts and we appeal to anyone with information to provide that information to the PSNI. ""We reiterate our joint commitment to a shared, peaceful and inclusive society."" After the protest outside the city hall some anti-immigration protesters had attempted to march to the Belfast Islamic Centre in south Belfast but were prevented by police. The crowd then made their way to Botanic Avenue, University Street, Lower Ormeau, Holylands and Donegall Road areas where sporadic violence developed for a number of hours. Disorder also broke out in the Sandy Row area and several cars were set alight and a business premises targeted. Assistant Chief Constable Davy Beck said those who ""engaged in this behaviour bring nothing but shame to themselves and Belfast city"". “This disorder, violence and destruction has no place in Belfast or anywhere else across the streets of Northern Ireland,"" he said. “I would strongly urge anyone who was involved in yesterday’s rioting and disorder to think long and hard about their actions and the devastating impact this has had on local communities."" A supermarket and a cafe in the Donegall Road and Sandy Row areas of south Belfast were also badly damaged by fire in overnight attacks. Abdelkader is the owner of the supermarket in the Donegall Road area that was targeted. He said he had shut the shop on Saturday afternoon and was surprised to see images of it burning on social media later that night. He said he was from Syria and had been living in Northern Ireland for eight years. “Everything we built from zero is destroyed,” he told BBC News NI. “Everything is done, my life is done.” He said he did not have the financial means to rebuild the property. Sam Yousef is a representative of the Syrian community in Belfast. He says that members of the community are “very afraid” and that he feels a bit unsafe as well. Mr Yousef says that on social media he has seen people telling each other not to leave the house because the situation is “very terrible”. “This is our country…we are trying to pay back, trying to work hard, pay tax, integrate into the society and contribute to the people here,"" he said. “Our children are growing up here and we want them to feel safe because we escaped an unsafe area."" Daniel Lannon, who attends a nearby church, said he was driving past on Sunday morning when he saw the destruction caused by the attack on the supermarket. He stopped to help with the clear-up. “I believe this is the right thing to do,” he added. “Some of the stuff that was going out on social media, with the protesters saying they were doing this in the name of Christianity, but that’s not Christianity. “Christianity is to love your neighbour, to help them, to help those who are different from you, so that’s what we are trying to do today.” A cafe on Botanic Avenue was also attacked by a crowd of anti-immigration protesters on Saturday afternoon as they made their way to the Holylands area of south Belfast. Protesters threw missiles at members of the media. Windows were smashed and furniture was broken in the cafe on Botanic Avenue. Rahmi, the owner of the cafe, who has been in Belfast for 35 years, told BBC News NI on Sunday that he ""could have been killed"". He reiterated that there could have been more of a police presence when ""the parade was walking"" through the area. “You watch the videos and you can see only me and these big, massive chairs that they keep throwing at me. “I’m sure if I had left the door open, they would do more damage or burn the inside.” On Saturday, the police said it was aware of a number of reports of criminal damage and were treating them as hate crimes. The Sinn Féin MLA for Belfast South, Deidre Hargey, said there are “concerns” around the police “operation that took place” because she had warned the PSNI about possible demonstrations. “We will be robustly following that up with the PSNI because lessons need to be learned,"" she added. “It was clear that there was no proper policing in the Botanic area, in the university area, and indeed into the Ormeau Road itself. These were issues that I had previously highlighted and flashpoints that could be sensitive areas.”  She also questioned if there had been ""enough action"" to even stop the crowds moving from city hall and throughout the streets in south Belfast. SDLP councillor Paul Doherty said his party would be requesting an urgent meeting with the PSNI. He said there were “serious questions for the police to answer”. Mr Doherty said “there was no police on” the Botanic Avenue when a business was damaged. “Why was that?” he asked. ACC Beck said the PSNI had a “significant policing operation” in place and that it was a “really challenging situation”. “It was a really dynamic and agile and fast-moving protest and I think my officers responded really well to that,” he said. “We will continue to work with any issues that we may face in the hours and the days ahead."" Mr Beck rejected criticism that the PSNI had fallen short in protecting businesses that had been attacked. “I do regret that people attacked businesses and that’s wrong and that’s where the fault lies,” he said. “It lies with those people that attacked and set out with violence in their mind and we will bring those people to justice.” Mr Beck said police officers had “responded to concerns right across Belfast” and that he had been in contact with community representatives. “We are working hard with the local community and will listen to the local community, we will respond to the concerns in the local community,” he added. Northern Ireland's Justice Minister, Naomi Long, condemned the violence. ""There can be no place in our community for hate: for xenophobia, racism and Islamophobia,"" she added. ""Neither can there be any place for such intimidation and intolerance.  ""My thoughts are with all those impacted by this disorder; those whose property was damaged, businesses attacked and who were intimidated, threatened or fearful as a result."" More than 100 people have been arrested after demonstrations organised by far-right groups descended into riots in UK towns and cities on Saturday. There was unrest in Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Blackpool, as well as Belfast, with missiles thrown, shops looted and police attacked in some places. Other smaller demonstrations elsewhere did not turn violent. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to give police forces the government's ""full support"" to take action against ""extremists"" attempting to ""sow hate""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1343eedzm6o,"'We're watching you,' far-right protesters warned",A home office minster says criminal activity will not be tolerated ahead of expected demonstrations.,2 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Home Office minister has warned those planning far-right protests this weekend that police are watching them. Demonstrations are expected in cities across the country, from Glasgow to Dover, following violent unrest around the Southport stabbing attack. Hundreds of mosques are strengthening security amid concern Islamic places of worship could be targeted. Lord David Hanson said police are monitoring organisers and would be using facial recognition technology to identify people. More than 100 people have been arrested at demonstrations after violent disorder was sparked by the murder of three primary school age girls at a dance studio on Monday. The BBC has identified at least 30 additional demonstrations being planned by far-right activists around the UK, including a new protest in Southport, this weekend. ""Nobody minds peaceful protest,"" Home Office minister Lord Hanson told BBC Breakfast.  ""But what happened this week in Southport, and what's happened elsewhere in the country, is organised individuals who have undertaken criminal activity to intimidate, to attack police, to break personal property, and that's not acceptable."" Highlighting how conspiracy to organise a riot is an offence, he added ""we are reminding people who are going to potentially commit this crime that we are watching them through intelligence-led policing"". Asked about the possibility of violent protests this weekend, he told LBC: “There is that potential, but I always say to anybody who's organising this, we will be watching you.""  Security staff are being hired at mosques in cities across the UK due to phoned-in threats about “targeted attacks”, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) reported. There is “deep-seated anxiety” and “palpable fear” among communities, MCB secretary-general Zara Mohammed said, urging mosques to work closely with police. Ms Mohammed said: “We go by what we’ve seen already and from what online posters are saying, but it sounds like far-right thugs and mobs are going to seek to intimidate congregations and mosques. “In Southport they were pelting stones and glass bottles, shouting Islamophobic slurs and abuse. “So it’s likely that we may again see groups of men and thugs coming together outside of the mosques to intimidate.” Protests are understood to be planned for areas such as Liverpool, Glasgow, Lancaster, Blackburn, Newcastle, Birmingham, Sunderland, Dover, Middlesbrough, Leeds and Hull, the MCB said. On Thursday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said groups seeking to incite disorder will be treated similarly to football hooligans, with more Criminal Behaviour Orders (CBO) to restrict the movement of offenders and stop them travelling. ""These thugs are mobile, they move from community to community, and we must have a police response that can do the same,"" he said. A former counter-terrorism police chief accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of helping incite the violence that broke out earlier this week, for a video he released on Tuesday in which he questioned “whether the truth is being withheld from us”. Neil Basu – who was in charge of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard from 2018 to 2021 – said there were “real world consequences” when public figures like the MP for Clacton failed to “keep their mouth shut”. ""That is a far-right politician once again trying to direct policing and law and order,"" Mr Basu told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Mr Farage insisted he had “merely expressed a sense of sadness and concern that is being felt by absolutely everybody I know – ‘what the hell is going on?’” He added: “I think it’s perfectly reasonable to ask what is happening to law and order in our country."" Civil rights campaign Big Brother Watch has expressed concern about the use of facial recognition technology, which the group's director Silkie Carlo described as ""alarming"" for democracy. ""Whilst common in Russia and China, live facial recognition is banned in Europe,"" she said. ""This AI surveillance turns members of the public into walking ID cards, is dangerously inaccurate and has no explicit legal basis in the UK."""

Northumbria Police said three of its officers were injured during the unrest and needed hospital treatment. Eight people have been arrested after a police building was ransacked and a Citizens Advice premises next door to it was set alight. Beer cans and bricks were thrown at riot police outside a mosque and cars were set on fire during the disorder. It is the latest episode of unrest to break out in towns and cities across England following the killing of three young girls in Southport on Monday.  Northumbria Police Ch Supt Helena Barron said officers had been met with ""serious and sustained"" levels of violence, which was ""utterly deplorable"".  She said a full investigation was under way to identify those responsible for any criminal behaviour. ""I want to make it absolutely clear that the disorder, violence and damage which has occurred will not be tolerated,"" Ch Supt Barron added. Of the three injured police officers, one has been discharged and two remain in hospital for further treatment, she said.  Some members of the crowd could be heard shouting Islamophobic slurs and chanting in support of far-right activist Tommy Robsinson, founder of the now disbanded English Defence League (EDL). Mr Yaxley-Lennon's X account has promoted false claims that the alleged Southport attacker had been an asylum seeker who recently arrived in the UK by boat.  Lewis Atkinson, Labour MP for Sunderland Central, said: ""Last night one of the flags on the street bore the reference to the North East Infidels, which is a Nazi offshoot from the North East chapter of what was the EDL."" Mounted police were deployed to Sunderland's city centre to push back demonstrators, some of whom were in masks. Officers also had beer barrels thrown at them, as young men shouted: ""Whose streets? Our streets"". Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said criminals attacking the police would ""pay the price for their violence and thuggery"". Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service confirmed it had been called out to the fire near the Sunderland Central Police office.  Rail and bus services were halted with Tyne and Wear Metro operator Nexus saying it had been asked by British Transport Police to close Sunderland Rail Station at around 22:15 BST. The Omniplex cinema in the city was also forced to close during the evening in the interest of public and staff safety, it said.  Residents said they could still hear police helicopters in the sky past midnight.  Mayor of the North East Kim McGuinness said rioters have caused ""significant damage"" to the city. ""They've set fire to a police station, to cars, they've looted shops, they've abused people in the street, they've attacked police officers and Sunderland will be feeling the effect of that,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""These people do need to be dealt with, with the full force of the law - you cannot use other people's grief to commit crime and violence"". Sunderland AFC posted on social media: ""Tonight’s shameful scenes do not represent our culture, our history, or our people.  ""Our great city is built on togetherness and acceptance, and Sunderland will forever be for all. We are stronger as one community."" Sunderland Central MP Lewis Atkinson said the police had his full support in response to the criminal ""thuggery"".  A crowd of about 200 anti-racist protesters also gathered outside the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque in Liverpool on Friday night after rumours of a far-right protest there. The group chanted: ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here"". Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said extra prosecutors had been called into work this weekend to deal with the disorder.  ""We have deployed dozens of extra prosecutors who are working round the clock this weekend, supporting the police, and ready to make immediate charging decisions so that justice is swiftly delivered,"" he said.  Towns and cities including London, Hartlepool, Manchester, and Aldershot have seen protests descend into violence following the Southport knife attack.  In response, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced a new national violent disorder programme to help clamp down on violent groups by allowing police forces to share intelligence. In a televised speech on Thursday, Sir Keir said: ""These thugs are mobile, they move from community to community, and we must have a police response that can do the same."" He also condemned ""violent disorder, clearly whipped up online"". ""We will take all necessary action to keep our streets safe"", the PM said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80x0gqvq7ro,Police separate crowds of protesters outside city mosque,Liverpool officers stepped up patrols amid more demonstrations in the aftermath of the Southport attack.,3 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Police moved to separate crowds of opposing protesters outside a mosque in Liverpool as more demonstrations began in the aftermath of the Southport attack. Merseyside Police formed a barrier between the two groups close to the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque on the city's Brougham Terrace from about 20:00 BST on Friday. A scuffle broke out between protesters at one stage as pro-refugee chants began from one side and others shouted ""go home"" in retaliation. Police had earlier insisted they were ""fully prepared for anyone intent on causing disorder"" as speculation built throughout Friday of protests being planned across the weekend. A short stretch of the road from the junction of Everton Road and Walker Street to the other side of the mosque was closed during the demonstration.  The gathering was among several which began around England in the wake of the knife attack at a children's dance workshop in Southport on Monday. Elsewhere, protesters clashed with police in Sunderland as they gathered for a planned demonstration, also outside a mosque. Stones and beer cans were thrown at police in riot gear, while mounted officers pushed back demonstrators, some of whom were in masks. Merseyside Police said extra officers were being deployed, with extra stop-and-search powers in place in both Southport and Liverpool into the weekend. Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, died after they were attacked by a knifeman at the Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Five children and two adults injured in the attack remain in hospital, while two other children have since been discharged from Alder Hey Children's Hospital. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer paid a visit to the hospital earlier as part of a second visit to Merseyside, where he thanked staff for their hard work and professionalism in responding to the attack. Merseyside Police Federation's Chris McGlade said more than 50 police officers were hurt in a ""sustained and vicious attack"" during violent protests in Southport on Tuesday.  ""Thugs"" who travelled to the town to use the attack ""for their own political purposes"" were to blame for the violence, the town's MP Patrick Hurley said. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said the disrespect that had been shown towards victims and grieving families and the community was ""despicable"". The officer praised the ""brilliant and heartening response"" from the people in the communities who had taken it upon themselves to help clean-up ""the destruction and mess left behind"" from the protests - with Southport Mosque being a target of the attack on Tuesday. She warned of the dangers of misinformation and speculation online, saying it could have ""real world consequences that put innocent people in harm's way"".  The chairman of a mosque that was attacked in Southport on Tuesday has said ""hate will never prevail"" as he joined other religious leaders on Friday to say hate ""must not be allowed to fester in our society"". Senior Imam Qari Asim read out a joint statement from Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders outside Southport Mosque. ""There are some who have chosen to use what should be a moment of collective grief to sow the seeds of division, spread Islamophobia and attack the mosque here in Southport,"" the joint statement said. ""People from all of our faiths live as minority communities in different places across the world and understand what it is like to be persecuted. ""And in times like this, we must all stand together and not let division destroy community cohesion in our cities and towns"". Imam Ibrahim Hussein, chairman of Southport Mosque, said he felt like ""the luckiest man in the whole country"" after seeing the support of the local community. ""But it is not about Southport Mosque, it is not about our suffering,"" he added.  ""We should have been focused all along about these poor people who have suffered in the most horrific way. ""Instead these people try to destroy what is so beautiful about our community."" Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Banks in Lancashire, appeared in court on Thursday charged with murder and attempted murder over the attack. Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said officers ""will not stand by and let criminals carry out unnecessary violence in our communities"". He continued: ""I'd like the public to know there is a robust and united response in place across the country, and police chiefs have agreed to step up resourcing this weekend. ""Our message to anyone thinking of getting involved in this type of criminality is clear - if you cause violence, you will face the full force of the law and we have the full backing of our criminal justice partners."" Det Ch Insp Tony Roberts said Merseyside Police had now made seven arrests following the disorder in Southport on Tuesday evening, adding that further arrests would be made over the coming weeks. He said the force was reviewing hundreds of hours of footage and images ""to identify everyone involved"". The disorder in Southport was followed by a number of incidents across the country on Wednesday. Eight people were arrested following disorder in Hartlepool, while two were arrested following an incident in Manchester, and over 100 arrests were made following disorder in central London. Several police officers have been injured in the incidents. On Thursday, Sir Keir announced that police forces across the country would be working more closely to tackle violent disorder. Home Office Minister Lord Hanson told LBC Radio that would-be protesters needed to ""be prepared to face the full force of the law on this criminal activity"".

Other smaller demonstrations elsewhere did not turn violent. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to give police forces the government's ""full support"" to take action against ""extremists"" attempting to ""sow hate"". Tensions have been high after the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday. In Liverpool, bricks, bottles and a flare were thrown at police, one officer was hit in the head when a chair was thrown, and another was kicked and knocked off his motorbike.  Around one thousand anti-immigration protestors, some of whom were shouting Islamophobic slurs, were confronted by counter-protesters.  A few hundred anti-fascist demonstrators gathered near Liverpool’s Lime Street station at lunchtime, calling for unity and tolerance, chanting “refugees are welcome here” and “Nazi scum, off our streets”. Police in riot gear with dogs struggled to keep the two sides apart and reinforcements were called to try and maintain order. The unrest continued into the early hours of Sunday morning, with fireworks launched towards police officers wearing riot gear. A library was set on fire in the Walton area of the city and rioters tried to prevent firefighters from putting it out, Merseyside Police said. Shops were broken into and a number of wheelie bins were set on fire, it added. The force confirmed a number of officers had been injured in what they described as ""serious disorder"", adding that two had been taken to hospital - one with a suspected broken nose and one with a suspected broken jaw. It said 23 people had been arrested. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Simms said: ""The disorder, violence and destruction has no place here in Merseyside, least of all after the tragic events that took place in Southport on Monday"". “Those who engaged in this behaviour bring nothing but shame to themselves and this city. "" More protests are expected on Sunday, though not as many as on Saturday. At a meeting of government ministers earlier on Saturday, a spokesperson for Sir Keir Starmer said the PM told those assembled that ""the right to freedom of expression and the violent disorder we have seen are two very different things."" He added: ""there is no excuse for violence of any kind and reiterated that the government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe"". On Saturday, the home secretary also warned that anyone engaging in ""unacceptable disorder” would face imprisonment and travel bans amongst other punishments, adding that ""sufficient"" prison places had been made available. ""Criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets,"" Yvette Cooper said. Police have the government's full backing in taking action against those engaging in ""thuggery"", she added. In Bristol, protesters and counter-protests were engaged in a standoff.  One group could be heard singing Rule Britannia, ""England 'til I die"" and ""we want our country back"". Beer cans were thrown at the anti-racism group, and some of the rival protesters were baton-charged by officers. Avon and Somerset Police said 14 people in the city had been arrested, with Chief Inspector Vicks Hayward-Melen anticipating there would be ""further arrests over the coming days"". In Manchester, there were scuffles with police, and at least two arrests.  While in Belfast, two people were arrested as protesters outside a mosque threw objects at members of the media and earlier smashed windows in a cafe. In Hull, protesters smashed a window at a hotel used to house asylum seekers, and bottles and eggs were thrown at police.  City Hall was placed on lockdown as the British Chess Championships took place inside. Humberside Police said three police officers had been injured and 20 people arrested after disorder in the city centre also saw shops ransacked and items set on fire. In Blackpool, protesters faced off against punks attending Rebellion Festival. There was little police presence as skirmishes broke out between the two groups, with bottles and chairs thrown.  Lancashire Police said it had arrested more than 20 people. The force said its focus had been on Blackpool but there had also been ""minor disruption"" in Blackburn and Preston. In Stoke-on-Trent, bricks were thrown at officers. Staffordshire Police said that two men at the centre of online claims they had been stabbed had actually been hit by an object that was thrown, and were not seriously injured. The force said 10 people had been arrested and three officers suffered minor injuries. Elsewhere Leicestershire Police arrested two people in Leicester city centre. And West Yorkshire Police said a protest on the Headrow in Leeds ""passed off largely without incident"", despite one arrest being made. Not all demonstrations held across the UK descended into violence on Saturday, and in some places protesters dispersed by the evening.  Saturday's protests follow a night of violence in Sunderland on Friday, which saw four police officers hospitalised.  Hundreds of people rioted, beer cans and bricks were thrown at riot police outside a mosque and a Citizens Advice office was torched. Twelve people have been arrested in connection with the violence. The BBC has identified at least 30 demonstrations being planned by far-right activists around the UK over the weekend, including a new protest in Southport. An extra 70 prosecutors are on standby this weekend to charge people arrested in connection with violent disorder. Shadow home secretary James Cleverly called on Sir Keir and the home secretary to ""do more"" to restore public order and ""send a clear message to the thugs"". Earlier this week, the prime minister announced a new national violent disorder programme to help clamp down on violent groups by allowing police forces to share intelligence. With additional reporting by BBC News reporters across England."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1e8d7llg9o,Did social media fan the flames of riot in Southport?,"False accusations about the attacker followed a familiar pattern, the BBC's Marianna Spring finds.",31 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"It’s become a familiar pattern of events: a violent, terrifying attack unfolds, innocent people are killed, and social media is set alight with unfounded - and often incorrect - accusations about the assailant's identity and what the motivation was. Think back to the stabbing attacks in Sydney earlier this year, falsely blamed on a Jewish student, or even the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July. It’s the same with Monday’s attack on a children’s holiday dance and yoga session in Southport, England. A false name - attributed to the 17-year-old accused of killing three little girls as well as injuring eight other children and two adults - spread like wildfire across X, formerly known as Twitter. The BBC is not repeating the false name here to avoid spreading misinformation. Media organisations cannot give the suspect's real name for legal reasons, but Merseyside Police have said the name shared on social media is incorrect. Nevertheless, posts on X sharing the fake name were actively promoted to users and racked up millions of views. Just as with the Sydney attacks and the attempted shooting of Mr Trump, X was the focal point for untrue claims before they spilled onto other sites. It wasn’t just this fake name either. There were false claims the attacker was a refugee who arrived in the UK by boat in 2023 and unfounded speculation he is Muslim. Some of these posts were accompanied by Islamophobic and racist hate. Merseyside Police have confirmed that the 17-year-old they have arrested was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, that he appears to have no known links to Islam, and that they are not currently investigating the attack as terror-related. This all contradicts lots of these claims - but it didn’t stop them poisoning an already toxic online atmosphere. So did these false and unfounded social media posts fan the flames of unrest in Southport? There are lots of different factors contributing to the riot - led by protesters who expressed anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views - not just social media. After all, protests and violence like this long predate the existence of the internet. Everything from political rhetoric, racism and wider anger about immigration to questions about government and police transparency and timing likely played a part. The fact that some of those at the rally decided to target Southport Mosque suggests that they may have been influenced by the unfounded online accusations that this had been an Islamist terror attack. The police themselves pointed to disinformation online as playing a part in the violence. There was discussion of the rally on regional anti-immigration channels on the Telegram app. Protest movements are often organised in closed chat groups we can’t access.  But false and unfounded claims about the attack expanded beyond the usual online spaces where these kinds of protests are organised. Content being seen by millions of X users, rather than just the fringes of social media, could also normalise some of the hate being pushed. Some of those amplifying these ideas included prominent political commentators and politicians. Others were less well-known, but with a reputation for promoting evidence-free conspiracy theories. Many of these accounts have purchased blue ticks, which means their posts feature more prominently on others' feeds. They are based all around the world too, with several right-leaning American profiles boasting hundreds of thousands of followers becoming very involved. They reshared variations of the false claims, using them to push anti-immigration views and ideas. That was in turn met by backlash denouncing the speculation - which also racked millions of views, but proportionally less than the original claims. Because the issue was picking up so much engagement, it was promoted further by X's algorithm, so that my own feed and those of several others who reached out to me were dominated with these posts as soon as they logged on to their X accounts. Some of the false claims seemed to originate not from these prominent political commentators or known conspiracy accounts though, but from anonymous profiles and pseudo-news accounts. Among the first accounts to share the false name, for example, was Channel 3 Now, which purports to be a legitimate news outlet, but whose origins are very unclear. The social media profiles belonging to the channel suggest it is based in the US or Pakistan, with little information about who actually works for the site. The site has since issued a “sincere apology and correction” following their article and posts, which says “we deeply regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused” and admitted their content was “not accurate”. They have not replied directly to the BBC’s questions. Other profiles - not using real names or images - copy-and-pasted the fake name to their own timelines across different, separate accounts to share the claim more widely. Some of these profiles seemed to belong to real users based in the UK, but others sharing this had the hallmarks of inauthentic accounts. These accounts can be automated or run by groups aiming to manipulate the online debate, and have a track record of posting only divisive content about issues like immigration. This isn’t just about pushing political agendas, either. Tragedies like this can also be exploited online to accumulate likes, views and follows - which in turn can be monetised. X has again been a focal point of this online frenzy, since the platform began allowing its paid blue-tick users to earn a portion of ad revenue for their posts. Their posts are more likely to be recommended on people's feeds, and they may be incentivised to post more controversial or sensational content to boost their views. This all seems to have had an effect on how attacks such as Southport are discussed in the hours and days after they have happened, since these kinds of frenzies are becoming more frequent and intense since the changes to X. On top of this, since Elon Musk took over the social media company, he has changed how it moderates false and hateful content - sacking dozens of employees who worked in these areas and introducing new measures like community notes provided by users to fact-check posts. X has not responded to the BBC’s request for comment. The social media company says publicly that it defends and protects users’ voices on the site. And while this is about a whole lot more than a tidal wave of social media posts, it's yet more evidence of the way the online world can inflame pre-existing tensions in the real world.  And that's a world where three little girls have had their lives cut short."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p20dl71jpo,"Rise in people fascinated by violence, police warn",UK and US officers say they are seeing threats from individuals who don't support a particular ideology.,31 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The threat from international and domestic terror presents a “breadth of challenge greater than it has ever been”, according to senior US and UK police officers who oversaw the successful prosecution of Anjem Choudary.  The Islamist preacher from east London is starting a life sentence for directing a group banned under UK terror law, and encouraging support for it online.  The officers say his case highlights the continuing danger posed by radicalisers - and the violent groups they support. But they also say counter-terrorism forces are now battling a wide diversity of threats - including from a worrying number of people who don't support an underlying ideology, but are simply drawn to violence. Young people being attracted to online extremism through conspiracy theories, the actions of “hostile states” such as Russia, and the “toxicity of our political environment” are also of concern, they warn. Following Choudary's trial, the BBC spoke exclusively to Matt Jukes, the UK’s head of counter-terrorism policing, and Rebecca Weiner, Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism at the New York Police Department. They told us that alongside extremist groups energised by events in the Middle East, the new security threats were sparking multiple investigations. It is a “palpably different picture than it was,” says Assistant Commissioner Jukes. Deputy Commissioner Weiner singles out online extremism as probably the most important aspect of what she terms an “everything, everywhere, all-at-once threat environment”. With two wars - Israel-Gaza and Ukraine - being fought in what Ms Weiner calls “a tsunami of disinformation”, she says it is hard for people to understand what is true and what is not - “and that is playing out in the realm of violence”. People are being “overwhelmed with false narratives” and fed conspiracy theories, she says. A disturbing aspect of this, says Mr Jukes, is the increasing number of those turning to terrorism because of a fascination for violence, rather than ideological fanaticism. He says in 20% of cases his officers now handle, terror suspects have no settled view of the world: “We are seeing people literally flip from searching for neo-Nazi material online to searching for Islamist material.” This is a real shift, he says, with people having previously gone from a single ideology, to extremism, and on to violence. Young people are viewing “dehumanising content”, including extreme pornography - says Mr Jukes - and being asked in online groups “to prove themselves by producing more and more extreme content”. This includes terrorist material created using artificial intelligence, he says, with gaming being one of the “gateways” into extremism online. The age profile of those drawn into this extreme environment is coming down - and he worries about “very young people who only need to take up a knife or use a vehicle as a weapon to carry out a deadly attack”. Nearly one in five of those arrested as terror suspects in the UK in the past year were under 18. Counter-terror police on both sides of the Atlantic have also been kept busy since last October’s attack by Hamas on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's health ministry. Fifty police investigations have been launched in the UK into support or encouragement of terrorism. There has also been a big increase in antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime. Government statistics for the year ending in March 2024 show terror-related arrests in the UK were up by 23% on the previous year (although they were lower than the period between 2013 to 2020). Five years ago, says Mr Jukes, he would have been kept awake primarily by fears of an IS attack in the UK, but now he says one of his main concerns would be the growing threat from “determined and shameless” state actors. For many years, he says “hostile actions of states” formed only a very small part of police and MI5 investigations. But this has grown more than fourfold since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings, says Mr Jukes, when a nerve agent was used to try to assassinate a former Russian spy and his daughter. The spy, who had defected to the West, and his daughter were badly injured - but a British woman died after coming into contact with Novichok. Russia has always denied involvement. There has also been an increased threat from parts of the Chinese state, he adds, and at least 15 foiled plots by Iran in the past two years to either kidnap or kill those in the UK it considers enemies of the regime. “If these authoritarian organs of the state feel like the UK or the US is fair [game] for them to pursue their adversities, then everything we stand for in terms of being a safe, liberal democracy is challenged,” says Mr Jukes. The two police chiefs also point to “toxicity” in the political environment, which has led to politicians becoming targets of violence - including two British MPs murdered in terror attacks, and the failed assassination of Donald Trump at a campaign rally on 13 July. I ask if there is any reassuring news amid this scary picture of dispersed danger. People can “take a degree of comfort”, says Mr Jukes, that since the attacks in London and Manchester in 2017, “that terrible year”, police have disrupted nearly 40 “terrorist plots”. “And we are doing that month-in, month-out, with real efficiency and effectiveness.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce93vlen9w6o,Australia appoints special envoy to tackle antisemitism,The government said the advisory role will help allay rising community tension over the Israel-Gaza war.,9 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Australia has appointed a special envoy to combat antisemitism and preserve ""social cohesion"", amid rising community tension over the Israel-Gaza war. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced lawyer and businesswoman Jillian Segal would consult with community leaders and discrimination experts to advise the government. It follows in the footsteps of countries like the US, Canada, Greece and the UK, which have all had similar positions for years. A special envoy for addressing Islamophobia will also be appointed soon, Mr Albanese added. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has become a volatile political issue in Australia. It has resulted in protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as a sharp uptick in Islamophobia and antisemitism. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.  More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. “Australians are deeply concerned about this conflict, and many are hurting. In times like this, Australians must come together, not be torn apart,"" Mr Albanese said on Tuesday. The appointment of Ms Segal - who has headed several key bodies representing the Jewish community and served in leadership roles in the education and banking sectors - is a ""critical step"" in easing friction, he said. Ms Segal said combatting the ""age-old hatred"" of antisemitism has never been more important, pointing to a 700% rise in incidences since the war began in October. “Jewish Australians want to feel free to live their day-to-day lives, and also want to feel safe to practice and express their religion without fear,"" she added. The announcement has been welcomed by the national peak body for the Australian Jewish community - a group Ms Segal led until last year - who say she will ""will bring deep knowledge of the issues and immense energy to the role"". However other groups - including The Jewish Council of Australia, which has been critical of Israel's actions in Gaza, and The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) - say they fear it will worsen division. ""It also risks further entrenching the concerning pattern of antisemitism being conflated with criticism of the state of Israel or with support for Palestine,"" APAN said. The Australian government supports a two-state solution, and in the wake of the 7 October attacks loudly supported Israel's right to defend itself. However in recent months it has increasingly voiced concerns about the country's military campaign in Gaza - including after an Australian aid worker was killed alongside six others in an Israeli air strike. Australia's governing Labor party has also experienced growing tensions, with one senator last week quitting its ranks over its stance on the war. Fatima Payman said she had been ""exiled"" after breaking party rules to vote against the government in support of a motion calling for the recognition of Palestinian statehood."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g37mk7vxlo,Are deep shifts in Muslim and Jewish voting here to stay?,"In the 2024 UK general election, Labour suffered some surprise seat losses over its stance on Gaza.",7 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"However big the headline change in the vote between the past two elections, drill down into two demographic pockets of Britain and you find staggering shifts. It all centres around the relationships between the Labour Party and not just Muslim voters, but Jewish voters too. It leaves a party in government that has made progress in winning back trust among people from one faith group while suddenly finding itself with a lot of work to do to win back many members of the other. The drop in the Labour vote share among British Muslims between 2019 and 2024 very obviously played out in several constituencies. This happened most dramatically in Leicester South, with a Muslim population close to 30%, where Shadow Paymaster General Jon Ashworth lost his seat to independent Shockat Adam. In the seat of Dewsbury and Batley, in Birmingham Perry Barr and in Blackburn, there were wins for independents in what had been safe Labour seats with large numbers of Muslim voters. In places like Bradford West and the seat of Bethnal Green and Stepney in east London, sitting Labour MPs clung on with startling reductions in their majorities. Mish Rahman, from Walsall, is not just any Muslim voter. He currently sits on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party, a body of fewer than 40 members. He is furious with the party’s response to the killing of tens of thousands of people in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there. “In my community it has got to the point where I am now embarrassed about my affiliation with Labour,” he says. “It was hard even to tell members of my own extended family to go and knock on doors to tell people to vote for a party that originally gave Israel carte blanche in its response to the horrific 7 October attacks,” says Mr Rahman. He lays the blame for the decline in Muslim voting for Labour squarely at the door of the Labour leader. Sir Keir Starmer was criticised by many in his party, including councillors, for an interview with LBC in October in which he suggested that Israel “had the right” to withhold power and water in Gaza. His spokesman subsequently suggested the Labour leader had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence. Then when Labour MPs were told by the party leadership in November to abstain from voting on an SNP-led motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, some Labour councillors resigned and, for many Muslims, trust in their Labour MP was lost. Faith communities are far from homogenous, of course. There are myriad factors that govern how a person will cast their vote, but faith does throw up a unique set of considerations that plays out in broad voting patterns. Muslims are estimated to form around 6.5% of the population of England and Wales, with around 2% in Scotland and 1% in Northern Ireland. Well over 80% of Muslims are believed to have voted for Labour in 2019. Research just ahead of the 2024 election suggested that had dropped nationally by up to 20 percentage points, and in some constituencies the Muslim vote for Labour clearly fell further. The contrast with Jewish voting data could not be more stark. In 2019, the proportion of British Jews (about 0.5% of the population) who voted for a Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn is thought to have collapsed to just single figures. Research suggests that figure could have climbed back to above 40%. “What we have seen is a huge bounce-back for Labour among Jewish voters,” says Adam Langleben, who was until recently the national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement. Mr Langleben, a former Labour councillor and now director of Progressive Britain (formerly Progress), points to Labour wins in London in the Finchley and Golders Green seat and also Hendon as well as Bury South in Greater Manchester, all constituencies with large Jewish populations. “Jewish voters returning to the party has undoubtedly delivered seats to the Labour Party,” says Mr Langleben. “You don’t need a majority of Jewish voters to win in these constituencies, but you also can’t only have 7% of them voting for you and expect to win,” he says. Mr Langleben had been a senior member of the Jewish Labour Movement but was one of many Jewish members of the party to give up their membership during the Corbyn era. When he left in 2019, he said it was on account of the party being “led by antisemites”, an accusation always strongly denied by those leading the party at the time. “It was a situation that was all-consuming. I would be canvassing for the Labour Party in a Jewish area and had people in tears on the doorstep saying there was no way they could vote for Jeremy Corbyn, and I was trying to juggle this huge personal tension,” he says. Mr Langleben puts Mr Corbyn’s problems down to both a lack of personal reflection about who he was associating with, and what he says was the party’s inability to deal with extreme elements in its base and tolerance of the use of antisemitic tropes. “From day one, Keir Starmer pledged to work with the Jewish community to try to deal with the issues inside the Labour Party. For him, fixing what went wrong was a personal mission,” he says. But given that Keir Starmer supported Jeremy Corbyn throughout his leadership, Jewish voters at hustings in synagogues and community centres around the country had been grilling Labour candidates as to why they should trust the current leader now. “The Jewish vote is now split and that’s how it should be. The results show there wasn’t a dominant party of choice, and that’s healthy, and still represents a huge transformation for Labour,” says Mr Langleben. So while mistrust clearly still remains, what is responsible for the transformation in the perception of the Labour Party among some British Jews? The fact that the current leadership’s criticism of Israel’s response to the 7 October attacks has been more tempered than it may have been under the previous leadership may have contributed. But long before that, Mr Langleben cites a change in the way complaints around “protected characteristics” like faith are dealt with by the party, but also refers to one thing that convinced him he was right to re-join the party. “The fundamental moment was Jeremy Corbyn being suspended from the Labour Party and then subsequently having the whip removed, because it showed Keir Starmer’s determination and his willingness to take on parts of the party that previously he had not been willing to take on,” he says. Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension is precisely identified by Mr Rahman too as the first major showdown between different wings of the party under Keir Starmer. Except, as someone who had been inspired by Mr Corbyn from the days of Stop the War protests in the lead-up to the UK-backed invasion of Iraq in 2003, Mr Rahman was on the other side, saying that was the moment when the alarm bells started ringing for him that the party leaders were not safeguarding the values he believed in. Mr Rahman does not see the party’s anti-Muslim slant as being limited to its response to events in Gaza. He does not question there have been serious cases of antisemitism but does not believe all accusations of racism are treated equally. “There is a clear hierarchy of racism in the Labour Party. Some instances of racism, including Islamophobia, aren't taken as seriously as they should,” he says. Mr Rahman cites the case of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the EHRC, who was suspended for alleged Islamophobia. Mr Phillips had said British Muslims were “a nation within a nation” and previously that their opinion was “some distance away from the centre of gravity of everybody else’s”, though later he suggested this had not necessarily been meant as a criticism. Mr Phillips was readmitted to the party in 2021 without it going to a panel inquiry. Mr Rahman, like many other Muslims, also points to Keir Starmer’s own comments, like those made in a Sun livestream during the election campaign, when he talked of migrants being sent back to the countries they came from. “At the moment, people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed because they’re not being processed,” the Labour leader said. “Can you imagine the Labour Party saying that about people of any other ethnicity? Saying they're going to deport people to Israel or Ukraine or Hong Kong? It wouldn’t happen and neither should it,” says Mr Rahman. Such is his disenchantment with Labour’s response that, coupled with wider concerns regarding the treatment of Muslims, he lays a serious charge against the party. “I don’t doubt for a minute that Labour is currently institutionally Islamophobic,” says Mr Rahman. Mr Rahman wants to use his voice to call out hypocrisy in the party while in government, in the hope that it will learn what he says is a lesson of this election - that no voter can be taken for granted. Mr Rahman did give up his membership of the Labour Party once before, in protest at Tony Blair’s role in the Iraq War. He, and other Muslims, felt persuaded to come back to the party in 2014 when the then-leader Ed Miliband condemned the scale of an Israeli operation in Gaza and the hundreds of civilian deaths. Once again, at the same moment, Mr Langleben was seeing things very differently on the doorsteps of Jewish voters. Even though Mr Miliband was himself Jewish, it was a time when polls were showing a rapid decline in Jewish support for Labour, particularly when the party’s 2015 manifesto talked about a parliamentary vote to recognise a Palestinian state. “There were sometimes quite horrible conversations with Jewish voters who really cared about the issue of Israel,” says Mr Langleben. “People in 2015 were accusing the Labour Party of antisemitism, but I think it fundamentally misread what antisemitism is. Then, it was a primarily about a foreign policy issue, Israel. That changed by 2019 when conversations were around a particular strain of far-left anti-Jewish racism,” says Mr Langleben. For some of those supportive of the Corbyn-era leadership, that sense that criticism of Israel was being conflated with antisemitism was also something they felt occurred while he was leader. The Hamas attacks of the 7 October 2023 happened during the week of the Labour Party conference and Mr Langleben says it was strange to see normal political business go on while he and other Jewish delegates were going through a difficult and upsetting period. Ultimately, Mr Langleben says he has been pleased with the way Keir Starmer has handled the crisis, seeing it as Labour realigning itself with UK and US government policy on Israel. This is precisely why during this election campaign, Mr Rahman had the hardest conversations on the doorsteps of Muslim voters he had ever had, with anger and frustration boiling over about Israel’s actions in Gaza. “If you look back at the history of the relationship between our communities and the Labour Party, it's always been a one-sided affair of loyalty from our communities,” Mr Rahman says. The Labour Party’s roots in his own family go back to his grandfather, who was a factory worker in the 1950s and 60s. Mr Rahman talks of feeling “betrayed”. Gaza of course is not just a Muslim issue, and not all Muslims ranked it is one of the key considerations on which they voted, but it had an impact. Similarly, Israel policy is not necessarily a major consideration for all Jewish voters, and even for those for whom it is, there are those who are highly critical of the Israeli government and are at odds with the response of Labour under Starmer. But while over the decades the Jewish vote has swung between the two main parties broadly in line with the general population, it would appear that if one puts to one side all of the rows over antisemitism, the party’s outlook on Israel does impact voting intention. Separately, both Mish Rahman and Adam Langleben are very clear that their accusations of discrimination levelled at the party in different eras do not just relate to party policy on the Middle East. Even if everyone can be satisfied that accusations of discrimination are dealt with equally, such are the modern tensions around Middle East policy that political parties may struggle to find a position that does not alienate some members of one of these faith communities. Labour has achieved much in winning back the levels of Jewish voters it has, but it has also left huge swathes of loyal Muslim voters in Britain feeling politically adrift, and large swings in culture and policy over recent years leave many in each community needing convincing of the true nature of the party.

The American, who last month was banned for a year from boxing following an anti-doping violation, made the comments on X's spaces platform, which allows people to have live audio conversations. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman said in a statement: ""Exercising my authority as president of the WBC, I am hereby expelling Ryan Garcia from any activity with our organisation. ""We reject any form of discrimination."" In a since deleted post on X, Garcia, 25, wrote: ""I was trolling, I want all the killing to stop. I love everyone, sorry if I offended you."" The American has not responded to the WBC's expulsion. After Garcia was handed a one-year doping ban by the New York State Athletic Commission, Sulaiman said the WBC would not issue its own suspension or ""punish"" him because of concerns about his mental health. It was not immediately clear what the expulsion from the WBC would entail. BBC Sport has asked the WBC for comment. Garcia failed multiple drug tests around his fight with Devin Haney in April. As well as a one-year ban, Garcia's upset victory over former undisputed lightweight champion Haney was overturned to a no-contest. Garcia's family released its own statement saying his comments ""do not align with his, or our family's, true character or beliefs"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c880l1ddpzgo,How a Gaza 'stunt' divided Australia's parliament,"A senator says she has been ""exiled"" for voting against her party to recognise Palestinian statehood.",2 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"When Fatima Payman crossed the Senate floor to vote against her government she knew it would come with consequences. The Australian Labor party has strict penalties for those who undermine its collective positions, and acts of defiance can lead to expulsion - a precedent with a 130-year history. The last time one of its politicians tested the waters while in power was before Ms Payman was born. But last Tuesday, the 29-year-old did just that - joining the Greens party and independent senators to support a motion on Palestinian statehood. Officially the Australian government supports a two-state solution, but did not back the motion after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be “as part of a peace process”. Within hours, Ms Payman had been temporarily suspended from her party room, by the end of the week it would become indefinite - after she publicly vowed to cross the floor again if given the opportunity. ""By her own actions and statements, Senator Payman has placed herself outside the privilege that comes with participating in the federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus,"" a government spokesperson said. Prime Minister and Labor leader Anthony Albanese was more concise: “No individual is bigger than the team.” On Monday, Ms Payman responded by saying she had been ""exiled"" – explaining that she had been removed from caucus meetings, group chats and all committees. The dismissal of the senator, elected in what was billed as Australia’s most diverse parliament to date, has drawn a mixed response and raised questions - mainly, whether it’s practical or fair for politicians to toe the line on issues affecting their communities. Ms Payman stands out in Australia’s parliament. The first and only hijab-wearing federal politician, she has been described as the embodiment of some of the nation’s most marginalised: a young woman, a migrant, a Muslim. She recounted crossing the Senate floor as ""the most difficult decision"" of her political career, adding that each step of her short walk had “felt like a mile”. However, the 29-year-old said she was “proud” of what she had done, and “bitterly disappointed” others hadn't followed. ""I walked with my Muslim brothers and sisters who told me they have felt unheard for far too long,"" she said. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 23 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. This has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. As has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as a sharp uptick in Islamophobia and antisemitism. The senator's move has drawn both praise and criticism. Anne Aly - who became the first Muslim woman to be elected in Australia’s parliament in 2016 - and has been a fierce advocate for an end to the conflict in Gaza, said she disagreed with Ms Payman’s approach. “I choose to do things in a way I think will make a material difference on the ground. Fatima chooses to do it her way,"" she told news outlet the ABC. But Josh Burns - a Jewish Labor MP from Melbourne - who has a different world view from Ms Payman when it comes to issues such as Palestinian statehood, has been one of her biggest supporters. “Parliamentarians come from different communities and backgrounds, and trying to balance all those perspectives isn't easy, but we must be an example to the Australian community about how to debate difficult issues respectfully.” The nation’s Islamic bodies have also issued a joint statement describing Ms Payman’s actions as “courageous” and calling on the Labor party to “echo the voices of the people it represents”. ""Political calculations and attempts to walk both sides have devastating consequences in Palestine and will ultimately end in failure,” it read. But Mr Albanese called the resolution a ""stunt"", adding: ""We need actually real solutions... this stunt from the Greens was designed to put Fatima Payman in a difficult position. It was designed to do that."" Mr Albanese’s penalty against Ms Payman has been more lenient than the complete expulsion that party rules require. And he’s left the door open for her to re-enter the fold if she’s willing to change course: “Fatima Payman is welcome to return to participating in the team if she accepts she's a member of it,” he said in an interview on Monday. Australian politicians have voted against their own beliefs to fall in line with party politics before. LGBTQ+ MPs - including current Foreign Minister Penny Wong - felt a similar conflict in the Labor caucus back in the days when it officially opposed gay marriage. It’s an issue that has opened Ms Wong up to personal attacks, but she’s remained adamant that quiet advocacy from within the party - rather than public criticism - is the preferred route. And she says it was a decade of doing just that which saw same-sex marriage legalised. “Even when we disagree, we have those arguments internally, as you saw over many years in the marriage equality debate. That’s what I did, and I think that’s the right way to go about it,” she told the ABC. But when asked whether she should have followed precedent, Ms Payman said: “It took 10 years to legislate same-sex marriage... These Palestinians do not have 10 years."" The contrasting approaches represent the changing demands of the Australian public, according to Kos Samaras - one of the nation’s leading pollsters. He says a growing cohort of young, multicultural voters are increasingly aligning themselves with politicians who aren’t afraid to take a stance on causes their constituents are “passionate about”. He also argues that migrant communities are no longer willing to accept political messaging that effectively urges them to “keep their head down”. “Australia has had a terrible history, whether from a societal perspective or political parties - that whenever someone from a diverse background expresses their view, overwhelmingly they’re told to pull their head in.” “That’s a formula that kind of works when a new group of people migrate to a country and want to keep a low profile as they’re establishing a new life – it’s not going to work with those migrant’s kids. And that’s exactly who we’re talking about. “These are people who have grown up in a country that has often made them feel like outsiders, and they’re no longer prepared to keep silent,” he adds, noting recent polling from his team which found that many young Australian-Muslim women feel they lack a political voice. A refugee whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, it’s a sentiment that Ms Payman says guides her politics. “I was not elected as a token representative of diversity,” she said after her temporary suspension last week. “I was elected to serve the people of Western Australia and uphold the values instilled in me by my late father.” Ms Payman says that she believes the government is freezing her out to “intimidate” her into resigning. But Mr Albanese is adamant that his decision is the right one, while emphasising that it is not about Ms Payman’s “policy position” but rather, her decision to “undermine” her party. For the time being at least, the young lawmaker has vowed to “abstain from voting on Senate matters… unless a matter of conscience arises where I'll uphold the true values and principles of the Labor Party.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck5g74jr59eo,SZA’s striking set failed to set Glastonbury alight,"The US R&B star shone, but drew the smallest-ever audience for a headline set on the Pyramid Stage.",1 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"After Dua Lipa and Coldplay's sleek and efficient sets, Glastonbury's Sunday night headliner had a tough act to follow. After a rumoured appearance by pop queen Madonna fell through, the slot eventually went to US R&B star SZA. One of the most-streamed artists in the world, she's a vibrant, confident performer, whose complex, messy dissections of modern relationships have endeared her to millennial fans. But their passion failed to ignite any magic on the Pyramid Stage. The star drew the smallest audience I've ever seen for a Glastonbury headliner, in more than 20 years of coming to the festival. It didn't help that, for at least the first half an hour, her microphone was both distorted and muffled - an issue for an artist whose appeal lies in the precision of her lyrics and the beauty of their jazzy vocal runs. The 33-year-old also committed the festival sin of failing to address the crowd. Her only interaction in the show's first act was to ask if any of her ""day one"" fans were present.  ""You know I need you, right?” she said, perhaps acknowledging that this was not her natural audience. By the time she got to her biggest hit - the darkly comic murder fantasy Kill Bill  (1.9 billion Spotify streams) - people had already drifted away to watch sets from The National, James Blake and London Grammar elsewhere on the site. That's not to say that SZA put on a bad performance, or that the thousands who stayed to the end of her set were disappointed.  She has spectacular vocal command, projecting to the back of the field without sacrificing intimacy. Towards the middle of her set, she played Nobody Gets Me - a devastating ballad about her struggle to let go after breaking up with her fiancé. It was by some distance the most vulnerable, moving performance I saw from a Pyramid Stage headliner all weekend. Young fans in the audience clasped their hands to their chest and mouthed along silently.  Other highlights included the brittle, rock-infused F2F and the 80s-infused pop smash Kiss Me More - which she fused with Prince's Kiss. It was a visual feast, too, divided into three distinct sections that mapped out the process of getting over a broken heart.  She started in a dingy cave, the metaphorical fortress of her own solitude, surrounded by stalactites and performing Drew Barrymore while perched on a giant ant. For the second section, dubbed ""robot world"", she struggled with conflicting emotions, simultaneously pining for her ex and wishing pain upon him, in songs like Snooze, Kill Bill and I Hate U. The final segment was titled ""Coming Home"". SZA, sprouted wings, climbed a tree, and played some of her more liberated, feel-good songs - including Saturn (about escaping the earth for a better life) and the self-explanatory Good Days.  Her final song was 20 Something, a declaration of solidarity for anyone else going through the turmoil of their third decade and she climbed down from her elaborate set and sang in communion with her fans in the front row. ""Glastonbury, I was so nervous about today,"" she said. ""I'm so grateful. You have my deepest love and my deepest respect. God bless you and please get home safely."" With sinuous choregraphy and a compelling stage presence, SZA's set was a sublime show in the wrong venue - a problem that has repeatedly blighted this year's Glastonbury. Beloved acts like Sugababes, Fred Again and Avril Lavigne were booked into areas too small to handle their fans; while the Pyramid Stage struggled to attract sufficient numbers for compelling, muscular sets by PJ Harvey and Janelle Monae. In the end, it's a shame that those performances, like SZA's will go down in history for the wrong reasons. After the set, the singer posted a message that seemed to acknowledge the negative response. ""The bravery required to be alive in public is remarkable,"" she wrote on X (formerly Twitter).  ""S/O [shout out to] everybody doing that."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Shania Twain played the coveted Legends slot, delivering big, brassy anthems like That Don't Impress Me Much and Man! I Feel Like A Woman! while conveying a wide-eyed disbelief at the size of her audience. ""I find moments like this very life-changing and I mean that very sincerely,"" she said, choking back tears towards the end of her set. Over on the Other Stage, Avril Lavigne was just as popular, causing major traffic jams as fans clamoured to hear era-defining pop-punk hits like Complicated and Sk8r Boi. She kicked off with the brilliantly snotty Girlfriend, and the cartoonish sneer remaining plastered across her face for the next hour. “I can’t believe it’s taken me 22 years to play Glastonbury,” she said. “It’s about time”. Janelle Monae played a tight, funky set on the Pyramid Stage - going through multiple costume changes, including a replica Michael Jackson suit. Lithe and limber, she celebrated her sexual freedom on songs like Pink, Yoga, Lipstick Lover and Make Me Feel, while dedicating her set to the queer community, in the final hours of Pride month.  Later, she expanded that dedication to other marginalised and persecuted groups around the world. “I am proud to stand with you as you fight back against genocide,” she said. “As you fight back against the criminalisation of homeless people. As [politicians] bring in laws to [regulate] our bodies.” She went on to call for an end to violence in Palestine, Sudan and the Congo - while also calling out anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. “These are our people. So when we see injustice, we know,” she declared. It was a powerful moment, expressed more eloquently than many of this weekend’s onstage protests. She was followed onstage by Nigerian star Burna Boy, in party-starting mood as he raced through Afro-fusion hits like Sittin’ On Top Of The World, Ye and Last Last. Flirting with the audience throughout, he eventually removed his top and invited everyone else to follow suit. If it had been warmer, they might have obliged. Headline sets came from French dance maestros Justice on the West Holts stage and indie-pop group London Grammar, who drew an enormous crowd to the hillside Park Stage, despite singer Hannah Reid's misgivings about being scheduled against SZA. But the biggest headliners, in terms of audience size, were US indie band The National, who immersed The Other Stage with epic guitars, rich horns, and Matt Berninger’s emotive confessional words.  From the intimate Light Years, to the pounding Abel, their grown-up sound and  intense delivery capped off an uneven Sunday, as Glastonbury prepared to shut up shop for another year. The festival will return in 2025, Emily Eavis has confirmed, before taking a fallow year in 2026."

The Traveller Movement added these communities faced ""chronic democratic underrepresentation"". Leeanne Morgan, 48, part of the Gypsy community, said people like her just want to be treated ""like everybody else"". The Electoral Commission is supporting a campaign to push more people from Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities to vote, saying they were ""less likely"" to be registered.  The mother-of-two said there were many barriers which her community faced, with many left feeling like ""second-class citizens"". ""There's only so long that you can stand up, you can ask and fight for things that you want,"" she added. Leeanne, who lives with her family on a site in south Pembrokeshire, said politicians did not visit sites while on the campaign trail. ""I think they forget that they are their constituents as well. I mean, historically, Gypsy and Traveller sites are out of the way and sort of push to the side.  ""Unless you've lived within the community for a long, long time, you wouldn't know that they're there,"" she said. There are about 3,630 Gypsy and Irish Traveller people living in Wales, with the highest proportions in Cardiff and Pembrokeshire. According to the latest census in 2021, 73% live in a house or flat and 27% live in a caravan or mobile home. Political rhetoric and language was also creating barriers, according to Leeanne. She has worked with officials to advocate for her community, and said too much jargon was used by political leaders and campaigners. ""I think they need to take into consideration how they're speaking to the people, to the people that are going to be voting them into power, so that they know, and everything is explained properly,"" she said. Grace Preston is one of those behind Operation Traveller Vote – a push to empower members of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities to vote in the upcoming election. ""Members of the community don't feel like constituents, but rather political footballs dragged out for politicians' campaigns,"" the senior policy officer added. The organisation behind the campaign, The Traveller Movement, said members of these communities' faced ""chronic democratic underrepresentation and huge levels of discrimination"". ""If you don't feel like an active constituent in a community, you disengage and don't get involved, our job is to show how you can use your vote and voice,"" she added. Alongside the campaign, the Traveller Movement has produced its own manifesto with recommendations on how all political parties can prioritise the communities' needs in areas such as health and education. The group has been visiting UK cities and knocking on doors at Traveller sites to help overcome any literacy or digital literacy issues. ""We have our own manifesto and questions that people should ask politicians... giving people that power to have a voice for themselves is super important,"" she said. The campaign has been supported by The Electoral Commission, the independent body which oversees elections. ""Everyone should be able to participate in elections, but our research shows that some groups are less likely to be registered to vote and to own an accepted form of ID, including Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities,"" a spokesperson added. Plaid Cymru said: ""Romani, [Gypsy], Roma and Irish Traveller communities are too often used as a political football."" ""We are committed to combating Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-migrant sentiment, anti-Gypsy and Roma Traveller sentiment, and all forms of racism and bigotry in politics and in wider society,"" a spokesperson added. The party said politicians of all parties had a duty to engage with all communities in their areas, and encourage everyone to participate in elections. Both Labour and the Conservatives have been asked to comment."

Secret recordings published by Channel 4 show a canvasser working to get Reform UK leader Nigel Farage elected as MP for Clacton using a racial slur to refer to the prime minister - who is of Indian origin. Reform UK said those making ""unacceptable comments"" will no longer be part of Mr Farage's campaign. Speaking to reporters, Mr Sunak said ""my two daughters have to see and hear Reform people who campaigned for Nigel Farage"" using racist language against him.  ""It hurts. And it makes me angry,"" he said. Mr Farage ""has some questions to answer,"" he added. ""When you see Reform candidates and campaigners, seemingly using racist and misogynistic language and opinions seemingly without challenge, I think it tells you something about the culture within the Reform Party."" In responding to the comments, Mr Sunak chose to repeat the racist term, saying: “I do it deliberately and I hate having to do it.  ""I chose my words deliberately and I hate having to repeat them, absolutely hate it but I also think it’s important to call this out for what it is and be clear about what it is."" Essex Police have confirmed they are ""urgently assessing"" comments made by Reform campaigners in Channel 4's footage ""to establish if there are any criminal offences"". Footage broadcast by Channel 4 shows racist and Islamophobic slurs apparently being made by Andrew Parker, identified as a canvasser for Mr Farage. Mr Parker tells an undercover reporter he has ""always been a Tory voter"" but he is ""annoyed"" by Mr Sunak, who he referred to using a racial slur. Mr Parker is also heard describing Islam as ""the most disgusting cult out"" and suggesting army recruits should carry out “target practice” by shooting at small boats bringing illegal migrants to the UK. At one point Mr Parker tells voters Reform would be ""kicking all the Muslims out of the mosques and turning them into Wetherspoons"". During campaigning, he advises the undercover reporter to use the term ""illegal"" when discussing immigration, especially when addressing non-white households.

Mr Parker said: “I have never discussed immigration with either Nigel Farage or the Reform Party and that any comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. “I would therefore like to apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention."" Mr Farage has claimed Channel 4's undercover filming was a ""total set up"", with Mr Parker a hired actor. He initially condemned the remarks as ""appalling"" and said anyone making  ""reprehensible"" comments will ""no longer be with the campaign"". But speaking to the BBC, Mr Farage said Mr Parker's behaviour in the Channel 4 report did not ""ring true"". He said Mr Parker ""came out with an endless stream of invective"", adding ""no one speaks like that, it went on and on and on"". ""I looked at his website, I saw some videos, he's a very well-spoken actor.... but he does what he calls ""rough speaking"".  From the moment he arrived in the office and he bowled up and spoke to me he was rough-speaking. He was acting from the moment he came into the office."" Responding to Mr Farage's comments, Channel 4 News said: ""We strongly stand by our rigorous and duly impartial journalism which speaks for itself. “We met Mr Parker for the first time at Reform UK party headquarters, where he was a Reform party canvasser. ""We did not pay the Reform UK canvasser or anyone else in this report. Mr Parker was not known to Channel 4 News and was filmed covertly via the undercover operation.” Mr Parker told the PA news agency that his comments were ""typical chaps-down-the-pub talk"". ""I’m not a racist. I’ve had Muslim girlfriends,"" Mr Parker added. He said he made the remarks in the ""heat of the moment"" because he was being ""goaded on"" - and asked whether he would like to apologise, he says: “Of course I’m sorry. They were off-the-cuff things that everyone says.” He says he has “a lot of Pakistani friends” and “Muslim friends”, and that he is “sick to death” of being asked about the footage. The secret recordings feature a conversation between what appears to be Reform UK organisers, including a man Channel 4 named as George Jones - longtime party activist who organises events for Mr Farage. In the footage Mr Jones calls a Pride flag on a police car as a ""degenerate flag"". He repeatedly suggests members of the LGBT+ community are paedophiles and criticises police attending Pride. He adds that, should Reform UK form a future government, “our police officers will be paramilitaries, they won’t be police” and should “bring back the noose”. Speaking to ITV's Loose Women, Mr Farage called the comments ""vulgar, drunk and wrong"" and claimed people in the group were ""gone"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11xxn833yo,Muslim millionaire gives major donation to Reform UK,"As well as being a donor, Zia Yusuf will also have a public role for Reform UK during the campaign.",20 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Muslim entrepreneur has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to Reform UK, claiming the UK has ""lost control of our borders”. The precise amount Zia Yusuf has given to the party has not been disclosed but Reform UK claims it is the biggest donation of their general election campaign so far. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has faced criticism from Muslim organisations after he said a growing number of Muslims do not share British values. When asked by the BBC about critics labelling some in Reform UK racist, Mr Yusuf said the party leadership ""feel very strongly that we should protect British values and put British people of all religions and creeds first."" As well as being a donor, the BBC understands the 37-year-old will have a public role for Reform UK during the campaign. In an interview with The Telegraph, which first reported the story of his donation, Mr Yusuf said: ""I love Britain and I'm a patriot, a British Muslim patriot, which I believe the vast majority of Muslims in the UK are."" Mr Yusuf, who earned an estimated £31m from selling his luxury concierge app Velocity Black last year, told the BBC he believed ""unsustainable"" net migration levels were making it harder for legal migrants to integrate and overwhelming the NHS. ""We have lost control of our borders. That's my view. And I think it's an objective statement,"" he told the BBC. The entrepreneur, whose parents came to Britain from Sri Lanka in the 1980s and worked in the NHS, told the BBC ""we need a grown-up discussion about immigration without name-calling"". He said it was his ""patriotic duty"" to fund Nigel Farage and Reform UK. Last month, Mr Farage told Sky News: “We have a growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values, [who] in fact loathe much of what we stand for.”  Asked if he was talking about Muslims, he said: “We are."" Zara Mohammed, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, accused him of deploying “horribly Islamophobic, racist and hate-filled rhetoric of misinformation”. Reform UK said Mr Yusuf's donation was given “very recently” as a single lump sum so it has not yet shown up in Electoral Commission donation figures. In the first week of the campaign, Reform UK raised £140,000, compared to Labour's £927,000 the Conservatives £575,000 and the Lib Dems £455,000, the Electoral Commission reported. Born in Scotland, Mr Yusuf moved with his parents to the south of England and won a partial scholarship to attend the private Hampton School in Middlesex. After working at Goldman Sachs, he quit his high-paying job to start Velocity Black with an old school friend. Until recently, he was a Conservative Party member but left due to Rishi Sunak's government's inability to ""make difficult decisions."" Despite parallels with Mr Sunak - both sons of migrants who entered finance after attending elite fee-paying schools - Mr Yusuf said the PM can no longer ""credibly govern"". ""Whatever is in the hearts of Conservative leaders, the reality is they are so disunited, and when there is so much infighting in the party,"" he said."

Keith Mason was due to represent The Workers Party of Britain, led by George Galloway, in Wakefield and Rothwell on 4 July in the general election.  Mr Galloway confirmed he had sacked the former prop for the messages, with Mr Mason issuing an apology.  ""I absolutely 100% respect all my Muslim brothers and sisters,"" he said.  Mr Mason, who played for Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, St Helens, Castleford Tigers and Huddersfield Giants, is reported to have insulted the religion in a number of tweets sent in reply to other X accounts.  In an apology, he posted: ""I’ve grown up with Muslims my whole life I see them as my brothers and sisters, and not one of them would say I was Islamophobic ever!"" He said he was a Roman Catholic who respected all beliefs, adding: ""I don’t have to agree with other religions like you wouldn’t with mine but I absolutely 100% respect all my Muslim brothers and sisters."" He concluded: ""I apologise to anyone who misinterpreted a conversation that came across that way."" Confirming his sacking, Mr Galloway posted: ""Mason apologised for his historic tweets which were published when he was indeed guilty of anti-Islamic bigotry. ""It seems repentance is not enough in the elections game however. So he's gone."" Mr Mason retired from rugby league in 2013 to pursue an acting career, appearing in the BBC crime drama series Peaky Blinders. His name will still appear on the ballot paper alongside The Workers Party of Britain as the deadline for candidates to be nominated has passed.

Demonstrators, some masked, have been camped outside Newcastle University since 4 May and occupied one of its buildings at the end of May. Members of the university's Jewish Society say they no longer feel safe on the site and some have resorted to hiding their traditional dress. A spokesman for the demonstrators said they did not intend people to feel ""intimidated"". The protest reached a climax on 29 May when a group of about 50 protestors occupied Newcastle University's Armstrong Building. Northumbria Police said a number of them caused ""considerable disruption"" in the city centre later that evening and three people were arrested. A representative of the university's Jewish Society, who wished to remain anonymous because of concerns for their safety, said: ""We are appalled at the recent escalations taken by the encampment, which has made it a terrifying time to be Jewish at Newcastle University. ""We avoid the camp where possible, but we refuse to be pushed out of our campus. ""We are here to study and that is what we would like to be able to do without hearing hate speech against us daily."" They added that ""those of us that are visibly Jewish are especially fearful"" and have taken to tucking their Star of David necklaces and traditional tassels into their clothes and wearing hats to hide their brimless kippah caps. A spokesman for the demonstrators, who was hiding his identify during the protest, said they only wore masks while on the encampment or while carrying out an action such as occupying a building. ""In day-to-day life and the running of the camp people are generally not wearing masks and, in the sense, we as a camp have very strict procedures and protocols on discrimination,"" he said. ""That's all discrimination - antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian discrimination. ""If any student is feeling intimidated we want to adjust that and we want to do some outreach for them.""

Sharifah Rahman was due to represent the party in the Cardiff South and Penarth constituency.  The party said the content of the social media posts ""do not reflect the views and values of Plaid Cymru"". BBC Wales has not been able to reach Ms Rahman for comment.  As this has happened so near to the close of nominations, Ms Rahman's name will remain on the ballot as Plaid candidate, but without support from the party. A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: “Plaid Cymru has consistently condemned both the actions of Hamas terrorists on October 7 and the subsequent horrific bombardment of Gaza by the Israeli Government.  ""We reaffirm our calls for an immediate ceasefire, the unimpeded distribution of humanitarian aid and the cessation of arms sales to Israel. “Plaid Cymru will continue to campaign for a just peace and a two-state solution – including the recognition of the state of Palestine, and a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7228qnz555o,Greens drop some candidates after online posts probe,"The party says it has blocked a ""small number"" of candidates after allegations of antisemitism online.",7 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Green Party says it has blocked a ""small number"" of election candidates after an investigation into their online activity.  The party was still examining previous social media posts hours before nominations closed at 16.00 BST on Friday. It was already known that four candidates are not running, after a probe into reports of antisemitic or extreme comments. But it is not yet clear whether, or how many any, other candidates have been dropped. Co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the BBC on Thursday that four candidates were ""no longer standing,"" without specifying whether they had been dropped or withdrew themselves.  It comes as The Times reports party officials were examining nearly 20 candidates over online material on Thursday night, less than 24 hours before the deadline.   In a statement, the party said it had taken ""decisive action"" against a ""small number of people who did put themselves forward"". ""We would never allow anybody antisemitic to stand for the Green Party,"" a spokesperson added. The Greens are hoping to field candidates in every seat in England and Wales for the first time at the surprise general election called last month. This requires the candidates to find 575 candidates in total, 103 more than at the last election in 2019. The Scottish Greens are a separate party. The party has defended its vetting processes, but has faced accusations some of its candidates have expressed or shared antisemitic statements online. The Greens have previously said they are working with Lord Mann, a former Labour MP and the government's advisor on antisemitism, ""to better educate Green representatives about anti-Jewish racism"". The Board of Deputies of British Jews accused the Greens of taking too long to act on ""such a clear problem"". ""Serious parties need to take candidate selection seriously - the Greens need to see this as a wake-up call,"" the community group added. On Thursday, Mr Ramsay defended the party's investigation process, saying it was independent of the party leadership and this was a ""matter of good governance"". “Like any other party, we have candidates who are selected and end up not standing. That’s no different to anyone else,"" he added. “If anyone has a situation where questions are raised about comments people have raised, those are properly investigated."" The Greens took a pro-ceasefire stance early on during the war in Gaza and are calling for tougher action against Israel, including boycotts and stopping UK arms sales to the Israeli military.  It has previously said it opposes ""any efforts to exploit the ongoing tragedy in Israel-Palestine to foster division, intensify antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of racism""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4475ld055o,Tory candidate linked to pastors accused of homophobia,"Darren Millar, who is standing in Clwyd North, says he does not share the views of Yang Tuck Yoong.",3 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservatives have selected a parliamentary candidate with links to preachers accused of homophobia and Islamophobia. Darren Millar, who is currently a member of the Welsh Parliament, has been selected to stand for the new parliamentary seat of Clwyd North in North Wales. Mr Millar has previously attracted controversy for his association with a pastor called Yang Tuck Yoong, who was criticised for homophobic views. Mr Yoong said homosexuality was an “abomination” and a “sin” and was reported to police in 2013 after saying it was “far more rampant, militant and organised than most of us actually believe it to be” in a sermon titled ‘The Sin of Sodom'. Mr Millar has said he does not endorse his views.  In 2019, it emerged that a charity Mr Millar was a trustee of – the Evan Roberts Institute – had financial links to Mr Yoong’s Cornerstone Community Church. He said at the time he did not share his views but human rights campaigners had called for him to cut ties with the church. The latest accounts of the Evan Roberts Institute show that the charity still leases a chapel it bought in 2014 to the Cornerstone Community Church, earning it income of £11,000 in ‘Freehold Reversionary Interest.’ Mr Millar told the BBC he did not endorse the views of the pastors and said “no one should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or religious beliefs"".  The refurbishment work on this chapel in Loughor, Swansea, was also paid for by the Cornerstone Community Church. In a video seen by the BBC from 2015, Mr Millar can also be seen at the opening of Mr Yoong’s Bible College of Wales pictured alongside two other controversial preachers. The footage shows Mr Millar at an event bowing with separate US preachers who have been accused of Islamophobic and homophobic views - Lou Engle and Dutch Sheets. A former Labour member of the Welsh Parliament, Edwina Hart, is also visible in the video. She is no longer an elected politician and is not running to be an MP in the general election. In 2018, Mr Engle allegedly told a conference in Singapore that Muslims were ""taking over the south of Spain"" and said he ""had a dream, where I will raise up the church all over Spain to push back a new modern Muslim movement"".  After the conference, hosted by the Cornerstone Community Church, police in Singapore reportedly investigated him over whether his comments could undermine religious harmony in Singapore. It was reported that Mr Yoong later apologised to Muslim community leaders for comments made by Mr Engle. Mr Engle has also reportedly called for ""martyrs"" to stop the ""homosexual agenda"" and accused Muslims of ""fuelling the demonic realm"" in sermons. Also pictured with Mr Millar in the footage is the pastor Mr Sheets - a Christian nationalist. Mr Sheets has previously said that America must ""refuse to give this nation to demons"" including ""Hinduism"" and said that ""Christianity will invade Islam"".  In a comment about the event at the time, Mr Millar said he was “delighted” to be at the event and said: “I thank God immensely how He shook a guy in Singapore and attracted him to this place in order to invest in what I believe is a project that would have ramification for the kingdom of God for many years to come. And I am delighted to be part of it.” A Conservative Spokesperson said: ""The Conservative Party does not condone homophobia or discrimination of any sort. Mr Millar has been clear that he does not share the views of these individuals."""

If not, this guide offers a summary of where the main parties stand on the issues most important to voters, based on the promises they have made during the campaign. Click on the drop-down list to select the nation, political parties and issues that interest you. A manifesto is the list of pledges parties make to voters, explaining what they would do if elected. This interactive has been put together by the BBC's Visual Journalism team, the BBC's political research unit in London and BBC journalists in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. Its aim is to summarise where the parties stand on key topics to help voters make informed decisions at the ballot box. We have selected issues highlighted in polling company Ipsos Mori's Issues Index, a monthly survey that measures the things the public believe to be the most important facing the country. We analysed surveys from the twelve months before the election was called and selected the issues based on their aggregate score over that period. In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, ""NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care"" are included under the one category of ""NHS and care"". ""Democracy"" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments. In order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria: Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here. This is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area. Because of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, ""health"" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33x9jm02ko,Labour’s Wes Streeting among victims of deepfake smear network on X,"The group also posts misleading comments to boost the credibility of its false, politically damaging videos.",7 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A doctored video of Labour's Wes Streeting has been pushed to X users - making it seem as though he called fellow politician Diane Abbott a ""silly woman"". A network of X accounts has been creating and sharing such clips of politicians ahead of the general election - and then posting misleading comments alongside to bolster the impression they are real. I have been tracking down some of the people behind the network and unpicking their tactics. Has their trolling gone too far? The doctored video of Mr Streeting features him on the BBC's Politics Live show. As the presenter discusses Ms Abbott, the footage is made to sound as though Mr Streeting is saying ""silly woman"" under his breath - but he never said those words. The clip was posted on X - formerly Twitter - by a user called Men for Wes who, in the comments, expressed outrage at the ""really nasty people"" in the Labour Party. Other users swarmed in the comments to endorse the clip as real. One account going by the name “Murray” falsely claimed to be a BBC Politics Live ""floor manager"" saying: ""This is legit"". Others said, “I can deffo hear Wes Streeting calling Diane Abbott a silly woman” or “You can clearly hear he said silly woman what an utter disgrace you are Wes Streeting”. One falsely suggested the BBC “pulled the episode” of Politics Live from iPlayer, which could discourage people from checking. This clip and several more about other politicians were recommended by X in the feed of one of the BBC's Undercover Voters - 24 fictional people with social media accounts, created to investigate what content is recommended to different types of voters during the election. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch relevant content. The videos recommended to the Undercover Voter profile have racked up tens of thousands of views and led to politicians such as Mr Streeting denouncing them as false. Some X users pointed out they believed it to be faked, some responded with abusive remarks - and others were clearly confused about what to believe. The BBC identified some of the users responsible for these videos, who describe their approach as ""shitposting"" - a term which usually refers to posting large amounts of ironic, low-effort content to derail productive discussion, distract people and provoke a reaction. This can come from people of all different political perspectives - and doesn’t have to be about politics. But while some of their fake clips are clearly absurd and satirical, others falsely portray candidates saying politically damaging things, while in the comments, the network of X users works to make them appear believable. Some of the clips make inflammatory comments related to the war in Gaza. As well as Mr Streeting, they have targeted Reform UK leader Nigel Farage and another Labour candidate, Luke Akehurst. An X user called chai_ste - who re-shared the clip of Wes Streeting with the question “is this real?” - also shared a different doctored clip of Mr Akehurst, whose outspoken support for Israel and its actions in Gaza has made him unpopular with the Labour left.  This clip falsely portrays him as bragging that he will be elected by ""thick"" Geordies who think Gaza is a footballer. The fake floor manager ""Murray"" was this time a “sound engineer” who again posted that “this is legit”. Other accounts, which seemed to be in on the joke, posted asking, “is this real?” and the original profile replied saying “I haven't seen any source to disprove it as of yet!” Another said: “I’m sure he just misspoke.” There’s also evidence several of these accounts were involved in another deepfaked clip of Sir Keir Starmer. It was about the Rochdale by-election earlier this year and falsely suggested Starmer called Labour supporters ""beyond thick"" and suggested that “as long as we’re scoring points with Israel they’ll be happy”. Several hours after they were originally shared, the doctored clips of Mr Streeting, Mr Akehurst and Sir Keir were labelled as fakes by X’s reader-operated fact check service, while X also applied a warning to the clip of Mr Akehurst saying it was “manipulated media”. Following my investigation, the Men for Wes account has been suspended by X and the videos from its account are no longer visible on the site. Some of the other profiles also appear to have been removed. This group of accounts regularly interact with one another, amplifying and engaging with each other’s posts in this way. Some appear to co-ordinate their posts on a Discord server - an instant messaging and chat community - which refers to them as a ""Shitposting Army"". Several of these X users post frequently about their concern for Palestinians in the war in Gaza, as well as posting in support of Jeremy Corbyn and left-leaning Labour politicians. At least two of the people who appear to be behind some of the accounts seem to be based in the UK and in their twenties and thirties. The Men for Wes account declined my request to speak on the phone several times and declined to disclose their identity, but agreed to answer my questions by messaging. They said they aimed to provoke attention and ""muddy the water"" for viewers. They described this as a ""corrective"" to the ways that politicians ""misrepresent who they really are"" and rejected allegations they were a threat to democracy. They condemned any hate directed at politicians shared by other accounts. They claimed a politician they supported had previously been targeted by misinformation, but in that case it had been spread by people in power and mainstream media outlets rather than ""random Twitter accounts"". The user running the chai_ste profile, who also declined to give their real name, poked fun at the question of whether this network of accounts had taken “shitposting” too far. They mockingly claimed to be following a “handbook from the Labour Party” and saying they were advised to post some “obviously fake videos” in among their “tasks” from the party, “so that it doesn’t become very obvious what we are really doing”. A doctored clip of Nigel Farage was one of the more obviously satirical creations of the network. The video edited the Reform UK leader's words from a clip making light of the incident where a milkshake was thrown over him, so that he appeared to make an obscene reference to bodily fluids. But the comments around other videos, bolstering their claims of authenticity, appear to be causing real confusion among some people. One user called Nigel, who responded on X to the post about Wes Streeting, told me he initially believed the video could be real. The 64-year-old said he intended to switch from Conservatives to Labour for the first time but said videos such as this could undermine their support. “This sort of thing is damaging. It seems everywhere you turn folks are out to get the Labour front team. I’ve been told by more Labour voters not to vote Labour than Tory voters!” he said. Another social media user - who asked to remain anonymous - contacted me to say he had been following several of these accounts with concern since the faked clips of Sir Keir emerged. He said: “Their tactics on how they'd push each fake were pretty calculated. It's frustrating as there are people in my life who have fallen for this kind of thing before."" Lots of the comments do feature users calling out the content as fake, however. X and Discord did not respond to the points raised by the BBC. X says publicly how “defending and respecting the user's voice is one of our core values”. Discord says online its guidelines ""ensure everyone can express themselves and find community — but not at the expense of anyone else"". The Undercover Voters are fictional profiles designed to represent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK. They follow, view and like content relevant to their character, informed by data and analysis from the National Centre for Social Research. For this story, I examined the feeds of the profiles of some of these fictional voters in Halifax, which has been a target for the Conservatives and is currently held by Labour. Kieran - a disillusioned voter in his twenties - is following lots of content about civilians killed in Gaza, as well as content about boycotting Israel. His feed on X was pushed these doctored clips of Mr Akehurst and then Mr Streeting. Another Undercover Voter called Patricia has viewed posts supporting Israel and opposing antisemitism. She has seen critical posts which reused old clips of politicians expressing support for Palestinians. These included abusive and Islamophobic remarks in the comments, but I found no evidence of a similar network of accounts sharing doctored clips or comments in the same way on her feeds. The third Undercover Voter character in Halifax is 44-year-old Maryam, who is quite disengaged in politics and undecided about who she wants to vote for. She has not been recommended this content so far."

Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out received a complaint on 4 January about Laura Wolfe liking material on X, formerly Twitter, regarding the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict. It was passed on to the FA who looked into the matter and subsequently issued the warning for her social media activity. In a memo sent to Kick It Out, which has been seen by BBC Sport, Burnley confirmed they had investigated the matter internally. The club also said they would review their diversity and social media policies as well as training for staff and contractors. The outcome of the FA investigation became public on Tuesday. The FA declined to comment but it is understood they issue warnings and/or reminders of responsibilities on a regular basis in relation to a wide range of alleged misconduct. Wolfe's legal team told BBC Sport she is disputing the outcome of the FA's findings. Burnley failed to respond when contacted for a statement. Activity on an X account under Wolfeâs name appeared to âlikeâ a post which stated âPalestinians are an invented peopleâ and âwere created to be the biggest Jew haters on Earthâ, while she also appeared to âlikeâ a comment which stated âgood riddanceâ to a poet that had been killed in Gaza. Burnley's investigation found ""on the balance of probability""  that there was ""insufficient evidence to substantiate"" the allegations against Wolfe were ""Islamophobic or discriminatory on the grounds of race or religion"". The club also told Kick It Out there was insufficient evidence to establish that Wolfe's activity on X brought ""Burnley Football Club into disrepute"". As well as her work as a consultant for Burnley, Wolfe is described on a business platform as having high-profile clients in the sports industry and as the owner of the Northwest Football Awards. She ran former Clarets boss Vincent Kompany's testimonial year while he was playing at Manchester City and lists Kick It Out as a client on her events website. Kick It Out said in a statement to BBC Sport the FA ""formally"" warned ""a contractor at a club about their social media activity"". The organisation added: ""From the outset, we passed the allegations to the FA and the club, and kept the complainant informed, as is our normal policy. ""As the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza continues, we urge all those involved in football to be cautious with their social media engagement, which could endorse words or have impacts that we do not intend. Kick It Out also said it was encouraging football to ""adopt the All Party Parliamentary Group Working Definition of Islamophobia so that all stakeholders are working to the same standard""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxeevlxex1lo,Why Nigel Farage’s return to the fray matters,"Nigel Farage has made it his life’s work to disrupt - and he reckons he is not done yet, writes Chris Mason.",29 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Nigel Farage is one of the most influential politicians of our time. Quite the achievement for a man who has never been an MP, despite trying to become one seven times. Would the UK have left the European Union, would people in the UK have ever had a say on EU membership, without him? Possibly not. Maybe you love him, maybe you really don’t. Nigel Farage has made it his life’s work to disrupt, delight, dismay, horrify, and he reckons he is not done yet. We reporters squeeze into an upstairs room of the Royal Cinque Ports Yacht Club, overlooking the English Channel. He had already announced that he wouldn’t try to win a seat in Parliament himself at this election, prompting a reporter from The Sun to tease him that he was a chicken. He argued that from the bitter experience of more than half a dozen defeats, he had little chance of success without working a seat for months in advance. Doing so would also tie him geographically to his chosen patch for much of the contest, which is why I reckon what he has said now is more significant than what he said last week. His capacity to be – potentially at least – a significant influence on this election is arguably greater by attempting to stride the national stage rather than plough a narrower and probably doomed personal furrow in a particular constituency. And stride the national stage is exactly what he is going to try to do. Mr Farage’s choice of backdrop, Dover, was intentional. Immigration, the topic that electrified the arguments around Brexit, arguably turning a relatively niche issue about sovereignty and governance into a mainstream concern, is the spine of his argument again. Little wonder: the Conservatives and Labour grapple about searching for solutions to the issue of small boat crossings, with numbers high. And legal migration numbers are sky high too. I have known Nigel Farage for the best part of 20 years. He is a master of the theatrics of politics, with a ready knack for oratory and a capacity to ad lib in fluent argument – and spot and capitalise on gaps in the political debate left by the Tories and Labour. He thinks illegal and legal migration amount to a colossal gap. He claims immigration poses a “national security emergency"". And he has been accused of Islamophobia for saying war in the Middle East is prompting a small but growing number of people in the UK to vote based on religion, along what he calls “sectarian” lines. But when I challenge him on the suggestion critics make that he is divisive, he argues: “I am willing to say things others aren’t"". Don’t some find this inflammatory, I push him. “No, they find it embarrassing. And difficult. And awkward. It is happening because there is no debate about it because, and they will all cry at me because, Labour started this, with a completely irresponsible immigration policy and the Conservatives have accelerated it.” His ambition is huge – and amounts to no less than seeking to replace the very party he joined then left, and then provoked, enraged and enthused for decades: the Conservatives. Right now that seems highly unlikely, however they perform in five weeks time. But then again, 20 years ago the UK leaving the European Union didn’t seem likely either. For now, it is the short term that matters. Can he neutralise that Conservative attack line that claims a vote for Reform UK, of which he is honorary president, is a vote to put Keir Starmer in Downing Street? Lots of Tories were already haunted by Reform and Nigel Farage grinning his way back to prominence will magnify their spooks. Mr Farage told me it was nailed on Labour would win the election and the Conservatives would be annihilated so people could vote Reform without fearing any wider consequence caused by them. Well, hang on: not a vote has been cast yet and Tories do fret that support for Reform UK disproportionately comes from people who voted for them in 2019. Let’s see. We are a week into the general election campaign. Each party is getting into its stride and finding its voice. The cacophony of voices grows louder and the pace will continue to quicken. The addition of Nigel Farage’s voice adds intrigue, personality, jeopardy, excitement and anger in roughly equal measure."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy00npvpmzpo,"Diane Abbott free to stand for Labour, says Starmer",The Labour leader endorses Diane Abbott to be Labour candidate in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.,31 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said Diane Abbott is ""free to go forward as a Labour candidate"", ending days of speculation about the veteran left-winger's future. Ms Abbott, the first female black MP, had claimed she had been banned from standing for Labour at the general election on 4 July. Sir Keir has now given Ms Abbott his blessing to stand in Hackney North and Stoke Newington - a seat she has represented since 1987.  Labour's National Executive Committee has the final say on Ms Abbott's candidacy - but a senior party source told the BBC the group will not block her from standing. Ms Abbott said: ‘“I will not be making any comment until next week but the narrative looks positive.” However, speaking at a rally outside Hackney Town Hall on Tuesday, she said: ""I promise you that as long as it is possible, I will be the Member of Parliament for Hackney North and Stoke Newington."" Left-wing Labour group Momentum called the decision ""a huge victory"" for Ms Abbott. A Momentum spokesperson said: ""Starmer tried to force her out. She held firm - and won. ""You come at the queen, you better not miss."" The last week has been dominated by a stand-off between Ms Abbott and the Labour leadership.  Sir Keir had repeatedly dodged questions on Ms Abbott's future, even after she appeared to confirm reports in the Times newspaper that she had been blocked from standing as a Labour candidate despite having the whip restored. On Thursday deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner raised the pressure on Sir Keir, telling Sky News: ""I don't see any reason why Diane Abbott can't stand as a Labour MP."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the episode showed ""Angela Rayner is in charge"" of Labour, instead of Sir Keir. ""If he's given into Angela Rayner on this, imagine what he'll give into when it comes to the union's demanding higher taxes, or indeed weakening our defence and security,"" he said. An SNP spokesman said ""the way Diane Abbott and other progressive candidates have been treated is shameful"". Lib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""Candidate selection for other parties is not an issue I get into."" Ms Abbott was suspended from Labour last year after suggesting Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experience prejudice, but not racism ""all their lives"", sparking a long-running process which saw her sit as an Independent MP. She apologised on X, formerly known as Twitter, and withdrew her remarks. Labour is in a bitter row with accusations that Sir Keir is carrying out a ""purge"" of left-wing candidates and placing his supporters in winnable seats. Ms Rayner has argued Sir Keir is not acting ""in a factional way"". Former Brighton MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle told the BBC he had been made a ""sacrificial lamb"" after Labour suspended him following a complaint about his behaviour. Overnight, Mr Russell-Moyle was replaced by Chris Ward, a former advisor to Sir Keir, as Labour's candidate for Brighton Kemptown. The BBC does not know the nature of the complaint made against Russell-Moyle.  On Wednesday after he was suspended, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken."" Speaking exclusively to Politics Live on BBC Two Mr Russell-Moyle claimed Labour were giving preferential treatment to Sir Keir's allies. When asked about whether there is a cull of left-wing candidates, Mr Russell-Moyle said: ""Quite clearly the timing for me is highly suspicious. ""The appointment of the person replacing me is highly suspicious. ""It would be better if the party made sure that if they are replacing MPs at the last-minute they are replacing MPs that are similar in terms of ideological belief or from local roots."" Shama Tatler, of the Starmer supporting Labour to Win group, has been selected as Labour candidate for Chingford and Woodford Green after Faiza Shaheen was barred, despite having already launched her campaign. Ms Shaheen, who fought the seat in 2019, has said she is considering legal action over the move and released a statement last night accusing some within Labour of a “systematic campaign of racism, Islamophobia and bullying”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckmm4lgm0l4o,German anti-Islam activist injured in knife attack,"The attacker stabbed several people including a policeman, before being shot by an officer.",1 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man has attacked six people, including a police officer, with a knife at a market square in the south-west German city of Mannheim, police say. One of the people injured was anti-Islam activist, Michael Stürzenberger, who had been preparing to hold a rally in the square, according to his group. The incident was caught on a YouTube livestream and showed the attacker stabbing a man, and then a police officer who went to help. The officer is in a critical condition. The attacker was shot and injured by another police officer. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described the incident as “terrible”, and that his thoughts were with the victims. He posted on X: “Violence is absolutely unacceptable in our democracy. The perpetrator must be severely punished.” Police in Mannheim tweeted about a ""major police operation"" in the city's market square and a rescue helicopter was sent to the scene. One person attacked several others with a knife, injuring them, at 11:35 (10:35 BST), police said in a follow-up statement. A firearm was then used against the attacker, it added. The attack is understood to have happened at the same time as a rally in the market square hosted by far-right anti-Islam activist, Michael Stürzenberger, and his organisation the Citizens' Movement Pax Europa (BPE). A spokeswoman for the city of Mannheim confirmed that the organisation had registered an event on the market square for Friday morning. BPE confirmed to Bild newspaper that Mr Stürzenberger was attacked in the leg and face.  His colleague Stefanie Kizina told the newspaper that Mr Stürzenberger has to undergo surgery, but his life was not in danger.  ""The attack happened before the event even started, it must have been planned well in advance,"" she said. Police have not released any further information about those injured in the attack. Local newspaper Mannheimer Morgen has reported that the attacker injured six people, including five BPE members and one police officer. According to DPA, the police officer was in a critical condition and will have to undergo emergency surgery. A livestreamed video from the event shows a man attacking people with a knife. At least one person is seen with a wound to the leg. A number of bystanders are seen grappling with the attacker, who later manages to break free and stab a police officer in the back.  Several police officers with firearms then surround him, before he falls to the ground. Police have not released the identity of the suspect, but German media outlets say he is a 25-year-old man who was born in Afghanistan but lives in Germany. Although a motive has not been confirmed, Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said there was a possibility that the attack could be Islamist-motivated. According to Bild, Michael Stürzenberger is the author of an Islamophobic blog, as well as a member of the BPE, an organisation which says it stands against the ""Islamisation"" of Germany. The 58-year-old is one of the authors of the anti-Muslim platform PI-News and is being monitored by the Bavarian domestic intelligence service. A former politician, Mr Stürzenberger once led a small right-wing populist party Die Freiheit, which was dissolved in 2016. Before that, he was a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - but left before he was kicked out."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cle0e0y4pyxo,Greens promise action over antisemitism allegations,"The party says it is working to ""better educate"" its representatives about ""anti-Jewish racism"".",16 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Green Party of England and Wales says it is taking action after complaints about antisemitic statements made or supported by its candidates. It comes after the Jewish Chronicle reported that three parliamentary candidates shared ""incendiary material"" online. The party says it is working with Lord Mann, the government's independent advisor on antisemitism, ""to better educate Green representatives about anti-Jewish racism"". Lord Mann, a former Labour MP, initially wrote to the party before 2 May's English local elections over posts allegedly made by candidates Mohamed Makawi and Abdul Malik from October 2023. The Green Party said Mr Makawi had has since apologised and undertaken social media training, while Mr Malik was ""unwittingly"" implicated by being tagged in the post. Mr Malik told the BBC he did not put up a post showing Hamas spokesmen, and said he completely condemns the attacks on Israel. The Green Party leadership confirmed they had met Lord Mann last week.  They have issued a joint statement with him, committing to a ""continued dialogue and working together to ensure that antisemitism, like all racism, has no place in Green politics"". The statement adds: ""The Green Party has taken a series of proactive steps towards these goals but understands that this will take consistent work going forward"". This week the Jewish Chronicle reported that three parliamentary candidates shared ""incendiary material"" online. The BBC has not been able to view the posts on social media, but has tried to contact all three people involved to ask if they wish to respond. According to the Jewish Chronicle, Elizabeth Waight, the Green candidate in Bethnal Green and Stepney, re-posted a video on Instagram in March this year in which a woman said: ""What's left for the Zionists [is] to eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Palestinians… I think this will happen soon."" The Jewish Chronicle also alleges that Chingford and Wood Green candidate Chris Brody uploaded links to an article that suggested that the 9/11 and October 7 terror attacks were ""false flag operations executed to open the path toward more slaughter and mayhem"". The newspaper also highlights Bristol East candidate Naseem Talukdar, who is said to have circulated comparisons between the Holocaust and the war in Gaza and ""liked"" a video clip in which anti-Israel activist David Miller says ""we have to destroy Zionism"".  Green Party sources say the allegations will be assessed as to whether disciplinary action, training or support would be the most appropriate response. A party spokesperson said: ""The allegations raised are serious and are being treated as such. At this stage it would be inappropriate for us to comment further on the examples raised."" It has been suggested to the BBC that the party machinery is stretched as it tries to sift through a number of cases of potential antisemitism that have been raised in recent weeks. Lord Mann believes all political parties must have robust systems in place to deal with complaints. The Green Party has taken a pro-ceasefire stance on the war in Gaza since October, and is now calling for tougher action against Israel, through boycotts, divestment and sanctions. In a further sign that the leadership is concerned about being seen to have become a haven for those with antisemitic views, the party released a joint letter from Jewish and Muslim Greens, saying they are ""united against antisemitism and Islamophobia"". ""Together, we oppose any efforts to exploit the ongoing tragedy in Israel-Palestine to foster division, intensify antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of racism"", it reads."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68982352,Modi's divisive campaign rhetoric raises questions,The Indian PM's remarks against Muslims on the election trail have puzzled many. What is going on?,10 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In the lead-up to India's general election, Narendra Modi was expected to frame it as a referendum on his  decade as prime minister.  He was expected to boast about achievements like generous welfare programmes and spaceflights. He was to reaffirm that the new Ram temple in Ayodhya represented a cultural assertion for India's majority Hindus. Even foreign policy was anticipated to influence the ballot, with the publicity boost afforded by Mr Modi's hosting of the G20 summit last September. Opinion polls have predicted a third, record-equalling landslide win for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But early in the gruelling six-week election, Mr Modi's campaign shifted gears, using divisive rhetoric that has raised questions about his tactics. He's been accusing the opposition, led by the Congress party, of appeasing the Muslim minority community. Muslims make up 14% of India's more than 1.4 billion people. Taking a cue from Mr Modi's campaign, social media posts by the BJP have, according to the opposition, ""demonised"" Muslims. He told a rally on 21 April that the opposition Congress wanted to distribute wealth to ""infiltrators"" and to ""those who have many children"". His remarks were widely seen as referring to Muslims.  At another rally, he warned women that the opposition would confiscate their gold and redistribute it to Muslims. He accused the Congress of orchestrating a ""vote jihad"", urging a ""certain community"" to unite against him. Mr Modi even said the Congress would select the Indian cricket team ""on the basis of religion"".  That's not all. In a recent interview Mr Modi said the ""whole world"" was trying to influence the elections. This week, Mr Modi blamed the Congress for taking ""truckloads"" of money from billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has long spoken about the close ties that Mr Modi shares with the country's two richest men.  ""For the first time you have spoken in public about Adani and Ambani. Is it your personal experience that you know they give money in trucks?"" Mr Gandhi responded in a video message. Neither businessman has reacted to the comments. India's opposition has also accused Mr Modi of Islamophobia, calling his remarks ""divisive, hate speech"". The Congress has demanded an investigation into a potential code of conduct violation. Since the BJP's rise to power, hate speech against India's 200 million Muslims has increased. But Mr Modi's fiery rhetoric on the stump has surprised many, as they expected a focus on highlighting his achievements instead.  ""To be honest, I thought Mr Modi's campaign would be much more about the rising India story, and about what they had done for the people,"" says Rahul Verma of the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), a Delhi-based think tank.  Others say Mr Modi's remarks are not unprecedented. They point to many such instances during his previous election campaigns, including what they call his ""inflammatory rhetoric"" after the riots in Gujarat in 2002 ahead of the state's assembly elections. ""So, it has not surprised me, but is has shocked me. We often refer to such rhetoric as dog-whistling but there was nothing subtle about the language being employed,"" says Milan Vaishnav of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. For one, many say, the BJP might have been spooked by a significant dip in turnout in early rounds of voting amid what has been a rather low energy election. In the previous two elections, won decisively by the BJP, high turnouts benefitted the party - 2014 was largely a vote against the Congress, and 2019 was a vote for Mr Modi.  Second, the opposition has been trying to reshape the narrative of the 2024 election, shifting focus from being solely a referendum on Mr Modi to campaigning on issues like unemployment, social justice and economic inequality. Political scientist Neelanjan Sircar suggests that the BJP excels in national elections when it focuses on overarching national issues. He told a podcast recently that the party's not ""playing its strongest game"" when elections become more regionalised, and local factors come into play. Mr Modi's party is targeting 370 seats this time, up from 303 in 2019. However, their rallying cry of ""Abki Baar, 400 par""  (This time, above 400), aiming for the party and its allies to secure a landslide, might have backfired. The opposition appears to have seized on the slogan, portraying the BJP as a dominating force set to reshape India with a massive majority. ""The opposition is using this slogan to say if they come with such huge majority, the BJP will change the constitution. And the opposition's narrative to empower poor and lower castes might have got some traction given there are high levels of economic anxiety evident in the pre-poll surveys,"" says Mr Verma. ""This might have provoked Mr Modi to take this narrative head on and give it a Hindu-Muslim twist."" Is Mr Modi's divisive rhetoric a sign of desperation?  Not really, says Mr Vaishnav. ""To me, it is designed to mobilise his cadres and perhaps to make up for an underwhelming performance in the first few phases. ""Desperation suggests that the BJP is losing, which I do not believe to be the case. Meeting the new target of 400 seats will be difficult unless the BJP can retain its seats from 2019 as well as expand into new areas."" Despite Mr Modi's rhetoric on the stump, he has sung a different tune in recent interviews with news networks. ""I am not anti-Islam, nor am I anti-Muslim,"" he told Times Now. He said his government's welfare benefits extended to all, irrespective of their community or religion, adding that ""social justice and secularism is a guarantee from Modi"".  Mr Modi criticised the opposition for using Muslims as political pawns and suggested that the community should reflect on its own situation. ""Muslims should introspect why there's a sense of shortcomings within the community."" He said the Muslim community was changing all over the world. ""When I go to the Gulf countries, India and I get so much respect. Here there's opposition,"" he said. Unravelling the complexity behind election victories in India is always a challenge. Gilles Verniers, a political scientist, believes they are rarely fought and won based on past accomplishments. ""Voters instead determine their choice according to what parties and candidates offer for the future. After building its past campaigns on welfare, security and nationalism, and having scored on these matters, the BJP does not have a lot of new ideas to offer to voters, hence the exacerbation of ethnic and religious nationalism,"" he says.  Mr Modi and his party will disagree. But one thing is evident: this election has not yet manifested itself as a sweeping wave favouring any side, regardless of which party stands to gain or lose from it. ""In politics,"" says political analyst Pratap Bhanu Mehta, ""never underestimate the power of boredom"". That could account for what many say is the BJP's ""nervousness""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68990672,MPs given guide to spotting conspiracy theories,The guide - commissioned by Penny Mordaunt - warns MPs and candidates of the main conspiracies in circulation.,10 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A new guide to conspiracy theories that ""can pose a danger to democracy"" has been written for MPs and would-be politicians. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, commissioned the booklet to warn colleagues of eight of the biggest false claims. These include conspiracies around vaccines, 5G and ""15 minute cities"".  It came as Ms Mordaunt took a swipe at former Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, saying he ""promotes conspiracy theories"". As the Commons leader was introducing the guide in the Commons on Thursday, Mr Bridgen  - who was a Conservative MP but was expelled from the party for spreading ""dangerous"" anti-vaccine conspiracies in April last year and now sits as an independent - raised the issue of Covid 19 vaccines. It feels a bit like an episode of a Dystopian TV drama when elected politicians have to refer to a conspiracy theory handbook.  But really, this is an indication of the real-world harm disinformation, conspiracy theories and hate on social media have caused in recent months and years. Once the Covid-19 pandemic eased and restrictions were lifted, you'd be forgiven for thinking the proliferation of online conspiracy theories might have subsided. But now they emerge up every time something major happens - whether a violent attack, a war, a disappearance.  They're used to explain what's unfolding in the here and now, rather than historical events. And a committed conspiracy theory movement exists here in the UK.  These conspiracy theories often exploit valid questions or go far beyond legitimate concerns - instead suggesting elaborate plots for which there is no evidence.  This handbook is a reminder of how MPs are grappling with the social media world. And that feels particularly acute with an election on the horizon and AI-generated content further exacerbating the murky underbelly online.  Mr Bridgen said the original version of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been being withdrawn this week.  Describing how he had suffered vaccine side effects, he claimed there is ""huge and growing concern"" over ""a medical intervention that this House encouraged, coerced and, in some cases, mandated people to inject into their bodies"" and asked for a ministerial statement on ""why the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency failed to act to protect the public interest"". Highlighting how the Covid 19 vaccines had saved millions of lives, Ms Mordaunt remined the MP he had already had several Commons debates on the issue and, while side effects are a serious issue, ""that is quite another thing from promoting false information about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines"". Ms Mordaunt said the guide had a chapter on anti-vaccine conspiracies and encouraged Mr Bridgen to ""get a copy and read it, to think seriously when he comes to the House, as he does every week, and promotes conspiracy theories and to really think about the consequences of what he is doing."" The eight conspiracies are explained by different charity groups and fact-checking organisations in the booklet are:  Urging all MPs to read the guide to conspiracy theories on Thursday, Ms Mordaunt said: ""Such theories are a real threat not just to democracy, but to the wellbeing of our constituents.  ""They are a form of radicalisation, they are spreading and we must do everything we can to combat them."" The guide says many of the conspiracy theories are linked to anti-Jewish racism, with a shared belief around ""a secret cabal that seeks world domination by controlling world events, promoting conflicts and financial instability, [which] can find its roots in age-old antisemitism"". ""This risk is not only of conspiracy theories targeting governments and populations but also the active support and proliferation of conspiracy theories by government or other public officials,"" it states. Showing cross-party support for the move, Labour's Lucy Powell also welcomed the ""important guide"", adding: ""Although the existence of conspiracy theories is nothing new, their reach, risk and repercussions are ever increasing."" The SNP's Deirdre Brock was also supportive but criticised the the ""the malign influence"" of Facebook groups linked to Conservative party HQ staff and activists during the London Mayor campaign, which she said were ""forums full of vile racism, conspiracy theories and Islamophobic abuse of Sadiq Khan"". ""There is reason to suspect similar groups are quietly spreading their poison across the UK, including in Scotland,"" she said.  The guide was written jointly by the Antisemitism Policy Trust, Full Fact, Tell Mama, Global Network on Extremism and Technology, the Community Security Trust and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue."

So-called ""liberated zones"" were set up at Oxford's Museum of Natural History and King's College, Cambridge, earlier. The demonstrators called for the universities to cut financial ties with Israel following its offensive in Gaza. Oxford University has previously expressed ""profound sympathy for those suffering in Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank"". In the past week, Pro-Palestinian protesters have have set up tents outside university buildings in cities including Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle as well as at Goldsmiths, University of London. In a joint statement, Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine called for the universities to stop lending ""financial and moral support"" to the Israeli government. ""Oxbridge's profits cannot continue to climb at the expense of Palestinian lives, and their reputations must no longer be built on the white-washing of Israeli crimes,"" it said. Cambridge Jews for Justice in Palestine, a group of Jewish students at the University of Cambridge said it was also supporting the demonstration ""to oppose Israel's occupation of Palestine"".  More than 33,000 people have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry there says, the majority of them civilians.  Israel rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in its campaign in Gaza, and has insisted it has the right to defend itself following the armed incursion by Hamas on 7 October. On Thursday, the Union of Jewish Students said the encampments were creating a ""hostile and toxic atmosphere"" on campuses and called on universities to ""take their duty of care to Jewish students seriously"". In a statement, The University of Oxford said it was aware of the latest protests. It added: ""We respect our students and staff members right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests. We ask everyone who is taking part to do so with respect, courtesy and empathy. ""Oxford University's primary focus is the health and safety of the university community, and to ensure any impact on work, research and learning, including student exams, is minimised.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61311046,UK housing scheme called danger to Ukraine refugees,"Potentially violent and abusive men are offering accommodation to Ukrainian women, BBC News learns.",4 May 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Potentially abusive men are using a UK scheme to host Ukrainian refugees - to contact vulnerable women, BBC News has learned. The men, some with a reported history of violence, message the women on Facebook groups specially set up to connect sponsors and hosts. Some refugees have also become homeless after relations with hosts broke down or because housing was not well vetted. But a UK government official said safeguards were in place. These included ""Home Office security and background checks on all sponsors, before visas are issued"", and at least one council visit to a sponsor's property. A charity head labelled the Homes for Ukraine scheme dangerous and said she was ""shocked by the absence of safeguarding checks"". In March, the government announced the scheme would allow anyone to host a family or individual, if they agreed to housing, criminal-records and other background checks. The system is slightly different in Wales and Scotland. Numerous Facebook groups were set up by local support networks and individuals, in response. They have become one of the main ways of connecting families and sponsors. Last month the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, raised concerns about the system, highlighting what it called ""the need for adequate safeguards and vetting measures to be in place against exploitation"". In EU countries, accommodation is organised primarily by national authorities and charities. There are also some private arrangements. While some British charities have tried to match applicants with potential hosts, many refugees are using the informal Facebook  groups.  There is evidence predatory males are joining these groups. One whistleblower with knowledge of the official scheme told the BBC in some local authorities, as many as 30% of all registered would-be sponsors are single men over 40 - the majority of them offering to host single women in their 20s and 30s. The government says it does not recognise those figures.  The BBC findings were ""deeply concerning and undermine the sponsorship programme"", said Robina Qureshi, chief executive of Positive Action in Housing. She described the scheme as ""dangerous"". Her organisation would never place a woman with a single man, and the government, she said, ""has created chaos, no risk checks, no due diligence"".  On a Facebook group set up to help match Ukrainian refugees, BBC News found one would-be sponsor who appears to live in a one-bedroom flat posting multiple offers to host young women.  Someone who knew him well claimed he had multiple convictions, including for burglary and affray. Police records indicate he was reported for allegedly carrying a crossbow and threatening a former partner, although no further action is believed to have been taken. Another man, in Manchester, had joined several Facebook groups and was offering a spare room to a string of young, single, Ukrainian women. He was also a member of a dating site called Single Ukrainian Women. Elsewhere on his timeline, he had written Islamophobic comments. It is not known whether either of these men was approved under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  Councils are meant to approve each property and complete Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks on all potential hosts they know about, including those who make contact via Facebook.  But the basic DBS checks are limited. Enhanced checks are requested only if there are children involved. A basic DBS check had raised no concerns about a man in his 50s offering to host a young Ukrainian woman, a source told BBC News  But when staff performed a more detailed check of social services records they found multiple complaints against him, including for domestic abuse and harassment. The UK government has come under pressure to speed up the settlement of refugees from Ukraine, with many complaining visa and host approvals have been unnecessarily slow. But it's thought that some councils are struggling with a lack of resources. The BBC found numerous posts on Facebook from Ukrainians who had reached the UK, but found their accommodation unsuitable. In such cases, often local charities step in to find emergency accommodation. One post from a volunteer helping new arrivals said: ""I was contacted by a young woman who had arrived on Saturday. She wanted to change hosts. I asked what the issue was and she sent me videos. The home wouldn't pass an inspection to rehome a dog."" The refugee involved, who does not want to be identified, told BBC News: ""She is a kind person but her house is a very big cluster of mess. There are many repairs needed. I couldn't go in the kitchen. I couldn't live here."" That refugee had received a visa under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, but the squalid condition of the property suggests no-one from the local council appeared to have checked the host's accommodation. She has since been rehoused. BBC News also learned of a Ukrainian who said she had been shown pictures of the bedrooms she and her two young children would be using. But on arrival, her entire family had been expected to sleep in one small reception room next to the kitchen, with no privacy.  The property had not been inspected. There had been no DBS checks. And she says the house was filled with Nazi memorabilia. ""The family... have Nazi pictures and Soviet symbols,"" she said. ""I don't feel safe."" She left and found a better host through social media but feels deeply scarred by the experience. ""I do not want my children to feel unsafe again and we feel unsafe,"" she said. ""I think we will go back to Germany."" While offering to support a refugee in her own home, Mira Kozlowska, who is Polish but lived in the UK for 21 years, has found herself helping to match others with suitable sponsors on social media. ""So many people are arriving and wanting to change sponsor,"" she told BBC News. ""It's a huge problem on the horizon."" ""Just now, I saw a post about how the sponsor wants the family to be out all day and not in the house.  ""Another girl was talking about how she didn't even have a door on her room and no privacy."" Another newly arrived refugee said, through an interpreter: ""When we arrive, there is no bed, just a mattress on the floor. ""The apartment is cold and when I put on the heater he shouts. ""There is no food in the kitchen and we have no money.""  Under the Homes For Ukraine scheme, hosts receive £350 per month from the government. And Ms Kozlowska said: ""I'm basically wondering how many people are doing it solely for the extra £350 - very scary."" The government rejects those criticisms and said ""attempts to exploit vulnerable people [were] despicable"".  ""The Homes for Ukraine scheme has safeguards in place, including Home Office security and background checks on all sponsors before visas are issued. Councils also conduct checks and must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor's property."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

It touched off a debate.,19 Jan 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A professor who was let go from her job after showing a class an artwork depicting the Prophet Muhammad has sued her former university, alleging religious discrimination and defamation.  The case has raised issues of religious tolerance and academic freedom.  The basic facts are not being disputed.  Erika Lopez Prater showed a classical work depicting the Prophet in an art history class at Hamline University in St Paul, Minnesota.  One of her students complained, and Prof Lopez Prater's contract was subsequently not renewed at the end of the term.  But the details of the case and the university's response have prompted a wave of debate, media attention and conflicting public statements, culminating in a lawsuit announced Tuesday.  The picture that was shown was an illustration of Muhammad receiving a revelation from the angel Gabriel - part of A Compendium of Chronicles by Rashid-al-Din, a 14th Century Islamic scholar. Before presenting it, she warned students that they could choose to opt out of the lesson, as many Muslims consider images of Muhammad to be un-Islamic, although there is a variety of views within Islam on the subject. Despite the warnings, Aram Wedatalla, a student and president of Hamline's Muslim student association, was upset by the class and after a conversation with the professor, complained to university authorities.  ""I'm like, 'This can't be real,'"" Ms Wedatalla later told the university's student newspaper. ""As a Muslim, and a black person, I don't feel like I belong, and I don't think I'll ever belong in a community where they don't value me as a member, and they don't show the same respect that I show them.""  An administrator then called the professor's actions ""Islamophobic"" - a label that the university later recanted - and her adjunct contract was not renewed. The controversy was mostly confined to academia until the New York Times published a story about the incident earlier this month.  A number of academics and groups including PEN America, an organisation that supports free expression, came out in support of Prof Lopez Prater.  Amna Khalid, a history professor at nearby Carleton College, wrote in the Chronicle of Higher Education that she was ""appalled"" by the university's decision and that ""it is the students who pay the highest price for such limits on academic freedom."" Prof Khalid, who is Muslim, told the BBC that a number of junior academics in the area have been in touch with her, expressing fear about what they can or can't say in the classroom. ""I don't want to vilify the student,"" she said. ""The problem is the institution."" Muslim groups were divided. While many civil rights groups came down on the side of the professor, Ms Wedatalla, the student, was initially supported by the Minnesota branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair).  But the group's national leaders took a different view. The national Cair organisation has said there was no evidence Prof Lopez Prater was acting with ""Islamophobic intent.""  Another advocacy group, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, came out with a full-throated defence of the professor. ""Dr Prater was trying to emphasise a key principle of religious literacy: religions are not monolithic in nature, but rather, internally diverse,"" the group said. The range of opinion highlights longstanding disagreements among Muslims over the sensitivity of depicting images of the Prophet. There is no explicit rule against such depictions in the Koran, instead the idea arises in the Hadiths - stories about the life and sayings of Muhammad gathered in the years after his death.  The prohibition is aimed at preventing idolatry - the worship of images in place of a god - and it is thought that classical depictions of Muhammad were only viewed by a select elite.  Sunni Muslims tend to be more strict in their interpretation of a ban than Shia Muslims. For instance, images of the Prophet are more common in Shia-majority Iran.   Prof Lopez Prater said she attempted to address the issue of divergent ideas about representation in religious art during the class. Controversies of this nature have tended to flare up not in art classes but around displays of cartoons or other drawings by people attempting to make political points or promote specific ideas about freedom of speech. The debate over the Hamline University incident has been mostly confined to the campus and media debates. But on occasion depictions have led to anger and even violence by Islamist extremists - perhaps most notably the attack against the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015. Having initially defended its decision and its criticism of the professor, the university backtracked on Tuesday, saying that its use of the word Islamophobic was ""flawed"" and pledging to hold discussions in the coming months about academic freedom, student care and religion. ""We strongly support academic freedom for all members of the Hamline community. We also believe that academic freedom and support for students can and should co-exist,"" officials said. But in her lawsuit, Prof Lopez Prater's lawyers said she had suffered significant damage to her career and reputation.  In her first public comments since the New York Times story, made to a YouTube roundtable discussion on faith, Prof Lopez Prater outlined her thinking in showing the image. ""I was teaching a world art class that was meant to be global in its perspective and think about diversity and global connections throughout history,"" she said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-53606190,Lockdown rules mean 'spirit of Eid has gone',"Restrictions will not end Eid celebrations despite plans being cancelled, a Muslim leader says.",1 Aug 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"New ""last-minute"" lockdown rules mean ""the spirit of Eid has gone"", a Muslim leader has said. Bradford Council of Mosques President Zulfi Karim said Muslims were angry at the timing of the announcement - but he said it would not end Eid celebrations despite many having to cancel plans.  The restrictions ban separate households in parts of northern England from meeting each other at home. The government said ""immediate action"" was needed due to a Covid-19 spike. The festival of Eid-Ul-Adha began on Thursday night and finishes on Monday. Mr Karim said: ""Imagine it's Christmas and you get this bombshell? ""Coming together of friends and family is actually a major part of the day of Eid - it's a sharing of food and gifts and coming together."" He added: ""It's a disappointment because we've bought toys for our grandkids. Our nieces and nephews were due to travel up from Birmingham, but they won't be coming now. ""We've cancelled all plans."" He said the celebrations would continue even though plans had been ""scuppered"" for many Muslims. Saima Afzal, a Blackburn councillor, criticised the way the government imposed the new rules. ""Why did the government leave it so late? Two hours before Eid, giving them little time to reconfigure,"" she said. ""The issue for me is the timing, it's really unfortunate. ""The lack of clarity for every community, not just Muslims, it's so last-minute."" Qari Asim, a senior Imam in Leeds, urged people to ""remain safe"" by celebrating at home. He said it was ""just as effective as being in larger groups"". ""BAME communities have been disproportionately affected during Covid-19 and therefore we need to take extra precautionary measures,"" he said. ""There has been a sense of deflation and disappointment as restrictions have been placed on Hajj for the first time in such a manner. But we are not alone. Other faith communities have had to make sacrifices. We hope these spiritual sacrifices will enable us all to defeat Covid-19 together."" He said he did not want the situation ""to give rise to Islamophobia, hateful narratives that some groups will try to exploit when Eid celebrations commence"" and asked for people to be respectful during the celebrations. Aisha Hussain, who lives in Bradford with her family, said they had spent ""a lot of hours"" on preparations to celebrate Eid-Ul-Adha with other relatives at their home and called the timing of No 10's announcement ""not fair"". The family learnt the news during a family party on Friday, forcing her aunt, who had planned to stay with them, to book a hotel to stay at. She told the BBC: ""It's very disappointing. I feel like we should have been prepared, some consideration should have been taken."" She said that while she understood that ""scientific facts are facts"", it was ""the government's responsibility to consider all of us"".  ""It's not just a small number of people, it's a large number of people that this is affecting."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock has denied the new restrictions, which affect people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire, are aimed at curtailing Eid celebrations. He said: ""My heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are. ""I'm very grateful to the local Muslim leaders, the imams in fact, across the country who've been working so hard to find a way to have Covid-secure celebrations.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44384790,Voices from the procession,Here are some of the voices of women taking part in the procession to celebrate 100 years of the vote.,10 Jun 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Processions are being held in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast and London to mark 100 years since the first British women won the right to vote.  Many of the 10,000 women expected to take part in Cardiff will be carrying homemade banners brandishing the hopes and concerns of women in the 21st Century. Participants will also wear a wrap in green, white or purple - the Suffragette colours - and be choreographed into bands to create a moving artwork as they travel through the streets.   Here are the voices of some of the women involved.  Sally Evans, of Newport, Gwent, works part-time for the South East Wales Racial Equality Council (SEWREC) and Newport's Riverfront Theatre and Arts Centre. She has helped make banners for both places. She said:  In SEWREC, I work with refugees and asylum seekers, many of them women who have faced challenging situations in their lives.  The women made a felt banner around the phrase ""And so I rise"" from a Maya Angelou poem. Some individuals also chose to make flags from their home countries and smaller banners in their own languages.  At the Riverfront, the women made a banner in the design of a mandala - the symbol of peace - and added words or phrases about the rights of women or empowerment of girls. For me personally, I feel it is important that Newport has a good showing in the procession.  So much history stems from here - not just the Chartist movement, which sought political rights for the working classes - but also the suffragette Lady Rhondda.  Newport has a tagline - the ""city of democracy"" - so it is very important we express this during the procession.  For me, it is such a good opportunity to think about how far women have come but also how far we have to go. In my work I see the challenges refugees and asylum seekers face - particularly in terms of social isolation and feeling displaced.  Many of the women we help have been deeply traumatised by what they have been through.  They need to feel part of a community, and safe within their city. Making these banners, and bringing women together in a bond of sisterhood, has helped achieve that.  Tasha Middleton, of Swansea, set up the first WI in Swansea city centre. She runs Sew Swansea and teaches textiles to diverse groups across the city. She said:  The design of the banner I was involved in was based on the work of Thalia Campbell - a leading banner maker of the Greenham Common protests in the eighties.  She made wonderful banners for nuclear disarmament and women's rights. We - myself and five other artists - wanted to re-imagine her work, making it relevant to modern women.  In the centre of our banner is the slogan ""The Red Dragon Inspires Action"" to show the power of Welsh women.  During our research, we discovered that at one point during the Greenham Common protests, 70,000 women were holding hands around the perimeter fence.  So we put hands around the edge of our banner too. We wanted to highlight all the ways in which women have lent a hand in history - helping during the miners' strikes and in the war effort.  I think this procession is fantastically important to highlight problems women still face.  A lot of the women who come to my sewing groups have low confidence, depression and anxiety. They can feel like they have no voice and that they are powerless. Women still face big issues - a large amount of sexism and sexual assault.  Bringing together women for any occasion is a passionate, powerful thing.  It is really important that we see our worth and what we can achieve, especially together. Sahar Al-Faifi, of Cardiff, is a molecular geneticist and community activist. She said:  Even before the procession was announced, I had been involved in centenary events to mark the first women getting the vote in Britain. I helped organise a screening of the film Suffragette and a discussion panel to consider the inequalities faced by women today.  When I was invited to take part in the procession, I wanted to make a banner to represent women of faith and colour.  I'm a scientist, so I gathered six Muslim artists and began designing. We came up with two main messages.  Firstly, we wanted to show the diversity of Muslim women. So often we are treated the same and painted with the same brush.  Secondly, there is a famous Islamic phrase, which says, ""Women are one half of society which gives birth to the other half, so it is as if they are the entire society."" This is why women need to be represented in all aspects of life.  Our banner has been digitally designed and printed, with some handwork added afterwards. It has suffragette colours, Arabic calligraphy spelling out ""freedom"" and Andalusian geometry.   I'm really excited about attending the procession. I feel it's going to be a massive medium to meet other women and share stories.  One hundred years ago, we gained the right to vote, but there are still so many inequalities, such as the gender pay gap.  Women's issues are universal issues. But speaking as a woman of faith and colour, racism and Islamophobia, especially in the workplace, affect me more.  The six artists who helped create the banner were Mariya Zaman, Shaimaa Osman, Nabila Ahmed, Emmi Khan, Jaffrin Khan and Husna Hussain."

Joyce McCarty faced a probe into claims she made in a text message of a ""Muslim plot"", which ousted her ally and former leader Nick Forbes. Ms McCarty, who was re-elected in May, will sit as an independent. Newcastle Labour Party says it condemns ""any act of hate crime"" and will ""call out any such behaviour when seen"". It said: ""Joyce McCarty has been found guilty through investigation of Islamophobia and is suspended from the Labour Party with immediate effect."" Ms McCarty declined to comment when contacted by the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Labour indicated that the 12-month suspension includes the four already served since her initial suspension in March. ""The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken,"" a spokesman added. In a text message seen by LDRS and first reported by JOE, Ms McCarty said she was aware of a ""specific Muslim plot"" organised by councillors in Newcastle's West End to remove the leader and get more black, Asian, and minority ethnic candidates selected. Despite being suspended in March, she remained on local election ballot papers for Labour in May and was re-elected in her Wingrove ward with an overwhelming majority. She was first elected to the city council in 1994 and was deputy leader from 2011 to 2021. The veteran councillor also sat on the local authority's cabinet with responsibilities for issues including support for refugees and asylum seekers. In February, Mr Forbes was defeated in the contest for his Arthur's Hill ward when Labour members voted by 13 to four in favour of Abdul Samad. Mr Forbes has alleged an ambush by left-wing members and claimed the contest was ""clearly manipulated"", but has since stepped away from city politics.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47633067,'No place' for Islamophobia in Tory party,"The party chairman responds to Islamophobia claims, saying swift action is taken on complaints.",20 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservative Party's complaints process is ""robust"", the party chairman has said, after a campaign group wrote to him about claims of Islamophobia. Hope Not Hate's Nick Lowles asked for Brandon Lewis to clarify his claim that all complaints of Islamophobia by party members had been dealt with. The party has not said how many investigations there are but 14 members have been suspended for Facebook posts. Mr Lewis said ""swift action"" had been taken when complaints were made. He said there was ""absolutely no place"" for anti-Muslim discrimination in the party. Mr Lowles wrote asking for clarification after Mr Lewis said in November 2018: ""We deal with complaints, none outstanding."" He said he took that statement to mean there were ""no complaints of Islamophobia outstanding"", but said: ""We now know that this is not true."" He said: ""Were you trying to mislead us, and via the statement, members of the public? ""Or are your systems and processes so broken that you did not know your statement was untrue when you made it?"" In his reply, Mr Lewis said: ""Anti-Muslim discrimination undermines society from within and there is absolutely no place for it in this country or in the Conservative Party. ""We take swift action when complaints are made to Conservative Party headquarters (CCHQ), immediately referring them for investigation. ""That was the case in November 2018, and continues to be the case today."" The Conservative Party has not said how many investigations it has conducted into allegations of Islamophobia against party members in the last year, or how many people have been suspended or thrown out. ""Investigations are rightly kept confidential and may vary in length, so we cannot and will not provide a running commentary on individual cases,"" Mr Lewis said. ""However, as you have no doubt seen, sanctions include suspensions and expulsions."" Earlier this month, former Conservative Party Chairman Baroness Warsi accused Prime Minister Theresa May of ""burying her head in the sand"" over Islamophobia in the party.  Shortly after her comments, the party confirmed 14 members had been suspended for Islamophobic Facebook posts and said ""decisive action"" would be taken against anyone making offensive remarks. Speaking to the BBC Asian Network, Baroness Warsi repeated her criticism of the party and said it was essential there was a ""clearing of the rot of Islamophobia which is festering like an underbelly in my party"". She claimed the problem was ""widespread"" in the party and had been ""going on for years"". ""The party does not take complaints seriously and only does so when there is a huge public outcry,"" she said. ""And that to me makes this problem within the party an institutional issue rather than an issue of a few bad apples."" ""Every time I try to get answers, there is a wall of bureaucracy behind which people are hiding,"" Baroness Warsi said. Only ""a full and independent inquiry"" would get to the bottom of the issue, she said."

Laurence Kahn said Labour was once the natural home for the Jewish community but claimed the leadership team had allowed anti-Semitism to ""flourish"". Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in the party. Jeremy Corbyn responded saying the party had taken ""rapid and effective"" action against anti-Semitism. Responding to the chief rabbi's comments, Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""As I have said many times... anti-Semitism is a stain on our society and I am completely clear it has no place in our party or in Wales."" Mr Kahn, chairman of the South Wales Jewish Representative Council, told BBC Wales: ""The Labour Party was at one time the natural home for the Jewish community.  ""But Jeremy Corbyn and his team have expelled the Jews by allowing anti-Semitism to flourish and spread throughout the Labour party and supporting Jew-baiters.  ""We support the chief rabbi in his statement condemning Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party and thank him for his courage and support."" Labour has been asked to respond to Mr Kahn's comments. Allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour have dogged the party for three years, leading to an investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party after being the subject of anti-Semitic abuse on social media. In Wales, the Labour assembly member for Cardiff Central Jenny Rathbone was criticised for making ""extremely offensive"" remarks about Jewish people last year.  She given a formal warning by her party, after a six-week suspension from the Labour group. The chief rabbi, who is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, said Labour's claim it had investigated all cases of anti-Semitism in its ranks was a ""mendacious fiction"". In an article for the Times, he asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the election. In response, Mr Corbyn insisted there was no place for anti-Semitism within Labour and those guilty of anti-Jewish racism had been ""brought to book"". He urged the Jewish community to ""engage"" with him. During the election campaign, Welsh Labour candidate Maria Carroll has had to explain her membership of a Facebook group offering help to party members facing anti-Semitism investigations, as well as other disciplinary matters. Ms Carroll said she left when it took ""an anti-Semitic conspiratorial direction"", but screenshots suggest she was adding comments to it last October. UK Labour said it had not found any anti-Semitic comments by her. Former Welsh Labour minister Alun Davies, assembly member for Blaenau Gwent, tweeted that Labour ""urgently [needs] to respond"" to the rabbi's comments and ""not dismiss this as a smear or pretend that [UK Labour] does not have a serious and fundamental problem"". On the same day, the Muslim Council of Britain accused the Conservative Party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia. Mr Davies added: ""The fact that two major faith groups have spoken out today tells us a lot about our politics and the nature of our political parties. ""It appears that both of our two main parties are infected by a prejudice that isn't being addressed."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56314173,Switzerland votes to ban face coverings in public,"The referendum, brought by a far-right party, could affect Muslim women who wear the burka or niqab.",8 Mar 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Switzerland has narrowly voted in favour of banning face coverings in public, including the burka or niqab worn by Muslim women. Official results showed the measure had passed by 51.2% to 48.8% in Sunday's referendum. The proposal was put forward by the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) which campaigned with slogans such as ""Stop extremism"". A leading Swiss Islamic group said it was ""a dark day"" for Muslims. ""Today's decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority,"" the Central Council of Muslims said in a statement, adding that it would challenge the decision in court. The Swiss government had argued against the ban saying it was not up to the state to dictate what women wear. According to research by the University of Lucerne (in German), almost no-one in Switzerland wears a burka and only around 30 women wear the niqab. About 5% of Switzerland's population of 8.6 million people are Muslim, most originating from Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo. Swiss people are given a direct say in their own affairs under the country's system of direct democracy. They are regularly invited to vote on various issues in national or regional referendums. It is not the first time Islam has figured in a Swiss referendum. In 2009 citizens went against government advice and voted to ban the building of minarets - a proposal also put forward by the SVP which said minarets were a sign of Islamisation. The proposal in Sunday's referendum did not mention Islam directly and was also aimed at stopping violent street protesters from wearing masks. However, the vote was widely referred to as ""the burka ban"". The latest proposal predated the coronavirus pandemic, which has meant all Swiss adults having to wear masks in many settings. Analysis by Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Geneva Was today's vote about all face coverings, from niqabs and burkas to the scarves rioters sometimes pull over their faces?  That's what the Yes campaigners from the Swiss People's Party insisted - but their posters and literature said otherwise, showing threatening looking women in black niqabs, and warning of Islamic extremism.  So does the result mean the Swiss are becoming more extreme? Are they Islamophobic?  Perhaps not. In the end, the ban only just squeaked through. In the past the Swiss People's Party has had much bigger majorities for its populist initiatives, often aimed at restricting asylum and immigration.  It successfully pushed through a ban on minarets in 2009 with a similar campaign to this one. But the debate around face coverings touched all sorts of different nerves. Many Swiss feminists view the burka and niqab as oppressive to women but they also oppose laws telling women what they can and cannot wear. When it came to voting they were torn. A regular answer from women asked whether they would support the ban was ""Jein"", a cross between ""Ja"" (yes) and ""Nein"" (no). Today's close vote in Switzerland was probably very much a ""Jein"" as well. Sanija Ameti, a member of Switzerland's Muslim community, told the BBC that the campaign - and the depiction of Muslim women in the posters - had been upsetting.  ""So many Muslims in Switzerland will feel insulted and not part of this society, and pushed into a corner where they don't belong. We don't look like these women in the pictures, we just don't,""  she said. However, others in the Muslim community supported the ban.  Imam Mustafa Memeti, from the city of Bern, told the BBC he thought the motivation behind the campaign was ""probably Islamophobic"". But he said he supported the ban anyway because it could help to emancipate Muslim women in Switzerland. Ahead of the vote, Walter Wobmann, chairman of the referendum committee and an SVP lawmaker, described Muslim face coverings as ""a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland"". ""In Switzerland our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms,"" he said. Amnesty International spoke out against the proposed ban, calling it ""a dangerous policy that violates women's rights, including to freedom of expression and religion"". The wearing of Islamic veils in public has been a controversial topic in other European countries. France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 while the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria and Bulgaria have put in place full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public."

The black and minority ethnic (BAME) members of the Black and Green Ambassadors programme discussed the issues at a virtual seminar on Monday. The new ambassadors - Asia Yousif, Olivia Sweeney and Roy Kareem - were introduced at the event. Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said the scheme will ""rebuild a better Bristol."" The ambassadors discussed topics including their connection to nature, and the importance of visibility and opportunities for diverse voices to become more involved in environmental projects.  Ms Sweeney told the BBC that sustainability is something she has always been passionate about.  ""I remember learning the three Rs, Reduce ReUse Recycle at school and ever since then it has been my thing,"" she explained. ""As I have grown up I have become increasingly aware of the social justice and behaviour change angle of the environmental movement.  ""Talking about race is hard in certain settings so being able to find my voice within an understanding and supportive network is a rare privilege."" Mr Kareem said he got involved because he ""hadn't seen many people that looked like me represented in the environmental sector or the sustainability movement"". He applauded the programme for dealing with the ""intersection of sustainability, culture and fairness"". The Black and Green Ambassadors scheme is an Ujima Radio CIC and Bristol Green Capital Partnership initiative launched after the city won the European Green Capital award in 2015. Marvin Rees said: ""Working together with all of Bristol - in all of its diversity - and empowering communities is at the heart of our strategy to tackle the climate and ecological emergencies."""

""Based on my experience and others, institutional racism and Islamophobia is rife."" The mayor replied: ""That is the world. It's a racially-unequal world. ""There is no institution in this country that is free of institutional racism - and there never has been because they reflect wider society. ""There was no shocking moment when the council was found to be institutionally racist. ""It's in our economy, it's in our politics. It is rife."" Mr Rees said the 2017 Runnymede Report found Bristol was the seventh-worst city in which to be born black. ""We are a city of inequalities. We have led the city to a point where it faces up to that,"" he said. He added 150 people from underrepresented groups had taken part in the council's Stepping Up programme, aimed at improving leadership diversity, of which a ""very significant number"" had achieved promotions. Mr Rees said another scheme was aimed at helping Somali women while the authority's work on domestic violence and youth violence targeted specific communities."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-47453711,Top Labour activist defends suspended MP,An MP called on Labour to look into the behaviour of a senior party figure that issued a defence of a suspended MP.,5 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has called on his party's general secretary to look into the behaviour of a senior Welsh party figure. Darren Williams issued a statement on behalf of the Welsh Labour Grassroots pro-Corbyn group defending suspended Labour MP Chris Williamson. The Derby North MP said Labour had been ""too-apologetic"" over anti-Semitism. A WLG spokesman said Mr Williams had not made a public statement on the matter. Mr Williams - a staunch supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford - emailed the statement to colleagues earlier this week. Derby North's Mr Williamson was suspended from the party, pending an investigation, after the remarks came to light. The MP said he regretted the comments. Welsh Labour Grassroots (WLG) - the Welsh version of the pro-Corbyn Momentum faction of Labour - said his comments were ""surely well within the scope of legitimate debate"" and that Mr Williamson's suspension was ""unfair and unnecessary"". Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock sought advice from Jennie Formby on whether there are grounds for disciplinary action against the group's secretary ""because political interference in political disputes is not allowed."" Welsh Government Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Labour Grassroots stance was ""staggering"". In the statement, the group said there was ""no justification for suspending Chris Williamson"". It called for his suspension ""to be ended and the whip restored"". Mr Williamson's comments had been misinterpreted by Labour politicians and the media, the WLG claimed. Rather than suggesting that Labour has apologised too readily to people in the Jewish community, WLG said Mr Williamson was ""seeking to argue that Labour politicians have often been too quick to accept questionable claims about the scale of the problem"". ""WLG remains implacably opposed to anti-Semitism, along with all other forms of racism, such as Islamophobia, and bigotry and prejudice of any kind,"" the statement said, saying the group offered ""unconditional solidarity to all those who encounter such hatred"". All cases of anti-Semitic abuse should continue to be dealt with through the party's procedures, WLG said. But the public discussion on the issue ""often militates against the kind of frank and serious discussion needed to develop effective solutions"", the statement added. In response, several Welsh Labour MPs expressed concerns over the role of Mr Williams, who is a representative on Labour's ruling body the National Executive Committee (NEC) as well as the Welsh Executive Committee (WEC).  The MPs said it was worrying that such a senior figure in the party is commentating on a live investigation, and think distributing material critical of an ongoing investigation is incompatible with his role on the NEC.  Senior Welsh Labour sources believe Darren Williams should consider his position on the NEC and WEC, with one suggesting he has abused his position on both bodies. It is understood that the statement was agreed by the 28 members of the WLG steering committee and he sent it to members in his role as the group secretary.  Labour's General Secretary Jennie Formby has warned constituency parties, the NEC and other Labour Party bodies that disciplinary cases against individuals are confidential and should not be discussed.  Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor, said the WLG statement would appear to contravene this instruction.  In response, a WLG spokesman said the statement had been a collective one which had been unanimously agreed by the steering committee, and said Mr Williams had made no public statement about the issue. Welsh Labour Grassroots supported Mark Drakeford's bid to become Welsh Labour leader in last year's leadership contest, while the group has consistently supported Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. A Welsh Labour spokesman said: ""As the First Minister of Wales and the leader of Welsh Labour Mark Drakeford has said on many occasions, there is no place for anti-Semitism in Welsh Labour or in Wales."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61717423,How Islamophobia is hurting India's foreign policy,This is not the first time India's ruling party has faced global opprobrium for alleged Islamophobia.,8 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In April 2020 allegations about a Muslim congregation sparking a cluster of Covid-19 cases in India quickly took an Islamophobic turn. Thousands of preachers from home and abroad had attended the gathering in Delhi by the Tablighi Jamaat, a near-100 year-old Islamic missionary movement. Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government called it a ""super-spreader event"".  Islamophobic memes and hashtags blaming the group for spreading the virus trended on social media, and news networks broadcast incendiary headlines such as ""Save the country from Corona jihad"". India charged nearly a thousand people who attended the congregation for flouting lockdown protocols. (Eight months later, courts had acquitted the last of the detained preachers, saying they had been ""maliciously prosecuted"" under directions from the government.)  Most of the preachers came from Indonesia, a trading partner of India. Not surprisingly, Indonesia expressed its disquiet over the issue at regional summit meetings. The country's lawmakers alleged that the controversy was being used to taint Muslims in Hindu-majority India. A former Indian diplomat said this was an example of ""externalisation"" of domestic issues. India's ongoing diplomatic firefighting over offensive comments made by two senior members of the BJP about the Prophet Muhammad is not the first time that Mr Modi's party or government has faced global censure for alleged Islamophobia.  Two years ago BJP MP Tejasvi Surya found himself in the centre of a storm when his 2015 tweet on Arab women went viral. Prominent businesspeople, lawyers and commentators in Dubai and Kuwait condemned his remarks. (Mr Surya deleted the tweet later.) In a 2018 public meeting, India's interior minister Amit Shah said that Bangladeshi citizens who had entered India illegally were ""infiltrators"" who had ""eaten our country like termites"".  This whipped up a storm in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, where a senior minister described the remark by India' second most powerful leader as ""unwanted and uninformed"". A Bangladeshi columnist wrote that Mr Shah ""had a long history of making hateful, insulting remarks about Bangladesh"". Over the past year, India has been hit by a tsunami of hate speech by saffron-robed right-wing Hindu radical leaders against the country's 200 million-strong Muslim community. Some of them have openly exhorted Hindus to take up arms and spoken about genocide of Muslims.  In the past, the right-wing has raised the bogey of so called ""love jihad"", a baseless conspiracy theory accusing Muslim men of converting Hindu women by marriage. Vigilante Hindu mobs have lynched suspected Muslim cow smugglers and demanded a boycott of businesses owned by the community.  On social media, female Muslim journalists and social workers have been ferociously trolled. Muslim women have been put up for sale in fake online auctions. Partisan news networks have added fuel to the fire by provoking participants into taking up extreme positions during shrill talk shows.    Mr Modi's government has either maintained a studied silence, been slow to respond or blamed ""fringe elements"" for such actions. All this appears to have emboldened ordinary Hindus to go online and tarnish Muslims. There have been consequences. In 2018, a popular Indian-origin chef working in a Dubai hotel was fired for posting an anti-Islamic tweet. When Indians living in Dubai began posting anti-Tablighi Jamaat tweets in 2020, a local businesswoman with links to the ruling royal family tweeted that ""anyone that is openly racist and discriminatory in the UAE will be fined and made to leave"".  This time too, unsurprisingly, the blowback has been fierce - 15 countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Qatar, have lodged protests with India. Making derogatory remarks against the Prophet was clearly ""crossing the red line"", says Talmiz Ahmad, a former Indian diplomat.  Mr Modi's government has been forced to suspend its spokesperson for her remarks. It is a reminder that ""targeting minorities with impunity, and hate speech with official sanction, will have repercussions for India's global reputation,"" notes Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a leading scholar.  In private, many BJP leaders believe that the outrage will soon die down, and it will be business as usual.  After all, India has an old and deep relationship with the Gulf countries. Some 8.5 million Indians work in the six Gulf countries belonging to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), more than double the number of Pakistanis, the next highest expatriate workforce.  Indians also form the largest expat community in each of these countries. They send home some $35bn every year in remittances that support 40 million family members at home, many in some of India's poorest states such as BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh. Trade between India and GCC countries is about $87bn. Iraq is the largest exporter of oil to India, followed by Saudi Arabia. More than 40% of India's natural gas comes from Qatar.  Prime Minister Modi himself has made relations with Gulf countries a priority. ""India has a significant relationship with West Asian countries in terms of energy security, employment of people as migrants and remittances that they send back,"" says Srinath Raghavan, a professor of history and international relations at the Ashoka University. But India cannot be complacent and take things for granted. ""It's a myopic way of looking at things,"" says Mr Ahmad, the former diplomat who is also author of a new book, West Asia at War. ""Indians have built a reputation as an apolitical, law-abiding and technically proficient people in these countries. If such offensive talk continues, employers in the Gulf could quietly start moving away from hiring Indians. Why would they risk hiring a potential zealot?"" This time Mr Modi's government, experts believe, appears to have reacted late, but resolutely. ""There seems to be an acknowledgement that if these things happen there can be consequences. Domestic and foreign politics are not insulated. The government has to make up its mind. Does it really want to get into rabble rousing?"" Prof Raghavan says."

Zarah Sultana, Labour MP for Coventry South, recounted her experiences during a debate on Islamophobia. In an emotional speech, she said she had been called a ""terrorist sympathiser"", and described being treated by some people ""as if I were an enemy of the country I was born in"". She added she had also been addressed in a letter as ""scum of the earth"". Speaking at Westminster Hall on Thursday, the 27-year-old said: ""Before being elected I was nervous about being a Muslim woman in the public eye. ""Growing up, I had seen the abuse prominent British Muslims were subjected to - I knew I wouldn't be in for an easy ride. ""And today I would like to say I was wrong to be worried when young Muslim girls ask me what it's like. ""I would like to say 'there is nothing to worry about', that they would face the same challenges as their non-Muslim friends and colleagues, but I cannot say that because in my short time in Parliament that is not my experience."" In a tweet sharing a video of her speech, she said it was not an easy one to give, but, she added: ""I can't be silent about Islamophobia"". MPs were debating a definition of Islamophobia created by a cross-party group of MPs. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims is calling on the government to adopt it.  During the debate, Ms Sultana told other members about a series of hate letters she had received since being elected in 2019. ""One person for example wrote to me, and I quote, 'Sultana, you and your Muslim mob are a real danger to humanity'. Another wrote I am a cancer everywhere I go and soon, they said, 'Europe will vomit you out'. ""A third called me a 'terrorist sympathiser and scum of the earth' and that is sanitised of their unparliamentary language."" The MP broke down in tears as she told the hall: ""I have discovered that to be a Muslim woman, to be outspoken and to be left wing is to be subjected to this barrage of hate. It is to be treated by some as if I were an enemy of the country I was born in. As if I don't belong."" Communities minister Eddie Hughes said: ""We remain committed to there being a robust and effective definition [of Islamophobia] and we will outline our steps to achieve this in due course.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43071847,Sarwar reveals blueprint to combat racism,The MSP has written to the first minister with proposals to tackle Islamophobia in Scotland.,15 Feb 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour MSP Anas Sarwar has written to the first minister outlining a series of proposals to tackle ""everyday racism and Islamophobia"" across Scotland.   Mr Sarwar wants the Scottish government to take action on black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) representation in the public sector workforce.   He also called for a review of the legal framework surrounding racist and Islamophobic abuse on social media. The Scottish government said it would consider the proposals. Mr Sarwar's letter to Nicola Sturgeon comes after he was allegedly subjected to racist comments by a Labour councillor. Mr Sarwar said the Labour group leader at South Lanarkshire Council told him he could not support Mr Sarwar's bid to lead Scottish Labour during last year's campaign to replace Kezia Dugdale as ""Scotland wouldn't vote for a brown Muslim Paki"". Scottish Labour later confirmed that councillor Davie McLachlan had been suspended by the party pending an investigation. Mr McLachlan has denied making the comments. Mr Sarwar recently launched a Cross Party Group (CPG) on tackling Islamophobia, supported by MSPs from every political party and over 50 organisations.   In his letter to Ms Sturgeon, he said his proposals were about ""challenging a culture that impacts on workplaces, colleges, university campuses and playgrounds across the country"". The Glasgow MSP called on the Scottish government to put in place a requirement for at least one BAME candidate - where at least one had applied - to be shortlisted for an interview for a public sector job. His proposals also include a regular audit of the diversity of Scotland's workforce, the ability for public sector workers to report abuse anonymously, and a programme of equality and diversity training to be rolled out across the public sector. On social media, Mr Sarwar called for a review ""to ensure that the correct legal framework exists for the police to take action and that the appropriate legal framework is then enforced appropriately and correctly"". And he said Police Scotland should also establish a formal relationship with the organisation Tell MAMA, which works on tackling anti-Muslim hatred.   Mr Sarwar, one of only four BAME MSPs to have sat at Holyrood, said: ""I want to repeat what I have said in every conversation, in every piece of communication, and in every media comment - this isn't about one individual or one party or organisation.   ""It's about challenging a culture that impacts on workplaces, colleges, university campuses and playgrounds across the country. ""What I have set out are steps that I believe the Scottish government should take to challenge the consequences of everyday racism and Islamophobia. ""This would demonstrate to the public how seriously we - as a parliament and a country - take this issue and help us to tackle this culture head-on.""   A Scottish government spokesman responded: ""As stated in parliament, the first minister is committed to working constructively with the proposed cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia. ""We will consider the points raised by Mr Sarwar when we receive the letter and reply to him in due course. ""Everyday racism, Islamophobia or any form of prejudice and bigotry is completely unacceptable, and it is wrong for MSPs, or anyone in our society, to be the subject or victim of it. ""We are resolved to do everything that it takes to ensure that Scotland is a place where there is zero tolerance of racism in any form."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50588623,Decisive moments in UK election campaign,Was this the week when it became clear Boris Johnson's Conservatives were likely to win the election?,30 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Was this the week people will look back on as when it became clear Boris Johnson and the Conservatives were likely to win the general election?  I say this because this election was always going to be decided by three big issues. So how does all the above fit in with what's been happening in the campaign these last few days?      To take the Leave versus Remain vote first, the key moment was the launch of the Conservative Party's manifesto - what it's promising if it wins the election.   With its familiar title ""Get Brexit Done"", it was an unashamed pitch to Leave voters furious the UK hasn't left the EU yet, and undoubtedly to other voters just sick of the whole Brexit stalemate/mess/morass.     Crucially for the Conservatives, as the rest of their manifesto was largely a steady-as-she-goes approach in all other policy areas, ""Get Brexit Done"" was just about the only message that stood out.   One imagines that is exactly what the party's campaign managers were hoping for - as, no doubt, was the relatively limited journalistic and political scrutiny there has since been as to exactly what ""Get Brexit Done"" means, and the extent to which relations with the EU are in fact likely to dominate UK politics for the foreseeable future.  But if the launch of the Conservative Party was a unifying moment for Leave voters, the opposite has been true for the forces of Remain and/or a second EU referendum.  Despite the endorsement of several high-profile Conservatives, the biggest out-and-out anti-Brexit party nationally, the Liberal Democrats, have really been struggling. Opinion polling suggests the party and its leader, Jo Swinson, are failing to gain traction, with many party insiders now thinking it was perhaps a massive mistake to make their main policy to just stop Brexit rather than to hold a second referendum.  Why? Because it looks rather undemocratic.   More broadly it's becoming clear the Conservatives are benefiting from the failure or unwillingness of all the political parties who either oppose Brexit altogether - or at least Mr Johnson's vision of it - to form some broad electoral pact against him.  Indeed, that may come to be the big story of this election for historians wondering why Remain politicians were unable to block Brexit, given that most polls now show opinion has shifted somewhat against leaving the EU. This election is less about who is the most popular leader and party and rather more about who is the least unpopular.   Opinion polls consistently suggest Jeremy Corbyn is the most unpopular leader of the Opposition since the question was first asked by pollsters in the 1970s. So an attack on the Labour leader from the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, accusing Mr Corbyn of allowing the poison of anti-Semitism to drip into the party was never going to help. Although it's true the Conservatives were also accused of racism this week - in their case Islamophobia - the allegations are seen, fairly or not, more as involving individual acts of crass behaviour rather than as being something somehow to do with the world view of their party or their leader.  Labour has also been struggling to make this election about the government's record rather than about Brexit or Mr Corbyn.    Polls do suggest the party has had some success in focusing voters' attention on the funding and quality of public services such as health and education. But just not enough.    The party's case has not been helped by Mr Corbyn's struggles to explain exactly how the government would fund its promised huge increase in the size of the state, without increasing taxes on ordinary people.  That emerged in the face of a hostile interviewer on the BBC, the well-known terror of politicians, Andrew Neil. It should be noted, in passing, that Mr Johnson has so far avoided the ordeal of being grilled by Mr Neil.  If, as the polls are suggesting, Mr Johnson is on his way to victory, it'll be thanks to a probably sometimes overlapping coalition of voters who either backed Leave in 2016 and/or think Mr Corbyn is dangerously leftwing.  Of course, it's worth remembering these are just polls, not real votes, and there are still two weeks to go. But as of now the Conservatives are surely the happiest of the main parties.    One last thought: this was supposed to be the Brexit election. In many ways, of course, it is in terms of which party can capitalise best on a deeply polarised country.  What the election hasn't really featured so far is a detailed discussion of either what Brexit will really look like or what would be the consequences of not going ahead with the UK leaving.  And that lack of debate may come back to haunt whoever ends up the winner.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54937713,Working from home 'could lead to more prejudice',"Offices and workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, a study suggests.",16 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Widespread working from home could lead to an increase in racism and prejudice, a new report warns. Workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, the England and Wales study for the Woolf Institute suggests.  Institute founder Ed Kessler said as more people work from home they risk going ""back into isolated silos"".  He called on ministers to focus on offices and workplaces as a ""vital"" area for improving community relations.  The study, conducted by polling company Survation for the Woolf Institute, which researches interfaith relations, surveyed 11,701 people.  Hadiya Masieh, who is Muslim, became close friends with Samuel Rosengard, an Orthodox Jew, after working together. Samuel said that while he had never had racist or Islamophobic views in the past, he may have had ""misconceptions"" about Muslim communities.  ""Meeting Hadiya has really helped clarify where my thinking can be askew,"" he said. Hadiya agreed saying that for her ""it was more of a political thing about Israel and Palestine"". But through their work they have become close friends. ""It was just a very natural relationship that we formed because we had the exact same agenda and passions,"" Hadiya said. ""We were both from very different backgrounds and the idea of Israel and Palestine was a hot topic. But we were able to discuss that in a way that was understanding of each other."" Samuel added: ""Before Covid we would have regular discussions about these kinds of issues. And also identifying common cultural traits between Jewish and Muslim communities, and areas of agreement and disagreement. ""Hadiya and I would often start off conversations just bumping into each other in the open plan office and then head off for a coffee. But that just doesn't happen. So that is a loss."" The study suggests that of those who work in shared offices, three-quarters (76%) - regardless of ethnicity - were in a setting that is ethnically diverse. However, it suggests that unemployed people are 37% more likely to only have friends from their own ethnic group. And it warns that without alternative settings to offices being set up, opportunities for social mixing between different religious and ethnic groups will be greatly reduced.  The study also examined people's opinions on diversity.  Its findings suggest that while nearly three-quarters of non-black or non-Asian respondents were comfortable with a close relative marrying a black or Asian person (74% and 70%), less than half (44%) said they were comfortable with the idea of a close relative marrying a Muslim person.  ""The word 'Muslim' appears to trigger more negative sentiment than the word 'Pakistani',"" the report says. This is ""despite the fact that 90% of people of British Pakistani heritage are Muslim"". The report also indicates that a majority of Muslims were themselves uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish or Sikh person, or someone of no religion. Around a third of Muslim respondents (38%) said they were uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Christian person. ""Muslims were both the primary target for 'uncomfortable' responses, but also the primary source,"" the report said. The study estimated the level of prejudice in each local authority across England and Wales. Researchers used a technique known as Multilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP), which looks at the survey responses and the demographics of each area. As well as being the most common target of negative attitudes by other faith groups, the report indicates Muslims are the group most likely to hold negative attitudes towards people of other religions. The study also suggests that diversity of friendships and colleagues varies significantly around the country. Even after accounting for factors such as the age, educational attainment and ethnic makeup of an area, people in north-east England are 150% more likely to have only British friends and 68% more likely to have only British colleagues, compared with people in London. The report says any apparent prejudice toward religion could be due to people feeling it is more acceptable to express negative sentiment towards religion than ethnicity. Religion remains ""a place where individuals are willing to express negative attitudes,"" the report says. ""Being Muslim, in particular, appears to remain a 'trigger' for prejudice, making religion a 'final frontier' for prejudice in England and Wales,"" the report's author Dr Julian Hargreaves added.  Methodology The survey was undertaken by Survation on behalf of the Woolf Institute. Survation spoke to a nationally representative sample of 11,701 adults across England and Wales between 29 March and 5 April 2019. The results indicating the proportion of people in each local authority who would be happy with a friend or close relative marrying someone from various backgrounds use a technique called Multilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP).  MRP projects the results of the survey onto local authorities based on the demography of the area. However, some estimates contain wide margins of error and statistically non-significant differences between local authorities."

The Berlin labour court judge ruled that the city-state's neutrality law for teachers, police and court officials was constitutional. Germany's 16 states have differing laws on headscarves in schools.   Three years ago Germany's constitutional court overturned a blanket ban on teachers wearing them. The federal court cited religious freedom, although civil servants across Germany are barred from covering their faces. The full face-veil is not allowed on a national level but the hijab is. Since the 2015 federal ruling each state has devised its own rules for Muslim teachers. The teacher in Berlin worked at the primary school for only a day before being assigned to a college where she was allowed to wear the headscarf. And the headscarf issue has become controversial in several German states. Police were called in recently when a head teacher at a primary school in the state of Hesse provoked a storm of abuse. She had written to parents telling them that wearing headscarves and other coverings was not allowed in the classroom. In Bremen, in the north west, teachers are allowed to wear headscarves, while in North Rhine-Westphalia the issue is decided on a case-by-case basis. The western state is proposing a ban on girls under 14 wearing headscarves in schools. The Berlin case has prompted widespread reaction in the German capital. Wednesday's ruling has been welcomed by the founder of Berlin's liberal mosque, Seyran Ates, who has campaigned to keep religious symbols out of schools. But Zeynep Cetin of the Network Against Discrimination and Islamophobia argued that the ruling was like a professional ban on the female teacher involved. Berlin Mayor Michael Müller has expressed his support for Berlin's neutrality law but a Green party politician said he wanted it changed. A Muslim teacher won a separate case in Berlin last year, when the same labour court ruled that a school had broken anti-discrimination laws by refusing her a job. The school had been unable to prove that the headscarf was a ""threat to peace at the school""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56211065,Who is the new Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar?,Anas Sarwar takes charge of Scottish Labour just 10 weeks before the next Scottish Parliament election.,27 Feb 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Anas Sarwar has been elected the new leader of Scottish Labour, replacing Richard Leonard who led the party for three years. The Glasgow MSP takes over less than three months before the next Holyrood elections.  Anas Sarwar became a member of the Scottish Labour party at the age of 16, but politics was already in his blood.  His dad, Mohammad Sarwar, was the UK's first ever Muslim MP and held the Glasgow Central seat for Labour between 1997 and 2010  - until his son Anas succeeded him.  Graduating from the University of Glasgow, Mr Sarwar worked as a dentist in Paisley for five years prior to becoming a MP. The 37-year-old was the Glasgow Central MP from 2010 to 2015 and was firmly in the Gordon Brown camp of New Labour.  Mr Sarwar took an active role in the pro-Union campaign leading up to the 2014 independence referendum, touring Scotland in a bus with No activists.  After the Glasgow Central seat was won by the SNP's Alison Thewliss in the 2015 general election, Mr Sarwar turned his attention to Holyrood and was elected a list MSP for Glasgow in 2016. As has often been the case for Scottish Labour in the last decade, the party faced a leadership election in 2017 after Kezia Dugdale quit and Mr Sarwar was pitted against Richard Leonard.  It was a rancorous campaign and Mr Sarwar faced criticism over his children attending a fee-paying school in Glasgow, with questions also raised over his family's cash-and-carry firm advertising jobs that paid less than the ""real"" living wage of £8.45 an hour. Mr Leonard won the race, becoming the first Scottish Labour leader to come from the left of the party.  The victory firmly reflected the party's membership make-up at the time; Mr Leonard was a firm supporter of the UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn whereas Mr Sarwar had signed a letter opposing Mr Corbyn's bid for re-election.  Mr Sarwar's most high profile role as an MSP was as Scottish Labour's health spokesman and he played a key role in the concern over safety issues at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital which led to a public inquiry.  Mr Sarwar will be the first non-white leader of a major political party in the UK and has spoken in the past about the racism he has experienced as a politician.  This included death threats made against his family.  Following his unsuccessful leadership bid in 2017, Mr Sarwar claimed that one councillor had told him Scotland would not vote for him because of his religion and the colour of his skin. A party investigation ultimately found there was no case to answer but Mr Sarwar was critical of Scottish Labour's complaints system which did not allow him to give evidence at the hearing. In 2018, Mr Sarwar established the Scottish Parliament's cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia.  In his pitch to party members, Mr Sarwar said he wanted to ""rebuild Scottish Labour, and then rebuild Scotland"". The Glasgow MSP has also taken a firm stance against the prospect of another independence referendum which he claims is not credible as the country rebuilds after Covid. The immediate concern for Mr Sarwar is May's Holyrood election where party strategists are hoping the new leader can lift them from third to second place in Scottish politics."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48588604,Is it OK for civil servants to wear religious symbols?,Quebecers weigh-in on the province's new secularism law that sets a dress code for federal employees.,18 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"For a decade, Quebec has been debating the issues of state secularism and reasonable accommodation in the Canadian province. Now it has just passed a new law that bars civil servants in positions of ""authority"" from wearing religious symbols at work. Bill 21 prevents judges, police officers, teachers and public servants holding some other positions from wearing symbols such as the kippah, turban, or hijab while at work. Like similar legislation introduced by previous Quebec governments in recent years to bolster state secularism, it has led to a fierce debate.  Advocates call it a reasonable step, one with broad support in the province.  Critics say it is discriminatory, will make it more difficult for religious minorities to integrate into Quebec society, and that it unfairly targets Muslim women.  The provincial government says it is a ""logical continuation of the Quiet Revolution"", a period in the 1960s when Quebec society rapidly embraced state secularism.  The Quebec provincial legislature passed the bill late on Sunday in a 73-35 vote.  Six people who have been vocal about Bill 21 and its impact spoke to the BBC.  Furheen Ahmed has been a teacher in Quebec for over a decade, and says she feels both frustrated and angry about new law.  Her job will be protected because of a grandfather clause included in Bill 21, but the fact that ""a teacher who teaches 10 feet away from me has more opportunity than I do simply because of what I'm wearing"" is unfair, she says.  ""How can somebody sit there and say that is not the textbook definition of discrimination?"" she asks.  Proponents of the bill have been careful to note that it doesn't target any specific religion, but many critics have argued that Muslim women are most likely to be affected.   Ms Ahmed says: ""I wish this was about all religious symbols in some way but I don't think it is"".  ""I don't think if hijabi Muslim women weren't out there doing their thing, being successful in this society - but perhaps looking a bit different, dressing  a bit differently - I don't think this ban would have even come into the conversation.""  She says she felt ""proud"" when both her school's school board and the Montreal city council came out in opposition to Bill 21.  Zahra Boukersi teaches French at a private elementary school in the Montreal region where she would be allowed to wear a hijab at work. But despite her faith, she has always rejected wearing any kind of Muslim head-covering.  She doesn't see the need to wear an outward sign of faith. ""Religion is intimate - it's personal,"" she says.  ""It's between God and me. That's how I see things.""  And she has never felt comfortable with what she believes a hijab symbolises.  ""There are women who wear it truly by choice. But even when they do, I see it as an act of submission,"" she says.    Ms Boukersi has spoken frequently in the media in Quebec about her support for secularism - a conviction born from her youth in Algeria.  A civil war from 1991 to 1999 pitted Islamists against the government in the North African nation, and the Muslim veil - which already had a complicated history in the country - became mandatory.  ""In the '80s, I was a student. I was in a mini-skirt. No one cared,  it was normal, it was normal to wear tight-fitting pants or a tight-fitting shirt,"" she says.  ""Ten years later, it was a catastrophe - a radical change.""  So Ms Boukersi sees Bill 21 as a fair place to ""draw a line"" against any potential similar religious influence in Canada.  As a child, Amrit Kaur would watch her parents patiently helping other children with their school work, which sparked her interest in becoming a teacher.   But now, the Quebec vice-president at the World Sikh Organisation is wondering whether there's a place for her in Quebec as a school teacher as she finishes her education degree. For her, wearing a turban is ""just such an integral part of my ethos and my being that I can't [disassociate] from it"".  She adds: ""My faith is not something I can leave at the door. That's virtually impossible."" She rejects the idea the legislation would help integrate immigrants into society. ""The people prevented from doing their jobs are the people most integrated [into Quebec society]. They're not immigrants who just moved to the country - they're people who've studied, who know the language, who give back.""  She says for the first time in her life she feels like she is ""looked at like someone who's causing trouble - and that feels really strange"". Freedom of expression and of religion is a basic human right, she insists. ""And that's being looked down on.""  Nadia el-Mabrouk, a professor of computer science, has become a prominent advocate for secularism in Quebec.  She supports Bill 21 - in particular the provision that would ban teachers in Quebec public schools from wearing any religious symbols - and would like to see the law extended to daycare workers in the province.  ""I'm not opposed to the veil,"" she tells the BBC. ""I'm talking about at school, at work, when in contact with children - at that point we say they need to be neutral."" She has compared asking teachers to remove religious symbols to when cartoon illustrators were asked to replace the constant cigarette dangling from comic strip cowboy Lucky Luke's mouth with a piece of straw. ""Lucky Luke wasn't actively pushing cigarettes - it's a drawing - but it was seen as influencing children,"" she explains.  She says a woman wearing a headscarf in a classroom is ""passive proselytism"".  ""I'm not saying it's indoctrination,"" she says. ""I'm not saying the Montrealers who are not Muslim are being indoctrinated. I'm saying it's a conditioning mainly for young Muslim students. It transmits the idea that a Muslim woman is veiled.""  She rejects the idea that the lengthy debate in the province over secularism is due to an undercurrent of Islamophobia or xenophobia - a frequent refrain in criticism of the issue.  She contends many Canadians - where the idea of multiculturalism is, in her word, ""sacred"" - misunderstand Quebec's desire for secularism.  ""It's a debate between two very different visions,"" she says.    Taran Singh, Quebec Sikh community representative and member of the Coalition Inclusion Quebec, has a question. ""What is the underlying evidence beneath this need?"" He sees Bill 21 as a ""divisive solution"" in need of a problem and says advocates have presented no direct evidence that public servants wearing religious symbols undermine the separation of Church and state.  ""Here there is a presumption that is being made - that wearing a symbol is somehow proselytising,"" he says.  Previously proposed legislative secularism solutions by former provincial governments in recent years has caused ""social cohesion"" to suffer in Quebec, he says.  ""Bill 21 clearly sends me the message that I am not an equal participant citizen in this society."" David Rand, a staunch secularist and atheist, calls Bill 21 ""a perfectly reasonable restriction"" similar to those already in place for public servants when it comes to showing partisan political preference while at work.   And he has little sympathy for those who argue they have been given a difficult decision between their faith and their career.  There is a certain kind of reserve that is necessary when working for the state, a certain kind of discretion, he says.  ""I would not wear a T-shirt that says 'God does not exist' if I went to work in the public service and I expect the same savoir vivre of a woman who wears a hijab or a man who wears a kippah, that they would remove it if they go to work in the public service."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43544115,Mother run over twice 'thought I had died',Zaynab Hussein's attacker hit her with a car twice in a hate crime that has left her bed-bound for six months.,27 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In September last year, a 21-year-old man deliberately drove his car at a woman, and, having knocked her to the ground, returned to do so again. Left with life-changing injuries, Zaynab Hussein, who is still recovering, has spoken to the BBC about life before and after this horrific incident. Mrs Hussein, a mother of nine, had just dropped her two youngest children off at school in Leicester when a car mounted the pavement and ploughed into her. The 47-year-old was thrown against a nearby wall and fell to the ground after hitting her head. As she lay helpless, her assailant performed a U-turn, and, noting that she was still alive, made a second attack. He mounted the pavement and drove over her with all four wheels.  Reliving the events of the day, Mrs Hussein said that when she was hit the first time she ""started feeling sick and dizzy"". ""Since no-one was helping me, I thought I would help myself. I tried to reach for my phone and as I was looking for it, he came back a second time."" The injuries sustained from the second blow have left her confined to bed for the past six months. She has been receiving specialist treatment to heal and mend the severe fractures to her pelvis, spine and limbs. ""My leg has been destroyed in a way that you wouldn't think is humanly possible. It is entirely crushed. I had skin and muscle tissue removed from [my thigh] to patch my leg together,"" she said.  ""My [right] forearm snapped in half and folded in on itself so that my fingers were touching my elbow crease."" Recalling the attack, Mrs Hussein remembers falling into unconsciousness and fearing her life was about to end. She struggles to hold back the tears: ""I was screaming 'help me, help me!' to people but no-one came - everyone just left me to it. ""When he hit me again, I could hear people saying 'oh my God, he is back'... They were just watching me. ""I became conscious again when I was in the ambulance. My son was called from college and he was with me. I heard him crying and that's what brought me back.  ""I thought I had died, so I wasn't expecting to become conscious again. I couldn't believe that I was alive."" The most difficult thing for Mrs Hussein to come to terms with is the loss of her independence.  The youngest of her children is aged just three. ""I was someone who was raising her children, who was working and did everything for herself."" Now, she struggles to look after herself. Simple tasks such as using the lavatory are a challenge when no-one is around to help. ""I can't raise [my leg]. When I'm forced to go to the toilet by myself, I drag my damaged leg on the floor behind me. Sometimes I can't get up at all, so they put a pot with a chair in the room for me."" All of the good memories from her adopted home city are now overshadowed by a darkness. Prior to the attack, Mrs Hussein had lived a quiet life with family, in Leicester.  After escaping violence and instability in Somalia, she had moved to the East Midlands city in 2003 and worked as a cleaner. ""I was happy and loved it here. I've experienced something that has made me forget all the good memories,"" she said. She finds it incomprehensible someone could harm a complete stranger for no reason. ""I didn't do anything to him. He didn't know me, I didn't know him. I wasn't crossing the road. He hit me because he felt like it. It was arrogance... there was no other motive than to hurt me. ""If someone hits you once - it is horrible, but you can tell yourself it might have been an accident or a mistake. For him to come back a second time... that was very hard."" Mrs Hussein's attack was treated as a hate crime and her assailant, Paul Moore, also from Leicester, was found guilty of attempted murder, at Nottingham Crown Court in February. Jurors also convicted him of the attempted grievous bodily harm of a 12-year-old Somali girl - he tried to drive at the schoolgirl, who was wearing a headscarf, moments after Mrs Hussein's attack. Moore, 21, has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years. At his trial, his half-brother, Lewis Welsh, said Moore had used racist terms to describe the attack afterwards. ""I don't think he knew what he was saying or doing. But he did tell me that he had ran over a 'Paki',"" he said. ""He tried to put it down to the London 7/7 bombings. He said he was proud of himself. He was rambling. He was doing the country a favour."" Mrs Hussein believes Moore's attack was inspired by Islamophobia. ""He was looking for [points to her headscarf]. If we're being honest, that's what he was after. There were lots of other people he could've hurt - it was a busy time - but he sought out people with headscarves."" Moving forward, she says the only thing that matters to her is that an attack like this should never happen again.  ""I don't want any other human being to experience what I have been through,"" she said. ""To cruelly make someone, who was healthy, disabled within a matter of minutes is something that I wouldn't want to happen to anyone - not even the person who hit me.  ""Everyone - no matter their race, religion or whatever they are - should be protected from this."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-41178811,'Sorry' daubed on racist attack house,An apparent apology is left on a house which had earlier been daubed with racist and Islamophobic graffiti.,7 Sep 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"""Sorry"" has been daubed over a house owned by Hindus after Islamophobic graffiti was painted over. The apology was sprayed in black paint on a whitewashed wall on the front of the property in Liverpool on 28 August. The previous day it was covered with racist and Islamophobic graffiti and several windows were broken, police investigating the hate crime said. The owners are Hindus of Sri Lankan heritage rather than Pakistani Muslims referenced in the abusive messages. The graffiti on the property in Stapleton Avenue, Speke, contained references to both Pakistani people and Islam. The owners are due to move in at the end of September following the completion of renovation work. Det Sgt Phil Atkinson said: ""The victims in this case have been supported... Our community policing officers will be giving the area close attention in the coming days and weeks. ""I would like to urge anyone out there who may have been a victim of hate crime to get in contact, so we can take action."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-41917784,'I thought Remembrance was a white event',Remembrance serves to honour those who gave their lives for Britain - but do all those who fought get the recognition they deserve?,12 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Remembrance serves as a way to honour those who gave their lives for Britain in conflict, including during the two World Wars, but do all those who fought get the recognition they deserve?  It was a conversation with a patient researching the Commonwealth contribution to World War One that sparked Dr Irfan Malik's interest in finding out about his ancestors.  ""Before I knew how much the Indians had contributed, growing up I thought it was very much a white war,"" he said. ""We weren't taught about the Indians in school."" It's a sentiment researchers at think tank British Future regularly come across in their efforts to highlight Muslims' participation in World War One and Two. Some 1.3 million Indian soldiers who fought in the WW1, of whom 400,000 were Muslim. In World War Two, about 2.5 million Indian soldiers took part, including 600,000 Muslims. ""There is a large appetite for this story to be told,"" said Sunder Khatwala, director of British Future. ""Remembrance is such an important occasion for the whole country that it is important we can all take part in it. ""It is part of the tapestry of the country's history."" Growing up in Nottingham, Dr Malik was well aware of Britain's annual Remembrance Day celebrations. But as a Muslim, he says he did not feel a personal connection to the events. However, his chance conversation led to three years researching his ancestry, and the discovery that both of his great-grandfathers were Indian Muslim soldiers who fought in WW1 alongside the British army. Dulmial village in Punjab - then part of British India - sent 460 of its men to fight in WW1, the largest number from any village in South Asia. They included both of Dr Malik's great-grandfathers, Subedar Mohammed Khan and Capt Ghulam Mohammad. It was a contribution, he says, that finally made him feel he had a connection to Remembrance. ""I used to see the Remembrance functions happening and I didn't feel I could take part in them fully,"" he said. ""But now I actually take part in fundraising for the Poppy Appeal and lay a wreath each year for Remembrance Day to remember my ancestors."" But, says Dr Malik, not enough has been done to highlight the contributions of Muslims to the British war efforts - so he decided to take matters into his own hands. ""When I realised there was very little information on this, I decided to become a teacher myself; now I go into schools and other organisations. ""I think it reduces hate between communities and helps community cohesion. If soldiers of different faiths could fight side by side 100 years ago, why can't we get on as community groups now?"" Dulmial had a long history of producing soldiers.  During WW1, when it was part of British India, the village, approximately 100 miles south of Islamabad in the Salt Range region, sent 460 men to fight in the British army. Nine from the village lost their lives.  Among those who fought were Dr Malik's great-grandfathers, Subedar Mohammed Khan, an Indian officer in an infantry regiment of the British Indian Army, and Captain Ghulam Mohammad. When war broke out in 1914, Subedar Khan and Capt Mohammad were already soldiers able and willing to join the conflict, both having signed up in the 1880s. While little is known about Capt Ghulam Mohammad, Subedar Khan served in the 33rd Punjab Regiment. He received medals for fighting in the Tochi campaign in the north-west frontier of what is now Pakistan. Subedar Khan retired in 1918 after about 40 years of service, returning to farm in Dulmial. Dr Malik's comments are echoed by Rabia Mirza, from Derby, who recently learnt her great-grandfather Mirza Firoz Din served with the Bombay Engineer Group, building trenches and bases for the British army. ""I was never interested in history at school. All I saw were white faces I couldn't relate to,"" she said. ""Now I know about my great-grandfather, I feel much more in touch with Remembrance. ""I think the media could certainly do more to educate people about the contributions of the Indian soldiers."" Ms Mirza cited Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk as an example of a missed opportunity to highlight the contribution of minorities to war efforts. Answering his critics, Nolan argued he approached the film as a ""pure survival story"" rather than focusing on the politics of the battle, and the film's historical consultant Joshua Levine told the BBC it was a work of fiction, adding ""it isn't a film's job to tell the full story of Dunkirk... and nor, in the time available, could it even try to do so"". But Ms Mirza said: ""I think this kind of thing hinders the diversifying of Remembrance and if media like this were to be more representative it would help."" While the lines might be blurred regarding historical representation in film-making, the Royal British Legion says diversity is now an ""integral part"" of its Remembrance work. It says it has worked with community organisations, such as the Punjab Heritage Association, to co-create content and encourage further communities to seek out their stories. It also plans to run a campaign celebrating diversity and dual heritage that challenges and changes perceptions of World War One, during the centenary of the 1918 Armistice. Recently, Birmingham's and Leicester's Central Mosques, along with Nottingham's Karimia Mosque, signed an Armed Forces Covenant to strengthen links with the military. Muslim communities are also beginning to hold their own Remembrance events for the first time.  Sultan Bahu Mosque in Birmingham held a two-hour ceremony last weekend to honour fallen Muslims. Organiser Hafiz Shauket Fazil said it was important to show the young pupils of the mosque that ""they have a stake in the country"". In attendance was Jahan Mahmood, from Birmingham, who was inspired to become a military historian by his uncle Mohammed Zabir, who served in the British 14th Army in Burma in World War Two.  Zabir was kidnapped by army recruiters from his school playground at the age of 16 and forced to serve in the war, his family having no knowledge of where he had gone.  He served in Burma from about 1942 in the medical corps, but also saw action fighting against the Japanese. He was captured by the Japanese and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner, suffering severe malnutrition and being beaten badly, while watching his comrades go through similar ordeals. When he returned home he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and rarely spoke about the war. ""If I as a young boy had been aware of his story, I would [have had answers] to the racism I suffered,"" said Mr Mahmood.  ""People said to me 'what have you ever done for this country?' and 'you should go back home'."" While he accepts there has been an increase in acknowledgement of the service of Muslims, he said better education would improve tolerance in Britain today. ""I still don't think there is enough information out there,"" he said. ""British historians on the whole and the media just haven't highlighted this contribution. ""Historians of ethnic background and activists have had to bring this to the nation's attention. ""If more had been done, maybe we would not be in the predicament we are in today as there might be less racism and Islamophobia across society."" Mr Khatwala concurs. ""Highlighting the Muslim contribution dispels the far-right conception that Islam is a foreign or alien thing that can't be British."""

King Felipe VI joined the demonstrators, alongside Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The king is the first Spanish sovereign to join a march since the monarchy was re-established in the 1970s. Emergency workers and shop staff who helped during the attack at Las Ramblas also took pride of place. The procession set off behind a banner bearing the slogan ""I'm not afraid"". Other placards denounced Islamophobia.  During the march, the king and prime minister walked the streets in front of hundreds of Catalan flags - the emblem for the autonomous region's long-running independence claim.    Some protesters whistled and shouted ""out"" at the king.  Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capital, is due to hold its unrecognised independence referendum in October.  Prime Minister Rajoy had encouraged ""everyone"" to take part to show that ""Catalonia and the rest of Spain [are] united against terror"". The 17 August attack - which saw a van deliberately driven into people on the Las Ramblas boulevard - was claimed by the Islamic State group. The driver later stabbed and killed a man while hijacking his vehicle. Hours later, a car attack in nearby Cambrils killed another woman.  A cell of 12 jihadists has been blamed for the attack. Eight are dead, while four have appeared in court in Madrid. King Felipe has reigned in Spain since 2014, when his father, King Juan Carlos I, abdicated.    Spain's monarchy was restored after the death of military dictator Francisco Franco in 1975."

Colin Barton, standing in Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, was expelled from the party for sharing Islamophobic memes. Robin Popley, in Charnwood, Leicestershire, was suspended after endorsing posts, one of which criticised the Duchess of Sussex. Neither have responded to requests for comment. Mr Barton's case was highlighted by BBC Radio Nottingham. Mr Barton, who was standing for Worksop South East in next week's borough council elections, shared various Facebook posts, one of which implied two headscarf-wearing women would be stoned for kissing. He also shared another meme which linked the sexual exploitation of white girls with Labour seeking ""Pakistani Muslim votes"". Mr Popley, who was standing as a candidate for Shepshed East, was suspended following a report in The Guardian newspaper.  It said he had ""liked"" a Facebook post that said Prince Harry's choice of wife was ""way off"", describing the duchess as ""a divorcee of mixed race 'actress' who has shown her ass on HBO"". The article also said Mr Popley had ""loved"" a post which said the appointment of Home Secretary Sajid Javid was ""aimed at securing the ethnic vote"" and a ""purely cynical tactic"" from Prime Minister Theresa May. A Conservative Party spokesperson confirmed Mr Barton had been expelled from the party and Mr Popley suspended. Ballot papers have already been printed which include both men as Conservative candidates and local returning officers said the deadline for withdrawals had passed.

It comes as schools have been urged to raise awareness of Islamophobia. The Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland is focusing on the harm caused by religious hate crime.  Muslim pupils have shared their experiences to help shape resources for the classroom. The most recent UK Government statistics showed a 29% rise in hate crimes in England and Wales. Religious hate crime increased by 35% between 2016-17, during a time when a charity in Wales said teachers from 13 of the 22 local authorities reported incidents of racism in the last year. Ms Holland said: ""I've spoken to young Muslims from across Wales who've told me that they're often scared in their communities, that they've directly experienced abuse at school, and that they're tired of the way Islam is often portrayed by the media, and the effect this has on the views of their non-Muslim peers."" Young Muslims' views have helped shape the new resources for teachers to use in the classroom. Videos include contributions of pupils from Cathays High School in Cardiff where around three quarters are from minority ethnic backgrounds.  Shutha, 15, said has had ""a few racial comments"" directed at her. ""Stuff like 'go back to your country', stuff about what's on my head without knowing necessarily what it's for,"" she said. ""I used to think it was people being horrible but as I grew older I realised that people aren't really educated on the topic of Islam, the topic of what we do in our religion, why we do it and why we dress a certain way, why our beliefs are a certain way."" She added: ""And I feel like if people get more educated on that, there'll be less Islamophobia, there'll be just less hate in general."" Though Azeem, 16, has not had direct experience of Islamophobia, some of his friends have.  ""On the bus people wouldn't want to sit next to them because they're wearing headscarves,"" he said. Ibby, 17, considers himself lucky to attend a multi-cultural school which he describes as ""a cohesive community"". But outside the school gates friends have been ""verbally assaulted"" by people on the street, he said. ""Early intervention is what's needed before the problem becomes a serious problem"", he said. ""Teaching young people about religion, about culture is hugely important"". Lesson plans produced for the project have been trialled in schools in Swansea, Cardiff and Neath. Jo Bamsey, a religious education teacher at Pentrehafod Comprehensive, Swansea, said they had received positive feedback from pupils. ""The three lessons were well thought-out and allowed for honest discussion in an open and reflective environment,"" she said. Fiona Thomas, a teacher at Dwr-y-Felin Comprehensive in Neath, added: ""The resources conveyed the message clearly to our students that as humans we are all the same, enjoying playing football, listening to music and playing on the Xbox."" Anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card said that teachers in 16 of Wales' 22 local authorities had contacted them for support for help dealing with incidents of racism, or for help in delivering workshops. Sunil Patel, campaign manager, said: ""The number of inquiries our charity has received has trebled compared to the same period last year."" Ms Holland said she recognised the challenge faced by teachers in tackling sensitive issues. ""We know teachers can sometimes feel unsure and nervous about delivering lessons on topics like this, and I hope this resource gives teachers the necessary guidance and support."" she said."

Kyle Pedley said he was ""aghast"" at comments made during a local election selection meeting in October. The chairman of Stourbridge Conservative Association denies any Islamophobia in his party. Conservative central office says any claims of discrimination are always investigated thoroughly. Mr Pedley has been a deputy chairman since August 2019 and he participated in a selection for candidates for the local council. He says in his first meeting as an officer they interviewed a candidate for selection for the local council.  ""As soon as his two-minute pitch ended, he was faced with a barrage of questioning which was factored around one thing and one thing alone, and that was his religion and his race. ""It was 'Are you really a Muslim? Do you pray five times a day? How many times a year do you go to the mosque?'"" Mr Pedley added: ""When he went out of the room the first topic of conversation was not about his merit, it was along the lines of 'do we need an Asian?'""   Mr Pedley says he sent two complaints to Conservative central office, the first three weeks ago, including one to the Conservative chairman's office. Other than an acknowledgement he says the party has not followed up with an investigation. The chairman of the Stourbridge Conservative Association said there was no Islamophobia in his association and was ""mystified"" at Mr Pedley's resignation from the party. He said he did not remember or recall the details of the selection meeting as described by Mr Pedley. Politics Live has spoken to another member of the Stourbridge Association who is a Muslim, and he said he never witnessed any discrimination within the party. Baroness Warsi, the former co-chair of the Conservatives who has pushed for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the party, said she was ""shocked"" but ""not surprised"" by the allegations.  ""This is really a reflection of the kind of things that I've been hearing now over four years, happening in associations up and down the country.""  A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. Serious allegations such as these are always investigated thoroughly, which is testament to the seriousness with which we take such issues. ""Our complaints process is rightly a confidential one and there are a wide range of sanctions including suspension and expulsion which are applied on a case-by-case basis."" Update 27 November 2019: Since this article was first published the Conservative Party has told the BBC that a formal investigation was launched in response to Mr Pedley's complaint, and that they wrote to him three days later to confirm this."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-48356351,How disinformation spread in Brexit Facebook groups,Closed online groups were targeted by disinformation in run-up to European elections.,30 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Social media groups which encouraged support for UK political parties in the build up to the European elections were targets for fake news and polarising content with links to the far right, a Newsnight investigation has found. Closed Facebook groups, whose contents can only be viewed by approved members, saw users engage with and share content linked to far-right and potentially fake accounts, including some apparently US and Russian-oriented profiles.  While disinformation was more prevalent in groups promoting the Brexit Party, it was also being shared, to a lesser extent, in pro-Remain groups. The groups were not officially associated with any party.  Posts in the groups often contained abusive language aimed at MPs. The Brexit party told Newsnight: ""We were not aware of this and we cannot spend all of our time monitoring Facebook.  ""If any Facebook group is using our logo or infringing our copyright, without our permission, and is behaving suspiciously in any way, we act to close it down as we have done before and will do again."" Newsnight worked with William Dance, a linguistics and fake news expert from Lancaster University, to track disinformation campaigns. The content, history and administrators of the 30 largest and most active closed pro- and anti-Brexit Facebook groups were analysed. The administrators of closed groups often vet new members using questions to ensure they hold views compatible with the rest of the group.  New Facebook rules, introduced after accusations the company allowed interference in elections across the world, have forced public pages to be more transparent about who runs them and who advertises on them. But as closed groups are private, they are less likely to be flagged up to Facebook moderators for rules violations. Newsnight's investigation found that the largest group, called ""Brexit Party - supporters"" (it had no official link to the party) was the latest incarnation of a page setup in January 2017 under the name ""Libertarians and Chartists for Trump"". It has been renamed several times to support different causes, operating as ""#MBGA News >> Make Britain Great Again News"" and then ""South West England #FreeTommy"" - a reference to former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson - before taking on its most recent Brexit-themed name. The group was run by a Facebook profile page called ""Make Britain Great Again"", containing links to the website MBGAnews.com, which in turn redirects to another site, RedPillFactory.uk.  Red Pill Factory is registered in California and has been described by critics as offering a mix of partisan and false stories on subjects including the yellow vest movement, immigration, and Brexit.  Since Newsnight contacted the site, it has removed some content, including a story claiming German authorities ordered prostitutes to have sex with migrants. There is no evidence to support that the story was true. On Facebook, the ""Make Britain Great Again"" profile also shared fact-based stories from Red Pill Factory including one headlined ""BANNED: Tommy Robinson Page DELETED By Facebook.""  Media Bias/Fact Check, an independent website which rates the reliability of online content, describes Red Pill Factory as: ""extreme bias, consistent promotion of propaganda/conspiracies, poor or no sourcing to credible information, a complete lack of transparency and/or is fake news."" In response to our investigation, a writer for Red Pill Factory said that they would ""deem the notion of 'fake news' to be very subjective.  ""[We] dispute claims that the site peddled fake news, but actually articles were often fact-checked,"" the writer said. They added: ""Persons trolling the website with fake articles or presenting inaccurate, anti-Islamic (as opposed to anti-terrorist), or racist articles were barred from submitting future articles"" and said an editor was once dismissed for violating those rules. RedPillFactory has run articles heavily critical of the yellow vests movement as of late - one contributor was sacked for promoting yellow vests."" ""Brexit Party - supporters"" was shut down before the European elections, after a Sunday Times investigation into its administrators. In response to the Sunday Times story, The Brexit Party said it would formally approach Facebook to demand that the groups were taken down: ""We have no interest in these people at all, absolutely not."" Meanwhile, other closed groups continued to spread links to disinformation.  ""We Support Brexit"" closed group, which has around 3,900 members, included a number of posts from a user who appears to be Russian. The user repeatedly shared links from News Front, a website that the EU's anti-disinformation East Stratcom Task Force has identified as a source of pro-Kremlin fake news.  The picture associated with the user's profile appears to be of a former Russian Miss World and in all likelihood does not show the person behind the account. The profile is entirely in Russian, and the cover photo features Vladimir Putin.  Newsnight attempted to contact the user, but they did not respond. The user account and the News Front site formed part of a wider pattern of disinformation or polarising content with foreign links being shared in pro-Brexit closed Facebook groups, which was then shared and engaged with by other users.  This includes content from Infowars, a conspiracy site, and NewsPunch, which was previously known as YourNewsWire, a site which was also criticised by the EU's East Stratcom Task Force for ""publishing fake media stories that support Russia's policies.""  NewsPunch editor Sean Adl-Tabatabai told Newsnight: ""We are a news organization that publishes information from a variety of different sources on a wide variety of subjects. Sometimes this includes the BBC itself. To call us 'fake news' is libellous and damaging to our reputation.  ""We have no control over members of the public who choose to share our content on any platform, including Facebook. At the moment, it is still their prerogative to freely read and share things as long as they are not breaking the law."" The BBC has also tried to contact the people who run News Front, but has not received a response. Posts from a website called Brexit Betrayal News were also shared across a number of closed groups by a Facebook user who appears to be in the US. Mr Dance estimates that the posts targeted 50,000 people who belong to groups such as ""Brexit the Protest"" and ""We Are The 17.4 Million"". As well as listing Brexit Party MEPs, the site shared links to the QAnon conspiracy which was popularised by fringe and alt-right groups in the US.  The Brexit Betrayal News domain was registered in Chicago in April 2019. When contacted through the site, the user confirmed that the website was hosted in the US, but refused to confirm whether they are from the US.  Disinformation appeared less prevalent in the pro-Remain closed groups Newsnight analysed. Last year, groups with names such as ""Say NO to ""Brexit""!"" and ""Labour Against Brexit"" occasionally included links to polarising news stories, some of which came from sites hosting false stories.  In other large closed groups, including ""Remain Together"" and ""UK Citizens - Say Yes 2 Europe - Remain in the EU"", links led almost exclusively to mainstream news networks. In April, the Mueller report on potential interference in the 2016 US elections  flagged Facebook groups as a breeding ground for foreign interference. According to the report, as early as 2014 Russian users were setting up small Facebook groups designed to attract US audiences and look as if they were controlled by American activists.  Mr Dance explained: ""These groups may be set up and operated with honest intentions but then fall victim to people intentionally sharing disinformation and misleading news. ""Facebook groups can be manipulated to foment political resentment and to stoke social tensions. In the age of social media, it is simple and low-cost to reach tens of thousands of people with biased and false news,"" he said. Disinformation is not the only type of controversial content identified by Newsnight's investigation. Abuse ""aimed at politicians from all parties"" was also prevalent, said Mr Dance. The ""Brexit Party Supporters group"" (a different group to the one which was shut down) has more than 6,000 members and included language such as ""HANG THEM HIGH"" referring to Change UK candidates.  Extremely offensive language was also directed at former prime minister and Remain campaigner Gordon Brown and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. In pro-Remain groups, similar language could be found, albeit less frequently. In ""No To Brexit!"" one user referred to Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe, saying: ""Hanging is too good for Quitlings"". Another user, referring to Theresa May, wrote: ""she is barking mad and needs putting down"". Facebook told Newsnight it could not comment on individual groups. In a statement, the company said: ""In the run-up to the European elections we made major investments to help protect the integrity of the elections and prevent abuse of our platform.  ""Across the EU, we have removed a number of fake and duplicate accounts that were violating our authenticity policies, as well as pages for name change and other violations. We also have a continuous programme that identifies and removes coordinated inauthentic behaviour by anyone across our platform.""  Newsnight asked for comment from the administrators of the various groups which hosted posts spreading disinformation and abusive language.  One administrator of ""Labour Against Brexit"" said: ""We regularly remove posts which do not fall within our guidelines (and often the posters with them). We have very occasionally identified individuals who seem to be infiltrators or trolls, and removed them. And our members are quite assiduous in reporting dodgy content."" An administrator of ""Brexit The Protest"" said that the group ""moderates everything"" and that he had ""not seen any disinformation being shared on the group."" And an administrator for ""We are the 17.4 Million"" said: ""We are a small team of volunteer administrators. All initial posts must be approved by admins. At this stage we regularly weed out extremism, hate speech and profanity and ban people from the group.  ""We lack the resources to police proactively comments underneath posts but do take action when a member reports something unsavoury.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61956108,Indian police arrest journalist over tweets,Mohammed Zubair of Alt News has reportedly been accused of insulting religious beliefs on Twitter.,28 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Police in India have arrested the co-founder of a fact-checking website who has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Mohammed Zubair of AltNews has been accused of insulting Hindu religious beliefs on Twitter, a network of media organisations said. Opposition leaders and journalists have condemned the arrest.  They said it was a clear attempt by the Hindu-nationalist government to clamp down on those who expose hate speech.  Mr Zubair recently highlighted comments by a spokesperson of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) allegedly insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a television debate. His tweet was widely shared and led to several Muslim countries lodging strong protests with India. In recent weeks, Hindu nationalists have drawn attention to past comments made by Mr Zubair and demanded that he be prosecuted for hurting their religious feelings. A prominent Indian journalist, Mohammad Zubair started the fact-checking website AltNews with former engineer Pratik Sinha in 2017.  The website quickly rose to prominence for its diligent work in combating misinformation and fake news in the country. Fact checks from AltNews are frequently shared by Mr Zubair on Twitter where he has more than half a million followers. He monitors hate speech and his Twitter posts on comments made by supporters of the BJP have invited intense backlash. Last week, he posted an e-mail from the microblogging site telling him that his tweet criticising Islamophobic comments by the leader of a Hindu group was being ""withheld"" - which means it's no longer visible in India - on request from the law enforcement authorities. The letter added that this was ""in order to comply with Twitter's obligations under India's local laws"". He later received another e-mail saying that two of his other tweets - about provocative comments made by a Hindu priest threatening to kidnap and rape Muslim women - were also being ""withheld in India"" under the country's IT laws. On Monday, Mr Zubair was detained over a complaint from a Twitter account that said he insulted Hindus in a 2018 post commenting on the renaming of a hotel after the Hindu monkey god Hanuman, the ANI news agency reported, citing senior Delhi police officials. A statement by the police later said that the tweet had been amplified by Mr Zubair's Twitter followers and ""created a series of debates/hate mongering"". Police claim their investigation found Mr Zubair's conduct ""questionable"" which ""warranted his custodial interrogation"". Pratik Sinha, also a co-founder of AltNews, who accompanied him to the police, said neither he nor Mr Zubair's lawyers were provided with a copy of the complaint on which the arrest was made. They were also initially not told where he was being taken after being detained.  Mr Zubair was produced before a local magistrate late on Monday night who granted the police one day's custody. Following this, he was allowed to meet his lawyer. A court on Tuesday remanded him in custody for a further four days. Many journalists and activists have been demanding his immediate release. ""Zubair who routinely busted fake news, exposed the hate machinery in India has just been arrested,"" said Rana Ayyub, a Muslim journalist. ""The country is punishing those who reported, documented the decline."" Opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: ""Every person exposing BJP's hate, bigotry and lies is a threat to them. Arresting one voice of truth will only give rise to a thousand more."" Police said at the centre of the arrest was a 2018 tweet by Mr Zubair in which he had shared a photo of a hotel signboard, modified from 'Honeymoon Hotel' to 'Hanuman Hotel'. The photo was actually a screengrab from a 1983 Bollywood comedy by acclaimed director Hrishikesh Mukherjee. But a Twitter account called Hanuman Bhakt, meaning worshipper of the monkey god Hanuman, recently shared the four-year-old tweet and called it a ""direct insult"" to Hindus. The account also tagged the Delhi police, asking them to take ""immediate action"" against Mr Zubair. The anonymous account, created last October, had just one follower until Tuesday morning. It has since risen rapidly to cross 1,500 followers."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50830833,Tories appoint discrimination inquiry chief,A psychiatry professor will examine Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party.,18 Dec 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservatives have appointed a psychiatry professor to lead its inquiry into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party.  The party said Prof Swaran Singh would look at how it handles complaints, and tries to clamp down on discrimination. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously pledged the investigation would get underway before Christmas.  Tory party chairman James Cleverly said it would help the party ""stamp out unacceptable abuse"". Prof Singh is a former commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), the watchdog currently investigating anti-Semitism allegations within Labour.  He has been a professor in Social and Community Psychiatry at the University of Warwick since 2006.  Announcing the appointment, Mr Cleverly said: ""The Conservative Party has always worked to act swiftly when allegations have been put to us"".  ""There are a wide range of sanctions to challenge and change behaviour,"" he added.  ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind"".  The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), an umbrella group of various UK Muslim bodies, has accused the party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia, and said it had a ""blind spot for this type of racism"". The group has previously called for Islamophobia allegations in the Conservative Party to be investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. Mr Johnson has defended the party's processes for handling complaints, saying members guilty of Islamophobia ""are out first bounce"". However he has faced accusations of Islamophobia himself, after writing in a newspaper column last year that Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-45570907,'Anti-Islamic taunts' as car hits crowd,"Police say the incident at a Cricklewood Muslim prayer centre is being treated as a ""racist hate crime"".",19 Sep 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Three men were hurt when a car struck several people outside a north London Islamic centre. Witnesses described hearing the driver ""shouting anti-Islamic taunts"" at the Muslim prayer centre in Cricklewood. The Met Police said it was being dealt with as an Islamophobic hate crime but is not thought to be terrorist-related. The driver of the car failed to stop and two men were taken to hospital following the incident at about 00:35 BST. It happened at the Al-majlis Al-Hussaini centre at the junction of Oxgate Lane and Edgware Road. One witness said the driver ""was trying to kill people"". Ali Salman said he was ""milliseconds"" from injury as the car swerved into groups of people leaving the Islamic centre following a lecture. ""This was someone who was trying to take out as many people as possible. He swerved left right trying to hit people,"" he added. A man in his 50s remains in hospital and is being treated for a serious leg injury. Two other men, both in their 20s, suffered minor injuries. Before the attack a group of three men and a woman in their mid 20s were asked to leave a private car park at the premises by volunteer stewards, police said. The group had allegedly been behaving anti-socially, drinking and using drugs. Speaking at the scene, Ch Supt Simon Rose said when the stewards challenged the group, ""they were subjected to a tirade of Islamophobic and racist abuse"". The car then drove near the mosque and the group were involved in a confrontation with a large number of people outside. Their car was then reportedly damaged by some of the crowd before it sped off, colliding with three people. Ch Supt Rose said it was ""extremely fortunate"" that no-one was killed. ""It is being dealt with as an Islamophobic hate crime and it is being dealt with as a racist hate crime,"" he added. ""It is not at this time being dealt with as a counter-terrorism incident, as always subject to continuous review."" A spokesman for the Hussaini Association, which had been holding a series of lectures at the Islamic centre, said: ""We are in deep shock at such an attack taking place on our community. ""We remain proud to live in a diverse and tolerant society and as such we remain unintimidated."" Dawn Butler, MP for Brent Central, tweeted: ""This is a very sad and tragic event. There is no room for hate. ""Brent is the most diverse constituency in the UK and our diversity is our strength."" The Met has urged anyone with information to come forward and said inquiries are under way to trace the car. Det Sgt Kelly Schonhage said: ""Extra neighbourhood police patrols have been stepped up in the area and officers will be on hand to speak with those in the local community."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40328536,More armed policing around mosques,Police said patrols would be stepped up around Scotland's 84 mosques after the Finsbury Park attack.,20 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"High-visibility police patrols are to be stepped up near Scotland's mosques after the Finsbury Park attack in north London.  Police Scotland said it had no intelligence about a specific threat, but said armed response vehicles would carry out patrols. A man died and 10 people were injured after a man drove a van into worshippers near Finsbury Park Mosque. Eight people were taken to hospital after the terror attack. A 48-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Police said all the victims of the attack, which took place outside Muslim Welfare House, were Muslim. Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable Nelson Telfer said the force would be mounting additional patrols in the general vicinity of Scotland's 84 mosques and that could include armed response vehicles. He said hate crimes were being monitored on a daily basis, but had shown no increase.  He added the force would not tolerate any attempt by any group to target members of any community in Scotland. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon chaired a Scottish government resilience meeting following the attack.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney, Justice Secretary Michael Matheson, Communities Secretary Angela Constance, senior Police Scotland representatives and Scottish government officials took part in the meeting. Ms Sturgeon said: ""This was a horrific attack and my thoughts go out to everyone who has been affected. I know that everyone will be saddened to see yet another terrorist attack. ""I convened a resilience meeting this afternoon to ensure that we are closely monitoring the situation. While there is no intelligence of any specific threat to Scotland, Police Scotland remain vigilant and visible across communities to provide reassurance to members of the public. ""Muslim communities will understandably be anxious just now and it is in these moments that we must come together as a country and unite against extremism and hate from wherever it comes."" Speaking earlier on the John Beattie programme on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Telfer said: ""We don't have any specific information that Scotland is at risk of attack in any of our communities. I would ask everyone to go about their business as normal, remain alert but not alarmed. ""We have 84 mosques across Scotland and we have linked in with the Muslim Council for Scotland and it will be within the general vicinity of those sites that people will see increased patrols.  ""What they will see is high-visibility policing and that may well include armed response vehicles and they may well see armed police officers. ""People should not be alarmed that, they should be reassured by their presence."" He added: ""We have put our increased presence in place from the early hours of this morning and we will monitor that on a daily basis and our response will continue to be proportionate to the situation faced UK-wide."" Police Scotland said earlier this month it would increase its number of armed police officers by about a third following warnings that the country would not be able to cope with a major terror attack. Speaking earlier on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland radio programme, Nabeel Shaikh, a former general secretary of Glasgow Mosque, said the authorities should do more to tackle extremist behaviour targeted at the Muslim community. ""Far-right extremism is just as dangerous as what we term the 'Islamic extremism' within our community,"" he said. ""Islamaphobia is on the rise and I think the government need to do something more about the far-right extremism that is growing and festering within our communities."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-46228083,'Nobody seemed to care' about WW2 graves,"For over 70-years, one woman has been tending to the graves of Indian soldiers killed in Scotland during World War Two.",16 Nov 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"For more than 70 years, Isobel Harling has tended the graves of Indian servicemen who fought and died during World War Two.  In Kingussie, nine graves belong to men who served in Force K6, a Muslim transport corps who rode mules and delivered supplies to front-line soldiers.  Mrs Harling hopes the families of the men buried at this cemetery know that their final resting place is well looked after.   She lost her own brother during the war,  when he was shot down in Leuven in Belgium, and she has often thought about the people tending his grave.  Her own loss influenced her dedication to the graves of the Indian soldiers.  ""They came over from home and they gave their lives for us. It's only right that we should remember them. The people in Leuven look after their graves, so it's only right that we look after the boys that were buried here."" Mrs Harling first started visiting the graves in her early 20s, often cycling to the graveyard by herself. When the local gravedigger noticed her tending the graves, he told her not to bring any of her own equipment because she could use his while she was there.  With help from the gravedigger, she  has spent years cutting the grass, placing flowers on the graves and keeping the cemetery tidy. Now in her 90s, she regrets that she has had to slow down a little.  Mrs Harling has never met the families of the men buried at Kingussie but she hopes the families know the graves are being cared for in the Highlands.  ""Nobody seemed to care and that bothered me. So when I jumped on my bike and cycled down, no one knew where I was going,"" she recalled. ""They (K6 soldiers) used to come down into the village, and they would come to some of the functions and dances... they were very quiet, very nice and mannerly."" At the start of the war, 1,723 men from India disembarked at Marseilles with 2,000 mules, sent to France to help the British Expeditionary Force deliver supplies to the front lines. These were the Force K6: Punjabi Muslims of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps (RIASC). Five-months later, struggling with one of the harshest winters of that time, the men faced the German blitzkrieg, with two companies escaping from Dunkirk and another company via St Nazaire. A fourth ended up in a German POW camp.  It was a foreign terrain for these men. Having come from the Punjab region, the men were accustomed to a warmer climate.  After their escape from France, they spent three-and-a-half-years in Britain.  They were part of preparations for one of Churchill's plans to invade Northern Norway to help secure German airfields.  The plan was never approved, but the Force K6 still accompanied the British infantry brigades, training them in loading, and how to handle mules.  Some of the men were born in what is now Pakistan and others from Kashmir. During their time in Scotland, there were inevitable casualties.  The youngest of the nine men was Mushtaq Ahmad, who was only 21-years-old when he was killed in action on 19 October 1942. The oldest in the group was Ali Bahadur, who died aged 38.  Thirteen of the men are buried in four cemeteries across Scotland. Most of them buried in Kingussie, as their Indian General Hospital was nearby.  Omar Sheik the founder of the Colourful Heritage Project said: ""I think the contribution of the soldiers is over five million soldiers in the great wars, 2.5m British Indian soldiers just in World War Two. The largest ever volunteer army.  ""The reality is not enough has been done to remember them and their contribution. The fact we are here, doing an inaugural service in 2018, at the largest single gravesite of Force K6 soldiers says everything.  ""Many of their relatives don't even know where they are or where they are buried, that itself is very poignant."" For many people in the Highlands this would have been their first time seeing a person from India.  ""They were welcomed immensely by the local communities."" Organised by Colourful Heritage and the British Armed Forces, a multi-faith remembrance service took place on Thursday to honour those men who gave their lives for Britain.  Mr Sheik says its a unique story and demonstrates a special connection between Scotland and the British Indian Army.  ""In Churchill's own words, 'had the British Indian Army not arrived when they did, the course of the war might have been very different'. ""A lot more needs to be done to commemorate the contribution of the British Indian Army. In the backdrop of Brexit and the anti-migrant narrative and the rise of the far right politics and rise in Islamophobia... now more than ever this story needs to be told.  Mrs Harling feels like the men belong in Highlands, a place where they died and remain buried, but not forgotten.  ""They gave up their lives for us, for our freedom. They've been there for a long time now,"" she said. ""It was very fascinating to see them marching with their mules, a sight I never forgot."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40442878,Anti-Islam campaigner launches UKIP bid,UKIP distances itself from controversial campaigner Anne Marie Waters who is bidding to lead the party.,30 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group is launching a bid to be the next UKIP leader on Saturday. Anne Marie Waters was blocked from standing for UKIP at the election, with then leader Paul Nuttall saying her views made him ""uncomfortable"". She campaigns against Sharia law in the UK and has called Islam ""evil"". UKIP said the campaign launch was ""not in any way an official UKIP event"" and urged members to ""think very carefully"" before attending. A UKIP spokesman said all leadership candidates would be vetted by the party's National Executive Committee, who will decide which ones will be allowed to go forward to a vote of the membership. Waters had planned to launch her leadership bid at Rotherham football club but has been forced to find an alternative venue. ""There were concerns about my 'views' and no doubt, police were happy to add to such concerns"", she said in a statement on her website.  South Yorkshire Police has said the decision to cancel the event at Rotherham's New York stadium was taken by the club.  The launch will now take place at an undisclosed location in Rotherham. Waters took part in a ""silent protest"" march against grooming gangs in the town last year. In a joint statement, UKIP MEP Jane Collins and councillor Allen Cowles, leader of UKIP's Rotherham branch, said they supported the decision to cancel the planned stadium rally and urged the party's councillors to boycott Waters' campaign launch. Mr Cowles said: ""UKIP councillors wish to make it clear that they do not condone in any way the views Ms Waters has previously expressed, or what she stands for.""  Waters announced her plans to stand for the UKIP leadership at a rally in Manchester earlier this month, where she was introduced by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson.  She told the cheering crowd ""Islam is a killing machine"" and urged them to ""join UKIP and vote for me,"" adding that the party will ""try to stop me"". After the Brexit vote, UKIP's leadership was aware the party had to broaden its appeal.   The former leader, Paul Nuttall, backed a radical policy platform with social integration at its core.  He said the party would shape the debate around extremism and Islamism in the way it claimed to have done with immigration - daring to address topics other politicians wouldn't. But while some in UKIP welcomed the policies announced in the election manifesto - including a ban on face coverings - they caused disquiet among other members who feared the party was in danger of being seen as Islamophobic.   Mr Nuttall insisted that was not the case, saying the focus was breaking down barriers in society and improving integration.  But UKIP is sensitive to public perception about its policy and direction. Having been dogged by allegations of racism in the past, it's determined not to go there again. A former Labour Party activist, Waters set up a UK branch of anti-mass immigration organisation Pegida with Robinson, but is no longer thought to be involved with the group.  She founded Sharia Watch UK, which aims to ""to document the advancement of Sharia law in Britain,"" in 2014. She hit the headlines a year later when she announced plans for an exhibition of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, but was forced to cancel the event after police warned it could be ""a risk to public safety"". She has argued that UKIP could regain support if it had the ""guts"" to be ""honest about Islam"" and challenge the view that it has ""nothing to do"" with jihadist violence. Anti-fascist campaign group HopeNotHate has branded Waters a ""toxic figure"" and urged UKIP to expel her from the party. But she has been defended by former UKIP leadership contender Raheem Kassam, editor of the Breitbart London website, who wrote earlier this year: ""If UKIP ditches Anne Marie Waters, the party is over"". The UKIP leadership contest was triggered by the resignation of Paul Nuttall, when the party failed to win any seats at the general election and saw its share of the vote collapse. Mr Nuttall, who campaigned for a ban on burkas and Sharia courts, said in April that Waters' comments were ""way above and beyond party policy"" and some had made him feel ""a bit uncomfortable"".  London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Ben Walker, a former UKIP councillor in South Gloucestershire, have also announced leadership bids. MEP Bill Etheridge, who came third in the first of UKIP's two leadership contests last year, and Thanet council leader Chris Wells have both said they might stand if Nigel Farage cannot be persuade to return to the job he quit after last year's Brexit referendum.  The former UKIP leader has not ruled out a bid."

Hasina Khan, from the Tackling Islamophobia Working Group (TIWG) said it was ""in some aspects the first opportunity for some to meet Muslims"". She said it was a chance to ""ask questions, have fun trying on hijabs"" and talk about the rise in hate crime. Since 2017, 72% of religious hate crimes against women in Bristol were anti-Muslim, police said. Ms Khan, who said she had experienced hate crime, said: ""The people who have come over say 'this is really important what you are doing'.  ""I think it's because of the amount of hate crime and there's also a bit of mystery about Muslim people. ""There's a lot of positivity and awareness of what we're doing today, there'll be more harmony in the community."" Matthew Hamey, from Weston-super-Mare, said: ""We live in the 21st Century now and racism of any sort shouldn't be part of our society.  ""I spent the first eight years of my life in the Middle East, in Bahrain - it had an impact, most definitely.  ""You obviously come into contact with local Bahrainis and they treated us the same as they wanted to be treated. They didn't let religious differences get in the way."" Rachel Weeks said: ""I literally grew up in a village just outside Bristol and I had no idea there would be any hatred towards my friend. ""She's my only Muslim friend, so just to have an idea that this sort of thing would happen to her - it's nice to support her.  ""I've been very lucky not to have been exposed to horrible things. It still shocks me that people are like that."" Heather Staniforth said: ""I lived in Malaysia and Singapore, so I have Muslim friends and obviously living in Singapore, everything is set up for that religion. Events like this are important because it shows love.""  Sukhi, from Bristol, said: ""Because people have a negative view with all different walks of life, it's very important to have people from minorities, from BME groups and they can interact and make people understand.  ""We need to break these walls and these barriers that are dividing people."" Alex Raikes, from Stand Against Racism and Inequality said the group was ""doing all we can to combat negative and destructive perceptions of Muslim communities and Islam"".   ""A big aim of the group is to take part in positive activities that challenge myths and stereotypes and break down fear and division.   ""TIWG joining the Christmas Market and engaging with local shoppers in conversation and fun activities is one great way to do this."""

Rev Richard Cameron, the minister at Scotstoun Parish Church in Glasgow, shouted at Mr Corbyn as he entered a local community centre. It later emerged that Rev Cameron had made Islamophobic and homophobic comments on his Twitter account. The church said there had been ""significant concern"" about the posts. In one tweet, Rev Cameron compared homosexuality to incest, describing them as ""unnatural"".  ""Both cause harm by breaking sensibly held taboos,"" he added.  In September, he tweeted: ""Christ has the power to help and change anyone. Obviously many gays hate this because want to carry on their perversion.""  He also shared a series of controversial views on Islam, describing terrorism as ""a problem Islam needs to deal with"", a full face veil as ""oppressive and unBritish"" and the Prophet Muhammad as ""a violent man"". In another post, he said: ""The best way to defeat Islam is to preach Christ"".  In response, a spokeswoman for the Church of Scotland said it deplored comments which were Islamophobic or homophobic.  ""At this stage all we can say is that there is a formal complaints process and that any complaints we receive in relation to this matter will be taken seriously and addressed,"" she added.  Rev Cameron, who worked in pharmaceutical sales before joining the church, has been minister at Scotstoun since 2000.  Earlier, he heckled Mr Corbyn during a trip to Glasgow, branding him a ""terrorist sympathiser"".  As Mr Corbyn was telling reporters about a scarf given to him by the Who Cares? Scotland charity, Rev Cameron shouted that he thought the Labour leader would be wearing an ""Islamic jihad scarf"". ""Do you think the man that's going to be prime minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?"" he added. ""Who's going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you're prime minister?"" The Labour leader did not react and he was ushered into the community centre by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.  Mr Cameron then accused Mr Corbyn of ""running away"". The Church of Scotland rebuked Rev Cameron for the way he approached the situation, saying: ""Whilst we may occasionally robustly challenge policy issues with which we disagree, we always intend to do that in a way that is polite and measured and allows for reasoned debate."" Meanwhile Who Cares? Scotland, which works with care experienced young people, criticised the minister for taking the focus away from their clients."

Police found a hoard of Nazi-era daggers, far-right literature and a framed Ku Klux Klan certificate in Nicholas Brock's bedroom in Berkshire. The 53-year-old was found guilty in March of three counts of possessing materials which could be of use in preparing terrorist acts. He was jailed for four years at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court. Brock's collection included a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf manifesto and a video of a white supremacist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019, the court heard. Prosecutors described the hoard as materials suitable for ""an undergraduate degree"" in the far-right. The stash and a hard drive containing the terrorist manuals were found in 2018 at Brock's home in Maidenhead, which he shared with his mother. Judge Peter Lodder QC told him: ""It is clear from the wide range of other material found on your computer and your hard drive that you are a right-wing extremist. ""Your enthusiasm for this repulsive and toxic ideology is demonstrated by the graphic, racist, Islamophobic and white supremacist iconography which you have stored."" Edward Butler, defending, said there was no evidence his client intended to carry out an attack. Brock, of Lancaster Road, previously told police he had an interest in military memorabilia which stemmed from his love of Action Man as a child. Police said Brock was likely to have been self-radicalised through browsing online. Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, said: ""The material Brock had in his possession is dangerous and concerning.  ""He had books which would provide techniques on how to fight, assisting someone who was potentially preparing a terrorist act.""  The defendant was ordered to serve another year on licence after his release from prison. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38029336,Mike Pompeo - Trump's loyalist diplomat,The US Secretary of State previously was the director of the CIA and a conservative Republican senator.,27 Apr 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"This video can not be played Claims about Trump 'dangerous and false', says ex-CIA director Mike Pompeo was a hardline Republican congressman before President Donald Trump appointed him to direct the CIA and later to lead the US Department of State. The former Tea Party representative from Kansas was handpicked by Mr Trump to be the top US diplomat after he fired former state department chief Rex Tillerson. Hours before Mr Trump announced that he would meet the leader of North Korea, Mr Pompeo was seen in the Oval Office with Mr Trump during a meeting with a South Korean delegation at the White House. In April it was revealed that Mr Pompeo had secretly travelled to Pyongyang over the Easter holiday to meet North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. Mr Pompeo is seen as a Trump loyalist who performed a delicate balancing act at the CIA in managing frayed relations between the spy agency and a commander-in-chief who compared America's intelligence services to Nazis. He has in the past played down findings by the CIA that the Russians attempted to influence last year's US election. But when push comes to shove, he has shown a willingness to contradict the president on the issue. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? After Mr Trump said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials, Mr Pompeo firmly stood by US assessments of Moscow's alleged meddling. Mr Pompeo is seen as more hawkish on the Kremlin than the president, and has previously warned that President Putin is a dangerous leader. This video can not be played Pompeo on Russia, North Korea and Trump During his time in Congress, the 53-year-old former-three-term Republican from Wichita, Kansas, was a vehement critic of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran. He has previously defended the National Security Agency's bulk data collection programme and opposes shutting the prison at Guantanamo Bay. What does the future hold for Guantanamo? After visiting the detention facility in 2013, he remarked that some inmates who had declared a hunger strike looked like they had put on weight. Mr Pompeo also defended the CIA after the 2014 release of a Senate report on torture, which detailed such practices as waterboarding. He declared: ""These men and women are not torturers, they are patriots."" The CIA tactics, he said, ""were within the law, within the constitution"". Mr Pompeo opposes shutting the prison at Guantanamo Bay Mr Pompeo graduated first in his class at West Point and graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of its Law Review. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 with the support of the Republican mega-donors Charles and David Koch. Mr Pompeo became a member of the House intelligence committee and its energy and commerce panel. Before joining Congress, he founded an aviation parts firm and an oilfield supply company. He was accused of Islamophobia for remarks he made following the deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing. Mr Pompeo had taken to the House floor to suggest some Islamic faith leaders might be tacitly encouraging terrorist attacks. ""When the most devastating terrorist attacks on America in the last 20 years come overwhelmingly from people of a single faith and are performed in the name of that faith a special obligation falls on those that are the leaders of that faith,"" he said. ""Instead of responding, silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow."" Mike Pompeo is sworn in as CIA director by Vice President Mike Pence (R) While he was a congressional candidate in 2010, one of his campaign aides sent a tweet linking to an article that labelled his Indian-American Democratic opponent Raj Goyle a ""turban topper"". Mr Pompeo apologised, though his campaign also sent out billboard ads urging everyone to ""vote American"".  He also served on the House Select Benghazi Committee, a special panel created in 2014 to investigate the deadly attack two years earlier on a US diplomatic compound in Libya. Democrats described it as a political witch-hunt against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr Pompeo released a report afterwards accusing her of intentionally misleading Americans about the nature of the attack to help President Barack Obama's re-election bid.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-56594570,Pupils stage protest over 'racist' uniform policy,"Pimlico Academy apologised to staff, parents and children for disruption caused by the protest.",31 Mar 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Pupils have staged a mass protest reportedly against the uniform policy of a central London secondary school. Videos on social media show scores of pupils chanting ""we want change"" after walking out of Pimlico Academy early on Wednesday. It follows students' claims Pimlico Academy discriminates against Muslim and black pupils. The Westminster-based school said there was ""regret"" in the way matters ""came to a head"" publicly. A statement purportedly on behalf of students railed against ""racism, Islamophobia and transphobia"" and said pupils were angry at a lack of recognition of the Black Lives Matter movement. Tensions between Pimlico Academy's senior leadership and its parents and pupils, began in August 2020 when a new uniform policy was imposed. Among the new rules affecting all pupils were a ban on afro haircuts which could ""block the views"" of other pupils in class. The new policy also required Year 12 and 13 students to sport ""formal business suits"" where previously they were allowed to wear chinos and a collared casual shirt  The Local Democracy Reporting Service reported parents complained this placed a financial burden on them while many people had been put on furlough or been made redundant. The Guardian newspaper reported up to 30 members of staff are considering whether to leave the school. Futures Academies, which runs the school in Pimlico, Westminster, did not comment on the reported mass exodus of staff, but said ""the majority of students"" were in classrooms studying throughout the protest. It added: ""We want to take this opportunity to reassure parents that this is an isolated event, and we are working to resolve the issues raised.  ""We apologise to all children, families and staff for the disruption today."" On Tuesday the National Education Union (NEU) passed a motion of no confidence in head teacher Daniel Smith and moved towards balloting for industrial action. Regional secretary Pauline Buchanan said the decision was not taken lightly. ""This vote is in response to serious failures of management which members believe are bringing the school into disrepute,"" she said. ""As well as NEU members' trade dispute over the industrial issues, members have strongly expressed their solidarity with students' concerns and their desire for an anti-racist school."""

Glynn Martin, of Greater Manchester Police, also shared images of explicit sexual violence and discriminatory jokes with fellow officers. He resigned in March ahead of a misconduct hearing, the full details of which have now been released. Mr Martin said he had sought counselling for pornography addiction. The sergeant, who worked for the force for 14 years and was based in Rochdale, told the disciplinary panel he was ""deeply ashamed"" of his actions.  The hearing found the case would ""harm public confidence in the police"" at a time when there was ""national concern about policing in respect of issues including racism, sexism, and Islamophobia."" Allegations against Mr Martin arose in November 2017 and he was arrested, but no criminal proceedings were brought against him.  His behaviour was then investigated by Greater Manchester Police's professional standards branch. During the hearing, he admitted to sending offensive content about disabled people. One clip showed sex acts performed on an unconscious woman, while another featured an image containing a paragraph advocating sexual violence. Some of material was sent to fellow police officers. Mr Martin also received anti-Semitic and Islamophobic images, but said he could not recall viewing them or being aware they were on his phone.  Explaining his actions, Mr Martin said he often forwarded images and videos without viewing them properly or in full.  ""This was part of my compulsion. I would never make the types of jokes I forwarded over WhatsApp out loud to anyone,"" he said. Mr Martin said the images did not reflect his ""thoughts, values or morals"". Though he had resigned a month before the hearing, the panel ruled the only appropriate action would have been dismissal. They concluded his behaviour amounted to gross misconduct and described the videos sent by Mr Martin as ""obscene and deeply offensive"".

The philosopher was appointed as the unpaid chair of the Building Beautiful architecture Commission in November.  He has now been dismissed after claiming Islamophobia was ""a propaganda word"" and ""each Chinese person is a kind of replica of the next one"".  Downing Street said the comments were ""deeply offensive"".  Sir Roger's appointment to head the new body was criticised at the time by Labour, who said his past comments on race and sexuality made him unsuitable to hold the post.  The author has now left his position ""with immediate effect"" after an interview with the New Statesman in which he questioned the definition of Islamophobia and speculated on the influence of Jewish financier, philanthropist and liberal political activist George Soros in his native Hungary.  He said he stood by comments he has made in the past that Islamophobia was a ""propaganda word invented by the Muslim Brotherhood in order to stop discussion of a major issue"". He said ""anybody who doesn't think that there's a Soros empire in Hungary has not observed the facts"" - a statement that critics have condemned as a conspiracy theory and an anti-Semitic trope.  In a wide-ranging interview, he also said the Communist regime in China was ""creating robots out of their own people"" which he said was a ""frightening thing"". The Conservatives have been under pressure to deal with anti-Muslim prejudice in the party amid claims by a former chair Baroness Warsi that they have turned a blind eye to it.  Communities Secretary James Brokenshire defended Sir Roger at the time of his appointment, saying his views had evolved and many of the attacks on him were ""misinformed and ill-judged"". It is understood Mr Brokenshire personally informed Sir Roger of his dismissal on Wednesday. No 10 said the comments were ""deeply offensive, completely unacceptable and it's right that he's been dismissed"". ""He was appointed because of his expertise in a particular field but it's clear that his comments are distracting from that work,"" a spokesman said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57020697,German call to ban 'Jewish star' at Covid demos,"The anti-Semitism commissioner urges officials to stop protesters ""relativising"" the Holocaust.",7 May 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Germany's anti-Semitism commissioner, Felix Klein, has urged authorities to stop protesters using the Nazis' yellow star forced on Jews in World War Two. Some protesters have replaced the word ""Jude"" (Jew) with the phrase ""ungeimpft"" (unvaccinated), equating Covid restrictions with the persecution of Europe's Jewish population.  The yellow Star of David has also been seen in protests in London. Mr Klein said he hoped German cities would follow Munich in banning it. ""If people pin so-called Jewish stars on themselves in demonstrations, thereby drawing comparisons that relativise the Holocaust, then the means provided by law should be applied against them,"" he told Tagesspiegel newspaper. The Nazis made wearing the yellow Star of David badge mandatory throughout territories they occupied, dehumanising Jews by marking them out as different. Anyone found without one faced a fine, prison or death.  Anti-lockdown protesters argue that the ruling liberal establishment is violating their personal freedom and exaggerating the Covid health risks. However, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, said last year it was ""unspeakable"" that Germans were comparing restrictions on their lives with the abuses of the Third Reich. The yellow star has appeared at protests beyond Germany too. British comedian David Baddiel drew attention to its use in London last month, and it was condemned by the Auschwitz Museum. The head of the UK-based Centre for Countering Digital Hate, Imran Ahmed, said anti-vaxxers in particular had ""instrumentalised"" anti-Semitism as it had given them new audiences, and he was angered by the use of the yellow Star of David.  ""I cannot think of many things more disgusting than comparing vaccines that will save countless lives to the industrial slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust,"" he told the BBC. When the yellow star appeared in January at an anti-lockdown protest in the Czech capital, Prague, the Israeli ambassador condemned it as an insult to the millions murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. Anti-Semitic offences in Germany rose to 2,300 last year, which the government's commissioner said was frightening but unsurprising, as in times of crisis people were more open to ""irrational explanations, including anti-Semitic stereotypes"".  He said they were espoused by the far right, conspiracy theorists as well as by the left. It is not just the yellow star that has appeared at German protests. Far-right regalia and Imperial War Flags have been used during rallies close to the Reichstag parliament building. Last month, the domestic BfV intelligence agency said some parts of the anti-lockdown movement were being placed under observation amid fears they were trying to undermine the state. It highlighted parts of the ""Querdenker"" (lateral thinkers) movement, which has drawn from the far-right AfD party, anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Although not all Covid protesters were anti-Semitic, Mr Klein warned that diverse groups were finding common cause and anti-Semitism was the ""cement that binds them together"". In a separate development, German intelligence said it was extending surveillance of an Islamophobic protest group in the eastern state of Saxony. It said Pegida had become ""extremist"" and ""anti-constitutional"" and was acting as a hinge between extremists and non-extremists."

Elliot Brown, 25, from Bath, shared a video of his Alexa speaker reading out a recipe for the explosive thermite. Brown denied collecting information that could be of use to a terrorist and disseminating a terrorist publication. He was found guilty after a week-long trial and jailed at Bristol Crown Court on Tuesday. Brown was sent to prison for three years and three months on each charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.  Judge Anthony Leonard KC also ordered Brown spend an extra year on licence after his release due to his offences ""being of particular concern"".   During the trial the jury heard how Brown, who has no previous convictions, held ""extremist views"". Brown was a member of a far-right group chat in which he exchanged racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic messages with other members. The group chat also contained photos related to the support of neo-Nazism and white supremacy. Brown recorded a 30-second video on 22 March 2020 in which his Amazon Alexa speaker responded to his question - ""how do I make thermite?"" Alexa read out instructions from a website which Mr Brown recorded and sent into the chat via the messenger app Telegram. Three days later fellow group member Dean Morrice purchased materials that could be combined to make thermite. In August 2020 police raided Morrice's home and found enough aluminium powder, iron oxide, and magnesium ribbon in the kitchen to make the explosive substance. Morrice was later convicted of 10 terrorism related offences, including stockpiling explosive materials. Brown was subsequently arrested in February 2021 for the dissemination of a terrorist publication but he told police he made the video ""as a harmless joke"". He said he had ""a dark sense of humour"" and was being ""ironic"" and had ""made comments"" to gain others group members' approval because he was significantly younger than them. Giving evidence, Brown said he was ""ashamed and angry"" of ""extremist"" comments he had made in the group chat. ""My views, at the time, were uneducated, far-right, anti-Semitic, racist and homophobic and I was in a vulnerable place at the time and had become more right-wing,"" he said. He said he had abandoned his extremist views, adding he was ""saved by becoming a Christian"" after Morrice's arrest. Det Supt Craig McWhinnie, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), said: ""While there is no evidence that Brown planned to commit any terrorist attack, his actions went beyond just casual talk and are a criminal offence under the Terrorism Act."" Supt Steve Kendall, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""People like Elliot Brown, who hold extremist views, can live absolutely anywhere and, although these instances are rare, they remind us we all need to be vigilant.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-48069763,The British Victorians who became Muslims,The stories of three pioneers who defied societal norms by converting to Islam.,19 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"At the height of the Empire, a select band of British people renounced Christianity and converted to Islam. These are the stories of three such pioneers, who defied Victorian norms at a time when Christianity was the bedrock of British identity. Solicitor William Henry Quilliam became interested in Islam after seeing Moroccans pray on a ferry during a Mediterranean break in 1887. ""They were not at all troubled by the force of the strong wind or by the swaying of the ship. I was deeply touched by the look on their faces and their expressions, which displayed complete trust and sincerity,"" he recalled. After inquiring about the religion during a stay in Tangiers, 31-year-old Quilliam became a Muslim, describing his new faith as ""reasonable and logical and, personally, I felt it did not contradict my beliefs"".  While Islam doesn't oblige converts to change their names, he adopted the name of Abdullah.  On his return to England in 1887, he became a preacher, and was said to be instrumental in the conversion of about 600 people across the UK. He also established the country's first mosque that year in Liverpool - regarded by many at the time as the ""second city of the British Empire"". Queen Victoria, who ruled over more Muslims than the Turkish Ottoman Empire, was among those who ordered his pamphlet ""Faith of Islam"", which summarised the religion and was translated into 13 languages. She is said to have ordered six more copies for her family. But her willingness to learn was not always matched by a wider society which believed Islam to be a violent religion. In 1894, the Ottoman sultan - with the approval of the Queen - appointed Quilliam as Sheikh al-Islam of the British Isles, a title reflecting his leadership in the Muslim community. Despite the official recognition, many Liverpudlian converts faced resentment and abuse over their faith, including being assaulted with bricks, offal and horse manure.  Quilliam believed the attackers had been ""brainwashed and led to believe that we were bad people"". He was known locally for his work with the underprivileged - advocating trade unionism and divorce law reform - but his legal career came to ruin when he tried to help a female client seeking a divorce.  A honey-trap was set up for her allegedly adulterous husband - a practice not uncommon at the time - but the attempt failed and Quilliam was struck off.  He left Liverpool in 1908 to minimise the scandal's impact on the Muslim community. He resurfaced in the south as Henri de Leon, although many knew who he was, according to Prof Ron Geaves, who has written a book about Quilliam. Although his profile diminished, he became involved with the country's second oldest mosque, built in Woking in 1889, and was buried in the Surrey town after his death in 1932. The Liverpool mosque bears his name to this day. It wasn't uncommon for members of the upper classes to be fascinated by Islam, often inspired by travels in Muslim lands. From an aristocratic family, Edinburgh-born Lady Evelyn Murray spent much of her childhood switching between life in Scotland and north Africa. ""There, I learnt to speak Arabic and my delight was to escape my governess and visit the mosques with my Algerian friends, and unconsciously I was a little Muslim at heart,"" she wrote. At her ancestral estate of Dunmore Park, she excelled at deer-stalking and salmon-fishing. Her explorer father, the 7th Earl of Dunmore, was often away in destinations including China and Canada. Her mother, later a lady-in-waiting to Queen Victoria, was also a keen traveller.  Lady Evelyn inherited her parents' wanderlust and it was in Cairo where she met and married her husband John Cobbold - a businessman who was part of the brewery dynasty that ran Ipswich Town FC. It is not known when she converted to Islam. The seed may have been sown by her childhood travels, but Lady Evelyn's faith was apparently cemented after a holiday in Rome, where she met the Pope. ""When His Holiness suddenly addressed me, asking if I was a Catholic, I was taken aback for a moment and then replied that I was a Muslim,"" she later wrote.  ""What possessed me I don't pretend to know, as I had not given a thought to Islam for many years. A match was lit and I then and there determined to read up and study the faith."" It was the religion's spiritual aspect that attracted many converts, according to historian William Facey, who wrote the foreword to Lady Evelyn's memoirs. He says they followed a ""belief that all the great religions shared a transcendent unity… behind the superficial doctrinal detail that divides them"". In the Middle East, Lady Evelyn - referred to as ""Lady Zainab"" by her Arab friends - often had access to areas reserved for women and wrote about the ""dominating influence of women"" in Muslim culture.  At the age of 65, she embarked on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca - the first British woman on record to complete the feat.  It offered her ""endless interest, wonder and beauty"" and her account was later published in a book, Pilgrimage to Mecca. Little is known about her life afterwards other than she travelled for a short period in Kenya. She died in an Inverness nursing home in 1963 at the age of 95, having instructed that a bagpiper play at her funeral and a Koranic passage, known as the ""verse of light"", be inscribed on her gravestone. The marker, located in her Glencarron estate in the Highlands, was later slashed with a knife - perhaps testament to the strong views her conversion drew. ""I am often asked when and why I became a Muslim,"" she wrote in her memoirs.  ""I can only reply that I do not know the precise moment when the truth of Islam dawned upon me.   ""It seems that I have always been a Muslim.""  The narrative of Victorian Muslim history is usually dominated by those from society's upper echelons, whose accounts have been better preserved. Keeping written documents, such as diaries, was ""generally more a sign of being middle class"", says Christina Longden, who only found out her ancestor became Muslim after her father researched their family tree. Robert Stanley rose from working-class grocer to Conservative mayor of Stalybridge - a mill town near Manchester - in the 1870s.  According to Ms Longden, who has written a book and play about him, he was also a magistrate who set up a fund for workers sacked for not voting in line with their bosses' views. She also found he regularly wrote about British colonialism to the newsletter of Quilliam's Liverpool mosque. Stanley met Quilliam in the late 1890s after he had retired from his political career, and they became close friends.  ""Robert was 28 years older than Quilliam so I think there may have been a bit of a father-son relationship there,"" says Ms Longden.   It wasn't until he was 70 years old however, in 1898, that Stanley became a Muslim and adopted the name Reschid.  Ms Longden believes from her research that there were ""no other Muslims"" in Stalybridge at the time. Stanley later moved to Manchester and died in 1911.  His conversion was kept quiet by his immediate descendants and was only discovered by the Longdens in 1998. ""Quilliam's granddaughter said this was 'an age when, if you didn't conform, your picture was turned to the wall for all time',"" says Ms Longden. Coincidentally, Ms Longden's brother, Steven, became a Muslim in 1991 after studying in Egypt as part of his university degree - seven years before finding out about Stanley. When he heard about his ancestor's conversion, he recalls finding it ""incredibly shocking, in a good way"". ""The fact there was a man who chose to be Muslim at a time when you couldn't possibly imagine someone would do something so unorthodox... when you sit and think about it, well yeah, it's Manchester.

The chairman of the Jewish Labour movement, Jeremy Newmark, would not say whether Labour's track record on dealing with anti-Semitism would cost the party a significant number of votes at the general election. But he does see it as a cause for concern. ""Jeremy Corbyn appears to have failed to understand the nature of contemporary anti-Semitism in the same way that it's understood by most of its target group,"" he said. Labour MP Wes Streeting - a frequent critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership - has also criticised the party's record on the issue. ""I don't think many Jewish voters in my constituency have been very impressed with the way the Labour party as a whole have responded,"" said Mr Streeting.  Mr Corbyn has previously said the party does not tolerate anti-Semitism in any way. The Labour leader's record on handling anti-Semitic behaviour has the potential to cause problems for the party at the ballot box. While fewer than 0.5%, or 263,000, of Britons described themselves as Jewish at the last census, a majority of them live in just 10 parliamentary constituencies, including some of the most tightly contested in the country.   Since Mr Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour Party, there have been allegations that he has failed to do all he can to tackle anti-Semitism. Having repeatedly refused to apologise for calling the Islamist Lebanese militia, Hezbollah ""friends"", he has also had to deal with a string of anti-Semitic comments from Labour councillors, an MP, and party stalwart Ken Livingstone. In April, Mr Livingstone was suspended from the party for standing by his claim that Hitler supported Zionism in the 1930s. The party decided to conduct a report into its handling of the issue.  At the launch of Labour's race and faith manifesto this week, Mr Corbyn reaffirmed the party's commitment to ""build a society free from all forms of racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. ""We will stand up to and take effective action against hate crime, notably, but not only in Muslim, Jewish and non-Abrahamic faith communities,"" he said.  In June last year, an inquiry led by Shami Chakrabarti - now a Labour peer - a former director of human rights group Liberty - concluded that the party was not overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism but there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". As with any community, a range of issues will influence Jewish voters' decisions, said Simon Johnson, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council. But he says ""this is probably the first election at which this has been an issue"" to such a big extent.  ""People within the Labour party leadership are in no doubt about the concerns of the Jewish community,"" he said. One early indication is a Jewish Chronicle opinion poll published this week, which suggested just 13% of British Jews plan to vote for Labour, compared with 77% backing the Tories. The poll by Survation, which polled a sample of 515 British Jews, also suggested Labour would do better with Jewish voters if Jeremy Corbyn was not the leader. One of the most marginal seats in the country is the leafy north-east London suburb of Ilford North, home to a Jewish community of about 6,600.  Two years ago, Labour's Wes Streeting won it by just 589 votes. He says he is taking no votes for granted. He is relying on his track record to impress voters, including the ones who, he says, have brought up Labour's anti-Semitism record on the doorstep. He says they have not been impressed by the party's reaction as a whole, ""but they have seen that I have been unflinching in my condemnation of anti-Semitism within the party.""  He also points to his record of trying to tackle the issue within wider society, which dates back at least as far as his time as NUS president more than a decade ago. The seat won't be decided on a single issue. On its border sits the large, modern King George hospital whose A&E is threatened with closure. The NHS, social care and schools will be on voters' minds too. However, another reason Labour's record on anti-Semitism could be an important issue is that UKIP is not running, in the hope of boosting Conservative candidate Lee Scott's chances.  Born locally, Mr Scott held the Ilford North seat from 2005 until 2015. He said ""a number of people"" he has met during the campaign have cited Labour's ""reluctance to tackle"" anti-Semitism as a reason ""they cannot vote Labour any longer"". On the other side of the capital is the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency. Crucially for Labour it's also home to the sixth biggest Jewish population in the country - 8,482 according to the 2011 census. However, it's almost certainly grown since then as younger Jews move to congregate around the wider area's Jewish schools, kosher restaurants and other amenities.  Labour's Tulip Siddiq, who has worked hard to build ties with the Jewish community, is defending a majority of just 1,138. In what could be interpreted as a sign that the Conservatives also see the importance of that relationship their candidate, Claire-Louise Leyland, was selected in a meeting at a local synagogue. According to Marcus Dysch, political editor of the Jewish Chronicle, it's one of a handful of seats around the country, including Bury South, where this issue has made Labour vulnerable. ""Anti-Semitism has become the number one topic of political discussion amongst the Jewish community nationwide,"" says Mr Dysch. ""It is the issue people are talking about above and beyond Brexit, the economy or healthcare."" Other candidates standing in Ilford North are Richard Clare, Liberal Democrat; and Doris Osen, Independent. In Hampstead and Kilburn: Kirsty Allan, Liberal Democrat; Hugh Easterbrook, Independent; John Mansook, Green Party; and Rainbow George Weiss, Independent."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-64925333,Flynn backs Humza Yousaf in SNP leadership race,SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn is the latest senior party figure to endorse the health secretary.,11 Mar 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has backed Humza Yousaf in the race to replace Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Flynn is the latest high-profile figure in the party to endorse the Scottish health secretary. On Saturday Mr Yousaf will join fellow contenders Kate Forbes and Ash Regan for a hustings event at Strathclyde University. SNP members will start voting for the new leader on Monday, with the winner to be announced on 27 March.  Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Flynn said: ""I think, for all of us, we need a big bit of hope at the moment. ""We have had a difficult few years with Brexit, with Liz Truss crashing the economy in October, with the cost of living crisis, and I think that Humza can provide that hope.""  The Aberdeen South MP praised Mr Yousaf's plans to expand childcare and provide help with the cost of living.  He also said the health secretary understood the necessity for energy security and green jobs. During last week's STV debate, leadership rival Kate Forbes delivered a sharp critique of Mr Yousaf's recording in government, telling him: ""You were a transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times."" Asked about that scathing criticism, Mr Flynn said: ""It is inevitable that when you are having a contest people will perhaps overegg things. ""When it comes to health Humza has overseen the NHS obviously in a very difficult spot. I don't think anyone is ever going to try and undersell that. ""But our NHS is performing better than any of those on these isles."" Challenged about record waiting times, Mr Flynn blamed a backlog from the Covid pandemic and an ageing population.   He also said Mr Yousaf's record in transport and justice was one to be ""proud of"", citing examples such as the delivery of the Queensferry Crossing under budget and falling crime figures. Asked if divisions in the party had been exposed since Ms Sturgeon announced she was standing down, Mr Flynn said there were disagreements within every political party. But he added: ""I think when colleagues are having debate they need to remember that whilst you can disagree you don't necessarily need to be disagreeable."" SNP Westminster deputy leader Mhairi Black had already announced her support for Mr Yousaf, criticising Ms Forbes, who has said she would not have voted for same-sex marriage if she had been at Holyrood when the legislation was passed. Bruce Crawford, a former parliamentary business secretary in the Scottish government, also endorsed Mr Yousaf. The former MSP tweeted: ""I have thought long and hard about who should be the next leader of the SNP. I believe that Humza Yousaf is the candidate who has best demonstrated the qualities and attributes to be that leader."" Veteran SNP MSPs Annabelle Ewing and Christine Grahame are among those to have announced they will be voting for Ms Forbes. One of the party's best known MPs, Joanna Cherry KC, has given her support to Ms Regan.  Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf has revealed he was forced to call in Police Scotland over abuse he experienced in the early days of his campaign. Mr Yousaf spoke of his fears that running to be first minister could impact his family, and his children in particular. He said: ""It's one of the long conversations, the hard conversations, that I had with the family who know about the racial and Islamophobic abuse that I get. ""Ultimately you don't really worry about yourself too much - you worry about your kids."" A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed a 25-year-old man and 35-year-old woman were arrested and charged in connection to reports of abusive and threatening behaviour in the Dundee area last month. The three leadership candidates will take part in an hour-long Debate Night programme from Edinburgh at 20:00 on Tuesday 14 March on BBC One Scotland."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50511329,Corbyn: I'd stay neutral in Brexit referendum,"Boris Johnson asks how the Labour leader could agree a new EU deal and then be ""indifferent"" about it.",23 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Jeremy Corbyn has said he would remain neutral in a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins power. He told a BBC Question Time leaders' special he would not campaign for Leave or Remain so it would allow him, as prime minister, to ""credibly"" carry out what the voters then decide. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later asked how Mr Corbyn could be ""indifferent"" on such a vital issue. But Mr Johnson faced questions of his own about whether he could be trusted. The prime minister was the fourth party leader to answer the audience's questions, with the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson also taking to the stage for 30 minutes each on Friday evening. Pressed on whether politicians should be relied upon to tell the truth, Mr Johnson said this was ""absolutely vital"".  While trust was a crucial issue for voters, he argued the biggest threat to public confidence was the ""corrosive"" effect of Parliament trying to block Brexit. He said the Labour, SNP and Lib Dem leaders wanted to ""basically frustrate"" the result of the 2016 referendum, which the public had been waiting more than three years to see delivered, by ""absurdly"" holding another one.  He said that the Labour leader's views seemed to have ""mutated"" and Mr Corbyn's ambition to negotiate an improved agreement would be totally undermined if he did not care whether the public backed it or not. ""He is now going to be neutral on the deal he proposes to do. I don't see how he can do a deal when he is going to be neutral or indifferent."" The four leaders all appeared individually and faced a mixture of audience questions and follow-up questions from host Fiona Bruce at the event in Sheffield.  The first to take the stage, Mr Corbyn, faced tough questioning about his economic polices, with one member of the audience suggesting his ""reckless socialist"" agenda ""terrified"" him and his family.  The Labour leader said his plans to take Royal Mail, the railways, the water industry and broadband delivery into public ownership had been ""set out"" very clearly and were aimed at ""delivering an economy that works for all"". He insisted business had ""nothing to be frightened of"" by his plans, saying his ""fully prepared and costed manifesto"" would bring the country together and help reduce inequality.  Mr Corbyn was criticised for what several audience members suggested was a lack of clarity on whether he personally would support or oppose Brexit in a new referendum in 2020, with one questioner saying: ""Why would anyone vote for Labour without knowing the answer to that question?"" Mr Corbyn said it was ""entirely reasonable"" to put the question back to the people as another referendum represented a sensible middle ground between those who wanted to cancel Brexit entirely and those backing the PM's deal. Asked to clarify his own position, he said: ""I will adopt, if I am prime minister at the time, a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring our communities and countries together rather than continuing an endless debate."" He later told the audience: ""You heard it here first on Question Time."" In doing this, he would follow in the footsteps of Harold Wilson - who allowed Labour ministers to campaign on both sides in the 1975 Common Market referendum and took a back seat during the campaign - although he personally backed staying in.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock attacked Mr Corbyn's position, saying he had ""decided to be indecisive"" and it ""won't wash with the voters"".  But shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock defended Mr Corbyn's stance as ""brave"". ""What we are saying is we trust the people to have the final say,"" she told Today.  It's not clear if the lively grilling of major politicians will shift the dial at this election.  But it certainly marked a shift in Jeremy Corbyn's position on Brexit. He had been put under pressure by his opponents to say whether he would support Leave or Remain in the new referendum Labour is promising. So he tried to eliminate a negative by providing clarity, of a sort: a clear commitment to stay neutral. Labour's strategists are suggesting he could now be seen as an honest broker that can bring a divided country together. In truth, though, behind the scenes there are fears that the party may have over-estimated the threat from the Lib Dems and underestimated the importance voters in Leave areas attach to delivering Brexit.  So his neutrality is in part an attempt to reassure those voters that his promised referendum isn't the means of cancelling Brexit by the back door. His followers will say he has risen above the fray; his critics - that he has become more decisive about sitting on the fence. Questioned on the issue of tackling incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Mr Corbyn was accused of failing to intervene when one of his own Jewish MPs, Ruth Smeeth, was heckled by an activist at a party event in 2016.  Mr Corbyn said Ms Smeeth and others had ""suffered terrible abuse"". He insisted that all forms of racism and misogyny were ""unacceptable"" and party activists who had abused MPs had been disciplined or expelled. When Mr Johnson took the stage, he dismissed suggestions he was trying to suppress the findings of a report into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 referendum vote as ""Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""There is no evidence whatsoever, that I know of, to show any interference in any British electoral event,"" the Conservative leader said. He insisted his party had ""zero tolerance"" towards Islamophobia and said he regretted any offence he had caused in articles about race during his journalistic career - including a piece in 2018 in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers. But he defended the right to freedom of speech and did not accept an audience member's invitation to say ""sorry"" for writing them. Labour's economic plans would be ""ruinous"" for the country, he argued, but he also acknowledged his plan to cut national insurance bills for low-earners - expected to be the main tax announcement in the Conservative manifesto - would only have a modest impact.  On the NHS, Mr Johnson stuck by his claims that the health service was receiving the biggest cash injection in its history. He added: ""Of course I understand that things have been tough in the NHS and understand the pressures the NHS is under. I know the massive demand the NHS faces but we can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said voting for her party in Scotland was the best way of ""depriving"" the Tories of a majority across the UK. Asked about what she would do in the event of another hung Parliament on 12 December, she said she would not work with the Tories but was prepared to deal with Labour if Jeremy Corbyn committed to end austerity and agreed to hold another Scottish independence referendum. ""In terms of what I would seek to win from a minority Labour government, obviously I would ask for and expect Jeremy Corbyn to respect the right of the Scottish people to choose their own future. ""It is not for Westminster to decide. It is for the people of Scotland."" When it was pointed out to her that Mr Corbyn had just stated to viewers that he would not sanction another independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government, she said she was predicting what he might choose to do after the election, rather than dwelling on what he was saying now. She said: ""Do you think he's going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants, for a couple of years, to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?"" The first minister said more needed to be done to reduce the number of drug deaths in Scotland, saying, ""I don't want to be citizen of a country where people are dying from drug issues."" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was immediately asked by an audience member whether she regretted saying she could become prime minister and ""how ridiculous this sounded"" - given that her party only had 20 MPs at the end of the last Parliament. She said she recognised it was a ""big ask"" for her to make it to No 10 but she believed many people were ""dismayed"" at having to choose between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and there had to be a ""better alternative"". She faced awkward questions over her plans to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50, being asked by one audience member whether she regarded all 17.4 million Leave voters as ""stupid"". Ms Swinson said this was not the case and they clearly disagreed over the benefits of being in the EU, to which she was told ""you can disagree with me but you lost"". She was also challenged over austerity and what one audience member called her party's backing for ""harsh and cruel benefit cuts"" while in coalition with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015. She conceded the Lib Dems had made mistakes during their time in government and should have done more to limit the scale of austerity - although she said she remained supportive of the principle of the Universal Credit system - which Labour has pledged to scrap. It was not a comfortable ride for any of the four who appeared in front of the audience in Sheffield who were pressed on issues as broad as the economy, austerity, Brexit, Bolivia, the Russia report, racism, the NHS and plenty more.  It was particularly uncomfortable for the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who was pummelled by the audience over her promise to stop Brexit by simply halting the process altogether in the unlikely event she won a majority. There were moments of real challenge too for Boris Johnson first on a very simple question - can he be trusted? The audience's attitude made it clear they have a big question about that, and about him. Read more from Laura here. The two-hour show came after recently-screened Question Time specials with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley. The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff."

The Ricketts family, which owns the Chicago Cubs, has made the shortlist of bidders to buy the club. But there are concerns over the bid after it emerged that the family's patriarch, Joe Ricketts, was accused, external of Islamophobia three years ago. The Chelsea Supporters' Trust (CST) said it is against the family's bid. The CST said it had conducted a snap survey of its membership on 1 April to see if ""they had confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club"" and ""whether they supported"" the bid. It did not say how many members took part but that ""72% of those who responded do not currently have confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, with 5% of respondents believing they would"". The CST added: ""Similarly, 77% of members who responded do not support the Ricketts family's bid for Chelsea FC and 3% of respondents are in support. ""The CST board is guided by our membership, and thus we do not currently believe it is in the best interests of our members for the Ricketts family's bid to succeed."" Chelsea were in action against Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday and and some Blues fans protested against the Ricketts family's bid before the game. ""Over the past fortnight, our bid team has met with several supporter groups to explain our vision for Chelsea Football Club,"" said Tom Ricketts. ""In those meetings, and by letter to all groups, we have shared a set of specific commitments we will make to fans, if our bid is successful. ""We believe these are far-reaching and certainly include an absolute commitment on the part of the Ricketts family and the bid team to put diversity and inclusion at the heart of the club.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43246496,Driver guilty of hate crime car attack,Paul Moore knocked over a Somali woman in his car and then went back to run her over as she lay on the ground.,2 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man has been convicted of the attempted murder of a Somali woman after knocking her over in his car and then going back to run her over as she lay helpless on the ground.  Mother-of-nine Zaynab Hussein suffered life-changing injuries in the attack in Leicester last September. Her life was saved after extensive specialist surgery but she remains confined to a bed. Paul Moore, 21, from Leicester, was found guilty at Nottingham Crown Court. Jurors also convicted him of the attempted grievous bodily harm of a 12-year-old Somali girl, for trying to drive into her minutes after the first attack. Moore - who has previous convictions and was on bail for a charge of causing grievous bodily harm when he was arrested for the attack - looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out. In the hours leading up to the attack, which happened five days after the Parsons Green attack in London, Moore had been drinking heavily with friends.  Mrs Hussein was returning home after dropping off her two youngest children at school when she was knocked down.  She was thrown by the force of the impact into the wall of a house in the Beaumont Leys area of Leicester.  In two witness statements provided from her hospital bed, she said she could feel blood on her forehead and had lost sensation in her limbs, believing them to be broken.  She tried to reach her mobile phone to call family and was crying for help. Two drivers stopped to ask if she needed help, but then drove on.  Mrs Hussein was left with a fractured pelvis, spine and multiple other injuries including severe breaks to her limbs.  Two young men who had been in the car told police that Moore, who is unemployed, had told them he wanted to run someone over. After he first hit Mrs Hussein, sending her flying, the pair jumped out of the still-moving car.  Moore performed a U-turn to return to the scene. He drove past Mrs Hussein and seeing her on the ground, he turned the car around, mounted the pavement and drove over her with all four wheels.  He then drove off again and spotted a 12-year-old Somali girl, identified by him as a Muslim because of her headscarf, walking to school with her cousin. Moore drove at her, apparently mounting the pavement again, but this time he clipped her side, sending her bag flying. The girl was unharmed but shaken.  During the trial, the jury heard that after the attack Moore turned up severely drunk at the home of his half-brother, Lewis Welsh, and told him in offensive, racist terms, why he had attacked the woman.  ""I don't think he knew what he was saying or doing. But he did tell me that he had ran over a 'Paki',"" said Mr Welsh. ""He tried to put it down to the London 7/7 bombings. He said he was proud of himself. He was rambling. He was doing the country a favour."" Mrs Hussein remains in pain and is still receiving medical treatment for her injuries - including returning to hospital for more surgery.  She and her husband are too scared to talk publicly about what happened but the wider Muslim community in the Beaumont Leys area remains in shock.  ""Everyone has been talking about how this happened - and why,"" said Zuleika, a community activist in Leicester.  She, like all the others the BBC spoke to, asked to remain anonymous because they are scared there could be another attack.  ""We are just asking ourselves who is going to be next. We have found out about other parents who have been insulted because they are Muslim. Some of them are scared and afraid to raise their voice - for every woman in this community, we now have the same fear."" Paul Moore pleaded denied attempted murder but gave the court no defence to the accusation that his crime was motivated by hate.  National statistics show that hate crime appears to have been rising over the last two years:  Part of the rise was down to better reporting but police were also sure there were spikes after major moments of tension.  The most significant of these were the EU Referendum in June 2016 and the terrorism attacks at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena and London Bridge. The Parsons Green London Underground attack came outside of the period for these statistics - but Moore's attempted murder of Mrs Hussein occurred five days later.  Azhar Qayum of Mend, a campaign organisation tackling Islamophobia, said women were particularly vulnerable to attacks, alongside elderly men, because they tended to be more visible.  ""What's happened to Mrs Hussen is very serious - but it is not an isolated case,"" he said.  ""There has been a long line of very serious crimes like this. We have had the Islamophobic murder of Mohammed Saleem in Birmingham, we have the Islamophobic murder of Mushin Ahmed in Rotherham, an 81-year-old grandfather.  ""And we have had the attack last year on worshippers at Finsbury Park. Although this is very serious, this level of seriousness is not isolated."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61976836,India state on edge after Prophet row beheading,Two Muslim men in Rajasthan killed a Hindu tailor who backed controversial remarks about the Prophet Muhammad.,30 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"India's Rajasthan state continues to be on alert following the beheading of a Hindu man by two Muslim men. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has appealed for calm and promised to take strict action against the attackers.  The victim, a tailor named Kanhaiya Lal, was killed in Udaipur district in north India on Tuesday by the men, who filmed the act and posted it online. They said the act was in response to his support for a politician's dividing remarks about the Prophet Muhammad. The National Investigative Agency - India's top anti-terrorism agency - is carrying out a probe. A senior police officer told reporters that the police had found early evidence that one of the accused men had links with a group in Pakistan. Islamabad, however, has denied such reports, calling them ""mischievous"". The BBC's Nitin Srivastava, who's in Udaipur, said the streets were empty and communities were living in fear of religious violence.  He added that there was heavy deployment of police forces across the city and senior officers were constantly appealing for peace. Most people were unprepared for a curfew, with many now struggling to get hold of even basic rations.  ""Daily wagers are worst affected,"" said Mukesh Gardiya, a local man. ""All that's happened is a big shock.""  The government has suspended internet services and banned large gatherings. Police have arrested the two men, who had identified themselves in the video. In another video, the accused boasted about the murder and also issued threats to Prime Minister Narendra Modi while brandishing cleavers. A top Rajasthan police official asked media outlets not to broadcast the video of the murder as it was ""too grisly to watch"". The men posed as customers to enter Kanhaiya Lal's shop, and attacked him while he was taking their measurements.  The victim had allegedly put up a social media post supporting former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nupur Sharma, who made controversial comments about the Prophet Muhammad last month. Her comments sparked a diplomatic row with several Islamic countries registering strong protests with India. The BJP subsequently suspended Ms Sharma from the party. The controversy also led to religious protests in India which turned violent after demonstrators threw stones and damaged public property. Three weeks before his murder, Kanhaiya Lal had been arrested by the police for allegedly hurting religious feelings, the Indian Express reported. He had asked for police protection after his release, citing threats to his life. The police then called some Hindus and Muslims for a peace meeting, after which Kanhaiya Lal said he didn't ""need any more action against any one"", a police official told the newspaper. The incident has been condemned by prominent politicians across party lines in India.  Former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who belongs to the BJP, blamed Mr Gehlot's Congress party government, saying ""a situation of communal frenzy and violence has arisen in the state"". Some BJP leaders have said they will march in the national capital Delhi to protest against the killing.  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the murder and called for immediate punishment for the attackers. Some prominent Muslim organisations have also condemned the murder. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board called the incident ""highly condemnable"", adding that it was against both Indian law as well as Islamic strictures. ""Nobody can be allowed to take the law into their hands and declaring someone a criminal and then murdering them is a highly condemnable act,"" the board said in a statement."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45114368,Criticism grows of Johnson's burka jibe,A former minister says he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became leader.,8 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is facing growing criticism over his remark that Muslim women wearing the burka ""look like letter boxes"". Dominic Grieve, the ex-attorney general, said he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became leader. Ex-Tory chairwoman Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's remarks could trigger a rise in hate crime. Senior Tories have urged him to apologise but he has not done so, and has stood by his comments. In a Daily Telegraph article, he said full-face veils should not be banned, but it was ""absolutely ridiculous"" women chose to ""go around looking like letter boxes"". He also compared them to looking like ""bank robbers"". A source close to the former London mayor has said: ""We must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues. ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" But, speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Mr Grieve - a former Remain campaigner who has previously clashed with Mr Johnson over Brexit - said his behaviour was ""very embarrassing"". Mr Grieve said he would ""without the slightest doubt"", quit the Tories if Mr Johnson became leader, ""because I don't regard him as a fit and proper person to lead a political party"". The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, has also backed calls for an apology over what she called ""gratuitously offensive"" comments.  Speaking at an event in North Berwick, East Lothian, she said: ""This wasn't an off-the-cuff slip, he wrote a column, he knew exactly what he was doing and I think it crossed from being provocative and starting a debate and actually it became rude and gratuitous. ""It's also not been shown through history that when men make sweeping statements about what women should or shouldn't wear that it goes well for them. ""I think he should apologise for them."" Earlier Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said there was no reason not to have a ""robust conversation"" about the subject, but added: ""We're not talking to our friends in the pub. We are public figures and we have an additional obligation to be careful."" A former Tory chairman, Lord Pickles, said Mr Johnson, who was foreign secretary until resigning last month over Brexit, risked ""closing down"" the debate with his ""illiberal language"". Supporters of Mr Johnson say the row is politically-motivated and that other senior Tories have made similar remarks without such criticism. By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent  By saying what he did, in the way he said it, Boris Johnson was guaranteed to provoke a reaction.  The question of what Muslim women choose to wear in public is a sensitive one, around which most politicians tread very carefully.  But Boris Johnson is not most politicians. And by using language you rarely hear in the normal course of political debate, the former foreign secretary has attracted attention and criticism.  If it was his intention to remind everyone that Boris is still Boris, not afraid to say what he thinks, despite being out of government and away on holiday, it was not without risk.  Figures show a rise in Islamophobic attacks and the Conservative party faces criticism for not addressing anti-Muslim prejudice in its own ranks.  In this context, many feel he has picked the wrong time to tackle the wrong issue.  But as ever, being outspoken is at once appealing to Boris Johnson's supporters and distasteful to his detractors.  Mr Johnson, who is the current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, has long been seen as a potential candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He fronted the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, and resigned as foreign secretary last month in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plans. Writing in the Guardian, Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""indefensible"" and ""have no place in the modern Conservative Party"". She said, although he was setting out a liberal position on the burka, he was doing it in an ""alt-right"" way, and using Muslim women as ""political fodder… to stake out a leadership bid"". ""Johnson's words… send out a message that Muslim women are fair game,"" she wrote.  But mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, said it was ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments showed a ""lack of knowledge"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""In today's day and age, the majority of the women who wear the burka are born and brought up in this country, are educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters and none of them wears a burka, adding: ""It's not a must, it's not an obligation."" Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, who wears the niqab, told BBC News: ""I absolutely have no problem with anyone disagreeing with my choice to wear it and criticising it.  ""But when you demonise and dehumanise a minority, who happen to be women of colour, I have a problem with this. ""It's not for the state, it's not for the government and it's definitely not for middle-aged white men to tell me what to wear and what not to."" Tory MP for Mansfield, Ben Bradley, said it was not the language he would have used, but added: ""Ultimately he is a journalist... and journalists want their pieces to be read.  ""They want people to talk about what they have written [and] I would say that is probably the motivation.""  Mr Johnson's former adviser Munira Mirza said Mr Johnson's views on the burka had been ""entirely consistent"" and other Conservative politicians had expressed the same view, without being called Islamophobic. In 2013 former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke - who also opposed a ban on the public wearing of burkas - said they should not be worn while giving evidence in court. He referred to burkas as a ""peculiar costume"" and a ""kind of bag"". Ms Mirza added: ""The reality is there is a political fight here. People who frankly couldn't care less about the issues that Muslim women face are piling into Boris because Boris said it."" Conservative MP Conor Burns also defended Mr Johnson, accusing his political colleagues of ""bandwagon jumping"". The member for Bournemouth West tweeted those who criticised the former foreign secretary ""clearly didn't understand"" his comments. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Last year, Zaynab Hussein, a mother from Leicester, was left fighting for her life after a man she didn't know smashed into her with his car - and then ran over her again. She was attacked because she was a Muslim.  Tell Mama, the national organisation that collects anti-Muslim attack statistics, says that the majority of street victims of such abuse and violence are women, for the same reason that Mrs Hussein was singled out: some Muslim women are easily identifiable by their mode of dress - and therefore easy to target.  Seven years ago Baroness Warsi said prejudice against Muslims had passed the ""dinner table test"".  And Mr Johnson's critics regard his ""letter box"" and ""bank robber"" comments as part of the problem the peer defined: normalising prejudice and dehumanising women, rather than calmly debating the complexities of the veil in an open society.  Since Baroness Warsi's warning, there has been the launch of a cross-departmental working group to tackle anti-Muslim hate. But it has been criticised as toothless, not least because the government can't agree a definition for Islamophobia.  In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West, and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-12375175,Eyewitness: EDL return to Luton,"What happened when the English Defence League staged a ""homecoming"" demonstration in Luton?",6 Feb 2011,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"This video can not be played Abdul Salaam supports the EDL even though he says he is a Muslim Abdul Salaam is not exactly the kind of person the English Defence League expected to recruit. But there he was, a Muslim willing to stand in the middle of a crowd chanting ""Muslim Bombers off our Streets"".  We found Glaswegian Abdul in Luton's St George's Square - and he explained why he, a follower of Islam, was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with an organisation accused of Islamophobia.  ""The EDL are supporting England, supporting Britain, and I'm British, so why can't I support my country?"" he said.  ""Have you seen me getting any racist abuse? They applauded me. Why are other Muslims not here? This demonstration is nothing to do with colour or religion. These are people who have watched their country being bombed and they are angry. These are patriotic Englishmen, red-blooded Englishmen."" EDL divisions: Groups from all over the UK Mr Salaam said he wasn't particularly assiduous about praying five times a day - and that he probably didn't get to a mosque as much as he should. But he insisted he was a true Muslim who thought deeply about his faith - and it was his duty to speak out alongside the EDL.  ""I'm here to support Britain and to defend Islam as well,"" he said. ""There are people who, under the name of Islam, blew up trains. They're not Muslims, they're hypocrites. When people have dragged Islam through the mud, it's my duty to speak out as a Muslim."" This was not the demonstration the EDL hoped it would be.  The police say there were 1,500 EDL supporters in the town, plus another 1,000 in the Unite Against Fascism counter-demonstration.  What had been billed as a demonstration ""Back To Where It All Began"" did not have the air of a triumphant movement sweeping all before it.  The EDL is almost two years old - but police forces have now developed tactics to prevent a repeat of some of the early three-way violent clashes between EDL supporters, anti-racism campaigners and fired-up young Muslim men.  The risk of those clashes disappeared behind massive steel barriers that the police used to seal the EDL in to St George's Square. They wanted to make a show in the hometown of their founders - but there was nobody around to see it.  On the streets of England: Police barrier in Luton Luton was a ghost town. Large parts were deserted from 10am. Police had warned businesses what to expect - and owners shut up and boarded up. The massive Â£800,000 police operation worked - but at some cost to the local economy.  But many of the EDL's supporters who turned out for the speeches thought it was still a day well spent. Their leaders described the movement as a bulwark against terrorism. They praised Prime Minister David Cameron's speech earlier the same day, in which he attacked multiculturalism.  Stephen Lennon, aka Tommy Robinson, one of the movement's founders, looked on chuffed as the crowd sang about joining ""Tommy's revolution"".  The EDL's leaders say the movement isn't racist - but many of the placards were pretty offensive to the few ordinary Muslims who saw them. And with the British National Party suffering internal battles, the organisation is now attracting the attention of a wide spread of international far right anti-Islamic activists.  Among those who had flown in was the bearded figure of Nachum Shifren, a controversial Los Angeles Rabbi.  ""I'm a supporter of the EDL,"" he said, standing next to a group of cropped-haired men from the EDL's Walsall, Leeds and Essex ""divisions"".  ""I see radical Islam popping up, I see governments caving in to it. I see a lot of lawlessness going on because of political correctness. ""I believe in the EDL and I don't want England to go the way of Paris. Do you realise there is a mile down the street where I cannot walk and get out alive?"" He was referring to Bury Park, the heart of Luton's Muslim communities - and this claim of ""no go"" areas for white people around the country was repeated time and time again by EDL members we interviewed.  Communities in fear But when we went to Bury Park, it was fairly clear that it was the local Muslim residents who were scared.  Standing by in Bury Park: Young men on the watch Just like in town, entire parades of shops had closed. Women and children were nowhere to be seen on what should have been the busiest day of the week.  Men and teenage boys were out in some force, nervously looking in the direction of the town centre and the police lines at the bottom of the hill.  Conspicuous by their absence, though, was the small group of hardcore Islamists whose 2009 protest against soldiers returning to Luton from Afghanistan had caused so much anger across the town. Stewards - one of whom was a local Christian clergyman - politely asked visitors to identify themselves - but also asked anti-racist campaigners to keep out to avoid inflaming tensions.  Jangir Khan, chairman of the Bury Park Business Association, was among those involved in organising the community's security - but like everyone else, he wasn't happy.  ""This is the busiest day of the week for the local economy,"" he said. ""If you close, then you lose 100% of income. Those who've stayed open have probably lost 90% because nobody is coming out. They are stuck in their homes.  ""We asked for the EDL to be banned from this town and the police said it couldn't be done. Well what about our human rights to go about our daily lives without fear?"" Some young men had travelled down from Birmingham, presenting themselves as the ""Muslim Defence League"". They were small in number and did not attempt to stage a public show of strength.  Overall, the Bury Park community had decided, in the words of one local leader, to make a dignified stand together, rather than to puff out their chests and make confrontational noises.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-46566836,Week ahead in Parliament,"The week will see another punishing session for the prime minister in the Commons, as she reports back on the EU summit.",14 Dec 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Will the aftershocks of a tumultuous Westminster week reverberate through what looks like quite a humdrum end of term agenda in Parliament?  One persistent rumour is that angry Tory Brexiteers may strike back at the government by failing to turn up to a vote at some point in the week - they could, for example, go on strike during the vote on the second reading of the Mental Capacity Bill, on Tuesday, where the bill would be lost if Labour's fatal amendment is passed.  This would be an alarming signal that the government had effectively lost the ability to govern - but it would not take many Conservatives to go AWOL to ensure defeat, if things really have got that embittered.  In an interview for Friday night's Today in Parliament on BBC Radio 4, I asked one senior Brexiteer, Mark Francois, an ex-whip, about this idea. His response? That no good whip disclosed their strategy in advance. So watch out. In that spirit, the prime minister's statement on Monday, reporting back on the latest EU summit, will return her to her Commons Groundhog Day, assailed from all sides by her critics.  Until now the key voice has always been the DUP Leader Nigel Dodds - without his support she will not have a majority for her Brexit deal -  so look out for signs that she is seeking support elsewhere, perhaps from Labour MPs who fear the consequences of a No-Deal Brexit. Another big Brexit event will be the publication of the long-awaited Immigration white paper - and the accompanying Commons statement from the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid.  This is probably the single most sensitive policy area arising from Brexit and the focus will be on how the home secretary balances the conflicting priorities of cutting immigration and providing workers for key industries - and he can expect both sides of the argument to be put by Conservative colleagues, as well as by opposition MPs.  And in the background there are increasing numbers of important statutory instruments being put through Parliament to prepare for the possibility of no deal; in the financial services area alone, 70 will go through between the end of October and February 2019..... Here's my rundown of the week ahead: The Commons begins its final week of term (2.30pm) with Education questions, but the big event will be the prime minister's report back on the latest EU summit - and any concessions she has achieved which might defuse some of the critics of her Brexit deal. Another day, another long, gruelling Commons statement for the PM.  Then MPs debate a series of motions to approve a series of regulations on online pornography, including on age verification and ""Ancillary providers"" - ie pornography delivered via social media. There is 90 minutes set aside to discuss each of these orders, and the result may be an unusually substantial debate.   My committee pick is Public Accounts Committee hearing on the Windrush generation and the Home Office (4pm).  Since the PAC mandate is to examine the effectiveness and efficiency with which policy is implemented, this hearing will not carry the emotional charge that this issue would bring to an inquiry by another select committee - but the officials and lawyers due to give evidence can expect a searching interrogation about how well they have performed their roles.   Meanwhile, increasingly important business is being done in obscure bodies called Delegated Legislation Committees. It all sounds horribly technical and bureaucratic but at 4.30pm the First Delegated Legislation Committee is discussing something called the Draft Markets in Financial Instruments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 - this turns out to be something like 30,000 pages of financial regulations which will have to be in place to keep the financial services industry running, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  They cover things like the concept of ""best execution"" the requirement for the industry to secure the best price for their clients when selling shares. Labour wanted this debated on the floor of the Commons, arguing that it is simply too sprawling to be dealt with off-stage in a committee, but the government is not keen.  And a little later, down the corridor, the Tenth DLC is discussing the Draft Gaming Machines (miscellaneous amendments and revocation) order, which looks suspiciously like the legal mechanism for implementing the government's retreat on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals. You will remember that the Sports Minister Tracy Crouch resigned over the slowness with which they were acting to remove FOBTs from the High Street. In the Lords (2.30pm) the normal half hour of questions to ministers is followed by a debate on the Privileges and Conduct Select Committee's Further Report on the conduct of Lord Lester of Herne Hill - this antiseptic title hardly does justice to the angst around this subject.  The Further Report is an eviscerating rebuttal of the arguments used to reject the previous report on the sexual harassment allegations against the former Lib Dem peer (he resigned the party whip).  The rejection was based on the argument that the woman who made the complaint should have been cross examined - the committee's retort is worth quoting: ""In arriving at this conclusion, we reflected on the cogent argument of Lord Lester himself in this House in 2009 in a case where the lawyers for Lord Taylor of Blackburn argued that Lord Taylor had been denied basic procedural safeguards guaranteed by domestic and international law, including the right to test the evidence against him through cross-examination. Lord Lester then argued that it was entirely misguided to say (amongst other things) that cross-examination was an essential safeguard in proceedings involving possible suspension from the House. Lord Lester was right in that case, and it is equally true of the present case."" But part of the reason this debate will be so charged is that many women peers (and a group of House of Lords staff whose letter to the committee is quoted in the report) believe the dry arguments about proper process shaded into outright misogyny - and they're furious, with a number of male peers likely to face strong criticism for their speeches in the previous debate.  I'm told a group of women peers have organised to make sure this report is approved and one will be asking if, having retired, rather than face the proposed sanctions, Lord Lester will still be allowed to come into the House and use its facilities.  After that, peers turn to the detail of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Bill in the second day of report stage consideration. Labour have a three-line whip on for the amendments about the Prevent programme and the proscription of terrorist organisations.  And the Green party peer, Jenny Jones, has an amendment down about not allowing journalists' material to be seized by border guards. MPs open (11.30am) with Justice questions. The Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour's Geraint Davies - the European Union (Revocation of Notification of Withdrawal) Bill - does what it says on the tin; it requires the PM to revoke Britain's Article 50 Notice of with withdrawal, unless a Brexit deal is approved by Parliament by January 21st, and the deal has been approved in a referendum.  Then MPs turn to the second reading of the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill, which deals with the protections and safeguards around the deprivation of cared-for people.  It has already been through the House of Lords, where extra protections and rights to raise concern were added in, but not enough, it seems, for Labour, who have put down an amendment acknowledging some improvement but still declining to give it a second reading.  In particular they complain that the bill does not do enough to deal with a ""substantial backlog"" of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Assessments. If this is pushed to a vote, the results might be interesting.  In Westminster Hall debates on Traidcraft and the future of fair trade (9.30am) and mental health support for firefighters (2.30pm) caught my eye; the latter is led by Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad, so it will undoubtedly address the consequences of the Grenfell Tower disaster for the emergency services personnel who were on the scene. On the committee corridor, the Justice Committee (10am) hears from Lisa Osofsky, the director of the much-criticised Serious Fraud Office.  And the Defence Committee continues its inquiry into Mental Health and the Armed Forces, with evidence from one of its own members, the former army officer Johnny Mercer, and the Veterans Minister, Tobias Ellwood, another ex-army officer. The committee is increasingly concerned that veterans are waiting for a year or more for mental health treatment, in some parts of the country. Their report, due next year, looks set to be, in the words of one committee member, ""a humdinger"". In the Lords (2.30pm) questions to ministers include the Conservative historian Lord Lexden continuing his campaign to clear the name of the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath - by asking whether the government has received any new information about the seven allegations against him left open at the end of Operation Conifer.  He will be pressing for a debate on a motion to convene an independent inquiry, if answers are not forthcoming. Then comes report stage consideration of the Upskirting Bill - formally, the Voyeurism (Offences) (No. 2) Bill. This is likely to be brief with no amendments submitted at the time of writing.  Peers then turn to two statutory instruments, both with motions attached. The first is from Labour's Lord Foulkes on the Operation of Air Services SI - it expresses concern over the effect of a no-deal Brexit. The second SI has a regret motion from Labour peer Lord Beecham on non-contentious probate fees. But it also has a fatal motion from the Lib Dems on which Labour will abstain - peers find it much easier to sound warning notes against SIs than to reject them outright.  There are six further SIs, on gaming machines; accounts and reports; and statutory and third country auditors; and then three on human fertilisation and embryology, human tissue and safety of transplant organs, which will be taken as a job lot The Commons day begins (11.30am) with the de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington, taking a mini-question time in his role as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and minister for the Cabinet Office. Then comes the boss, at noon, for the final Prime Minister's Questions of 2018.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative ex-nurse, Maria Caulfield would require defibrillators to be placed in schools, leisure centres and other public facilities.  The main debates are on two motions chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - first calling on the government to produce a cumulative impact assessment of changes to disability support, and then a motion calling on the government to change the law to ""provide clarity that an employers' first aid responsibilities cover both physical and mental health.""  Both could be pushed to a vote. My committee pick is Treasury Committee's joint session with the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee (2.15pm) to look at the package of measures announced in the Budget, last month, to help the High Street.  The key witness is Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride. It's another example of the increasing trend for cooperation between committees, where an issue cuts across their territories, and the resulting report (which will doubtless also draw on the HCLG Committee's parallel inquiry into the future of the high street) could carry some considerable clout.  In the Lords (3pm), peers will be discussing two private members' bills - first the detail of the Age of Criminal Responsibility Bill, proposed by the Lib Dem peer, Lord Dholakia.  This would raise the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales from 10 to 12. At the moment, children under 10 cannot be arrested or charged with a crime, while children aged between 10 and 17 are dealt with by youth courts, given different sentences if convicted, and sent to special secure centres for young people, not adult prisons. Lord Dholakia has attempted to pass similar measures in previous years.  The government line during his earlier attempts was that children of that could, mostly, distinguish between bad behaviour and serious wrong-doing, and should be held accountable for their actions.  The government has also argued that the public must have confidence in the youth justice system and know that offending will be dealt with effectively.  Next, what will probably be a brief, ritual third reading for the Crossbencher Baroness Deech's Divorce (Financial Provision) Bill, which would introduce, as a fair starting point, the equal division of all the property and pensions acquired by the couple after marriage, make provision for short-term maintenance, give the flexibility to allow the marital home to be retained for the carer and children, and allow binding pre-nuptial agreements. Then come debates on subjects chosen by backbench Conservative peers -  firstly, on sports, recreation and the arts' contribution to society wellbeing, led by the former sports minister, Lord Moynihan; and secondly, on the threat of plastic to the environment and the case for improved recycling, led by Baroness Neville-Rolfe.  It's the last day of term, when, by tradition, MPs are allowed to bring in games.....proceedings open (9.30am) with half an hour of International Trade questions, followed by Women and Equalities questions, and then the weekly Business Statement, from the Leader of the House.  The key point of interest is whether and when the government will schedule the resumption of the ""Meaningful Vote"" debate, on the prime minister's Brexit deal.  The main debate will be on the UN report on the Rohingya refugee crisis, on a motion calling on the government to put pressure on the UN to prevent refugees from Myanmar being repatriated back into unsafe conditions - Conservative Anne Main and Labour MP Rushanara Ali lead proceedings,  In an interesting move, the traditional general debate the forthcoming adjournment, in which any MP can speak about any subject, has been bumped from the Chamber to Westminster Hall - where a minister will painstakingly note down a galaxy of different issues and promise responses from the relevant ministers.  By its very nature the debate never produces a vote, and with very limited chamber time available to the Backbench Business Committee, they have clearly opted to prioritise voteable motions for chamber debate.  In the Lords (11am), question time includes the crossbench or independent peer Baroness Boycott asking ministers what steps they've taken to ensure healthy and nutritious food does not become more expensive after Brexit.  Then there are balloted debates on subjects chosen by backbench peers.  First, Lord Sheikh on the Impact of Islamophobia in the UK; the second Lord Campbell-Savours on the remit and arrangements for handling of evidence by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse. The lunch time mini debate led by Lord Berkeley is on the tendering process for the building of five new Type 31e frigates and the impact on the Appledore Shipyard. Then, unless plans change, and they might, Honourable Members and Noble Lords depart for the Christmas break - and will return on Monday 7 January."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57404388,Canada truck attack: Muslim family victims named,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned Sunday's attack as authorities weigh terrorism charges.,8 Jun 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has identified the four members of a Muslim family killed in a ""premeditated"" attack on Sunday. Madiha Salman, 44, her husband Salman Afzaal, 46, their 15-year-old daughter Yumna Afzaal and Mr Afzaal's 74-year-old mother were hit by a vehicle while on an evening walk in London, Ontario. Mr Trudeau condemned the attack as an act of terror.  The couple's nine-year-old son survived and is in hospital with injuries.   The attack was the worst against Canadian Muslims since six people were killed in a Quebec City mosque in 2017. A 20-year-old Canadian man has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. Police said the family is believed to have been targeted because of their Muslim faith. Authorities are weighing possible terrorism charges for what is thought to be a hate crime.  Speaking in the Canadian House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Trudeau decried ""a terrorist attack motivated by hatred, in the heart of one of our communities"".   ""If anyone thinks racism and hatred don't exist in this country, I want to say this: how do we explain such violence to a child in a hospital? How can we look families in the eye and say, 'Islamophobia isn't real'?"" he said.  A vigil has been planned for Thursday evening at the London mosque the family attended.  Three generations of the Afzaal family were killed on Sunday while out for an evening walk. Five family members were waiting to cross an intersection along London's Hyde Park Road when the truck mounted the curb and hit them, police said.   Family and friends told CBC News that the family had been deeply involved in their community and committed to their faith.  After graduating from the London Islamic School last year, 15-year-old Yumna was in the ninth grade at Oakridge Secondary School.  At Oakridge, Yumna was slated to become a Grade 10 representative on the Muslim Students Association, the organisation's president told CBC.  Yumna's mother, Ms Salman, had recently completed a post-graduate degree in civil and environmental engineering at Western University in London, according to her LinkedIn page. Her goal was to work on solving ""geo-environmental issues"" and ""contribute towards reclamation of our natural environment"".  Salman Afzaal was ""humble"" and loyal to his community, a friend told CBC.  The name of Mr Afzaal's 74-year-old mother has not yet been released.  The couple's nine-year-old son was the only family member present who is expected to survive. He remains seriously injured in hospital.  Police named the alleged attacker as Nathanial Veltman, 20, of London, Ontario. He was arrested without incident at a shopping centre about 6km (4.8 miles) from the crime scene.  It is not yet known if the suspect has ties to any hate groups, said Det Supt Waight.  ""There is no known previous connection between the suspect and the victims,"" Det Supt Waight said, adding that the suspect was wearing a vest that appeared to be ""like body armour"".  Police said Mr Veltman had no previous convictions. Officials added that there was good weather and high visibility conditions when the black truck was seen mounting the kerb on Hyde Park Road at around 20:40 local time on Sunday. One witness told CTV News she had to shield her young daughter's eyes from the bodies. ""There were people everywhere and running,"" said Paige Martin. ""Citizens were trying to direct the emergency vehicles where to go. There was a lot of pointing and screaming and arm waving."" A 2016 census found that London - a city about 200km (125 miles) south-west of Toronto - is growing increasingly diverse. One in five people was born outside of Canada, with Arabs being the area's largest minority group, and South Asians coming in a close second. Mr Trudeau addressed parliament in the wake of the attack, describing a ""brutal, cowardly, and brazen act of violence"". The perpetrator ""does not represent us as Canadians"", the prime minister said, but he dismissed the notion that this type of violence is not ""Canadian"" - a sentiment echoed by Canada's opposition leaders.  ""We need to look this in the face - this hate does exist in our country,"" Mr Trudeau said.  London Mayor Ed Holder was among those who paid tribute to the victims, saying: ""This was an act of mass murder, perpetrated against Muslims, against Londoners, and rooted in unspeakable hatred.  Mayor Holder said he was speaking ""on behalf of all Londoners when I say our hearts are broken"".  ""We grieve for the family, three generations of whom are now deceased."" The mayor's statement added that he had ordered flags outside London City Hall to be lowered for three days of mourning. It is not the first time members of the Muslim community in Canada have come under attack. In January 2017, a Canadian man fatally shot six worshippers at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre, and seriously injured five others. The perpetrator was sentenced to life in prison.  Canada's deadliest vehicle-ramming attack happened in 2018, when a self-described ""incel"" (involuntary celibate) ploughed his van into a group of pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 people."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55331063,Burchill's book about cancel culture cancelled,"Julie Burchill's publisher says the writer ""crossed a line with regard to race and religion"".",16 Dec 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The publisher of a book about cancel culture by Julie Burchill has cancelled it after the writer was accused of Islamophobia on Twitter. The book, Welcome to the Woke Trials, had been due to be published by Little, Brown in April. But Burchill got embroiled with a row with fellow writer Ash Sarkar. Little, Brown said her comments were ""not defensible from a moral or intellectual standpoint"" and ""crossed a line with regard to race and religion"". A statement from the company said: ""We will no longer be publishing Julie Burchill's book. This is not a decision we have taken lightly.  ""We believe passionately in freedom of speech at Little, Brown and we have always published authors with controversial or challenging perspectives - and we will continue to do so. ""While there is no legal definition of hate speech in the UK, we believe that Julie's comments on Islam are not defensible from a moral or intellectual standpoint, that they crossed a line with regard to race and religion, and that her book has now become inextricably linked with those views."" Writing on Facebook, Burchill said the publishers had told her there was ""also a concern that the line might be crossed again during the promotion of the book"", to which she added: ""I'LL SAY!"" Sarkar accused Burchill of Islamophobia after the Sunday Telegraph columnist made comments about the age of one of the Prophet Muhammad's wives. According to Little, Brown's official description, Welcome to the Woke Trials was inspired by the ""vitriolic reaction"" Burchill received in response to an article she wrote for The Observer in 2013, after which she was ""pursued by the outrage mob"". The publisher billed it as ""part-memoir and part-indictment of what happened to Burchill between then and now, as the regiments of the woke took over""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56325254,French teen admits lying about murdered teacher,The student admits she was not in class when Samuel Paty showed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.,9 Mar 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A French schoolgirl has admitted to spreading false claims about a teacher before he was murdered last year. Samuel Paty was beheaded in October after showing students cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The girl, whose complaints sparked an online campaign against Paty, has now admitted that she was not in the class. Mr Paty's killing stunned France and led to an outpouring of support at memorial ceremonies and marches around the country. The 13-year-old girl, who has not been officially named, originally told her father that Paty had asked Muslim students to leave the classroom while he showed the cartoon during a class on free speech and blasphemy. According to evidence given by the girl seen by French media she said: ""I didn't see the cartoons, it was a girl in my class who showed me them."" ""She lied because she felt trapped in a spiral because her classmates had asked her to be a spokesperson,"" her lawyer, Mbeko Tabula, told AFP news agency. The girl's father filed a legal complaint against the teacher and began a social media campaign over the incident based on his daughter's account. He identified Paty and the school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, west of Paris. Prosecutors said shortly after the killing that there was a ""direct causal link"" between the online incitement against Paty and his murder. The perpetrator, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack. It then emerged that the campaign against the history and geography teacher had been based on a distorted account of what had happened in class days earlier. As he had done in similar lessons on free speech in previous years, Paty warned students that he was about to show a depiction of Muhammad. He said anyone who thought they might be offended could close their eyes.  The girl had originally claimed the teacher had asked Muslim pupils to leave the room. When she objected she was suspended from school, she said. It now appears that the girl was suspended the day before the class was given, according to Le Parisien newspaper, because of repeated absence from school. The girl explains in her leaked testimony that she made up the story so as not to disappoint her father. He posted two videos on social media in response to the allegations. Speaking on French radio on Tuesday, the Paty family's lawyer said the girl's family knew that she had not been in class on the day in question and why she had been suspended. ""So to come and say now, sorry, I believed my daughter's lies, that's really weak,"" Virginie Le Roy told RTL radio. In a separate development, two university professors have been given police protection after they were accused of Islamophobia by student protesters.  An investigation has begun after posters were put up last week at Sciences Po university in Grenoble that read ""Fascists in our lecture halls, Islamophobia kills"", naming the two professors. Junior Interior Minister Marlène Schiappa said their lives were in danger and the campaign was reminiscent of the harassment of Samuel Paty. ""We can't tolerate this kind of thing,"" she said. After Paty's murder, President Emmanuel Macron presented the teacher's family with the nation's highest honour, the Légion d'honneur. Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are considered highly offensive by Muslims. The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet.  Twelve people were killed by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015 after the images were published. Both the Charlie Hebdo murders and Samuel Paty's beheading struck a deep chord in a country where secularism - or laïcité - is central to national identity. Under that principle, the state cannot intervene in matters of religion, and thus should not curb expression to protect the feelings of a particular community."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65650435,What's happening in Parliament this week?,MPs and peers gear up for a whole lot of haggling over new laws over the next few weeks.,19 May 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"There's going to be a whole lot of ping-pong going on in Parliament in the next few weeks.  The process of getting agreement between the two houses of Parliament on new laws is an exotic-sounding exercise, which involves bills bouncing between them until the final wording on critical details is agreed.  It may be hard for outside observers to follow - particularly because much of the real action is in behind-the-scenes talks between the parties - but it matters a lot.  This week's ping-pong involves the Retained EU Law Bill and the Strikes Bill, but there will be plenty more to come, when peers grind their way through some of the biggest draft laws before them, including the Illegal Migration Bill, the Levelling Up Bill, and the Online Safety Bill.   MPs are invited to accept or reject changes made in the Lords - sometimes rejection can be a flat ""no"".  Sometimes, the government majority in the Commons offers an ""amendment in lieu"" - a compromise proposal.  Peers then decide whether to take rejection of their amendments on the chin, accepting the will of the elected Commons, or to offer an alternative, usually watered down, version of their original change. There's no limit to how long this can go on; it tends to go to a couple of rounds, but where positions are entrenched, ping-pong can grind on for quite a while.  Grizzled veterans of the Commons still shudder at the memory of the seven rounds of ping-pong over the 2007 Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act - and there is no doubt that on the Strikes Bill, the Illegal Migration Bill and on retained EU law, positions are very entrenched. So this week's ping pong may just be Act One. It's been an odd little on-off interlude in Parliament, with MPs and peers breaking for Easter, then the Coronation, and, at the end of the coming week, for their Whitsun Recess.  They then have a decent run of unbroken legislating, with eight weeks from their return on 5 June to the start of the Summer Recess at the close of business on 26 July. Commons: (14:30 BST) Home Office Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements (a report-back on the G7 Summit by the prime minister?) following at 15:30. Main debate: Committee of the Whole House on the Non-Domestic Rating Bill. This introduces more frequent valuations for business rates - every three years rather than every five - and creates a new business rates improvement relief. That's followed by consideration of Lords amendments to the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill.  The government will be seeking to overturn four defeats in the Lords: on limiting the application of the bill to England only; on removing protections from unions that fail to take reasonable steps to ensure their members comply with work notices (peers took that bit out); on making failure to comply with a work notice a breach of contract and grounds for dismissal, and on requiring consultation before the government can specify minimum service levels to be maintained during industrial action.  Expect all of these to be bounced back to the Lords. Westminster Hall: (16:30) MPs debate two e-petitions on the cost of living for people with disabilities. The first calls for an energy grant to people with a disability or serious medical condition, on the argument that there are millions of people whose condition means they use a lot of energy, for example to power ventilators, wheelchairs, stair lifts or bath seats. The second argues that disabled people should be included alongside carers in the £650 one-off payment as part of the Cost of Living support package.  Lords: (14:30) A brief Third Reading rubber stamping of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill (expect the Lords amendments limiting the government's powers to revoke inherited EU law to be reversed in the Commons on Wednesday). Then peers resume their long march through the detail of the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill, with day 14 of its marathon Committee Stage. Commons: (11:30) Energy Security and Net Zero Questions. Ten-Minute Rule Bill: Conservative MP Anna Firth wants to require people in charge of dogs to take all reasonable steps to ensure that their dog doesn't fatally injure another dog. Main Debate: A Labour Opposition Day motion or motions, to be announced.  Westminster Hall: Former minister Kevin Foster has a debate on short-term holiday lets and the planning system (09:30). Committees: Health (10:00) quizzes minister Maria Caulfield on declining vaccination uptake. Treasury (10.15) has one of its regular sessions with Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, where they will examine the latest interest rate increase. Business and Trade (10:30) hear from representatives of the UK's car and electric vehicle battery manufacturing sector. Foreign Affairs (14:30) hears evidence of the possibility of war crime charges relating to the Ukraine war from Andriy Kostin, the country's prosecutor-general.  Lords: (14:30) Peers complete their consideration of the Northern Ireland (Interim Arrangements) Bill, the latest measure to fill the gaps left by the lack of devolved government there. Then it's back to the detail of the Online Safety Bill - with the eighth of 10 Committee Stage days. Commons: (11:30) Wales Questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time. Ten-Minute Rule Bill: Conservative Gareth Johnson wants courts to be able to ban disruptive passengers from flying.  Main Debate: Consideration of Lords amendments to the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill - the law to reprocess or revoke laws inherited from the UK's 40 year membership. The government will be seeking to reverse four Lords defeats: two involved the creation of a committee of MPs and peers to refer major changes for debate; another is about allowing Parliament and the devolved legislatures to prevent the automatic revocation of retained EU rights, powers and liabilities and to require that environmental protections and food standards must not be reduced. The Commons would normally deal with Lords amendments at quite a brisk pace - suggesting there may be room for some late addition to the agenda.  Westminster Hall: Labour MP Fleur Anderson, whose Putney constituency is directly under the flightpath, leads a debate on the future of Heathrow Airport (16:30).  Committees: Science, Innovation and Technology (09:30) look at the Metropolitan Police's use of live facial recognition technology, during the Coronation, and potential future AI-based tools. Transport (09:30) questions Rail Minister Huw Merriman on how the Strikes Bill applies to rail services. Human Rights (15:00) holds a one-off session on the legal status of assisted dying in the UK and elsewhere, and how the human rights legal framework applies.  Lords: (15:00) Another day, another bill facing a long committee stage. This time it's the Illegal Migration Bill and this is day one of five. Commons: (09:30) Environment Food and Rural Affair Questions, and Questions to the Attorney General, followed by the weekly update on the forthcoming Commons agenda from the Leader of the House. Main Debate: Backbench debate on recognition of the 1930s Great Famine in Ukraine, known as the Holodomor, when millions of Ukrainians died during the forced collectivisation of farms by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. That's followed by a general debate on tackling Islamophobia.  Committees: Public Accounts (09:30) questions the main players in the administration and eventual acquisition by Octopus Energy of Bulb Energy - the largest of the many UK energy supplier collapses as the energy crisis took hold in 2021, with the taxpayer and bill payers on the hook for the £3 billion costs of the process.  Lords: (11:00) Online Safety Bill - day nine of committee stage. Neither House sits on Friday 26 May - and with Parliament taking its Whitsun Recess, MPs and peers will not return until Monday 5 June."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55095956,Court reduces sentence of Quebec City mosque shooter,"Alexandre Bissonnette will be eligible for parole after 25 years, down from 40 years.",27 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Canadian court has reduced the sentence of the man behind a 2017 shooting at a Quebec City mosque. Alexandre Bissonnette was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences last year for killing six people and seriously injuring five others. Quebec's highest court struck down the consecutive sentences, calling it ""cruel and unusual"". The appeal court's ruling means he will be eligible for parole in 25 years, instead of 40. Bissonnette turns 31 this week. In January 2017, he stormed into the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre and shot at those gathered for prayers. The attack shook the nation, and raised questions about Islamophobia in Quebec as well as in other parts of the country. He pleaded guilty to the attack. ""I am ashamed of what I did,"" Bissonnette told a Quebec courtroom at the time. ""I am not a terrorist, I am not an Islamophobe."" In Canada, a life sentence allows for parole eligibility after 25 years.  In 2011, the law was amended to allow judges to impose consecutive sentences instead of concurrent, for multiple murders. That means that judges could extend the period before parole eligibility beyond 25 years. Consecutive sentences have only been applied a handful of times in Canada since the law was amended, including a judge handing down a 75-year prison sentence for a man who pleaded guilty to killing three police officers in 2014. Thursday's ruling could have widespread repercussions. In a unanimous and sharply written decision, the Quebec court found they violated the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically the sections that protect the life and security of a person and against ""cruel and unusual"" punishment.  The justices wrote that the possibility of sentencing someone to a prison term longer than their life span was ""absurd."" ""This nonsense cannot survive and constitutes, in itself, cruel and unusual punishment, degrading because of its absurd nature,"" they wrote.  The ruling only has jurisdiction in Quebec, but if it were to be appealed and go to the country's supreme court, the sentencing issue could find a national stage."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51112238,Twitter sorry for letting adverts target neo-Nazis,Social network apologises for allowing the use of discriminatory ad keywords it had meant to ban.,16 Jan 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Twitter has apologised for allowing adverts to be micro-targeted at certain users such as neo-Nazis, homophobes and other hate groups. The BBC discovered the issue and that prompted the tech firm to act. Our investigation found it possible to target users who had shown an interest in keywords including ""transphobic"", ""white supremacists"" and ""anti-gay"". Twitter allows ads to be directed at users who have posted about or searched for specific topics. But the firm has now said it is sorry for failing to exclude discriminatory terms. Anti-hate charities had raised concerns that the US tech company's advertising platform could have been used to spread intolerance. Like many social media companies, Twitter creates detailed profiles of its users by collecting data on the things they post, like, watch and share. Advertisers can take advantage of this by using its tools to select their campaign audience from a list of characteristics, for example ""parents of teenagers"", or ""amateur photographers"". They can also control who sees their message by using keywords. Twitter gives the advertiser an estimate for how many users are likely to qualify as a result. For example, a car website wanting to reach people using the term ""petrolhead"" would be told that the potential audience is between 140,000 and 172,000 people. Twitter's keywords were supposed to be restricted.  But our tests showed that it was possible to advertise to people using the term ""neo-Nazi"".  The ad tool had indicated that in the UK, this would target a potential audience of 67,000 to 81,000 people.  Other more offensive terms were also an option. We created a generic advert from an anonymous Twitter account, saying ""Happy New Year"".  We then targeted three different audiences based on sensitive keywords. Twitter's website said that ads on its platform would be reviewed prior to being launched, and the BBC's ad initially went into a ""pending"" state.  But soon afterwards, it was approved and ran for a few hours until we stopped it.  In that time, 37 users saw the post and two of them clicked on a link attached, which directed them to a news article about memes. Running the ad cost £3.84. Targeting an advert using other problematic keywords seemed to be just as easy to do.  A campaign using the keywords ""islamophobes"", ""islamaphobia"", ""islamophobic"" and '#islamophobic' had a potential to reach 92,900 to 114,000 Twitter users, according to Twitter's tool. Advertising to vulnerable groups was also possible.  We ran the same advert to an audience of 13 to 24-year-olds using the keywords ""anorexic"", ""bulimic"", ""anorexia"" and ""bulimia"".  Twitter estimated the target audience amounted to 20,000 people. The post was seen by 255 users, and 14 people clicked on the link before we stopped it. Hope Not Hate, an anti-extremism charity, said it feared that Twitter's ads could become a propaganda tool for the far-right. ""I can see this being used to promote engagement and deepen the conviction of individuals who have indicated some or partial agreement with intolerant causes or ideas,"" said Patrik Hermansson, its social media researcher. The eating disorder charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care added that it believed the ad tool had already been abused. ""I've been talking about my eating disorder on social media for a few years now and been targeted many times with adverts based on dietary supplements, weight loss supplements, spinal corrective surgery,"" said Daniel Magson, the organisation's chairman. ""It's quite triggering for me, and I'm campaigning to get it stopped through Parliament. So, it's great news that Twitter has now acted."" The social network said it had policies in place to avoid the abuse of keyword targeting, but acknowledged they had not been applied correctly. ""[Our] preventative measures include banning certain sensitive or discriminatory terms, which we update on a continuous basis,"" it said in a statement. ""In this instance, some of these terms were permitted for targeting purposes. This was an error. ""We're very sorry this happened and as soon as we were made aware of the issue, we rectified it.  ""We continue to enforce our ads policies, including restricting the promotion of content in a wide range of areas, including inappropriate content targeting minors."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51709197,Tory members suspended over Islamophobia claims,A report by Hope not Hate appears to show anti-Muslim online comments made by Tory members.,2 Mar 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservative Party has suspended a number of its members following allegations of Islamophobia. A dossier compiled by the campaign group Hope Not Hate appears to show anti-Muslim online comments made by Tory members, including six councillors. It lists more than 20 names, but it is understood not all belong to the party. The Tories say they have suspended all of those who were party members, pending investigation. But the Conservatives have not confirmed how many members have been suspended. The Conservatives launched an inquiry into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party at the end of last year - following repeated calls for it to do so. It came after incidents had been highlighted to the party and in the media. In Hope Not Hate's dossier, an online post allegedly from an ex-councillor says: ""Moslems do not deserve 'Human rights' as we understand them, partly because of their animal-like behaviour."" Another online post from a council candidate suggested that it was ""not a bad thing"" if Muslims left the UK. Hope Not Hate said it was calling on the Conservative Party to ""take immediate action"" against the individuals and it will ""continue to demand that they take proper steps to tackle the Islamophobia crisis that has gripped the party at every level"". The group's campaigns director, Matthew McGregor, said the Tories ""need to take much more seriously its obligation to Muslim members, and to the wider community"". ""That means tougher sanctions, and more transparency about its processes and decisions,"" he added. In response, a Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""All those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation. ""The swift action we take on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of any kind is testament to the seriousness with which we take such issues."" In September last year, a number of Conservative Party members were suspended for posting or endorsing Islamophobic material online after the BBC highlighted more than 20 new cases. And in November last year, another group of party members were suspended over claims of Islamophobic social media posts."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44619976,Trump says travel ban ruling 'tremendous',"The president says his policy is best for the US, arguing European countries have been ""over-run"".",27 Jun 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"US President Donald Trump has hailed a Supreme Court ruling upholding his travel ban which covers people from several Muslim-majority countries. Lower courts had deemed the ban unconstitutional, but the US top court reversed the decision in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. At a White House meeting to discuss Mr Trump's proposed border wall he lauded the decision as ""a tremendous success"". The court's reversal is viewed as a victory for the Trump administration. The ban prohibits most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. Mr Trump said the Supreme Court decision was a ""great victory"" for the nation and constitution. ""We have to be tough and we have to be safe and we have to be secure,"" the Republican president said in Tuesday's meeting with lawmakers.  ""The ruling shows that all the attacks from the media and the Democrat politicians were wrong, and they turned out to be very wrong,"" he added. He added: ""If you look at the European Union, they're meeting right now to toughen up their immigration policies because they've been over-run, they've been over-run. ""And frankly, a lot of those countries are not the same places anymore."" The travel ban, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect in December, has been widely criticised by refugee and human rights groups. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion, which said the travel ban was ""squarely within the scope of Presidential authority"". He also rejected arguments that the ban discriminated against Muslims.  ""The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,"" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ""The text says nothing about religion."" Shortly after the Supreme Court released its decision, President Donald Trump shared the news from his Twitter account. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the dissenting opinion, which argues the court failed to uphold the religious liberty guaranteed by the first amendment of the US constitution. ""It leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States' because the policy now masquerades behind a facade of national-security concerns,"" Justice Sotomayor wrote. The dissent also states that ""a reasonable observer would conclude that [the ban] was motivated by anti-Muslim animus"". The travel ban has been in place since December, when the Supreme Court ruled that it could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.  The ban prevents most immigrants, refugees and visa holders from five Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - as well as North Korea and Venezuela from entering the US.  But the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela were not part of the legal challenge.  The ban allows for waivers on a case-by-case basis, but applicants who cannot afford an attorney to go through the waiver process will likely be unable to immigrate to the US, immigration advocates say.  Justice Stephen Breyer noted in his dissenting opinion that the State Department reported that only two waivers were approved out of 6,555 applicants during the first month of the travel ban. The high court has been issuing a number of decisions this week, including a ruling against a California law that required clinics to inform women of the availability of abortions paid for by the state.  The Court ruled that the law violated the free speech rights of Christian facilities. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News - at the scene Despite the controversial nature of Donald Trump's travel ban, there were more abortion rights activists outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday morning than immigration protesters.  Perhaps it's because abortion has been a contentious legal battle for decades, while the president's travel directive had been in effect, and out of the headlines, for months.  Attention in recent weeks has been on migrants coming across the southern US border, not visitors and prospective residents from countries like Libya, Iran, Yemen and Syria.  Nevertheless, this marks a significant victory for Mr Trump - and for presidential power to set immigration policy in general - albeit by the narrowest of margins.  The five court justices said they took the president's order on its face, and separated it from his more bombastic anti-Muslim comments made on the presidential campaign trail and via Twitter. The travel ban was implemented haphazardly at the start of the Trump administration and faced repeated setbacks from the US legal system. In the end, however, the president got his way - or at least enough of his way to claim success.  The third time turned out to be the charm. The White House issued a statement saying the ruling was ""a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution"". ""In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country."" Immigration lawyer Cyrus Mehta told the BBC that the majority opinion ""gave in to President Trump's hate and bigotry and will be viewed as a blemish"". He added that Congress could overrule the decision ""so that a future president will not have a blank cheque to block the entire people of a nation - from babies to grandmothers - out of hate, fear or bigotry. That is our only hope for redemption as a nation"". Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the decision was ""critical to ensuring the continued authority of President Trump - and all future presidents - to protect the American people"". Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrant Rights Project called the ruling one of the court's ""great failures"". ""We must make it crystal clear to our elected representatives: If you are not taking action to rescind and dismantle Trump's Muslim ban, you are not upholding this country's most basic principles of freedom and equality."" Mr Trump's ban has seen several iterations. Iraq and Chad were banned in previous versions. Iraq was removed for having ""a close co-operative relationship with the US"" and Chad for having ""sufficiently improved its practices"". The administration said that the ban was the result of carefully considering national security interests, but critics argued it was fulfilling his campaign promise for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". The state of Hawaii had challenged the ban and a federal judge blocked its implementation. Critics have noted that major attacks such as the 9/11 New York attacks, the Boston marathon bombing and the Orlando nightclub attack were carried out by people from countries not on the list, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kyrgyzstan, or by US-born attackers."

The best-selling author had been due to address an event hosted by KPFA Radio in Berkeley, California, in August. Organisers accused him of ""abusive speech against Islam"" when scrapping his appearance, an allegation he denied. He called on the station to review his past remarks and apologise. In a letter to ticket-holders, the publicly funded radio station wrote: ""We had booked this event based entirely on his excellent new book on science, when we didn't know he had offended and hurt - in his tweets and other comments on Islam, so many people."" The station, which is not affiliated with the University of California, said in a letter - which Mr Dawkins published online - that it does not support ""hurtful"" or ""abusive speech"". It also apologised ""for not having had broader knowledge of Dawkins views much earlier"". Local media report that Bay Area residents had brought attention to statements made by the author of the anti-religion book The God Delusion, including a 2013 tweet saying ""Islam is the greatest force for evil in the world today"". In an open letter to organisers, Professor Dawkins wrote that he ""never used abusive speech against Islam"". He said harsh statements he has made in the past have been directed at ""IslamISM"" - apparently referring to those who use the religion for political objectives - and not adherents of the faith. ""I have criticised the appalling misogyny and homophobia of Islam, I have criticised the murdering of apostates for no crime other than their disbelief,"" Professor Dawkins writes. He also pointed out that he has been a ""frequent critic of Christianity but have never been de-platformed for that"". He describes listening to KPFA ""almost every day"" during the two years he lived in Berkeley, adding that ""I especially admired your habit of always quoting sources"". ""You conspicuously did not quote a source when accusing me of 'abusive speech'.  ""Why didn't you check your facts - or at least have the common courtesy to alert me - before summarily cancelling my event?"" Professor Dawkins' book about the study of evolution, The Selfish Gene, was named last week by the Royal Society as the most inspiring science book of all time. Known as the home of the Free Speech moment in the 1960s, Berkeley has recently left that reputation in doubt as far-left protesters have sought to silence speakers and academics with whom they disagree. Conservative authors Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos have each clashed with the University of California after events where they were due to speak were cancelled by the college administration out of fear for public safety."

So locals in the Australian city began adding colour, covering the bollards with bright fabrics and paint. The effort, given the name ""boll-art"" on social media, even appears to have won over authorities. ""It's really just a response to these massive concrete blocks,"" one bollard decorator, David Gray, told the BBC. ""Melbourne is very drab right now and I have heard a lot of people say, 'that just made me smile'."" The grey barricades have been appearing in more and more locations around Melbourne. The security measures were approved after six people died when a man drove a car into pedestrians in Bourke St in the city centre in January. Last month, after the London Bridge attack, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said there was ""no time to be wasted"" in installing the bollards. ""We were not going to wait around for six months or 12 months while plant boxes are built so they look better,"" he said.  ""The threat of terror, the threat of hostile vehicle attacks, the threats to public safety are all too real."" Mr Gray, who describes himself as a ""lapsed artist"", said he was not making light of any tragedies. ""I have consciously not gone to Bourke St because I believe that is a sacred site - even six months on, it is too raw,"" he said.  Rather, he said he had been motivated by passersby complaining about the bollards' appearance, and concern they could turn into advertising space. Using his mother's sewing machine, the 54-year-old stitched together colourful patterns and placed them outside Southern Cross railway station. Some of the art has been removed, but the City of Melbourne tweeted: ""We're not removing art from the bollards"". On Tuesday, Mr Andrews described the artwork as ""great"". Melbourne Lord Mayor Robert Doyle tweeted that it was an example of when ""good things happen"". The barriers will ultimately be replaced by permanent bollards, but authorities have not said when that will happen."

The party said it will conduct an investigation into historical social media comments made by Sahar Al-Faifi. Ms Al-Faifi appeared in Plaid Cymru's party political broadcast for the general election, which aired on BBC Wales, ITV Wales and S4C on Thursday.  The party said it will not tolerate anti-Semitism or racism ""in any form"". Ms Al-Faifa has been asked to comment on the posts, which were deleted some time ago. In the broadcast, she said: ""Activists, it's us,"" in a reference to Plaid's slogan for the election campaign: ""Wales, it's us."" Since the party election broadcast, Sahar Al-Faifi has been accused on social media of making anti-Semitic Facebook and Twitter comments between 2012 and 2014. Plaid Cymru said: ""We have taken immediate action to suspend the person in question. We will investigate all allegations.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54972389,Minority voters who changed their minds about Trump,"Joe Biden won the election, but support for Donald Trump increased among black and Latino voters. Why?",22 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Despite his election defeat, President Donald Trump can boast a success that has intrigued pollsters - he was more popular with ethnic minority voters than in 2016. Some might find this surprising given that his critics so accused him of racism and Islamophobia. Trump denies the charges and has accused Democrats of taking African Americans voters for granted. The Republican president gained six percentage points among black men, and five percentage points among Hispanic women. It means some voters changed their minds, after either not voting or voting for another candidate in 2016.  But it tells us something about Trump's unique appeal.  ""I was definitely more liberal growing up - my grandmother was big in the civil rights movement here in Texas during the 60s, and I grew up with that ideology."" Mateo Mokarzel, 40, is a graduate student from Houston, Texas and is of mixed heritage, Mexican and Lebanese. He didn't vote in 2016, and he isn't loyal to either major party - but this time around he decided to cast his vote for the Republicans.  ""The first time Trump ran I really wasn't convinced. I just thought, here's this celebrity talk-show host guy that wants to run for president, I didn't take him seriously - so I was not a Trump supporter the first time he ran. To be honest, I thought he was a ringer for Hillary, so I just wasn't interested,"" he tells BBC News. But Mokarzel says his upbringing in Texas influenced his view of both political parties. ""People forget that Texas used to be a blue [pro-Democrat] state,"" he says. ""The blue here wasn't like the ideological progressives that we think of now. They were more the old-school 'southern Democrats' - very racist, very intolerant. So, it was a totally different party, and I had experiences growing up of a lot of racism."" Mokarzel brushes off accusations of racism levelled at the president. Instead, he says he was attracted by Trump's isolationist foreign policy and economic policies. ""He really delivered on his anti-globalisation policy,"" he says. ""Neoliberal expansion has really hurt both Mexico and the US, and when you have family that live there, and you can see how it's hurt people living, their jobs, their wages, it really has increased the narco-war, and this is one of the things Trump came in saying - 'hey, we're going to tear apart these trade deals' - and then he actually did it. That was for me the first sign that he actually meant some of the things he was saying."" Mokarzel's wife Lily, a teacher, first-generation Mexican-American and also a Trump supporter, adds that she voted for him for economic reasons - ""our salaries have increased"" - and because she likes his ""genuine self"", despite colleagues and her union supporting Biden. ""The way I've been seeing him attacked, the lies,"" she says. ""I never used to vote, because I never felt my vote counted… And I feel like, since Trump has been in office our lives have improved.""  Elizabeth, 27, also changed her mind about the president over the course of his four years in office. She's a Mexican-American voter from Laredo, one of Texas's majority-Latino border cities in which Trump over-performed with voters this year. She didn't vote in 2016, and initially wasn't convinced by Trump. But when it came to casting her vote, she felt the Republican party best reflected her socially conservative, Catholic beliefs - particularly on abortion. Trump recently nominated anti-abortion judge Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, and said it was ""certainly possible"" they could revisit Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court case that legalised abortion nationwide in 1973. ""My family were all Democrats, it was a huge line of Democrats in my family - but this time I did see a difference,"" Elizabeth says. ""A lot of presidents make promises but they never keep them, including [former President Barack] Obama. With Trump, when he came into office he came in promising, and at first I was like, 'oh yeah more empty promises' - but then I started seeing the results… I do love that he's pro-life and pro-God, and for me that's very important."" In 2020 Latinos overtook the black community to become the largest minority voting bloc in the country - and are therefore a politically powerful group. But it is also diverse, made up of people from very different political and cultural backgrounds.  Even on issues such as immigration, on which President Trump has been notoriously hardline, the Latino community is less monolithic than some assume. A 2017 Gallup poll, for example, found that 67% of Hispanic people said they worried a great deal or a fair amount about illegal immigration - higher than the proportion of non-Hispanic whites (59%) who answered the same way. There was surprise on election night when it emerged that Miami-Dade County - the largest county in Florida - had lost a chunk of the Democratic support it had in 2016. Democratic analysts wondered whether the party had done enough to appeal to Cuban-Americans, who make up a large proportion of that county's voters. The Trump campaign's painting of Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris as socialists would have also been successful among Cuban-Americans and Venezuelan-Americans.  Cuban-American journalist Paola Ramos wrote in Vogue magazine: ""I come from a family of Cuban exiles and grew up around dinner tables that discussed the crumbling of Fidel Castro's regime - among family discussion that plotted the awaited return to an island that was overtaken by communism in the early '60s. Like many young Cuban Americans in Florida, we knew the meaning of Castro, socialismo, and comunismo before we even learned how to add or subtract."" The group that saw the biggest increase in support for Trump compared to 2016, however, was black men. The black community has long been seen as the most solidly Democratic voting bloc. This year was no different.  Sam Fulwood III - who this year conducted the Black Swing Voter Project, a survey - tells BBC News that the rise in support for Trump among black voters is ""more hype than reality"". ""No other demographic in US society voted for Joe Biden in higher numbers than black men, except black women,"" said Fulwood, who has been highly critical of Trump.  But although black voters tend to overwhelmingly vote Democrat, they are not a monolith. According to a Pew Research Center study from January 2020, a quarter of black Democrats identify as conservative, and 43% as moderate.  A 2018 Harvard-Harris poll also found that 85% of black Americans favour reducing legal immigration, more than any other demographic - 54% chose the strictest options available, allowing fewer than 250,000 immigrants per year, or even say they want to no new immigrants at all. In an article in the Los Angeles Times that same year, former diplomat Dave Seminara suggested this was because young black men in the US ""often compete with recent immigrants for low-skilled jobs"". In their recent book Steadfast Democrats, Ismail White and Chryl Laird suggested the reason black voters have so consistently voted Democrat in the past was not because of a unified ideology, but because of ""social pressure from other black voters"". Organisations such as Blexit, headed up by right-wing personality Candace Owens, gained increasing prominence too. And this year, several black celebrities appeared to voice their support for Trump, including rappers Curtis Jackson (aka ""50 Cent"") and Ice Cube - although 50 Cent later rowed back his endorsement, and Ice Cube, who had backed Trump's Platinum Plan, distanced himself from the president's actual campaign.  Black Entertainment Television (BET) founder Robert Johnson also voiced the frustration of black voters with the Democrats, when he told US broadcaster CNBC: ""I think black Americans are getting a little bit tired of delivering huge votes for the Democrats, and seeing minimal return in terms of economic wealth and closing the wealth gap, job creation and job opportunities. Joe Biden was not an inspiring candidate for many black Americans."" Fulwood tells BBC News that although most black voters he spoke to for the Black Swing Voters Project overwhelmingly believed President Trump was ""racist"" and ""incompetent"", they also admired how he ""shows strength and defies the establishment"". ""Because Americans are fiercely independent, they like strong leadership, and Trump projects the image of being a strong leader,"" he says.  The president seems to defy authority, he adds. ""I think that resonates with a great number of, particularly young, African-Americans, who already feel that the establishment is weighted against them. So his rhetoric taps into their antipathy. They don't like him, they don't like his policies, but they like the idea that he sticks it to the establishment."" Stephanie Muravchik, author of a new book entitled Trump's Democrats, also suggests President Trump's appeal to some voters was down to his image as a ""boss politician"" - an old-style local bigwig who she says would be personally familiar with their town's residents. ""It's a culture where men are absolutely required to defend themselves against any kind of insult,"" she tells BBC News. ""Trump really intuitively understands that culture and adopts it as his own. He says things like, 'never show fear, it's all about strength' - when he got Covid and then recovered, he whipped off his mask. That may seem absurd and childish to some, but it reads differently in these communities."" The Covid-19 stimulus cheque sent to US citizens, with a letter personally signed by President Trump, was an example of so-called ""boss politics"" in action.  ""Trump really wanted to sign the cheques,"" she adds. ""As mine was automatically deposited, I got a letter from the US government signed by Trump, saying 'Hello Stephanie, I have given you this money, I'm looking out for you. Sincerely, Trump'. It was really absurd, but it was brilliant, because it was invoking that model of politician as protector."" But even with all of this in mind, are the racism accusations putting off minority voters? For Mateo Mokarzel, these claims have only strengthened his resolve to support Trump, and push back against what he calls ""media bias"". ""He has a strong nationalist stance, and they try to portray that as racist,"" Mokarzel says. ""Protecting your borders and building up your economy is something most Americans want. I don't see how that's racist or some kind of dog whistle."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-42049814,Pupils hijab questioning 'discriminatory',Campaigners condemn Ofsted decision to ask girls in primary schools why they wear the headcsarf.,20 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Muslim campaigners have condemned ""discriminatory"" plans for school inspectors to question girls who wear hijab in primary school.  Head of Ofsted Amanda Spielman said pupils would be asked why they wear the headscarf, which ""could be interpreted as sexualisation of young girls"". But some have asked why the pupils and not the schools will be challenged. Ofsted said the move was in line with its current practice of assessing whether a school promotes equality. The hijab is traditionally worn as a sign of modesty once a girl reaches puberty. Research by the National Secular Society in September suggested 59 of 142 Islamic schools, including 27 primary schools, in England have a uniform policy which states a head-covering is compulsory. ""The hijab in primary schools should be something that is dealt with via the schools uniform policy,"" said Sajda Mughal, head of JAN Trust, a charity working with BAME and Muslim women. She called the move by Ofsted ""nonsense and discriminatory"" and said it will be used by extremists to advance their narrative of ""them and us'"" and could fuel marginalisation. ""I know as a Muslim mother of young girls, I'd be alarmed and horrified if I found that my daughters were questioned if they wore the hijab,"" she said. This was echoed by human rights campaigner Aisha Ali-Khan, who said the primary schools should be held to account ""rather than quizzing little girls"".  Oftsed should instead ask ""why are primary school uniform policies allowing hijab for girls under the age of puberty when Islamic laws state otherwise,"" she added. But Amina Lone, from the Social Action and Research Foundation, was one of those who lobbied Ofsted to take action. ""As a second generation Muslim woman and a parent, I have huge concerns about the increasing encroachment of gender inequality in public spaces for women of faith,"" she told the BBC's Asian Network.  ""The hijab is absolutely not required for children. ""Gender equality was hard fought for in this country and we shouldn't be diluting that.""  She said it was ""absurd"" to be having this debate in 2017 and stressed this was not about secondary school children or adults. There is no ban on Islamic dress in the UK, but schools are allowed to decide their own dress code. Current government advice states: ""Pupils have the right to manifest a religion or belief, but not necessarily at all times, places or in a particular manner."" Shereen, a hijabi, said the choice should be between the parents and the child.  The mother-of two, whose own daughters do not wear a hijab, said the headscarf has been misrepresented. ""It has nothing to do with sexualising children. That claim is ridiculous,"" she told the BBC Asian Network. Vlogger and mother, Nilly Dahlia agreed. She started wearing hijab aged 22.  ""Hijab is not about sexualisation. It is a sign of submission to our faith,"" she said. ""I do feel like the government are trying to control Muslims."" But blogger Hifsa Haroon-Iqbal said the issue was simply a school uniform one.  ""If schools do not want young children in primary education to wear hijabs in school, this needs to be made explicitly clear within the school uniform policy.  ""This is not about racism, being islamophobic or discriminatory. It is common sense,"" the mother-of-three wrote. ""To subject a young child to questioning about why they are dressed in a particular way is ludicrous as it will always warrant the same response, 'because my mother dresses me'."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-63699881,Racism furore reignites scrutiny of Australian media,"High-profile Aboriginal presenter Stan Grant left Australian TV this week, citing ""relentless"" abuse.",24 May 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"After a prestigious career of more than three decades, trailblazing Aboriginal journalist Stan Grant hosted his final show on Monday and walked away from Australian TV screens indefinitely.  ""Racism is a crime. Racism is violence. And I have had enough,"" Grant wrote in a column last week explaining his decision.  The Wiradjuri man made history in 1992 when he became the first Aboriginal presenter on prime-time commercial TV in Australia. He went on to win a slew of awards in Australian media, and was an international correspondent for CNN and Al Jazeera before returning home to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).  The ABC describes him as one of Australia's most respected and awarded journalists.  But on Monday night he looked defeated, visibly shaking as he signed off from his political panel show Q+A.  ""To those who have abused me and my family, I would just say - if your aim was to hurt me, well, you've succeeded,"" he said.  Grant's decision to leave has reignited fierce conversations about racism and media diversity in Australia.  ""If one of the few Indigenous presenters on television with a career that took him all over the world can't be protected from racism... what will that mean for anyone who walks down a similar path?"" ABC journalist Ryma Tchier wrote on Twitter.  Australia's Indigenous people have over 60,000 years of history, and half of Australians were either born overseas or have a parent who was. But the media representing such a multicultural population remains disproportionately white.  A 2022 study found more than three quarters of the reporters or presenters on Australian TV were from an Anglo-Celtic cultural background. The difference was even more pronounced at the leadership and board level.  The Media Diversity Australia report prompted the five TV networks examined to acknowledge their lack of diversity. But the channels also questioned the report's findings, criticising how it had determined cultural background, and criticising the short, two-week research window of the study. Several pointed out they had increased diversity in other areas of their output or tried to increase representation through targeted roles and recruitment.  But the broader issue has long been a problem in Australian media, and critics cite it for contributing to high-profile controversies. In 2019, a newspaper was widely accused of using racist tropes in a cartoon depiction of Serena Williams - the image was ultimately deemed acceptable by media regulators. And in 2020, Australia's most watched breakfast show, Channel Seven's Sunrise, settled a racial discrimination case over an all-white panel where a pundit suggested Aboriginal children should be forcibly removed from their families.  The Seven Network initially defended the segment, which sparked protests outside their studio, saying ""editorial opinions… are a vital part of journalism"", but later apologised for causing offence after the broadcast regulator found they had breached industry standards. A prestigious media award - the Kennedys - was also criticised in 2021 for not having a single person of colour on the 60-person judging panel.  The cultural diversity in Australia's media industry is shocking compared to many other Western countries, says Antoinette Lattouf, who in 2011 became one of the first Arab-Australian women to be a commercial television reporter.   As a result, she says, many Australian communities' stories go untold and vital perspectives are missed.  ""Each nation has their own challenges… [but] anybody who has… seen BBC, CNN, ITV, even broadcasters in New Zealand, will note they're far more diverse than our screens,"" says Lattouf, who co-founded the Media Diversity Australia group to improve the situation.  Culturally diverse journalists say they face more barriers to entering the Australian media industry than their peers.  But cases like Stan Grant's expose the problem outlets have in retaining them when they do make it.  Former ABC reporter Rhianna Patrick says the reason she joined the industry was the same reason she left it.  ""I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a journalist… because I recognised that the only time I ever saw people from my community reflected in the media was in a negative way,"" the Torres Strait Islander tells the BBC.  She built an impressive career over two decades - first in Indigenous radio then at the ABC, where she came to headline her own, self-titled national radio show.  But Patrick was the only Indigenous person in her unit, sometimes her entire floor. The impact of that fact hit her all at once in 2020 as she watched the Black Lives Matter movement sweep the globe, including Australia.  ""All of these things I had buried… were starting to come to the surface and I realised… I just couldn't go back into a mainstream media space and do my job anymore,"" she said.  Non-white journalists have regularly reported racial abuse from audiences. In the wake of Grant's exit, even more disclosed experiences.   ""Maybe once a week, I get called a racial slur [or] I get told I'm not Australian … I've also thought about leaving because of racist abuse,"" said news presenter and comedian Michael Hing, who is Chinese-Australian.  He said he had also considered departing the ABC because ""all-white management teams are too often incapable of understanding"".   There is racism from peers too, Lattouf and Patrick recount.  ""If ever there were crimes committed by people of Middle Eastern backgrounds, people [in the newsroom] would say things like 'oh, what did your cousins get up to?'"" Lattouf says.  ""I've been told that 'I'm one of the good ones' from the Lebanese community - a backhanded compliment that suggests that the rest of my community isn't good.""  There's also the pressure that comes with often being the sole person from their community in a newsroom, and feeling disproportionately responsible for coverage of an issue or advocating for their people.  And covering topics such as police brutality, racism and violence can be feel personal and traumatic, they say. Patrick says she knows the work she did was important. ""But you also want to be able to have times when you can do stories about Indigenous excellence, about Indigenous joy.""   It all adds up. And so - like Grant - many culturally diverse journalists leave. When Grant announced his departure, he accused the ABC of an ""institutional failure"" to protect or defend him.  He said racism had been ""relentless"" throughout his career, but it reached a new level of intensity after he covered the King's Coronation for the ABC, when he spoke about the impact of colonisation on his people.  Grant said the ABC had invited him to be part of coverage specifically to offer that perspective, but when the backlash came, he was left to fend for himself. He also pointed out the role some conservative media outlets played in amplifying the outrage. In the days since his decision, there have been 'I Stand with Stan' protests, and the ABC has apologised and pledged to do better.  ""I'm incredibly sorry that he felt let down by our organisation... we will do all we can to make up for it,"" ABC News director Justin Stevens told a rally.  The ABC has promised to review how it deals with racism directed at staff. It follows other reviews it has had in recent years aimed at impoving diversity.  Some commentators hope the anger over Grant's exile could mark a turning point, but others are sceptical.  ""You go through these cycles of reckoning - reforms are introduced, you have a couple of new hires - but the actual underlying structures don't change that much,"" one Aboriginal reporter who didn't wish to be named told the BBC.  In his final speech on Monday, Grant said he had spent his career trying to represent his people with pride and love. ""I've just wanted to make us seen and I'm sorry that I can't do that for a little while,"" he said. ""I've had to learn that endurance is not always strength. Sometimes strength is knowing when to say stop. ""I am down right now. I am. But I'll get back up and you can come at me again. And I'll meet you with the love of my people."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49089209,Reports of racist abuse rise by 43%,"Reports of racist abuse in English football rose by 43% during the 2018-19 season and can be linked to Brexit, says anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.",24 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Manchester City and England forward Raheem Sterling frequently spoke out against racism last season The rise in reports of racist abuse in football can be linked to Brexit, Kick It Out chief Roisin Wood has claimed. Statistics gathered by the anti-discrimination charity showed reports of racism in English football rose by 43% - from 192 to 274 - last season. ""I think you can't not link them together,"" Wood told BBC Sport. ""We're seeing a lot of reports of 'go back to where you came from' which we haven't seen for a while which seems to be on the back of Brexit."" Factoring in all forms of discrimination, reports of abuse in professional and grassroots football increased by 32% to 422, up from 319 during 2017-18. A further 159 reports were received via social media. Reports of faith-based discrimination - including Islamophobia and anti-Semitism - rose by 75% from 36 to 63, a higher percentage than any other form of abuse during the period. It is the seventh consecutive year reported incidents of discrimination within football have increased, and the 581 total reports is more than double the figure from five years ago. ""If we're seeing a rise in hate crime, the Home Office is seeing a rise in hate crime and other bodies are seeing a rise in hate crime, it's linked because that's what is going on in society at the moment. If it's there, we'll see it in football,"" Wood added. ""In some of the cases we have seen, there is a real hatred there which we haven't maybe seen as much of in the past where it's really violent and very targeted, particularly on social media. ""Some of the social media reports we've seen you wouldn't want anyone to see. ""We're talking to people all the time that feel, post-Brexit, that 'maybe this country isn't for me'. ""[Politicians] have to take that responsibility very seriously, they are the leaders of the country and they need to set the tone. Society is reflected in football."" Responding to the figures, which also showed that reports of abuse in the professional game had increased by 46%, the Football Association said it had made ""huge strides"" in recent years to ensure English football is a ""diverse and inclusive"" game. This includes a new inclusion plan - 'In Pursuit of Progress' - which aims to ""create opportunities in football, both on and off the pitch, for people of all backgrounds"", as well as funding two extra grassroots officers, based at Kick It Out, who work directly with the County FA network. ""We strongly condemn all forms of discrimination and encourage all fans and participants who believe that they have been the subject of, or witness to, discriminatory abuse to report it through the appropriate channels: the FA, our County FA network or via our partners at Kick It Out,"" the FA's statement added. Kick It Out says the FA has not informed them of the outcome in 79% of the 109 discrimination cases reported in grassroots football - 40% of which were from under-18 football. Incidents of racism marred the 2018-19 season, with Raheem Sterling and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang among several players to face abuse. In December, Manchester City and England forward Sterling suffered alleged racist abuse from Chelsea fans during City's 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge, and followed that the next morning with an Instagram post in which he questioned newspapers' portrayal of black players and said it fed prejudice and aggressive behaviour. In March, Sterling was vocal in condemning the racist abuse received by England players during their 5-1 win in Montenegro as well as offering support to his younger team-mate Callum Hudson-Odoi. And in April he was quick to call out Leonardo Bonucci when the Juventus defender suggested that his team-mate Moise Kean was partly to blame for the racist abuse he received from Cagliari fans. He was presented with his Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award in the same month, with FWA chair Carrie Brown citing his public stance on racist abuse as being just as important as his exploits on the pitch. This video can not be played December 2018: Former Liverpool & England footballer John Barnes on racism in football Dan Roan, BBC sports editor Just over two weeks before the start of the new season, these figures serve as a stark warning to English football's authorities.  They know the game here cannot afford a repeat of the high-profile incidents that marred last year, especially with the government urging them to put tackling abuse ""at the top of their agenda"".  Six months ago the outgoing Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley criticised the sport for a lack of leadership and collaboration on the issue. So some will be encouraged by the measures announced today, including a review of FA sanctions and education, and a renewed attempt to improve football's dismal record on job opportunities in coaching and senior administrative roles for BAME candidates.  But others will look at the Â£800,000 total annual funding that Kick It Out has to rely on from the FA, Premier League, Football League and Professional Footballers' Association, and ask whether these bodies should be investing significantly more if such a wealthy sport is serious about making the game more inclusive.  December: Banana skin thrown on to the pitch during the north London derby at Emirates Stadium, after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored for Arsenal December: Raheem Sterling suffers alleged racial abuse during Manchester City's defeat at Chelsea. Sterling later says newspapers are helping to ""fuel racism"" by the ways in which they portray young black footballers March: Chelsea lodge a complaint with Uefa over racist abuse aimed at Callum Hudson-Odoi during Europa League last-16 second leg win at Dynamo Kiev March: England report racist abuse of players during their 5-1 win over Montenegro in Podgorica April: Juventus' 19-year-old Italian forward Moise Kean suffers racist abuse from the stands during a match at Cagliari - with team-mate Leonardo Bonucci's suggestion that Kean was partly to blame called ""laughable"" by Raheem Sterling April: Two incidents of alleged racist abuse, towards Derby winger Duane Holmes and Wigan defender Nathan Byrne, are reported in the Championship  April: Troy Deeney and Watford team-mates Adrian Mariappa and Christian Kabasele receive racist abuse on social media April: Ashley Young receives racist abuse online following Manchester United's Champions League defeat in Barcelona In April, the Professional Footballers' Association asked players to send them evidence of racist online abuse in order to demonstrate to governing bodies the severity of the issue. The PFA planned to show the posts to the sports minister and a number of football bodies at a meeting in May, while meetings with Twitter and Facebook were also requested after a number of high-profile incidents. Players were previously encouraged to boycott social media for 24 hours as part of the #Enough campaign. The release of Kick It Out's figures came as the FA, Premier League and EFL published a joint letter to sports minister Mims Davies, in which they outlined measures they are taking to tackle discrimination in football next season. This includes a review of how both clubs and the FA sanction discrimination, improved steward training, improved reporting methods and providing more opportunities for BAME people in coaching, refereeing, management and administrative positions. In a statement, an EFL spokesman said it is ""committed to working collectively to ensure football is a game for all"". ""While today's announcement suggests more work needs to be done, the results of our recent supporters survey demonstrates clubs are working hard to make football as inclusive as possible. The survey stated 86% of respondents believed their club offered a 'welcoming and inclusive matchday experience for all supporters."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-59246434,MPs may face votes to remain Labour election picks,"The two MPs are at risk of facing ballots that could see them deselected, the BBC understands.",11 Nov 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Two Coventry MPs could face battles with their own party to remain Labour candidates at the next general election. The BBC understands Taiwo Owatemi and Zarah Sultana are at risk of facing votes that could see them deselected. Party members in their constituencies are organising to try to meet the required threshold to trigger a vote. Labour's National Executive Committee signed off the rules around candidate selection this week. Local parties can force a full selection process if a majority of local party and affiliate branches vote to trigger a contest. It comes as the party gears up for a general election - possibly as soon as 2023. Some constituency Labour Party (CLP) members in Coventry were left deeply unhappy at the candidate selection process during the 2019 snap general election. There were claims it was a ""stitch-up"" and suggested the national Labour Party had imposed candidates loyal to then leader Jeremy Corbyn in the two Coventry seats left vacant by the retirements of long-serving MPs Geoffrey Robinson and Jim Cunningham. No local councillors were on the party's shortlists in Coventry South, where Zarah Sultana is the MP, and Coventry North West, Taiwo Owatemi's constituency. Some members claim the election results were an indicator that Coventry voters were also unhappy with the choices of Labour candidates as they held on to the two seats by a whisker. In 2017 Coventry North West had a Labour majority of 8,580 and Coventry South had a Labour winning margin of 7,947 - but in 2019 that fell to 208 in Coventry North West and 400 in Coventry South.  However, those drops came on an election night that saw Labour's share of the vote nationally drop from 40% to 32% and the party lose 60 seats. Some senior members of the CLP in Coventry South have also grown increasingly frustrated at Ms Sultana's habit of speaking out against the party leadership and causing controversy, such as when she was pictured with anti-police banners at a rally recently, something she later apologised for. Local organisers have told the BBC the original plan was to try to force trigger ballots - votes to decide if they should remain as the party's candidate - as soon as December, but that could now be pushed back after a by-election was called in North Shropshire for 16 December. Four local councillors have been named locally as possible challengers to the incumbent MPs, Earlsdon councillors Becky Gittins and Antony Tucker, Jim O'Boyle, the cabinet member for jobs and regeneration at Coventry City Council, and Kindy Sandhu, the authority's cabinet member for education.  All four failed to rule themselves out when approached by the BBC. Ms Sultana has yet to comment on the selection process, but Ms Owatemi said: ""I have loved being the Labour Member of Parliament for Coventry North West for nearly two years now.  ""Standing up for my constituents both in our city and in Westminster is a real privilege and a role I take incredibly seriously."" She added she would ""very much like to continue in my role"" and ""restand as the Labour parliamentary candidate at the next general election"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-51150517,Journalist attacked because of his sexuality,A judge rules Guardian columnist Owen Jones was targeted due to his sexuality and political views.,18 Jan 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man launched an unprovoked attack on Guardian columnist Owen Jones because of his sexuality and political views, a judge has ruled. James Healy, 40, admitted assaulting Mr Jones by The Lexington pub in Islington last year but claimed it was because the 35-year-old had spilled his drink. However, Mr Jones said he ""absolutely did not"" spill the drink. At the end of a two-day hearing, the judge ruled the attack could only have been due to his media profile. Recorder Judge Anne Studd QC said Healy, of Portsmouth, would have had ""plenty of opportunity to remonstrate"" with Mr Jones in the pub if he had spilled the drink but made no attempt to do so. ""This was a deliberate and targeted attack on Mr Jones personally,"" she said. Following Healy's arrest, a search of his home revealed a photograph of him performing a Nazi salute. The court heard the photo showed him as a teenager but had been printed out in 2015. Healy, who has admitted affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, faced a trial of issue to determine his motivation for attacking Mr Jones. In her ruling Judge Studd said that while it could not be proven Healy had been performing a Nazi salute in the photograph, she was ""sure that [Healy] holds particular beliefs that are normally associated with the far right wing"". ""I therefore propose to sentence Mr Healy on the basis that this was a wholly unprovoked attack on Mr Jones by reason of his widely published left-wing and LGBTQ beliefs by a man who has demonstrable right-wing sympathies,"" she said. Mr Jones suffered cuts and swelling to his back and head and bruises all down his body in the assault which happened on his birthday night out on 17 August. In his evidence at Snaresbrook Crown Court, the journalist said: ""I'm an unapologetic socialist, I'm an anti-racist, I'm an anti-fascist and I've consistently used my profile to advocate left-wing causes."" Mr Jones has almost one million Twitter followers, 125,000 followers on Instagram and 350,000 followers on Facebook. ""What I use these platforms for is to advocate left-wing ideas and a passion and unwavering commitment to opposing racism, fascism, Islamophobia and homophobia,"" he told the court. ""Almost every single day I am the subject of an unrelenting campaign [of abuse] by far-right sympathisers. ""They've come to see me as this hate figure in their ranks."" Mr Jones said he received death threats on a daily basis, adding: ""It's the combination of being left-wing, gay, anti-fascist - that's everything the far right hate."" Describing the evening of the attack, Mr Jones said: ""My recollection is that I was saying goodbye to a friend and then I was on the floor completely disoriented. ""In those 10 seconds, I don't really remember what happened because I was attacked from behind, I had no sense of what was going to happen."" When asked about the claim he had knocked Mr Healy's drink, he said: ""That absolutely did not happen. ""If I thought I had accidentally spilled someone's drink, I would apologise profusely, I would say, 'I'm so sorry' and I would insist - whether they liked it or not - on buying them another drink."" The court heard Healy has a string of convictions for football violence and is currently subject to a football banning order for encroaching on a pitch. He also allegedly had a football hooligan flag adorned with SS symbols and a collection of pin badges linked to white supremacist groups. Healy told the court: ""I'm a hoarder. I never throw anything away. I just had them all that time tucked away in the back of a drawer. ""Bearing in mind they came into my possession in 1998, there was no internet back then, the information now is easily available. ""As far as I knew, they were connected to football and football violence."" A date has yet to be set for Healy's sentencing."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40658243,US senator defends attacked Muslim rival,Jeff Flake expresses his support for a Democratic challenger after she is abused online.,19 Jul 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has come to defend a woman who wants to unseat him after she received hateful messages about her Muslim religion.  Democratic candidate Deedra Abboud, 45, came under attack after she posted a campaign message on Facebook with an image of the US Constitution. The post prompted an onslaught of cyberbullying, including comments about Ms Abboud's religion. Mr Flake, 54, expressed his support for Ms Abboud on Twitter. ""Hang in there @deedra2018. Sorry you have to put up with this. Lots of wonderful people across AZ. You'll find them,"" he tweeted on Tuesday. The senator also posted a link to an op-ed in The Arizona Republic calling out the online attack on Ms Abboud, which came after she posted a message about separation of church and state.  ""Almost 250 years ago a group of dreamers came together and sketched out a revolutionary vision. No longer would they be shackled to the whims of a distant government, nor bound to the religion of an idiosyncratic king. They set out to forge their own futures, determine their own destinies, and follow their own faith,"" she wrote.  ""In their infinite wisdom, the Founding Fathers decreed that this nation would separate church and state, and in doing so protect both institutions. Government would be free from religious overreach, and religion would be free from government interference."" Facebook users began flooding her page with comments saying there was ""no room for Muslims in our government. Nice try though you are quoting the Muslim brotherhood"". Another user wrote: ""Nice try but your first love is Satan (AKA Allah) and your second love is to a litter box your 'people' come from. You are as American as Chinese checkers."" ""BAN ISLAM IN THE USA…WE HATE YOUR FILTHY DEATH CULT,"" another Facebook user said. Ms Abboud, a Phoenix-based lawyer, thanked Mr Flake for his response.  ""Thank you @JeffFlake for leadership in rejecting behavior that doesn't reflect our American values. AZ's amazing people deserve more than this"", she tweeted.  Ms Abboud, a native of Little Rock, Arkansas, is running for Mr Flake's seat in the August 2018 Democrat primary. If she wins, she would challenge Mr Flake in the general election that autumn. Mr Flake has come to the defence of Muslims in Arizona before.  In the wake of President Donald Trump's executive order in January, which targeted seven Muslim-majority countries, the Republican said in a Medium post the White House was right to be concerned about national security, but that it was ""unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry"". ""Enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims,"" wrote Mr Flake, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees.  He also attended a service at a Scottsdale mosque in December 2015 to show his support amid harsh, anti-Muslim rhetoric from then-Republican presidential candidate, Mr Trump.  ""My hope and prayer today is that isolated voices calling for division are overwhelmed by the chorus of voices in this room today calling for acceptance, tolerance and inclusion,"" he said at the time."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50552068,Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour,"Ephraim Mirvis urges voters to consider Labour's ""inadequate"" response to anti-Semitism allegations.",26 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The chief rabbi has strongly criticised Labour, claiming the party is not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism - and asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the general election.  In the Times, Ephraim Mirvis said ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in the party. Labour's claim it had investigated all cases of anti-Semitism in its ranks was a ""mendacious fiction"", he added. But Jeremy Corbyn said the party had taken ""rapid and effective"" action.  At the launch of the party's ""race and faith manifesto"", the Labour leader said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"" and would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government.  He said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism cases were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Rabbi Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street.  Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.  A number of prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party after being the subject of anti-Semitic abuse on social media while others have accused Mr Corbyn of personally endorsing anti-Semitic tropes and imagery.  In his article, the Orthodox chief rabbi of Great Britain and Northern Ireland - who is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, the largest umbrella group of Jewish communities in the country - says raising his concerns ""ranks among the most painful moments I have experienced since taking office"". But he claims ""the overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety"" at the prospect of a Labour victory in 12 December's general election. He writes: ""The way in which the leadership of the Labour Party has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people.  ""It has left many decent Labour members and parliamentarians, both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired."" He adds that it was ""not my place to tell any person how they should vote"" but he urged the public to ""vote with their conscience"".  The chief rabbi claimed the response of Labour's leadership to threats against parliamentarians, members and staff has been ""utterly inadequate"" and said it ""can no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism"". Mike Katz, the chair of the Jewish Labour Movement group which is officially affiliated to the party, said the chief rabbi was ""absolutely right"" and there had been a failure of leadership over anti-Semitism in Labour. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the chief rabbi's ""unprecedented"" intervention ""ought to alert us to the deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews"". In a statement, he said everyone should be able to ""live in accordance with their beliefs and freely express their culture and faith"". The Labour peer Lord Dubs, the child refugee campaigner who fled Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in the 1930s, said he regretted some of the language Mr Corbyn had used in the past about Israel and the fact he had met with groups who denied its right to exist.  But he told BBC Radio 4's Today these episodes were ""quite a long time ago"" and had to be seen ""in the context"" of Mr Corbyn's support for peace in the Middle East.  ""I think things have happened under his leadership which should have been stopped way back,"" he added. ""I believe the Labour party is moving forward. It is not good enough what has happened in the past."" This is a sweeping and unequivocal condemnation of Labour's leadership, its treatment of Jewish parliamentarians and its handling of allegations of anti-Semitism.   It's also highly unusual for such an intervention by the leader of a religious denomination during a general election campaign. The chief rabbi has pastoral oversight for a large proportion of people who identify as Jewish in the United Kingdom. Last week, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York appealed to voters and politicians to ""honour the truth"" and ""challenge falsehoods"" but there was no specific criticism of individual candidates nor their party leaders. But the chief rabbi's article asks if Jeremy Corbyn is fit for high office and calls on voters to consider what the result of this election ""will say about the moral compass of this country?"" Last year, three Jewish newspapers, - The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish News and The Jewish Telegraph - published exactly the same front cover on 25 July - arguing that a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn would prove ""an existential threat"" to British Jewry. The chief rabbi, in this highly critical column, is saying much the same. The Labour leader faced criticism from Jewish groups when he said in last week's general election ITV leader's debate that the party had ""investigated every single case"" raised by complainants. The chief rabbi takes issue with Mr Corbyn's claim, citing figures from the Jewish Labour Movement of ""at least 130 outstanding cases"". At an event in Tottenham, north London, the Labour leader did not directly address the number of outstanding cases but defended the party's disciplinary processes as being ""rapid and effective"". ""Anti-Semitism in any form is vile and wrong, it is an evil within our society,"" he said.  ""There is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism in any shape or form or in any place whatsoever in modern and Britain and under a Labour government it will not be tolerated in any form whatsoever."" He added: ""In government our door will be open to all faith leaders. Chief Rabbi welcome. Archbishop of Canterbury welcome. Those from the Hindu community are all very welcome."" South-African born Rabbi Mirvis became chief rabbi in 2013. In a Facebook post in July, he congratulated Boris Johnson on his election as Conservative leader, describing the new prime minister as a ""long-standing friend and champion of the Jewish community"". According to the British Board of Deputies, there are between 260,000 and 300,000 Jews in England and Wales. Around half belong to the Central Orthodox denomination which includes the United Synagogue, led by the chief rabbi.  Measures to combat anti-Semitism were among a number of policies unveiled by the party, including: The Muslim Council of Britain, which has repeatedly criticised the Conservatives for failing to address anti-Muslim prejudice amongst their members, said not enough was being done to tackle racism ""whether from the left or the right"".  It said British Muslims would ""agree on the importance of voting with their conscience""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55132098,Muslims under pressure to sign French values charter,"A ""charter of values"" is the latest effort by the French state to win Muslim hearts and minds.",1 Dec 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"France's Muslim Council is due to meet President Emmanuel Macron this week, to confirm the text of a new ""charter of republican values"" for imams in the country to sign. The Council (CFCM), which represents nine separate Muslim associations, has reportedly been asked to include in the text recognition of France's republican values, rejection of Islam as a political movement and a ban on foreign influence. ""We do not all agree on what this charter of values is, and what it will contain,"" said Chems-Eddine Hafiz, vice-president of the CFCM and Rector of the Paris Grand Mosque.  But, he said, ""we are at a historic turning point for Islam in France [and] we Muslims are facing our responsibilities"". Eight years ago, he said, he thought very differently. The Islamist Mohamed Merah had just carried out attacks in Toulouse.  ""[Former French] President Sarkozy got me out of bed at 5am to talk about it,"" he remembers. ""I told him: 'His name may be Mohamed, but he's a criminal!'  I didn't want to make the connection between that crime and my religion. Today, I do. The imams of France have work to do."" The plan is for the CFCM to create a register of imams in France, each of whom would sign up to the Charter, in return for accreditation. President Macron spoke in October about putting ""immense pressure"" on Muslim authorities.  But this is difficult territory in a country that cherishes state secularism.  Mr Macron is trying to stop the spread of political Islam, without being seen as interfering in religious practice, or singling out one particular faith. Integrating all groups of Muslims into French society has become a pressing political issue in recent years. France has an estimated five million Muslims - Europe's largest Muslim minority. Olivier Roy, an expert in French Islam, says the Charter raises two problems. One is discrimination because it targets only Muslim preachers, and the other is the right to freedom of religion. ""You are obliged to accept the laws of the state,"" he told me, ""but you are not required to celebrate its values. You cannot discriminate against LGBT, for example, but the Catholic Church is not obliged to accept same-sex marriage."" Fashion designer Iman Mestaoui receives regular abuse from those she calls the ""haters"" - hardline Islamists who say her brand of scarves and turbans does not always cover a woman's hair enough. But, she says, the idea of getting imams to sign up to ""French values"" is a problem, when Muslims are already seen by many as not fully French. ""It's putting us in a strange place where you have to show people that you subscribe to the republican values; where you feel French, but they don't feel you are,"" she explained. ""We feel like nothing we do - pay taxes, do [national service] - will be enough.  You have to prove that you're really French: you have to eat pork; drink wine; not wear hijab, wear miniskirts. And it's ridiculous."" But Hassen Chalghoumi, imam of the Drancy mosque on the outskirts of Paris, says that after years of terrorist attacks, the government has been forced to act.  Mr Chalghoumi is now in hiding, following a spike in death threats over his reformist views. ""We have to go the extra mile, to show that we are well-integrated, that we respect the law,"" he told me. ""This is the price we have to pay because of the extremists."" Outside the Paris Grand Mosque, Charki Dennai arrives for prayers, his rolled-up mat and Koran tucked under his arm. ""These young [extremist] people are time bombs,"" he says.  ""I think the imams are a bit too nice to them.  We can respect French law and also Islam, it's feasible. That's what I do."" But there are questions over how much influence imams have among younger Muslims, especially when it comes to extremist violence. ""It won't work,"" says Olivier Roy, ""for a very simple reason: the terrorists don't come from Salafi mosques. If you take the biographies of terrorists, none of them is a product of Salafi preaching."" Salafism is a hardline, ultra-conservative movement identified with political Islam. The charter is one part of a wider government strategy to curb foreign influence, prevent violence and threats from extremists, and win back young people who feel forgotten by the state. Mr Macron has proposed more Arabic-language teaching in state schools and more investment in run-down areas, and has emphasised that he is targeting Islamists who reject France's laws and values, not Muslims as a whole. Hakim El-Karoui is a specialist in French Islamist movements at the Institut Montaigne who regularly contributes to government thinking. ""I'm a real fan of the strategy,"" he told me. ""It's comprehensive.  It's cultural, and also about organisation and funding."" But, he says, Muslims themselves should be included by the government in projects like this, ""because they can do a lot in terms of spreading the enlightened version of Islam on social networks - the government is not able to"". And without the buy-in of ""grassroots Muslims"", says Olivier Roy, the new Charter will be hard to enforce. ""Let's suppose that the local Muslim community decides to ignore the CFCM and appoints its own imam,"" he told me. ""What will the government do?  Either we change the constitution and give up the concept of freedom of religion [or] the government cannot impose certified imams on local Muslim communities."" In a Paris studio, shooting pictures for her new catalogue, Iman Mestaoui tells me she made her whole family vote for President Macron in 2017. Since then, she has noticed a ""huge shift"" to the right on issues like immigration and security.   ""I was pro-Macron,"" she said. ""He was a real hope in our community, but we feel like we've been abandoned."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48536402,Hancock brands Corbyn an anti-Semite,"Labour calls the remarks, made at a Tory leadership hustings, a ""baseless political attack"".",6 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Tory leadership contender Matt Hancock has described Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as an anti-Semite during an election hustings in Parliament. If Mr Corbyn became PM, the UK ""could end up with the first anti-Semitic leader of a Western nation since the Second World War"", Mr Hancock said. Labour called the health secretary's remarks a ""baseless political attack"". A number of Labour MPs have left the party in protest at what they say is its tolerance of anti-Semitism.  The Labour party has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism since mid-2016, with its leadership accused of tolerating a culture of anti-Jewish prejudice.  Mr Corbyn has insisted he is getting to grips with the issue and has beefed-up the party's internal disciplinary procedures. Mr Hancock made the remarks at an event held by the One Nation group of Conservative MPs.  Responding to his comments, a Labour source said they ""ring hollow from a minister in a party that has supported governments that actively promote anti-Semitic policies in Hungary and Poland and has spent the week wooing Trump, the man who refused to condemn neo-fascists in Charlottesville who chanted 'Jews will not replace us'"".  ""Numerous candidates in the Conservative leadership contest have been accused of racism, Islamophobia, homophobia and misogyny, one of whom may be the next prime minister"", the source added.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the comments were a ""disgrace"". Mr Hancock is not the first Tory leadership contender to highlight the issue, Dominic Raab recently saying that anti-Semitism in Labour was a ""stain on our country""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50416768,Lib Dems 'to protect worshippers from attacks',"The party promises tougher sentences for hate crimes, improved gender rights and less stop and search.",14 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Liberal Democrats have promised to protect places of worship from hate crimes and terror attacks if they win the general election.  The party is promising more funding for security - and also says it would bring in tougher sentences for hate crime. The Remain-supporting party has been criticised for running candidates against other pro-EU politicians. But Lib Dem health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said people wanting to stop Brexit ""have to back"" her party. The Conservatives say they want to ""get Brexit done"" by 31 January, while Labour is promising another referendum after the election, on a revised deal it hopes to reach with the EU. In other developments on Thursday: Home Office figures released last month showed a 10% rise in hate crimes - offences motivated by hostility towards someone's race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity - in England and Wales in 2018/19. The Liberal Democrats say they will turn all such crimes into ""aggravated offences"", meaning maximum sentences would rise. Currently, crimes committed for homophobic, disablist or transphobic reasons carry lower maximum jail times than those for aggravated by race or religion. By BBC Reality Check Hate crime statistics provide a breakdown of religiously motivated acts of criminal damage or arson, but these don't necessarily indicate whether they were on a place of worship.  These show that in 2018-19, there were roughly 850 reported cases of criminal damage - a rise from 570 five years ago.  Under 5% of these crimes resulted in someone being taken to court, lower than for other types of hate crime, such as assault.  The highest numbers of religious hate crimes are aimed at Muslims and Jews, who represent three-quarters of known victims.  Just under half of religious hate crime offences were targeted against Muslims in 2018/19, the Home Office said, and 18% were targeted against Jewish people. The Lib Dems are promising more funding for security at places of worship, schools and community centres ""vulnerable to hate crime and terror attacks"". The party says it wants ""complete data"" to be collected on the ethnicity of people going through the justice system, and an end to ""disproportionate"" use of stop-and-search powers by police on people from ethnic minorities. It is pledging to ensure ""equal marriage"" for all, including allowing the Church of England and the Church of Wales to carry out same-sex weddings. It wants to amend the Gender Recognition Act, so it no longer includes a requirement for medical reports to be submitted and recognises non-binary gender identities. Applicants for passports would be able to fill in an ""X gender option"" under its plans. Ms Berger said: ""Discrimination has no place in 21st century Britain. Unfortunately this is not the reality for too many in the UK."" She criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, for having ""inexcusably failed to root out anti-Semitism"" in the party and having ""betrayed the values of equality and anti-racism against all"". The Conservatives, Ms Berger added, were ""encouraging ugly nationalism"". Mr Corbyn has described anti-Semitism as a ""poison and and evil"", adding that his party has taken action to root it out. Earlier this week, the Conservatives expelled a number of members alleged to have posted Islamophobic content on social media, saying it would ""never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination"". The Lib Dems have entered a ""Remain alliance"" with the Green Party and Plaid Cymru in dozens of constituencies, meaning only the party with the best chance of a win will run in them. Ms Berger, who quit Labour earlier this year and joined the Lib Dems in September, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her old party had ""refused to engage"" in talks aimed at creating a wider anti-Brexit alliance. The Lib Dems are still contesting the seat of Canterbury, in Kent, despite their candidate quitting this week, saying he did not want to divide the Remain vote between himself and an anti-Brexit Labour rival. He has since been replaced. The Lib Dems are also fielding a candidate in South West Hertfordshire, where former Tory cabinet minister David Gauke - who was expelled from the Conservative parliamentary party after voting to block a no-deal Brexit - is running as an independent. Ms Berger said: ""I know and like David very, very much but, as I understand it, David would like a soft Brexit. People want a choice at this election."" For Labour, Mr Corbyn has said that, if he becomes prime minister, he would ""get Brexit sorted"" within six months, after getting a new deal with the EU and putting it to voters in a referendum. Conservative leader Boris Johnson says his agreement is ""oven-ready"" and can get through Parliament if he wins a majority at the election."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-50603395,'Faith is the number one thing influencing my vote',Some first-time voters feel they have to choose between religion and policy.,10 Dec 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Faith and politics.  Two things you've probably heard a fair bit about in this election period. From claims of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia within the biggest parties, to accusations that religion is influencing policies. ""Faith is deciding my vote,"" Josh Collins tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Josh is an 18-year-old student at the University of Nottingham - voting in his first election. He's Jewish and says he would like to vote for Labour, but can't because of what he calls, ""Labour's anti-Semitism crisis"". There are lots of Labour policies that impress Josh like their environmental commitments and pledge to end tuition fees. But he criticises Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for his handling of anti-Semitism, saying he's been too slow to stamp the problem out of the party. Labour are ""campaigning for him to get into Number 10, and as a Jewish person, I'd be genuinely scared if he got anywhere near the door"". ""I think, even though I don't want it to be, faith is the number one thing which is influencing my vote. I don't want a tolerance of abuse against religious minorities."" But not everyone shares the same fear. Alice Brostoff, 18, is also Jewish, but unlike Josh, will be voting for Labour. ""I feel like the Labour Party are the people that represent my views in a way I would want. No other party does that."" The issues which Alice feels passionate about include the NHS and austerity. She won't be voting for the Conservatives because she says they have ""handled Brexit really badly - though I don't believe there should be another [referendum on the EU]."" The University of Sheffield student thinks that anti-Semitism ""is a big thing"" but says ""it's not isolated to the Labour Party"". And she doesn't think faith will ever affect the way she votes, for her it's a political issue rather than anything to do with her identity. Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour party on several occasions and said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"". For Bilal Malik, a 24-year-old Muslim, faith ""will play a massive role"" in this election. He says he can't vote for the Conservatives because of their alleged issue with Islamophobia. Bilal says he's frustrated by the party's denial of the problem. ""Even within the Tories, there've been complaints in the past by legitimate Muslim voices, like Sayeeda Warsi. But the response to that has been so dismissive,"" he tells Newsbeat. He cites the Conservative leadership contest where candidates pledged to have an independent inquiry into Islamophobia - but nothing has yet materialised. The party says it will have an inquiry into all forms of prejudice and discrimination before the end of the year. ""It's that lack of willingness to take responsibility on Islamophobia that causes distrust of the Conservatives on the part of Muslims."" ""It's never been so bad,"" Bilal says. He feels comments made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past have encouraged people in society to be Islamophobic.  ""The lack of consequences for comments he's made speaks volumes. And because of the power he now holds in office, there is legitimacy in whatever he says."" He feels Islamophobia has an impact on his everyday life and now takes protective measures when using the tube, after hearing of incidents where Muslims have been targeted on train platforms. ""I don't get close to the yellow line until the doors fully open, just in case.""  ""It's worrying because you don't want to live in that kind of society."" Boris Johnson has apologised for the ""hurt and offence"" that has been caused by Islamophobia in the Tory Party. The chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, and the Muslim Council for Britain have both urged people to vote with their conscience, while emphasising it's not their place to tell people how to vote. Aaminah Saleem, 18, is Muslim, a member of the Conservatives and planning to vote for the party. She says it's been ""a struggle to put aside my feelings"", but ""religion and politics are separate right now"".  ""It's not hard for me to vote Conservative but at the back of my mind there are moral issues."" ""I'm trying to set them aside and focus on my local candidate; I'm sort of separating the national party from my local one."" The University of Birmingham student tells Newsbeat: ""I know we have a problem [with Islamophobia]. I think our two main parties have discrimination issues and the election has highlighted what a serious problem it is."" ""Both policies and my faith are very important, but for me, if I was to vote for Labour there would be moral problems as well.""  Aaminah says she's always felt welcome in the Conservatives. ""Most of my experience in the party has been positive, I've never felt my religion has disadvantaged me"". Aaminah, Josh and Bilal are all concerned by the parties' records when dealing with minority groups. Josh says the Conservatives record on Islamophobia will ""definitely impact"" his vote. Being able to live a normal life ""without fear of intimidation or abuse"" is his main priority.  ""I'd definitely put that above any issues like Brexit or climate change. I care about each party's record and how they deal with religious groups."" Bilal is unimpressed by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, saying both have major flaws. But other issues hold weight for him too. ""In an ideal world, you want leaders who are amazing and accepting. So alongside Islamophobia, things like education and the NHS will also play a role."" He says he'll most likely vote Labour as ""their vision resonates more with me than what the Conservatives are offering"". While Tory voter Aaminah wishes the issue of racism hadn't been ""politicised"".  ""Once you politicise an issue, like Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, you forget that there's a human problem behind it and it becomes political point scoring.""

The Ricketts family, which is aiming to buy Chelsea, says it will meet fans to allay concerns about its potential ownership.   They are one of six groups who have made their bids for Chelsea public. The bidders are all waiting to hear if they have made a shortlist.  Fans have criticised the Ricketts family's ownership of the Chicago Cubs baseball franchise, as well as anti-Muslim comments made by the family's patriarch Joe Ricketts in 2019. Paul Canoville, Chelsea's first black footballer, said on social media, external: ""So I've seen and heard enough. I'm backing Chelsea Supporters' Trust and saying a big fat anti-racism NO to the Ricketts bid."" On Wednesday the Ricketts family issued a statement, which said: ""Our family rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms. Racism and Islamophobia have no place whatsoever in our society. We have developed deep and abiding partnerships with the Muslim community in Chicago, as well as with all communities of colour.  ""Respect for diversity and inclusion are central to our family's values. If we prevail in our bid for Chelsea, we commit to the club and to the fans that we will actively promote these values."" Brian Wolff, the head of Chelsea's Chicago official supporters group and a Cubs fan, has also urged those handling the sale to reject the Ricketts bid in favour of other options after he claimed it had been met with ""universal disdain"" by fans in the US and worldwide.   He questioned the political allegiances of the family and said other bids would ""commit to not only building upon the last two decades of investment in players and infrastructure but, equally important, the investment in supporters and the values which we hold dear.""  Centricus bid to buy club intends to 'maintain existing management' Chelsea set for full semi-final support after talks between FA and government Is this a moment of reckoning for English football ownership? Investment firm selling club expects sale could happen this month Multiple bids lodged to buy Premier League club Life after Abramovich - what's next for Chelsea and English football? However, sources close to the Ricketts family said Joe Ricketts would have no role or involvement in the bid for Chelsea, which is being headed up by his children Tom, Todd and Laura, who - unlike her Republican family - is a Democrat. The family took over at the Cubs in 2009 and led the team to a World Series win in 2016, their first in 108 years. The family also redeveloped the Cubs stadium, Wrigley Field, and the surrounding area, costing about Â£750m. It is understood the family want to speak to the Chelsea Supporters' Trust and Chelsea Pitch Owners, who hold the freehold to Stamford Bridge, and have already spoken with Chelsea and Fulham MP Greg Hands.  The CST is willing to meet any prospective owners and said on Monday it wants the government to ""discount any bid which is unwilling to issue a golden share to fans"".  That would mean special veto rights to block key decisions such as Chelsea moving stadium, changing its club colours or its badge. In a statement the CST added: ""We will continue to reaffirm that any new owner must share the inclusive views of Chelsea football club and our diverse support base.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-49143822,Payout after preacher's wrongful arrest,Footage of the street preacher's arrest has been viewed online almost three million times.,28 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Christian street preacher who had his Bible confiscated as he was handcuffed by police has been awarded £2,500 for wrongful arrest. Footage of the arrest of Oluwole Ilesanmi pleading with police to not ""take my Bible away"", has been viewed online almost three million times. He was detained outside Southgate Tube station in February after a 999 call claimed he had been Islamophobic. The Met said it had a right to investigate a potential hate crime. In a video posted online, Mr Ilesanmi, 64, is seen telling police: ""Jesus is on the way.""  An officer, who arrested him for breach of the peace, can be heard replying: ""I appreciate that but nobody wants to listen to that. They want you to go away.""  When Mr Ilesanmi tries to keep hold of his Bible, an officer says: ""You should've thought about that before being racist."" Mr Ilesanmi admits describing Islam as an ""aberration"" but said he was expressing his point of view as a Christian rather than denigrating Muslims. On Tuesday, Mr Ilesanmi will hand a petition to the Home Office, signed by 38,000 people, asking for greater protection for street preachers. Scotland Yard has since agreed to pay Mr Ilesanmi £2,500 for wrongful arrest and his humiliating and distressing treatment. Mr Ilesanmi said: ""I am glad that the police have recognised that it was not right to arrest me for preaching from the Bible.  ""It was traumatic being arrested. But I'm was determined to get back to Southgate and start preaching the gospel again."" Supt Neil Billany, of the force, said: ""The Met respects and upholds the rights of all individuals to practice freedom of speech, and this includes street preachers of all religions and backgrounds.  ""However, if the language someone uses is perceived as being a potential hate crime, it is only right that we investigate.  ""That is the role of the police, even if a decision is subsequently made that their actions are not criminal. In this case, it was deemed appropriate to remove the man from the area."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-40340803,'No British problem with Islamophobia',"In the wake of the Finsbury Park attack, UKIP's Neil Hamilton claimed there are no reliable hate crime figures.",20 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Britain does not have a problem with Islamophobia and there are no reliable statistics on hate crime, UKIP assembly group leader Neil Hamilton has said. Mr Hamilton said the majority of British people are ""tolerant and welcoming"". His comments come after the Finsbury Park terror attack in London. BBC Wales understands that the man suspected to have driven a van into Muslim worshippers on Monday is from Cardiff. Mr Hamilton also suggested that ""firm control"" of immigration would ""at least"" alleviate problems of fundamentalist terrorism. In February it was reported that all police forces in Wales saw hate crime rise in the first full three months following the EU referendum. Greater Manchester Police said there was a significant rise in hate crimes after a terror attack in the city in May.  Asked if Britain has a problem with Islamophobia, Mr Hamilton told a press conference: ""No I don't, actually. ""The overwhelming majority of the British people are tolerant and welcoming.  ""Inevitably there is a minority that is prepared to resort to violence and abuse. That's not acceptable."" He added: ""There are no reliable statistics on hate crime for example."" Mr Hamilton added: ""There isn't a general problem with Islamophobia in the United Kingdom or Wales"". Mr Hamilton opened the press conference by talking about a Senedd debate on immigration, to be held by the party on Wednesday. The debate calls for a ""controlled and fair immigration system"". ""For the last few years we've been adding a city the size of Cardiff to the population of the UK every single year,"" he said. ""That's undoubtedly had an impact upon the provision of public services in different parts of the UK"". Asked how to ensure rhetoric on immigration does not divide communities, Mr Hamilton said: ""We've seen now the results of years of ignoring the problem, deliberately suppressing discussion of the issue."" ""There are massive difficulties the country now faces as a result of this uncontrolled inflow,"" he said. ""The case of Salman Abedi is a case in point,"" Mr Hamilton said, referring to the perpetrator of the recent attack in Manchester. ""They came from Libya in 2008. We now know that family was known to have connections with Islamic fundamentalist groups in Libya. ""No system of immigration control is full-proof,"" he said. But he added: ""We have to get our border control system fit for purpose and we have to be more alert to the need to scrutinise the background of those who are coming here."" ""This is a composite problem, which goes way beyond the immigration problem"", he said. ""A firm control of immigration and in particular a proper appraisal of asylum seekers qualifications is an essential part - it will not solve the problem completely no doubt - but at least alleviating the problems of fundamentalist terrorism."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43920227,Labour expels activist over remarks to MP,Marc Wadsworth accused Ruth Smeeth at an anti-Semitism event of working with the media to hurt Labour.,27 Apr 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour has expelled an activist for bringing the party into disrepute after he criticised a Jewish MP at the launch of an anti-Semitism report. Marc Wadsworth accused Ruth Smeeth of working ""hand in hand"" with the media to undermine Labour. Labour's National Constitutional Committee found he breached the party's rules and should be thrown out.  Mrs Smeeth welcomed the result but Mr Wadsworth said he would see whether he could launch a legal challenge.  The announcement followed a high-profile disciplinary hearing in which Mrs Smeeth gave evidence against him.  Before Wednesday's hearing, Mr Wadsworth - an anti-racism campaigner and Momentum activist - suggested that he was being ""hung out to dry"".  Mrs Smeeth branded his comments, at the launch of the Chakrabarti report into anti-Semitism, ""vile conspiracy theories"" while a group of MPs who accompanied her to the hearing had demanded action.  A Labour spokesman said: ""The National Constitutional Committee of the Labour Party has found that two charges of a breach of the Labour Party's rule 2.1.8 by Marc Wadsworth have been proven."" ""The NCC consequently determined that the sanction for this breach of Labour Party rules will be expulsion from membership."" The MP thanked all those who had supported her throughout what she said had been a two-year ""ordeal"", saying there was no place for ""bullying and intimidation"" within the party. ""I am relieved that after nearly two years this matter has finally been resolved,"" she said.  ""I hope that this decision represents the first step towards a return to the values of decency and respect throughout the Labour Party."" The Jewish Labour Movement also welcomed the outcome, saying the case was ""symptomatic of the ongoing delays in resolving disciplinary matters"".  Mr Wadsworth said in a statement that he had been ""overwhelmed by the support I've received"" and intended to look at ""all my options to legally challenge the decision"". He added: ""I deplore anti-Semitism, anti-black racism, Islamophobia and all forms of prejudice, bigotry and discrimination that I have campaigned against all my political life and will continue to do so."" He later told reporters that Mr Corbyn, whom he described as an ""old friend and comrade"", had ""had a go"" at him after the incident and told him he could have used ""kinder language"". But he said Labour's leader had been supportive since then and had told mutual friends he ""doesn't see I did anything wrong"". He suggested a member of Mr Corbyn's team had contacted him on the morning of the hearing to say they were ""working behind the scenes"" on his behalf but would not say who this was.  The activist was supported by Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, who said he was ""astonished"" by the ""absurd"" decision to expel the activist. ""It flies in the face of the evidence presented and offends against the principles of natural justice,"" he said, in a statement on Facebook. ""The NCC's [National Constitutional Committee] decision has all the hallmarks of predetermination and tramples on Labour's record of standing up for fairness."" The MP for Derby North said he would help Mr Wadsworth in his efforts to ""clear his name"". But Labour MP Anna Turley, one of those who accompanied Mrs Smeeth to the hearing, said the decision was the right one as Labour should be in the ""vanguard of the fight against prejudice and hate""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40323769,Finsbury Park attack: What we know so far,One person has died and nine people were taken to hospital after a van was driven into people in north London.,20 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of terror offences after he drove a van into a group of worshippers close to a mosque in north London. One man, who had taken ill before the attack began, died and nine others were taken to hospital, some of whom were critically injured.  The terror attack happened shortly before 00:20 BST on Monday, 19 June, when the vehicle mounted the pavement outside Muslim Welfare House - which is also a community centre - on Seven Sisters Road. Here is what we know so far. A number of worshippers from Muslim Welfare House and nearby Finsbury Park Mosque were on the streets at the time, having just taken part in evening prayers after breaking the Ramadan fast.  A group were helping an elderly man who had fallen down in Whadcoat Street - a short road off Seven Sisters Road - as they waited for their next set of prayers.  It was then that a white van came down the street, mounted the pavement and drove into people.  Calls were made to the emergency services at about 00:20 BST. A police van arrived within one minute and a cordon was raised around the area within 10 minutes.  The man who was driving the van was restrained by people at the scene, and an imam stopped some of the crowd from attacking the suspect. More than 60 medics went to help the injured, including ambulance crews, advance paramedics, specialist response teams, and a trauma team from London's Air Ambulance. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack was ""declared a terrorist incident within eight minutes"" of the first emergency call being received.  As a result, officers from the local borough are being supported by armed police and the Territorial Support Group, which is deployed to events that may involve public disorder. The Counter Terrorism Command is leading the investigation. Police confirmed early on Monday that the elderly man who was receiving first aid before the attack had later died.  He has not yet been named, and police said they were still investigating whether he died as a result of the attack or something else. The London Ambulance Service said nine people were being treated in three hospitals in the capital, with some in a serious condition. Two other people were treated at the scene for minor injuries.  The police confirmed that all the victims were Muslims.  Witnesses reported seeing one man giving CPR to a victim in the street, while another man's head injury was treated with a makeshift dressing. The BBC understands Darren Osborne, a 47-year-old man from the Cardiff area, was initially arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He grew up in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset and has four children. He was later also arrested for the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism. Immediately after the attack he was detained by members of the public as they waited for police to arrive on the scene.  Eyewitness Abdul Rahman told the BBC: ""When the guy came out from his van he wanted to escape, run away, and he was saying 'I want to kill Muslims. 'I want to kill Muslims.'"" Police said he was taken to hospital as a precaution. Security minister Ben Wallace said the man was not known to the police or security services, and it is thought he acted alone.  Some witnesses said there was more than one person involved in the attack, but a statement from the police said there were no other suspects.   Forensics officers are now examining the white van, which has Pontyclun Van Hire - a firm from Rhondda Cynon Taff in Wales - written on it. A residential address in the Cardiff area is being searched in relation to the terror attack.  Mr Osborne's family released a statement, which said: ""We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in.  ""We're devastated for the families, our hearts go out to those who've been injured. ""It's madness, it must just be complete madness."" Mrs May said the incident was a terror attack. She said the man arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack ""targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives"".  She reiterated remarks that were made after an attack near London Bridge, saying ""there has been far too much tolerance of extremism over many years."" She added that there would be nowhere left for extremism to hide. Labour leader and local MP Jeremy Corbyn said on Twitter that he was ""totally shocked"" by what had happened.  ""I've been in touch with the mosques, police and Islington council regarding the incident. My thoughts are with those and the community affected by this awful event."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan promised additional policing to reassure communities, especially those observing Ramadan. He has also asked people to ""remain calm and vigilant"". ""We don't yet know the full details, but this was clearly a deliberate attack on innocent Londoners, many of whom were finishing prayers during the holy month of Ramadan,"" he said.  ""While this appears to be an attack on a particular community, like the terrible attacks in Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge, it is also an assault on all our shared values of tolerance, freedom and respect."" Imam Mohammed Mahmoud, who protected the alleged attacker from an angry crowd, said: ""This demonisation of the Muslim community at the hands of people with ulterior motives... have succeeded to some extent [by] influencing the vulnerable and the impressionable.  ""It's on a par with the London Bridge attack... and we just hope that in times of tragedy people come together and unite.  ""The fabric of this society is not torn but we have to continue to keep the fabric of this society intact, and come together."" General secretary of the Finsbury Park mosque Mohammed Kozbar said: ""An attack on one faith is an attack on all faiths and communities.  ""They will try to divide us... they will not succeed."" The secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), Harun Khan, tweeted that the van had ""intentionally run over worshippers"" and that he was ""shocked and outraged"". In a statement, the MCB added that it was a ""violent manifestation of Islamophobia"" and called for extra security around mosques. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid spoke briefly to concerned residents before being led through the police cordon as he visited the scene. He said ""the attacker will not succeed in his efforts to divide British society"".  The Jewish Community Council of North London called the attack ""barbaric"" and tweeted that members shared their ""thoughts and prayers with our friends and neighbours"". Speaking on his first state visit as Irish prime minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: ""I think pretty much everyone in Ireland has somebody who lives [in London] who's a relative or a close friend. ""And when there's an attack on London, we feel in Ireland that it's almost an attack on us as well."" Police have asked witnesses or anyone with information to call them on 101 or contact them via Twitter @MetCC. Information can also be provided anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or visiting its website."

She's giving her reaction to Darren Osborne being jailed for life for driving a van into a group of Muslims near a north London mosque, killing 51-year-old Makram Ali. ""We're just relieved that it's finally over, and the family's at least able to get justice,"" Hana, from Finsbury Park, adds. ""The whole community is low, they're kind of grieving over it.""  The sentencing was announced just before prayers started at Finsbury Park mosque on Friday. In an announcement to worshippers, its trustee Khaled Omar said the community must react with ""relief but not happiness"". He asked them to think of Mr Ali's family as well as the family of Mr Osborne, who he said must be suffering too. ""Our thoughts now are with the victims who've lost dear ones, and those who were injured,"" he told Newsbeat. ""We're totally focused now on trying to help them rebuild their life. We know that this is a scar that will stay with them forever."" Nine people were also injured in the attack.  ""It's something you can't forget, and it's definitely affected the area,"" said Merium Bhuiyan, who attends the mosque. ""People were a lot more concerned in terms of going out after the attack. ""We had a few incidents of Islamophobia, like women having their headscarves ripped off and feeling uncomfortable and unsafe, especially on public transport,"" she says. The 30-year-old says local police have worked with the community to try and make them feel safer. ""The message of hope and positivity that's come out of it is that people have come together. There's been a stronger sense of community."" 30-year-old Ibrahim agrees: ""The fact that he's been sentenced to prison shows us that our voice has been heard.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-45640506,PM faces roadblocks in Birmingham,Theresa May has little room for manoeuvre in Birmingham's traffic.,26 Sep 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"That's always been the standing joke about Birmingham.  But these days, there's many a true word.... No-one would argue it will be a very good thing indeed when we see an end to the grinding disruption caused by one of the biggest building sites in Europe.  There is a double meaning here. Will this gigantic project culminate in a city centre showpiece that really is genuinely ""good when it's finished""? There will be no avoiding the question when about 11,000 people converge on the city for next week's Conservative Party Conference.  Looming high over the convention centre are the giant cranes constructing the project entitled, with not a trace of irony, Paradise.      It's more hellish than heavenly for anyone enduring the traffic jams, cones and road closures surrounding the site.  And there could be no more appropriate metaphor for how little room for manoeuvre Theresa May has as she struggles to steer a course to keep her show on the road.  A party conference less than six months before Britain leaves the EU was always bound to be a bumpy ride.  But the events of recent days leave Mrs May just as tightly boxed in as Birmingham's long-suffering drivers. The rebuff to her Chequers plan in Salzburg has, on her own admission, increased the chances of a no-deal Brexit.  In a region where more than 50,000 people work in car making, no deal would cost tens of thousands of those jobs, according to the Chief Executive of Jaguar Land Rover, Dr Ralf Speth.  He also warns a ""hard Brexit"" would wipe out the £1.2bn a year profits he needs to invest in the next generation of low and zero-emission vehicles.  These are essential if Mrs May's prescription for ""zero emissions mobility"", which she set out in the self-same Birmingham conference centre three weeks ago, is to be realised over the next 30 years.  Yes, all roads lead to Birmingham: Dr Speth made his speech there as well. If she hopes to give him what he wants, frictionless access to European markets and just-in-time delivery of goods and components, while also equipping the UK to sign trade deals around the world, she would inevitably be thwarted yet again by further accusations of cherry picking. But her Common Rule Book to enable Dr Speth's car parts to be moved across the EU is derided by Brexiteers as ""the Euro Rule Book"".  Maybe they feel she has already listened too much to business leaders like Dr Speth.    And then there are the voters themselves.  Many thousands of them, especially in the Black Country and Stoke, supported Leave and switched from Labour to the Conservatives in Stoke South and Walsall North in last year's general election.  How can Mrs May make the compromises she needs in pursuit of a Brexit deal without appearing in places like these to be backtracking on Brexit?  On the other hand, the Conservatives lost Warwick and Leamington to Labour and had their majority squeezed in Worcester, apparently on the strength of Remain sentiment in these and other areas which have long been considered safer Tory territory.       And all this while holding together a party whose rival factions are breathing fire.  We hear Boris Johnson will make another of his rock star entrances into Birmingham to address about 1,000 activists on the eve of Mrs May's conference speech. The question mark will hang over Mrs May's leadership whatever happens in Birmingham.   Brexitologists among you will say there are infinitely more complications which narrow the road for her and ensure every time she steers one way she is open to an equal and opposite reaction.  There is just nowhere to park the awkward questions which previous leaders have so often contrived to avoid.    And it's not just the back-seat drivers in her party she needs to worry about. Other traffic hazards can come unexpectedly, from the Left.  After a summer in which the damaging row over anti-Semitism has dogged the Labour Party in general and Jeremy Corbyn in particular, his party's Deputy Leader of Birmingham City Council, Brigid Jones, conceded to me during last weekend's Sunday Politics Midlands it had not been Labour's finest hour: An example of English irony perhaps?  But she went on to tell me the Conservatives needed to confront a no less serious challenge in their own ranks: Islamophobia. I was contacted after our programme by viewers suggesting I should ask Theresa May about this.  And ask her I will, when I join her in Number Ten during the run-up to this first party conference since last year's car crash in Manchester: falling stage logos, coughing fits and all. I hear, incidentally, to avoid any embarrassing repeats this time, all the words and logos displayed on the set will be projected on rather than stuck.  But there's no legislating against the perennial curse known to politicians, activists and journalists alike as the conference cold. To find out how she answers this and other questions, you'll have to join me for this weekend's Sunday Politics Midlands at 11.00 BST on BBC One Midlands and, this week, across the UK on BBC One HD.  Joining me in the studio will be Education Minister and Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon Nadhim Zahawi and former shadow Treasury chief secretary and Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood Shabana Mahmood. And by the way, if proud Brummies among you are about to berate me on Twitter and elsewhere for those comments about the Paradise development and the traffic logjam in the city where the concrete never sets, relax. Bring it on, I say. A city devoid of cranes and building sites is a city without a future. I just hope it'll be good when it's finished."

It said the Swedish government's decision to allow the protest to go ahead was ""completely unacceptable"". It comes amid growing diplomatic tension between the two countries. Turkey, which had appealed to Sweden to stop the protest, earlier called off a visit by Sweden's Defence Minister, Pal Jonson, saying the trip had ""lost its significance and meaning"".  It was hoped the trip could dispel Ankara's objections to the Scandinavian country joining the Nato military alliance. Turkey has so far held up both Sweden and Finland's Nato applications. Turkey wants political concessions, including the deportation of critics of its President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Kurds that it claims are terrorists. Turkey is already a Nato member, which means it can block another country from joining. Sweden and Finland both applied to join Nato after Russia invaded Ukraine.  Rasmus Paludan, a politician from the Danish far-right Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, burnt a copy of the Quran during the protest on Saturday afternoon outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Turkey is a majority Muslim country. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement denouncing the act, which it said happened despite ""repeated warnings"". ""Permitting this anti-Islam act, which targets Muslims and insults our sacred values, under the guise of 'freedom of expression' is completely unacceptable,"" it said. It added that the burning of the Quran was another example of the ""alarming"" extent to which Islamophobia, racism and discrimination had reached Europe, and it called on the Swedish government to take ""necessary measures"".  Sweden's Foreign Minister, Tobias Billstrom, called the act ""appalling"".  ""Sweden has a far-reaching freedom of expression, but it does not imply that the Swedish government, or myself, support the opinions expressed,"" he wrote on Twitter. Separate protests both in support of and against Turkey were also held in Stockholm. After Turkey cancelled the Swedish defence minister's trip, Mr Jonson tweeted: ""Our relations with Turkey are very important to Sweden, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue on common security and defence issues at a later date."" Demonstrators in Stockholm last week hung an effigy of President Erdogan from a lamppost in what Sweden's Prime Minister said was an effort to sabotage Sweden's Nato application.  Mr Paludan held rallies last year at which he threatened to burn the Quran, sparking riots."

""His legacy will be much more about what's happened off the field,"" Rotheram added. Salah was named both PFA Player of the Year,Football Writers Footballer of the Year and Premier League Player of the Season after his 32 goals set a new record for the most in a 38-game season.

A chant by Liverpool fans about their player includes the line ""sitting in the mosque, that's where I wanna be""  - and was praised on social media, external by Salah himself. ""To have that breakdown of Islamophobia caused by one person is an absolutely phenomenal achievement,"" Rotheram told BBC Radio 5 live's Mo Salah: Football is Life.

Supt Bennett and Ms Hussain said some victims got so used to being abused they treated it as normal, racial harassment tended to be carried out by young white men and that some people assumed Muslim women would not be allowed by men to report crimes. Supt Bennett, Avon and Somerset Police's hate crime lead, said: ""Islamic women in particular are suffering, often almost daily, verbal harassment and persistent name calling and intimidation - and this is the area where we really want to smash it. ""They are normalising this behaviour because it's part of their everyday life and I want to say 'the police absolutely don't want you to put up with this behaviour'."" Ms Hussain, from We Rise, which aims to empower Muslim women, said: ""Sometimes there's a tendency to treat Muslim women differently than women in general when it comes to issues such as not reporting crime.  ""The assumption made by many authorities is that Muslim women are under the control of men and therefore aren't able to report crimes, when actually if you look at the wider statistics relating to all gender-based violence such as sexual harassment, rape, domestic violence - you can see that the reporting rates are very low.""  Supt Bennett said, based on results from The British Crime Survey, police knew there was ""still a substantial gap between reported and unreported crime and in some crime categories it can be as much as 50%"". ""The survey unsurprisingly shows even higher levels of under-reporting for hate crime. Every time I talk to Muslim groups, I can never find anybody who hasn't suffered from some form of hate crime and therefore my gut tells me that under-reporting is probably off the charts,"" he said.  He said officers had to ""work much harder"" to get the message through to women because ""they're not as overtly present on prayer days as the men"".  Sheila el Dieb, 72, from Bristol, has been a Muslim for 20 years. She said her experiences ranged from verbal abuse to physical abuse and damage of her property in previous homes.  ""Sometimes I feel that women may be reluctant to report incidents and run the risk of upsetting family members who have been unable to protect them and risk changing the normal pattern of life,"" she said. ""I think most of the hate crime is perpetrated in the street by people passing by. Often we go into shock when it happens because it's unexpected and we don't know what to do.  ""Generally it's opportunist. If your first language is not English, you think 'did I really hear that?'."" Supt Bennett said the abuse his force dealt with was not just confined to Bristol.   ""There are mosques in Bridgwater, Yeovil, Taunton, Street, Glastonbury,"" he said. ""It's not unique to Bristol but amplified by the size of the Muslim community.  ""An incredible amount of hate crime is perpetrated by a stranger to the victim. Our positive outcomes in hate crime are incredibly low and if we don't have CCTV or witnesses it can be difficult. ""The perpetrators of racial harassment tend to be young white men under the age of 25. Perpetrators of hate crime tend to be cowards. They pick on people when they're vulnerable, on their own. It's the psychology of the bully. ""Why young white men? Hate crime is driven by ignorance. If you were to profile that 'young white man', they would tend to be what I'd call right wing."" Aaliyah Hussain said she had not experienced anti-Muslim crime because she was not ""visibly Muslim"".  ""I don't wear the headscarf. I've endured racism but not Islamophobia. But women who do wear the headscarf are far more likely to be abused because they're considered fair game - and it's because of the pervasive hostility towards Muslims that is encouraged by the right wing media,"" she said. Alex Raikes, from Stand Against Racism and Inequality (SARI), said they ""encouraged Muslim women to come forward to them when they suffer anti-Muslim abuse"".  ""SARI will support any victim whether they want to report to other agencies or not - 35% of SARI's clients are Muslim so many people are coming forward and clearly Islamophobic abuse is happening all too often.  ""If it's not reported, it can't be stopped. SARI has also set up the Tackling Islamophobia Working Group (TIWG) to ensure agencies such as the police and local authority and Muslim communities work together."""

Egypt striker Salah, 26, was filmed on a mobile phone from a section of home supporters as he was taking a corner. The footage, taken by a fellow fan, shows expletives directed at Salah, including about his Muslim religion. In a statement, West Ham said they have ""a zero tolerance policy to any form of violent or abusive behaviour"". It continued: ""We are an inclusive football club. Anyone identified committing an offence will have their details passed to the police and will face a lifetime ban from London Stadium. ""There is no place for this kind of behaviour at our stadium."" The user who posted the video on Twitter said: ""I was disgusted by what I was hearing. People like this deserve no place in our society let alone football matches."" Police are aware of the incident. ""We are dismayed to see yet another high-profile incident of discrimination in English football,"" anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out said in a statement. ""We are pleased that West Ham officials have expressed their determination to identify the supporter and take firm action - this type of behaviour is simply unacceptable and must be challenged swiftly and decisively.""  Salah was named PFA Player of the Year, Football Writers' Footballer of the Year and Premier League Player of the Season last year after his 32 goals set a new record for the most in a 38-game season. He has been praised by Steve Rotheram, mayor of Liverpool, for helping to tackle Islamophobia and ""breaking down barriers"", as well as being described as a role model for Muslim children.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-46557076,Wales a 'hunting ground' for far right,"Young, poor, vulnerable people are being recruited by the far right, says an anti-radicalisation expert.",16 Dec 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Wales has become a ""hunting ground"" for the far right, the leader of an anti-radicalisation project has warned. Young, poor, vulnerable people are most susceptible to recruitment, said Tony Hendrickson, co-ordinator of the lottery-funded Resilience project. He explained teachers need to be better at spotting and reacting to racism in order to ""counter the narrative"". The Welsh Government said it expects schools and local authorities to comply with counter-terrorism legislation. Mr Hendrickson, 54, who grew up in Llanrumney, Cardiff, is the new co-ordinator of Resilience, which is run by charity Ethnic Minorities and Youth Support Team (EYST). His warning comes as new figures reveal a 36% rise in people referred to the UK's terrorism-prevention programme, Prevent, over right-wing extremism. A lack of diversity in large parts of Wales makes it easier for the far right narrative to take hold ""because it is easier to alienate people if you don't know them"", Mr Hendrickson explained. He added the far right issue is a bigger problem in Wales than Islamist extremism, and has grown as a movement since the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump. ""The Islamist problem has never been that big. If Muslims had really bought into that, there would have been bombs going off every day,"" he said. Resilience was set up in response to Prevent, which was criticised by some for being ""Islamophobic"". It works with vulnerable young people at risk of political or religious radicalisation - both to the far right and to Islamic extremism - or sexual exploitation. ""Resilience is about providing a response - a counter narrative,"" explained Mr Hendrickson. Working in schools, youth centres, colleges and prisons, he said most of the work his team do is pre-emptive, increasing the ability of vulnerable young people to resist radicalisation or exploitation. Mr Hendrickson said school staff need to be more aware of racist attitudes among pupils. ""A lot of schools are still struggling with incidents of racism - either they don't recognise it or they are uncomfortable to respond,"" he said. ""I don't blame parents but something should be happening at school. We are living in a diverse society, we need to have these discussions."" He used the example of a Syrian boy who was getting into trouble at school to illustrate the problem. ""One of our workers went to the school to speak to the boy, and found out he was being racially bullied,"" he said. ""When he raised that with the teachers, they hadn't recognised that at all."" Mr Hendrickson called for diversity education similar to sex education. He claimed the problem of far right extremism is ""cyclical"" and ""will get worse before it gets better"". ""The far right has been emboldened by the rise of UKIP, and to some degree the main parties have bought into that narrative,"" he added. ""The far right will only ever be violent because the narrative is based on anger and aggression: it's not about dialogue and getting people around the table. For them, it's 'us' against 'them', a race war."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""The UK Government published the Prevent Duty Guidance for England and Wales for specified bodies including education providers.  ""We would expect local authorities and schools to take reasonable steps to encourage compliance with the responsibilities under the Counter Terrorism Act. ""Our curriculum will aim to develop all our children as ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world, ensuring they respect the needs and rights of others, as members of a diverse society.  ""The safety, security and wellbeing of children and young people is of paramount importance and we expect schools to adopt a zero tolerance approach to all forms of bullying."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54598546,French pupils held after teacher beheaded,"In all, 15 people are now in custody after the murder of teacher Samuel Paty near Paris.",20 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Four school students are among 15 people who have been taken into custody in France following the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, who showed controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his pupils. The other detainees include four family members of the killer, a father at the school and a known Islamist radical. Police carried out some 40 raids on the homes of suspected radicals on Monday and more raids are expected. The brutal killing has shocked France. Tens of thousands of people took part in rallies across the country on Sunday to honour Mr Paty and defend freedom of speech. A ceremony paying tribute to Mr Paty, who was 47, will be held at the Sorbonne University in Paris on Wednesday. A man named as 18-year-old Abdoulakh A was shot dead by police on Friday after killing Mr Paty close to his school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a north-west suburb of Paris. Four school pupils who may have helped identify Mr Paty to his killer in exchange for payment have been detained, a judicial source told the AFP news agency on Monday. This brings to a total of 15 the number of people taken into custody in the aftermath of the murder.  The killer's grandfather, parents and 17-year-old brother were detained shortly after the gruesome attack.  The father of a pupil who reportedly launched an online campaign against Mr Paty and a preacher described by French media as a radical Islamist were among six people arrested on Saturday. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin accused the two men of having issued a ""fatwa"" against the teacher. The dozens of raids on Monday targeting suspected Islamist radicals were not necessarily linked to the investigation into Mr Paty's murder. But Mr Darmanin said police would be interviewing about 80 people who were believed to have posted messages in support of the killing. ""We want to harass and destabilise this movement in a very determined way,"" an interior ministry source told AFP. The government also said it was probing 51 French Muslim associations. It said if any were found to be promoting hatred, they would be closed down. One organisation, the Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), was labelled an ""enemy of the state"" by Mr Darmanin. The organisation, which monitors anti-Muslim hate crime in France, has accused the minister of slander after he claimed the group was ""obviously"" involved in Friday's attack. In a statement following news of the attack, the CCIF expressed ""our pain and our sadness to the family of this teacher"". Anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-François Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class about freedom of speech earlier in October. As he had done in similar lessons in recent years, Mr Paty, a history and geography teacher, advised Muslim students to leave the room if they thought they might be offended. Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslims because Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God). The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the famous publishing of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A trial is currently underway over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015. Some French-Muslims say they are frequent targets of racism and discrimination because of their faith - an issue that has long caused tension in the country. Abdoulakh A is understood to have been an 18-year-old Chechen, born in Moscow, who had been living in the Normandy town of Évreux, about 100km (60 miles) from the murder scene. He had no known links to either Mr Paty or his school. Mr Ricard said that the killer went to the school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine on Friday afternoon and asked students to point out the teacher. The suspect followed Mr Paty as he walked home from work. He then used a knife to attack the teacher, before beheading him. Witnesses are said to have heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is Greatest"". When police responded to the scene and confronted him, he fired at them with an airgun. Officers returned fire, hitting him nine times. A 30cm-long (12in) blade was found close by. Authorities said the man had been before courts in the past but only on minor misdemeanour charges."

The author of a letter received by Erkin Guney, chairman of Masjid Ramadan mosque, in Hackney, said they ""could not stop smiling"" seeing the footage of the disaster. The father of three said his ""stomach turned"" after reading it. The earthquakes have claimed more than 40,000 lives and seen some towns with 80% of buildings turned to rubble. The anonymous letter wished for ""more deaths"" saying ""the more Muslims that suffer the better"". It read: ""I could not stop smiling watching the people being pulled from the rubble, some dead some still sadly alive."" It expressed ""comfort"" at news of entire families being killed in the disaster and wished for another earthquake in the region. Mr Guney, who has overseen 300 aid boxes dispatched from the mosque, also known as Shacklewell Lane Mosque, said he had received hundreds of supportive messages. He said the first line of the offensive letter mentioned ""sorrow"", adding: ""It was only when I read the second line, I stopped in my tracks and realised it was a very hateful message. I was lost for words, it turned my stomach.""  Mr Guney has origins in Famagusta, in Turkish-controlled Cyprus, where he says his town has witnessed 48 deaths, mostly children. He added: ""We are all still in a state of shock and grief. I cannot comprehend how someone would take time out of their day to formulate such poison.  ""I only pray for that person as he must have so much hate in his heart, and be in dark hole.""  The Metropolitan Police confirmed another mosque in Stoke Newington had also received a letter with racist and Islamophobic language.  The force added no arrests had been made but inquiries were ongoing. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to hellobbclondon@bbc.co.uk"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59933029,Man held for making app to auction Muslim women,"The arrest came days after a similar app, Bulli Bai, generated outrage and led to four arrests.",10 Jan 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Police in India have arrested a man suspected of creating an app that put up photos of more than 80 Muslim women for ""sale"" online last year. The open source app - Sulli Deals - had been hosted on web platform GitHub in July 2021. The 25-year-old was arrested days after a similar app - Bulli Bai - uploaded photos of more than 100 Muslim women. Four students, including a 21-year-old student who allegedly created the second app, were arrested. In both cases, there was no actual sale, but the purpose was to degrade and humiliate Muslim women, many of whom have been outspoken about the rising tide of Hindu nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Sulli"" is a derogatory Hindi slang term right-wing Hindu trolls use for Muslim women, and ""bulli"" is also pejorative. After the Bulli Bai app generated outrage online, one of the women who had filed a police complaint in July alleged that police in the capital Delhi had not taken any action yet. On Sunday, police arrested Aumkareshwar Thakur from Indore city in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. Police told BBC Marathi that Mr Thakur's name came up while Neeraj Bishnoi, the alleged creator of the Bulli Bai app, was being questioned. Mr Thakur's devices are being analysed, KPS Malhotra, the deputy commissioner of Delhi Police's cyber crime team, told the BBC. The Sulli Deals app had taken publicly available pictures of women and created profiles, describing the women as ""deals of the day"". Those featured on the app were all vocal Muslims, including journalists, activists, artists or researchers. One of the women, a commercial pilot, told the BBC in July that she felt ""chills"" go down her spine when she heard about the app. The Bulli Bai app also generated similar reactions from the women whose photos were uploaded without their permission - this included several journalists, a Bollywood actor and the 65-year-old mother of a disappeared Indian student. A 2018 Amnesty International report on online harassment in India showed that the more vocal a woman was, the more likely she was to be targeted - the scale of this increased for women from religious minorities and disadvantaged castes. Critics say trolling against Muslim women has worsened in recent years in India's polarised political climate."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47514251,McDonnell would welcome Labour probe,"The shadow chancellor says he wants Labour to be a ""shining example"" in tackling anti-Semitism.",10 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour's John McDonnell has welcomed a potential investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism in his party.  The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it is considering a formal inquiry following a number of complaints, including from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. The shadow chancellor told the BBC he wants Labour to be a ""shining example"" in the way it tackles anti-Semitism. He added: ""Let's get on with it now"".   Jeremy Corbyn has said anti-Semitism has ""no place whatsoever"" in the party. The Labour Party has been dealing with complaints of anti-Semitism over the last two years. On Friday, the chair of Labour peers wrote to party leader Mr Corbyn to express ""alarm"" at the ""ongoing failure"" to resolve the issue - something they said ""diminishes the moral authority of the Labour Party"". The EHRC is asking Labour to work with it to improve its processes.  It has raised concerns with the party, which has two weeks to respond before it decides whether to take enforcement action - which can range from a voluntary agreement with the party to a full-blown investigation.   The watchdog, which was set up by the Labour government in 2006, said it believed the party ""may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs"", following a number of complaints. Asked about the investigation, Mr McDonnell told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I'm hoping we will get a clean bill of health about how we are handling things.  ""If there are issues that the EHRC can advise us on, I welcome that. Because I want us to be a shining example of how you tackle issues like anti-Semitism, both within your own party, but also wider society. ""Let's get it done, because we will all learn lessons from it and I hope that other political parties as well - in how they deal with the racism that they've experienced in their own party - learn from this too."" The Conservatives have been accused of not tackling Islamophobia in the party by their own former party chairwoman, Baroness Warsi. Senior Labour figures have clashed in the past week over the way the backlog of complaints against Labour members is being dealt with, amid claims the process has become politicised. The party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, has asked that any complaints be forwarded to him for monitoring, saying that ""opacity and delay"" had led to a ""complete loss of trust"". But the party's general secretary, Jennie Formby, said that approach would undermine party processes.  The Sunday Times has reported claims that two of Mr Corbyn's closest aides had intervened in the party's disciplinary processes to lift the suspension of an activist accused of anti-Semitism. The party said the report was based on a ""selective briefing"" from a former employee and said while for a few weeks staff in Labour's Governance and Legal Unit had sought advice on a handful of cases, that practice had been stopped when Ms Formby became general secretary ""and made the procedures for dealing with complaints about anti-Semitism more robust"".  It said there had been no attempts to overturn the unit's recommendations."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49012361,May and Corbyn clash over anti-racism records,The PM calls on the Labour leader to apologise for anti-Semitism failings in heated Commons exchanges.,17 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over their anti-racism records after the prime minister demanded an apology for anti-Semitism in Labour. Mrs May said it was a ""disgrace"" Mr Corbyn had ""dodged his responsibility"" for tackling anti-Jewish prejudice. The Labour leader insisted he was ""dealing"" with the issue. And he said the PM should reflect on the impact of her own ""hostile"" immigration policies and her party's problems with Islamophobia.  Earlier on Wednesday, more than 60 Labour peers put their names to an advert in the Guardian accusing Jeremy Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism. The signatories, who make up about a third of Labour members in the Lords, said the leader was presiding over a ""toxic culture"".  Brandishing a copy of the advert at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said he could not ""parade himself as the champion of the people and the defender of equality and fairness"" until he apologised for his failure to get to grips with the problem of anti-Semitism. ""The person who has been dodging his responsibility is the right honourable gentleman,"" she said. ""The real disgrace is his handling of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party."" In response, Mr Corbyn said he would ""deal with any racism"" in his party and ""looked forward"" to Mrs May doing the same with allegations of Islamophobia in the Tories. ""This party totally opposes racism in any form whatsoever. Anti-Semitism has no place in our society or any of our parties and no place in any of our dialogue,"" he said. By BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith Although it was a bit of a cheek for Theresa May to lean over the despatch box and demand her opponent apologise, it does point to the fact that the anti-Semitism crisis in Labour has become a Jeremy Corbyn crisis. This morning some Labour MPs were saying they wanted Mr Corbyn to go in front of a Jewish audience and apologise for his personal failure to tackle anti-Semitism. The response of Team Corbyn has so far been to denounce such people as political malcontents seeking to damage his leadership. But interestingly John McDonnell, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, said maybe the party ought to listen to some of the views of these critical peers and incorporate them into future recommendations. You begin to wonder if the pressure is now becoming so intense that merely circling the wagons and denouncing critics as traitors is no longer sufficient. He said Mrs May should reflect on the impact of her immigration policies when she was home secretary and the failings in the treatment of the families of Windrush settlers.  ""Coming from a prime minister who encouraged the hostile environment, sent 'go home' vans around London and deported British citizens, I think she might look to her own party's and government's records as well."" Labour has been engulfed in a long-running dispute over anti-Semitism, which has seen nine MPs and three peers leave the party. Last week, the BBC's Panorama revealed claims from a number of former party officials that some of Mr Corbyn's closest allies tried to interfere in disciplinary processes involving allegations of anti-Semitism. As well as calls for an investigation into the claims made in the programme, the Labour leadership is also under pressure to adopt an independent complaints process. In the Guardian on Wednesday, the peers said Mr Corbyn had failed to accept responsibility for ""allowing anti-Semitism to grow in our party"". ""The Labour Party welcomes everyone irrespective of race, creed, age, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Except, it seems, Jews,"" the advert said. ""This is your legacy Mr Corbyn,"" it added. ""Labour is no longer a safe place for all members and supporters,"" it said.  About a dozen of the signatories are former ministers who served in the last Labour government - including Peter Mandelson, Beverley Hughes and John Reid. Those who signed make up about a third of the Labour members of the House of Lords. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell hit back, saying the letter was ""completely inaccurate"".  He said some people wanted to use the issue as a ""political weapon"" - but he was focussed on sorting the issue.  When the Panorama documentary aired, a Labour spokesman said the former employees who had talked to the BBC were ""disaffected"", and included some officials ""who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn's leadership"". But more than 200 current and former staff wrote to Mr Corbyn to say the party had treated whistleblowers in an ""appalling and hypocritical"" way, and that the ""moral responsibility"" for the anti-Semitism crisis lay with the party's leader. In February Labour released figures showing that the party received 673 accusations of anti-Semitism by Labour members between April 2018 and January 2019. However the scale of the issue remains disputed. Meanwhile, there have been calls for the Conservatives to commission an independent inquiry into claims of Islamophobia by its members.  Earlier in the leadership contest, Home Secretary Sajid Javid pressed his rivals to sign up for one during a head-to-head debate. Tory chairman Brandon Lewis has also refused to say how many complaints the party has received about Islamophobia, but he has insisted the numbers were ""very, very small"".  Correction 23rd July 2019:  An earlier version of this article inaccurately said that Labour has never confirmed the number of anti-Semitism cases it is investigating and this has been amended to confirm that the party did release figures for a 10 month period in 2018/19."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50408438,The early scalps of the general election,Dredging up dirt on rivals has never been easier - leaving some wannabe MPs rueing online indiscretions.,19 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The deadline for wannabe MPs to throw their hats into the ring passed on Thursday afternoon - but some didn't even make it that far. Up and down the country, candidates for the 2019 general election were forced to pull out of the race - and be replaced - before getting their names on ballot papers.  The stories behind these party-managed deselections are all different. But while some candidates have been forced to step down for more traditional reasons, such as policy differences with their parties, many have found themselves hostages to their past lives on social media.  Of the 23 identified by BBC research to have stood aside in the run-up to the deadline, about a third did so because of some kind of past online transgression.   Seven of Labour's selections lost their status in the run-up to the 14 November deadline. Art critic Matthew Collings had secured his place in South West Norfolk until allegations were made about posts on his social media accounts dismissing claims of anti-Semitism in the party as a ""witch hunt"" and describing a former chief rabbi as a ""notorious hate-filled racist"". He denied posting anything that ""could possibly be anti-Semitic"" but was removed just a day after his nomination.  Kate Ramsden was due to run in Gordon, Aberdeenshire, until the Jewish Chronicle highlighted a blog post from her in which she compared Israel to an abused child who becomes an abusive adult. The party withdrew its support and she quit.   And Frances Hoole lost her candidacy in Edinburgh South West over a social media post showing her with a bottle of Cillit Bang cleaning spray pointed towards an image of her SNP rival Joanna Cherry. The next three candidates were knocked out for different reasons. Gideon Bull, who was set to run as a candidate in Clacton, Essex, stood down after admitting to using the Jewish slur ""Shylock"" in a private council meeting - though he said he hadn't realised it was offensive.  Sally Gimson was selected by local members to run for the seat of Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, but then removed by Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) after  complaints from members of another local party where she used to be a councillor. And Laura Davies - who ran for the party in both 2015 and 2017 - was deselected by the NEC for the Shrewsbury seat after she disagreed with her local party over plans to shake up hospital provision in the area. Finally, Ed Murphy was ditched as Labour candidate in Cambridgeshire North West at the last minute before the deadline - with no reason made public by the party.  Three of the candidates chosen by the Conservative Party lost their chances to run before Thursday's cut-off point. Former BBC presenter Nick Conrad stood down after critics attacked comments he made on the radio in 2014, saying women should ""keep their knickers on"" in a discussion on rape. Antony Calvert had been due to run for the seat of Wakefield, but Facebook posts were discovered where he criticised the appearance of his Labour rival, Mary Creagh. Mr Calvert also said if the deceased Libyan dictator Col Muammar Gaddafi had wanted to walk the streets unrecognised ""he should surely have fled to Bradford"". He said the posts were more than 10 years old and had not intended to cause offence - but still had to step down.  The former MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, Chris Davies, had been chosen as the candidate for Ynys Mon. But he pulled out after some of his fellow Welsh Tories criticised his candidacy because of a previous conviction for claiming false expenses. And, in the Scottish constituency of Aberdeen North, Conservative candidate Roger Houghton has been suspended from the party. over alleged anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and homophobic comments. He will remain a candidate, but without the party's support. The Liberal Democrats have lost five of their selected candidates. Two went in September, even before the mad rush to get all the seats covered. Galen Milne stood for the party in Banff and Buchan in 2017 and had been due to run again. He was deselected after posting on social media that Tories should be ""burned at the stake"". Kirsten Johnson bowed out of running in North Devon over a race row that erupted after an interview she gave on BBC radio.  Kevin McNamara had been the Lib Dem's candidate in Thurrock until he resigned after social media posts of his from a decade ago were shared,  allegedly containing homophobic and racist comments. Rob Flello used to be a Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent South, and had been set to run for the Lib Dems in the same seat - until the party discovered he had voted against gay marriage and gay adoption. They said his values ""greatly... diverge from ours"".  For Tim Walker, the decision to stand down was more political. He decided not to be the Lib Dem candidate in Canterbury as he did not want to split the Remain vote between himself and Labour's Rosie Duffield, who had only won the seat from the Tories by 187 votes. The Brexit Party decided not to run candidates in the end in 317 Conservative seats. Besides this, eight of its candidates have been deselected or stepped aside for other reasons.  The party's ""Workington Man"" Philip Walling was removed from running in the constituency after he took to Twitter to back Boris Johnson's deal. This was before Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage moved towards the PM's view. Jill Hughes had been due to stand in the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen, but stood down after social media posts revealed some unusual beliefs, including a claim that extra-terrestrials were working with world governments in a ""hush-hush"" arrangement. Prabhjit Dhillon was going to take on Warwick and Leamington for his party - but gave up the candidacy after posts were discovered on his social media, saying ""moderate Muslims... sit back and look the other way while jihadists fight"".  Calum Walker quit from running in SNP-held Dundee East after Mr Farage's decision to stand down 317 candidates in Tory-held seats. He tweeted that he feared splitting the Leave vote in the area could lead to a Labour government ""propped up by the SNP"".  Louis Stedman-Byrce pulled out in Labour-held Glasgow North East for the same reason.  On deadline day, Rupert Lowe decided not to contest Labour-held Dudley North for fear he would ""split the vote"" with the Tories, and allow Labour back in. Andy Wood also pulled out in Hove, urging voters to back the Conservative candidate.  Finally, Owen Prew was not nominated in Canterbury - where he had been expected to run. The reason is not clear.  In many of these cases, it's clear social media is proving a check on people's ambitions for public life. Tweet dredging - going through people's social media history to look for incriminating posts - has grown massively. And it's not just in politics, says the BBC's digital elections reporter Joe Tidy. ""Just ask the actor and comedian Kevin Hart who lost his dream job of Oscars host last year thanks to the internet unearthing homophobic jokes from the actor's dusty old Twitter archive,"" he says.  So the 2019 election was undoubtedly going to see the effects. ""The methods have improved a great deal because of how much more schooled on internet use everyone has become,"" said Tidy. ""Every year, more and more people are graduating from 'the school of the internet' - able to carry out bulk searches of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram pages to dredge up stuff that has long been forgotten about. "" Many of such controversial comments were posted several years ago at a time when both the posters and the internet were less enlightened, so, he says, ""you can see how easy it is for careers to crumble"". There is some talk in the tech world of an ""auto-delete"" function to permanently erase posts after two or three years. Tidy says this could reduce the chances of people's careers being ruined by silly youthful outbursts online.  ""Then again,"" he adds, ""some argue that these glimpses into the past are a useful insight into the true characters of the people being thrust into public life."" So has there been an unusual rise in candidates standing down before this election? That is statistically very hard to work out, says our political correspondent Jessica Parker. ""There are no official records and it's worth remembering that people can pull out, under the radar, for all sorts of unremarkable reasons,"" she says. ""After rows about allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour and Islamophobia in the Conservatives, parties feel under pressure to show a zero-tolerance approach."" Brexit is another ingredient, she says, leading, as it does, to people withdrawing so as not to split the Leave or Remain vote.  Maybe it won't be like this forever. Parker says would-be politicians may learn to be more cautious online.  ""But whether Brexit will continue to test party loyalties in the same way: well,"" she concludes, ""that's anyone's guess."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45112792,Why some Muslim women wear the veil,"The differences between a hijab, niqab and burka - and why some women wear them while others don't.",8 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and for comparing them to ""bank robbers"" - prompting calls for him to apologise and be expelled from the Conservative Party. But Mr Johnson's comments, which some believe will aggravate Islamophobic tensions in the UK, have also highlighted some confusion about what a burka is - as the veil revealing just the eyes is, in fact, known as a niqab. So what actually are the differences between the various types of Islamic dress for women and what governs their choices?  The Koran, Islam's holy book, tells Muslims - men and women - to dress modestly. Male modesty has been interpreted to be covering the area from the navel to the knee. For women it is generally seen as covering everything except their face, hands and feet when in the presence of men they are not related or married to. However, there has been much debate within Islam as to whether this goes far enough. This has led to a distinction between the hijab (literally ""covering up"" in Arabic) and the niqab (meaning ""full veil""). The hijab is typically a scarf that covers the hair and neck, whereas the niqab is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf or an abaya, a full-length robe, and sometimes with a separate transparent eye veil.  The burka is the most concealing - covering the entire face and body, leaving just a mesh screen to see through. UK mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, says it's ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments show a ""lack of knowledge"". The ""majority of the women who wear the burka"" she says, are born and brought up in Britain. They are ""educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters none of whom wear a burka. ""I haven't forced my daughters into it because I don't have to,"" she said. ""It's not a must. It's not an obligation. However... [it] gets you closer to God. It's a spiritual thing more than anything else."" She is ""not under an obligation"" to cover her face but does so because it is ""emulating"" the Prophet Muhammad. So, how does she respond if asked to remove her covering for security reasons? ""I'm happy to take my veil off,"" she said, citing the example of being asked to at a bank. ""When I travel, and I do travel, sometimes I don't even wear [it] because I think it's a lot easier not to [for] security reasons. ""To make comments that they (women who wear burkas) look like bank robbers, I don't think it's fair."" Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, wears the niqab but told BBC News she sometimes gets verbal abuse from others for her choice of veil. ""A week ago someone abused me and said 'you're an ugly terrorist' when I tried to park my car near where I live,"" she said. ""Two years ago, when I was passing by one department to another at Heath Hospital, someone passed by and said 'don't cut off my head you're ISIS'. It's quite painful [to hear]."" In 2014, BBC News' Shaimaa Khalil wrote about why she stopped wearing her headscarf, only to put it back on again when she became the Pakistan correspondent. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who lives in New York, does not wear a face veil and supports a ban on them. She said the number of women wearing them in the West is increasing in part because girls begin to wear them before they reach puberty and many were not given a choice.    Muslim scholars have long debated whether it is obligatory to wear the burka or niqab, or whether it is just recommended. There have also been more liberal interpretations which say any headscarf is unnecessary, as long as women maintain the sartorial modesty stipulated in the Koran. That holy text addresses ""the faithful women"" who are told to shield their private parts and not to display their adornment ""except what is apparent of it"". Scholarly disputes revolve around what this last phrase means. Does it refer to the outer surface of a woman's garments, necessitating that she cover every part of her body - ie don the full niqab? Or does it give an exemption referring to the face and the hands, as well as conventional female ornaments such as kohl, rings, bracelets and make-up? The latter interpretation has been adopted by some of the most prominent scholars from Islamic history who favour the hijab - headscarf - option. There are additional Koranic instructions - seen as ambiguous and therefore much debated - for women to draw the ""khimar"" (scarf) to cover the ""jayb"" (bosom/upper chest), and for ""the wives and daughters of the Prophet and the women of the believers to draw their ""jalabib"" (cloaks) close round them"". When contacted by BBC Reality Check, both the Women's Muslim Council and Faith Matters (an organisation which promotes integration) said accurate numbers weren't available for the UK.  But there does seem to be consensus that the figure is likely to be low.  Dr Omar Khan, director at the Runnymede Trust, a think tank that deals with race equality, said that it is likely to be ""less than 1% [of the Muslim female population] - how much less is difficult to know"". Sunder Katwala, director of think tank British Future, acknowledged a lack of a ""robust methodology"", but said there was a ""ballpark estimate in region of 3,000-5,000"" with it ""very unlikely to be as high as 1-2%"" of the female Muslim population.  These are both estimates by experts working in relevant fields, but until specific research is carried out, it will be difficult to know how prevalent the full-face veil is.  What we do know is that in the 2011 census, Muslims represented 4.8% of the population of England and Wales.  Using the most recent population estimates, this would mean there are roughly 1.43 million Muslim women living in the two nations.  If the number of Muslim women wearing the niqab were to be as high as 1% - this would equate to just over 14,000 women - but, again, the 1% figure is just an estimate.  In other European countries, the figure also appears to be low. In 2009, a French Interior Ministry report estimated that just 0.1% of French Muslim women wore full-face veils which, at the time, equated to 1,900 women.  In Austria, a ban of full face veils in public spaces was said to affect just 0.03% of the Muslim population, according to Nilufar Ahmed, a senior lecturer in public health at Swansea University.  In Belgium between 150 and 200 women wore the niqab before a ban came into force, says Michael Privot, director of the European Network Against Racism.  Between 150 and 200 women in Demark - which banned face veils in public this month - wore a niqab or burqa on a daily basis.  That's 0.1% of Muslim women in the country, according to the Guardian. While Boris Johnson's comments about Islamic face veils have provoked consternation among some, his defenders have said they were made as part of an argument against banning such garments. Other countries though, have taken this step. France was the first European country to ban full-face veils - ie burkas and niqabs - in public places in April 2011, seven years after it introduced a law prohibiting conspicuous religious symbols in state schools. It was followed a few months later by Belgium, which banned the wearing of partial or total face veils in public on the grounds of security. Full or partial bans on full-face veils have since been in place in Austria, Bulgaria, the southern German state of Bavaria and, since 1 August, Denmark. There have been protests against Denmark's new law, which does not mention burkas and niqabs by name, but says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"". Repeat offenders could be fined 10,000 ($1,500; £1,200) kroner. By contrast, in Iran the law requires women to wear modest ""Islamic"" clothing. In practice, this means women must wear a chador, a full-body cloak, or a headscarf and a manteau (overcoat) that covers their arms. There are posters in cities and towns comparing unveiled women to unwrapped candy and lollipops attracting unwanted attention from flies. Recently, some Iranian women have protested against this law by taking off their headscarf in public. One woman was jailed for two years in March for doing this."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43103888,Leonard: Equal pay women 'owed apology',"The Scottish Labour leader says there was ""too much resistance"" to the council workers' equal pay claims.",18 Feb 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Scottish Labour leader has said women in Glasgow City Council are owed an apology for ""too much resistance"" to their equal pay claims when the local authority was under Labour control. Richard Leonard said Labour settled many equal pay claims but there was ""too much legal obstruction"". The party was in power in the city for decades before being ousted by the SNP last May. He was speaking to the party's Women's Conference in Glasgow. The council dropped its legal challenge in January with cross-party agreement.  It had previously lost a Court of Session appeal against an Employment Appeal Tribunal ruling that they had continued to discriminate against women through the introduction of payment protections upholding the earnings of male colleagues following the initial wave of equal pay awards. Unison said the women want a fair and transparent pay scheme and compensation and that the council has agreed to discuss a settlement for the 11,000 claimants with it and other trade unions. Mr Leonard said: ""I am pleased that we are now on the right side of the argument with equal pay in Glasgow City Council. ""Many equal pay claims were settled under Labour in Glasgow, but there was too much resistance, too much legal obstruction and for that I think we owe those women an apology."" He emphasised plans to tackle discrimination and harassment within Scottish Labour and wider society in the wake of the sexual harassment scandals at Westminster and Holyrood. His focus on discrimination follows his leadership rival and fellow MSP Anas Sarwar speaking out about his own experiences of abuse and criticism of Mr Leonard's decision not to suspend MP Hugh Gaffney, who apologised earlier this month after making ""deeply offensive and unacceptable"" remarks about the LGBT community and Chinese people. Scottish Labour has announced plans to set-up a special sub-committee of the party's Scottish executive to develop an anti-discrimination and harassment policy. Mr Leonard said: ""Over the past few months the culture of politics, particularly in relation to gender equality, has rightly come under the spotlight. ""Politicians - including some in the Labour party - have been found to engage in behaviour, that falls well below the standards we in this room, and in this party and in this movement, expect and deserve. ""There has, once again, been a breakdown of trust between politicians and those they hope to serve. So my job, our job is to work to rebuild that trust. ""We will work to ensure women across Scotland know that the Labour Party stands up for them. We will work to end discrimination both within the party and without."" He added: ""Scottish Labour, under my leadership, will be at the forefront of the drive for equality."" Mr Leonard said he had already taken steps to make the party more equal, adding: ""That action comes from the one driving principle - that there is no place for any form of discrimination in the Labour Party, be it sexism, be it homophobia, be it racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia."""

Stuart Seldowitz has acknowledged in media interviews that he is the man seen in viral video calling the vendor a ""terrorist"". He alleged the individual had provoked him by expressing support for Hamas. The halal cart man, named in reports as Mohamed Hussein, denied to media he made any comments in favour of Hamas. A New York Police Department spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that Mr Seldowitz had been taken into custody on Wednesday.  He is facing multiple charges, including aggravated harassment, hate crime and stalking, CBS, the BBC's US partner, reported.  The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Seldowitz for comment. In the viral videos, he is seen at the food cart at different times of day.  In one clip he says: ""If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids, you know what, it wasn't enough."" In another interaction, viewed more than 40 million times, according to X, formerly known as Twitter, he calls the vendor ""ignorant"", suggests his family could be tortured by the Egyptian secret police and makes inflammatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad and the Quran.  During another encounter, a bystander is heard saying: ""You're harassing this man."" Mr Seldowitz had a long career in the US Department of State, including in the Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs, and was a White House National Security Council director under President Barack Obama.  The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday that Mr Seldowitz had confirmed it was him in the clips.  ""The bottom line is, yes, it's me,"" the outlet quoted him as saying.  He said he thought ""there should be some comment back to someone who is endorsing terrorism and the killing of innocent civilians"". In an interview with City & State, Mr Seldowitz was quoted as saying: ""I regret the whole thing happened and I'm sorry.  ""But you know, in the heat of the moment, I said things that probably I shouldn't have said.""  Mr Seldowitz formerly worked for a lobbying company, Gotham Government Relations, which said in a statement on Tuesday that his actions were ""vile, racist and beneath the dignity of the standards we practice at our firm"". A press release issued by the company in November 2022 called him the firm's ""Foreign Affairs Chair"". But David Schwartz, Gotham's founder and president, said that Mr Seldowitz hadn't done any work for the firm for about five years and that the title was an honorary one.  ""I am incensed, I am outraged, and I am beyond words,"" Mr Schwartz told the BBC.  ""This is not the person that I knew, he was very intelligent, he was honoured by the state department and won three awards. ""But when I saw that video, within seconds I knew we had to act, and I did not hesitate. We have severed all ties."" Many New Yorkers have expressed support on social media for Mr Hussein, the food truck vendor.  New York Mayor Eric Adams posted on X: ""Islamophobia is hate. Plain and simple.  ""This vile, disrespectful rhetoric has no home in our city. We reject it - and we're glad to see we're not alone."" Mr Hussein, originally from Egypt, told the New York Post he intended to sue Mr Seldowitz. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."

Pinder Chauhan says she had experienced racist abuse since first being elected as a councillor in Northampton in 2017. She has been selected to stand in Bedford at the next general election.  She said ""very graphic"" drawings had been sent to her home and on WhatsApp, and she had experienced verbal abuse in the street. Ms Chauhan, who currently serves on West Northamptonshire Council, said ""very graphic"" drawings were sent to her home after she won the Sixfields ward in Northampton on the now-defunct Northamptonshire County Council. ""They were hand delivered so someone had physically gone to my doorstep and all I could think was that my kids and husband were in the house,"" she said. ""You automatically start thinking about their safety."" Ms Chauhan said the abuse had got worse since she was selected to stand for the Conservatives at the next general election, which is due by January 2025. ""It started off on social media where if I visited a temple I'd dress traditionally, but I'd get messages saying go back to your own country; I'd been born in England, so this is my country,"" she said. The BBC has seen the image of the pig's head that she was sent via Whats App. ""I was in the middle of party conference, so I'm feeling incredibly worried because phone calls started at the same time,"" she said.  ""All of a sudden this is in your personal space, it's on your phone and not just online."" She also shared her experience of an incident when she started out as a councillor in Northamptonshire. ""Someone on the street came right up to my face and said he was from the British National Party and I had to take a step back as he was that close to me,"" she said. ""I was with about five or six people, but even then someone was willing to be that close."" Ms Chauhan, who represents the East Hunsbury and Shelfleys ward and is cabinet member for flooding on West Northants Council, said these incidents would not stop her continuing her political career. ""I try not to think about it; I love listening to people and love being out there; I feel this is what I was born to do, as cliched as that sounds,"" she said. ""Politics is a massive platform for change - that's why I do it and I think that drive outweighs the negatives. ""It is part of being a politician - you do have to have a strong skin, but a lot of it is really unacceptable."" She said people who send these messages should ""think about the impact it has"".  ""There are other ways of communicating and you don't have to threaten, but ultimately I think for someone to do that they have to probably not be in the right place mentally,"" she added. Bedfordshire Police's hate crime lead Sgt Daniel O'Mahoney said: ""We treat all reports of hate crime with the utmost severity and members of the public should be confident in reporting incidents to us and know that they will be investigated thoroughly.  ""We continue to work with a number of partners across the region around hate crime, and I would encourage anyone who has been the victim of an incident to get in touch with us right away, either through our website or by calling 101.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67655910,Elizabeth Magill: UPenn loses $100m donation after House antisemitism testimony,A major University of Pennsylvania donor withdraws grant after Congress hearing about antisemitism on campus.,9 Dec 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A major University of Pennsylvania donor has withdrawn a $100m (£79.3m) grant after a controversial appearance in Congress by the school's president. In an email seen by the BBC, Ross Stevens said he was ""appalled"" Elizabeth Magill avoided questions about how students calling for the genocide of Jews would be punished. Ms Magill was grilled by politicians on Tuesday about antisemitism on campus. She has since apologised for her remarks, but is facing calls to resign. US media are reporting the advisory board at Wharton - the university's business school - has written a letter to Ms Magill calling for her to step down ""with immediate effect"".   American college campuses have seen angry protests and rising incidents of antisemitism since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted two months ago.  Ms Magill appeared in the House of Representatives alongside the presidents of Harvard and MIT, Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth. They were asked by Republican New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik: ""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university's] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?""  Ms Magill and her MIT and Harvard counterparts did not reply yes or no but said - in varying ways - that it depended on the ""context"".  There has been a widespread backlash since, with the White House condemning the remarks. ""The lack of moral clarity is unacceptable,"" Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, the highest-ranking Jewish member of the administration, said on Thursday at a ceremony to mark the lighting of the national menorah. In his message about the withdrawal of the donation, Mr Stevens said: ""I have clear grounds to rescind Penn's $100 million of Stone Ridge shares due to the conduct of President Magill.""  The founder and CEO of Stone Ridge Asset Management, he told the university that its ""permissive approach"" to those calling for violence against Jewish people ""would violate any policies or rules that prohibit harassment and discrimination based on religion, including those of Stone Ridge"". Penn is one of the oldest universities in the US and a part of the elite Ivy League group, which also has Harvard, Columbia and Yale as members.  Wharton counts former US President Donald Trump, Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, and many other powerful names in business and finance among its graduates.  The donation, in the form of limited partnership units in Stone Ridge, was gifted by Mr Stevens in 2017 to help Wharton create a finance innovation centre.  Ms Magill in particular has faced mounting scrutiny as to whether she can continue in her position.  She released a video on the university's website on Wednesday apologising for her response during the hearing, saying that she was focused on the ""university's long-standing policies - aligned with the US Constitution - which say that speech alone is not punishable"". She added she should have been focused on the ""irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate"", adding that it is ""evil, plain and simple"".  While her apology on Wednesday was welcomed by some, Mr Stevens' letter appeared to call for her resignation.   He said Stone Ridge would welcome the opportunity to review its decision ""if, and when, there is a new University President in place"". On Wednesday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - a non-voting trustee at UPenn - criticised Ms Magill for her ""absolutely shameful"" remarks and called on the university to make a ""serious decision"" on her continued leadership. ""It should not be hard to condemn genocide,"" he said. ""Leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity, and Liz Magill failed to meet that simple test."" A petition demanding Ms Magill's resignation had gathered more than 23,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon. Facing criticism over her own remarks at Tuesday's hearing, Harvard President Dr Gay apologised in an interview with the college newspaper, saying she ""got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures"". The House Committee on Education and the Workforce announced on Thursday that they will formally investigate Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over ""rampant antisemitism"". ""Committee members have deep concerns with their leadership and their failure to take steps to provide Jewish students the safe learning environment they are due under law,"" the committee's chairwoman Virginia Foxx said in a statement.  Two University of Pennsylvania students - both of whom are Jewish - filed a lawsuit against the school on Thursday, claiming it has become ""an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment and discrimination."" The lawsuit also accuses the school of ""selectively"" enforcing rules of conduct ""to avoid protecting Jewish students"" and hiring ""rabidly antisemitic professors who call for anti-Jewish violence"".  Islamophobic attacks have also been on the rise on university campuses.  The Department of Education has launched an investigation into multiple schools over alleged incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia."

In May, Holland Park School in Kensington, west London, was found to have a ""culture of fear and favouritism"". An investigation by its governors uncovered ""public humiliation"" or shouting used as a behaviour policy. Pupils and teachers were also subject to sexism, Islamophobia and racism. The school announced last year that former headteacher Colin Hall would retire early, while a new chair of governors was appointed. Now Ofsted has concluded that ""turbulence"" in the school's leadership had ""destabilised"" the school community. Inspectors found many aspects of school life, including pupils' behaviour, had ""declined substantially"" since a previous inspection seven years ago. The inspectorate said that pupils and staff had ""welcomed the governors' intervention to stop previous behaviour management strategies that they deemed unacceptable"". However, behaviour policies had not been updated, leaving a ""vacuum"" with staff and students confused over how to deal with unacceptable behaviour, some of which was spilling into the local area after school, Ofsted said. A spokesperson for the school said: ""Ofsted has independently identified many of the long-term, historical weaknesses which governors have also been concerned about, and which they have been working extremely hard, with school leaders, staff, and external partners, to put right. ""These serious problems were also set out in the independent investigation report and in the Notice To Improve that the government issued to the school last year. ""We now ask that the whole school community comes together and unites around a strategy to support the school to reach the standards that our students deserve."" The Department for Education previously issued the school with a Notice to Improve in November, highlighting financial mismanagement as well as leaders' ""excessive salaries and failure to seek prior approval from the government for 'novel and contentious' expenditure"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61701908,India in deeper crisis over Prophet Muhammad row,"A controversial statement by a member of India's ruling party has angered many nations, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia.",7 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"India's diplomatic nightmare over controversial comments made by two senior officials of the country's ruling party about the Prophet Muhammad is showing no signs of ending.  The UAE, Oman, Indonesia, Iraq, the Maldives, Jordan, Libya and Bahrain have joined the growing list of countries in the Islamic world that have condemned the remarks. Earlier, Kuwait, Iran and Qatar had called Indian ambassadors to register their protest, and Saudi Arabia had issued a strongly worded statement.  Indian diplomats have been trying to placate these countries - it shares cordial relations with most of them - but the storm is far from over.  At the centre of this controversy is Nupur Sharma, who was a spokesperson of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She made the remark in a televised debate last month, and videos of her statement had gone viral. Naveen Jindal, who was media head of the party's Delhi unit, had also posted a provocative tweet on the issue.  Critics say Ms Sharma and Mr Jindal's comments reflect the deep religious polarisation that the country has been witnessing over the past few years. Hate speech and attacks against Muslims have risen sharply since the BJP came to power in 2014. Their comments - especially Ms Sharma's - angered the country's minority Muslim community, leading to sporadic protests in some states. The BBC is not repeating Ms Sharma's remarks as they are offensive in nature. The two leaders have issued public apologies and the party has suspended Ms Sharma and expelled Mr Jindal.   ""The BJP strongly denounces insults of any religious personalities of any religion. The BJP is also against any ideology which insults or demeans any sect or religion. The BJP does not promote such people or philosophy,"" it said in a statement. But experts say that the BJP's response may not be enough after what looked like the country's internal matter took an international turn. The anger in the Islamic world is evident from some of the statements from these countries.  Qatar said it expected a public apology from India.  ""Allowing such Islamophobic remarks to continue without punishment, constitutes a grave danger to the protection of human rights and may lead to further prejudice and marginalisation, which will create a cycle of violence and hate,"" Qatar's ministry of foreign affairs said. Saudi Arabia also used some strong words in its statement. ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its condemnation and denunciation of the statements made by the spokeswoman of the BJP,"" it said. India's ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, said the remarks from some ""fringe elements"" did not represent the views of the Indian government. Senior BJP leaders and other diplomats have also condemned the controversial statement. The 57-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and Pakistan have also criticised India. But Delhi criticised both, as it usually does, saying their comments were ""unwarranted and narrow-minded"".  Analysts say that the top leadership of the party and the government may have to make public statements on the issue. Not doing so, they say, runs the risk of damaging India's ties with the Arab world and Iran. India's trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman and the UAE, stood at $87 billion in 2020-21. Millions of Indians live and work in these countries and send millions of dollars in remittances back home. The region is also the top source for India's energy imports.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a regular visitor to the region since coming to power in 2014. The country has already signed a free trade agreement with the UAE and is in talks with the GCC for a wider deal. Mr Modi famously attended the ground-breaking ceremony of the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi in 2018 - it was termed as an example of the growing ties between India and the region.   Against this backdrop, the UAE's decision to join the chorus against India is quite significant. The relations between the two countries have significantly improved in the past few years. The UAE has also backed India at multi-nation forums.  Experts said the controversy could overshadow some of India's recent diplomatic successes with the UAE and other nations. While Delhi's relations with Tehran have been lukewarm over the past few years, the controversy could overshadow Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian's upcoming visit to India. Another former diplomat Anil Trigunayat, who has served in the Arab world, said that India was in a difficult situation and only sincere efforts at the leadership level could prevent negative fallout. Other analysts say the diplomatic cost from the fallout could greatly hurt India's interests in the region.  ""Indian officials often react defensively when foreign capitals, including close friends of New Delhi, criticise Indian domestic matters. But in this case, expect Indian diplomats to work quickly to defuse tensions with apologies and other forms of damage control,"" said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center think-tank. Arab nations are also looking to take concrete action to soothe anger among their own people. Hashtags criticising India have been trending in these countries and the incident has been the top story in their media outlets.  Some of these hashtags have called for a boycott of Indian products. There have also been reports of some stores in Qatar and Kuwait removing Indian products from their shelves. A sign in Arabic at the Al-Ardiya Co-Operative Society supermarket in Kuwait read: ""We have removed Indian products."" But analysts, including Mr Kugelman, believe that despite the public display of anger, the relationship was important to both the GCC and India and both sides would be looking at mitigating the risks.  ""As concerned as Delhi should be about this angry response from such a strategically critical region, India is also shielded from further damage by its own clout. Because of their economic interests, Gulf states need India to keep importing their energy, they need Indians to continue living and working there, and overall, they need to keep doing business with India,"" he said. He added that there might be limits to how far these countries would go in responding to these anti-Muslim comments.  Critics say that religious polarisation has increased in India since the BJP came to power. And the past few weeks have been particularly tense after some Hindu groups went to a local court in Varanasi to seek permission to pray at a centuries-old mosque, claiming that it was built on the ruins of a demolished temple. TV channels have held provocative debates and social media has seen rampant hate over the issue. Many people associated with right-wing organisations often make controversial statements on TV shows, but critics say Ms Sharma wasn't a ""fringe element"" as the BJP has claimed. She was an official spokesperson of the party, tasked with representing the BJP's views. Analysts add that the international fallout over the controversy should be a wake-up call for India and it should learn that divisive politics can have international ramifications.  ""Delhi is learning that when it comes to the country's increasingly toxic politics, what happens in India often doesn't stay in India. As India's global clout grows and its diplomatic and economic partnerships abroad become stronger, there's more at stake when its domestic politics cause unhappiness abroad,"" Mr Kugelman said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50676921,Farage defends decision not to contest Tory seats,"The Brexit Party leader claims his party are ""tearing chunks out of the Labour vote"", as three of its MEPs quit.",6 Dec 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Nigel Farage has defended his ""difficult"" decision not to contest Tory-held seats, insisting he was putting ""country before party"". The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Neil that his party had stopped the ""Lib Dem surge"" and were ""tearing chunks out of the Labour vote"". He said his party was the challenger in Labour-Leave areas in next week's poll. It comes as three Brexit Party MEPs quit to support the Tories, saying the party will split the pro-Brexit vote. Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Lance Forman and Lucy Harris resigned the whip on Thursday, with Ms Rees-Mogg - Tory minister Jacob Rees-Mogg's sister - saying it was ""tragic"" that the Brexit Party ""are now the very party risking Brexit"". Mr Farage announced in November that his party would not contest the 317 Westminster seats the Conservatives won in 2017, in order to help Leave-supporting candidates win. Some have been critical of this decision, including MEP John Longworth, who lost the Brexit Party whip in the European Parliament on Wednesday for not support his leader's strategy. He is now backing the Conservatives. Andy Wigmore, from the Leave.EU group Mr Farage fronted at the 2016 referendum, said the former Brexit Party MEPs had made the ""right decision at the right time"" to back the Conservatives.  ""It's time for Nigel to join them,"" he added in a tweet.  During the 30-minute interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Farage was asked about his election strategy, Islamophobic remarks made by two of his candidates and whether the NHS should be ""on the table"" in any post-Brexit trade talks with the US. The Brexit Party leader denied being marginalised at the general election. Mr Farage said: ""I don't think if you came with me and visited some of the Labour heartlands in the north you would think that and I also think that what we've done is have a very dramatic effect on this election. ""I think, number one, the decision, difficult decision, I took in 317 seats to stand down. ""What that's done is that's poleaxed the Liberal Democrats. They were going to win in south London down through Surrey, right out to the west of England they were going to win a lot of seats if we'd stood. And I knew that wasn't the right thing to do."" Mr Farage claimed the Brexit Party had prevented a ""surge"" from the pro-EU Lib Dems and had, therefore, blocked a second EU referendum. ""What we are actually doing now is tearing chunks out of the Labour vote,"" he said. He blamed his failure to form a so-called ""Leave alliance"" between his party and the Conservative Party for the election on the Tories. ""The Conservative Party didn't want to do it,"" he said. On his call for political reform, including scrapping the House of Lords and changing the voting system, he said: ""At this stage we don't look like fundamentally reforming British politics, but do I think there is an appetite for it? Absolutely."" Mr Farage said he believed Boris Johnson would win the election and that was his preference in a choice with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. But he said he was undecided who to vote for in the Conservative-held constituency where he lives. Andrew Neil also challenged Mr Farage on Islamophobic comments made by two of his candidates in in Edinburgh South West and Birmingham Ladywood. ""Any attempt that gets made to try and paint the Brexit Party into being a right-wing political party that would harbour anybody with extreme views is completely and utterly wrong,"" he said. ""We are, in terms of the mix of our candidates, if I look at what we put forward for the European elections, we had more diversity of background, of class, of race, than any other party."" On Brexit, Mr Farage said he wanted to see ""some amendments"" to Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, saying: ""If we don't we are not going to get a clean break from the EU."" And on whether he thinks NHS drug prices would be ""on the table"" in post-Brexit trade deal talks with the US, Mr Farage said the suggestion was ""ludicrous because no British government will sign up to more expensive drugs"". He said he believed that ""wealthier people should be encouraged to take out private insurance to lift the burden off a system that is struggling to cope"". ""When it comes to opening up the NHS for privatisation, do you want the truth? It's already happened."" In a special series of election interviews, Andrew Neil has already questioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date to taking part, which has prompted a political row and accusations from Labour that he is ""running scared""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-53588018,The 'fighting Islamophobia' books for young adults,"Fiction books have been providing a ""counter-narrative"" to anti-Muslim views, research suggests.",24 Aug 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A girl being groomed to become a suicide bomber might not sound like the most child-friendly novel. But fiction books about terrorism and radicalisation have been helping children and young adults ""resist extremism and Islamophobia"" since the 9/11 terror attacks, new research suggests.  Nearly 3,000 people were killed and thousands more injured on 11 September 2001. The following month, US forces launched military action in Afghanistan and the ""War on Terror"" began.  A consequence of that, according to Cambridge University's Dr Blanka Grzegorczyk, was Muslim and immigrant communities being ""presented by the media as posing a threat to the core of British culture, nationhood and identity"". British authors have been ""writing back"" against that portrayal, suggests her Cambridge study - the first to examine the wave of books commissioned after 9/11 and 7/7 by children's publishers that deal with those themes. Dr Grzegorczyk looked at 28 books published since 2001, like one by Noughts and Crosses author Malorie Blackman. Many of the books ""depict the ramped-up security measures adopted by the British state"", Dr Grzegorczyk says, that ""in tandem with the media's cultivation of a certain paranoia"" helped promote a ""constant fear"" of Muslims.  She says books like Run, Riot by Nikesh Shukla - about a group of teenagers pursued by the police after one of them films the politically-sanctioned murder of an ethnic minority youth - ""communicate across the tribal divide that young people have grown up with"". ""They are offering young audiences a counter-narrative to that anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric,"" Dr Grzegorczyk tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Muhammad Khan's I Am Thunder - about a British Asian girl whose marginalisation leaves her vulnerable to radicalisation - also featured in the study. ""The way we often talk about those things in the media and our everyday lives feels quite simplistic,"" says Reuben Thomas. Reading I Am Thunder gave the 27-year-old a different perspective on radicalisation and Islam, he says. The portrayal of the main character suggests there are various factors - such as prejudice and bullying - that can lead to someone being radicalised. ""This book does a really good job of showing the nuance and complexity, without it being a victim narrative."" Reuben says he has a clearer understanding of ""the insidious nature of radicalisation"" because the book ""humanised the people involved and encouraged some empathy"". He says there are ""horrendous narratives"" in the media about young people being in gangs and religion being a negative thing - particularly for Muslims and British Asians - but the book ""dispelled so many of the myths"". ""It stripped all that away and looked at people as individuals, focusing on similarities rather than differences."" You might also be interested in: These books feature characters who form bonds beyond racial, cultural, religious or national divides. The study suggests this can help readers imagine a future based on shared values. Siobhan Dunlop agrees. The 27-year-old says the ethnic minority characters in Run, Riot are shown to be individuals ""with hopes and dreams"". ""They are shown as human and presented in a way closer to reality."" She says fiction can help deal with issues like Islamophobia because you get to see details from people's lives ""and realise they're connected to you"". ""They love their family, might have a similar taste in music or have visited similar places. I think that can help people connect in different ways with issues."" Siobhan's also started questioning the ""narrative around gentrification making things better"" since reading the book. Gentrification is when areas change as richer businesses and people begin moving in.  ""It's particularly poorer ethnic minority groups who get impacted by this kind of politics,"" she says. ""And for me it challenges the idea that having these new things is always progress - when actually it's disturbing people's way of life."" The books in the study, and others like them, are inspiring ""a new wave of youth activism"", Dr Grzegorczyk says, pointing to Black Lives Matter, Fridays for Future, and US campaigns against gun violence.  ""These books are pointing them towards a new kind of connectedness across cultures that moves us on from previous generations' fixation with 'us against them'."" Siobhan says books have changed her political views and ""make me want to act on those ideals"". ""They give you a different way of looking at the world.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48601134,Tories accused of 'failure' over Islamophobia,"The Muslim Council of Britain says it has documented ""hundreds of cases"" within the party.",11 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has accused the Tory Party of ""fundamental failures"" in tackling Islamophobia.  Its head of public affairs, Miqdaad Versi, said he had seen ""hundreds of cases"" within the party, ""demonstrating the scale of the problem"".  When action was taken, he claimed the offending members were ""quietly let back into the party"". Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis has previously said ""swift action"" is taken when complaints are made. The MCB is an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies, including mosques, schools, and charitable associations. It has formally asked the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate accusations of Islamophobia in the Tory Party, claiming it ""runs deep"".  The watchdog said it was considering complaints in line with its ""usual processes"". Speaking at the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mr Versi said: ""We have seen, unequivocally, failures within specifically the Conservative Party when it comes to Islamophobia - not just small failures [but] fundamental failures in every single way.  ""I'm talking about leadership within the party... I'm talking about issues when members of Parliament have done certain things and no action has been taken against them.   ""I'm talking about when councillors and representatives of the Conservative Party have said or done things which are inappropriate and unacceptable."" He said that action was sometimes taken, but sometimes not ""until the media have been called"", adding: ""And then what happens? A few weeks later they're quietly let back into the party....These types of things are unacceptable."" Mr Versi said he was not claiming Islamophobia was not happening in other parties, but he was ""focussing on where the specific and large-scale issue is"". Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson also faced criticism during the committee over his previous comments about women who wear burkas. In August 2018, Mr Johnson wrote a column in the Daily Telegraph arguing against a ban on full-face veils - but said women wearing the garments looked liked ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". It prompted dozens of complaints, but he was cleared of breaking the Tories' code of conduct. Speaking at the committee, Iman Atta, director of anti-Islamophobia charity Tell MAMA, said there had been a rise in reports of abuse from women wearing veils or headscarves after the article.  Addressing those running to become the UK's next prime minister, she added: ""Political leadership comes with responsibility... because people will look at the words that a political leader is using and re-use those words on the ground and in the streets. ""We do ask every single candidate... to be responsible with the language that they use."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47454993,PM's 'head in sand' over Tory Islamophobia,"Theresa May has failed to acknowledge anti-Muslim prejudice in her party, Baroness Warsi says.",5 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Theresa May has been accused of ""burying her head in the sand"" over Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.  Former party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the PM had failed to ""acknowledge"" or ""tackle"" the problem and this was ""symptomatic"" of her wider leadership. Shortly after her comments, the party said 14 members had been suspended for Islamophobic Facebook posts. The Conservatives said ""decisive action"" would be taken against anyone making offensive remarks. The suspensions followed messages posted on a Facebook group called the ""Jacob Rees-Mogg Supporters Group"". The page was not affiliated with the MP or the party as a whole but Conservative members identified as using it have been suspended pending an investigation. ""When we find evidence of members making offensive or inappropriate comments, we consistently take decisive action,"" a spokesman said.  But Baroness Warsi, who was the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister, has said her party had ""turned a blind eye"" to prejudice and become ""institutionally Islamophobic"". She suggested the ""rot had set in"" several years ago and accused senior party officials of being ""in denial"" and presiding over an ""opaque"" complaints process.  In a personal attack on the prime minister, she said Mrs May had ""failed to tackle the problem head on"". ""She doesn't listen, she fails to acknowledge when there is a problem. It's probably symptomatic of the way in which her leadership has dealt with other matters. ""Burying your head in the sand is not going to make problems go away.""  She said efforts to modernise the party had ""gone into reverse"" since Mrs May succeeded David Cameron as leader, but she ruled out quitting the party, as others have done. ""If my party's going though a process of 're-UKIPification' of itself, then it's my job to stand within that party and fight to bring it back to the centre ground."" She has written to the party's chief executive Sir Mick Davis urging him to ""show leadership"" on the issue, because, she said, Mrs May and party chairman Brandon Lewis had not. She said Sir Mick, a former chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, had a ""long history of fighting bigotry"" and was ""uniquely placed to understand consequences of unchecked hate"". Baroness Warsi has been warning about anti-Muslim prejudice in the party for years.  Her latest intervention follows a row over former candidate Peter Lamb, who was was due to stand in the Staple Tye ward, in Harlow, Essex, in May's local elections and had previously stood in the Toddbrook ward. Mr Lamb was disciplined by the party after it emerged that he had posted a message on Twitter in 2015, saying ""Islam like alcoholism [sic]"" and ""the first step to recovery is admit you have a problem"".  Later in the same year, he tweeted: ""Turkey buys oil from ISIS. Muslims sticking together,"" adding: ""Do they want us to call ISIS Daesh now so that we don't associate them with Islam?"" Mr Lamb was reinstated as a candidate but local party sources said he had quit the party earlier on Tuesday, following the row about his comments. In a statement on Twitter, he apologised for the remarks, saying they were ""aimed at the extremists that have hijacked Islam and are cowardly hiding behind the religion"".  Justice Secretary David Gauke rejected suggestions the party had ignored warnings on the issue.  ""Where there is evidence, we take action, as a political party should.    ""Whether it is Islamophobia or whether it is anti-Semitism, there is an obligation on political parties to take action and address it.   ""That is what the Conservative Party does and will continue to do. So I don't accept that criticism."" But the Muslim Council of Britain said the level of prejudice within the party was ""astonishing"" and the claims should be independently investigated. ""We've seen MPs, councillors and members engage in bigotry that should have no place in a modern Conservative Party,"" a spokesman said.  ""Yet the constructive call by Muslim communities for an independent inquiry into the issue has been ignored again and again. Instead we hear excuses, denials and the responses we would expect when there is an institutional problem."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12376304,Row about Cameron speech timing,"Foreign Secretary William Hague defends the PM's remarks on multiculturalism - as a Labour MP suggests it amounted to ""propaganda"" for the English Defence League.",6 Feb 2011,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Mr Cameron signalled a tougher stance on groups promoting Islamist extremism The foreign secretary has defended the timing of David Cameron's comments on multiculturalism - which coincided with a march by the English Defence League. In Saturday's Mirror, Labour's Sadiq Khan accused the PM of effectively ""writing propaganda for the EDL"". William Hague said a PM's speech should not be shelved ""because some people have chosen to march down a street"". Labour's Yvette Cooper said the PM was ""unwise"" not to have also criticised the EDL and ""non-violent extremism"".  In his speech on radicalisation and terrorism on Saturday, Mr Cameron warned that the ""hands-off tolerance"" of unacceptable practices by non-white communities had only served to encourage extremism. He criticised ""state multiculturalism"" and argued the UK needed a stronger national identity to stop people turning to extremism. The English Defence League, which has been accused of Islamophobia - also held a rally in Luton on Saturday, prompting criticisms from some Labour MPs about the timing of Mr Cameron's speech. The EDL's leaders deny the group is racist. Asked whether the timing of the speech had been unfortunate, Foreign Secretary Mr Hague told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""This is a prime minister giving a speech about the future of our country, that doesn't have to be re-scheduled because some people have chosen to march down a street that particular day. ""This is a speech that will endure over the months and years long after people have forgotten what was going on on that particular Saturday afternoon."" But shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan  reportedly told the Mirror newspaper, external that Mr Cameron was ""writing propaganda"" for the group - a remark criticised by the Conservatives  as a ""smear"". Asked whether Mr Khan had been right to make the remark, Ms Cooper told Sky News: ""I think that we have always got to fight against extremism, it's also right to challenge non-violent extremism as well. ""I do think the prime minister was unwise not to make it clearer that he was criticising all kinds of extremism and so on the day of course that we had the English Defence League march he could have made it clearer that he was criticising extremism among EDL members."" Asked whether Mr Khan should apologise for his comments, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander told BBC1's Politics Show: ""I'm pretty sceptical about politicians calling for other politicians to apologise. ""My sense is Sadiq's remarks reflected some of the rather lurid headlines that we saw yesterday about the speech."" He added that it was for Mr Khan to ""explain the context in which he made those remarks"". On BBC One's Andrew Marr show, the chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission Trevor Phillips refused to criticise Mr Cameron's claim that multiculturalism had failed. He said Mr Cameron ""may have made life a bit more difficult for himself"" by combining a speech on terrorism with one on integration but said he was right to say it was not the role of government to tell people to embrace multiculturalism. This video can not be played The Chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, Trevor Phillips, says he partly agrees with Prime Minister David Cameron's criticisms of ""state multiculturalism."" However he added: ""People don't choose not to integrate mostly. There are a few people on the edges who don't want to integrate with anybody else but most people, if they don't mix, it's because they don't have the choice."" He said the government had a role to play to help people integrate - with a renewed battle against discrimination and work to ensure more jobs were accessible to people from all backgrounds. He added: ""The key thing here is that if you take the biggest Muslim community, Pakistanis, 25% of Pakistani men are taxi drivers, 75% of Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are economically inactive. That is the issue. ""The issue here is not some sort of abstract culture. The place most people integrate is in the workplace. If people can't get jobs, you can't expect them to integrate."" Mr Cameron's speech was criticised by some Muslim groups  - the Muslim Council of Great Britain said it was ""disappointing"" and treated the Muslim community as ""part of the problem as opposed to part of the solution.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54123146,US commemorates 19th anniversary of 9/11,"Both President Trump and Joe Biden visited the same memorial on Friday, at different times.",11 Sep 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Rivals for the White House have displayed a moment of unity as the US marks the 19th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden greeted Vice-President Mike Pence at the Ground Zero memorial in New York, where each attended ceremonies. Mr Biden then travelled to Shanksville, Pennsylvania - the site of the Flight 93 memorial - to pay respects.  President Donald Trump spoke there earlier on Friday. However Mr Biden and Mr Trump did not cross paths because their schedules did not overlap. Nearly 3,000 people died when four hijacked airliners were crashed into the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon and - after passengers fought back - the field in Shanksville, on what is the worst terrorist attack in US history. Joined by First Lady Melania Trump, Mr Trump attended a morning service at the Shanksville memorial, where Flight 93 crashed after its 40 passengers and crew prevented al-Qaeda hijackers from reaching the US Capitol building. ""To the family members of Flight 93: today every heartbeat in America is wedded to yours,"" Mr Trump said.  ""Your pain and anguish is the shared grief of our whole nation."" ""The memory of your treasured loved ones will inspire America for all time to come. The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds, America will always rise up, stand tall and fight back."" Although both Mr Trump and Mr Biden will refrain from overt campaigning, their separate visits to Pennsylvania are being watched closely, as the state is seen as a key battleground in the 3 November election.  Before his Shanksville visit, Mr Trump made a brief stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to greet members of the state Army National Guard. The iron-and-steel town is in Cambria County - the heart of what has been known as 'Trump country' - in the southwest of the state.  Mr Trump spoke with three officers about local military and thanked them for their service, local media reported.  Mr Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016 and with the election less than eight weeks away, the president is fighting hard to keep towns like Johnstown on his side, says BBC's Tara McKelvey.  Mr Biden and his wife, Jill, attended a memorial service and commemoration ceremony at the 9/11 museum in New York City. They travelled to Shanksville in the afternoon to visit the same memorial as Mr Trump. Mr Biden was seen greeting family members of those killed in the attack. He and his wife laid a wreath on the memorial as well. Mr Biden told reporters earlier on Friday he would not talk about anything other than 9/11 and that his campaign had withdrawn political adverts from airing on television. ""We took all our advertising down, it's a solemn day, and that's how we're going to keep it,"" he said. Mr Biden greeted Mr Pence at the World Trade Center site in New York earlier in the day, and the pair touched elbows in lieu of a handshake to observe protocols aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. Mr Biden referenced the pandemic in a series of tweets later in the day, saying: ""This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss."" Mr Pence delivered short remarks in New York City and read passages from the Bible, saying: ""I pray these ancient words will comfort your hearts and ours."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, also joined Mr Pence and Mr Biden at the memorial service. On US Twitter, hashtags relating to 9/11 are trending, with people remembering the day and sharing stories of loved ones lost in the attacks. Some on social media have also drawn attention to the anti-Muslim sentiment that spread across the country in the wake of 9/11, noting how they were bullied, stereotyped, or policed.  Hate crimes rose against Muslims after the 2001 attacks, FBI data found. The 9/11 attacks were a series of four coordinated attacks on the US by the Islamist terror group al-Qaeda.  As well as the 3,000 people killed on 11 September 2001, some 400,000 people were injured or exposed to other contaminants in the aftermath of the attacks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control. Hundreds of first responders and survivors have died in the years since due to related illnesses, like cancer. Weeks after the attack, the US sent troops to Afghanistan to combat al-Qaeda. The so-called 'War on Terror' has stretched decades and American intervention in the Middle East continues to be a quagmire of US foreign policy."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-53498343,Diverse talent 'must be celebrated in schools',"It is important to get away from a ""narrative of disadvantage"", the head of a review says.",30 Aug 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Black, Polish and Italian contributions to Wales must be taught to all children in schools, the head of a curriculum review has said. Almost 35,000 people have signed a petition for Britain's colonial past to be taught in Welsh schools. Charlotte Williams said it was important ""to get away from a black narrative of disadvantage"". She said the contributions of musicians, artists and academics from all communities must be celebrated. ""There are large parts of Wales where children will not have seen black people except for on TV - and sometimes this can be in very negative ways,"" she said. Following worldwide protests after the death of George Floyd in US police custody, there have been calls for greater recognition of Wales' role in colonialism and slavery to be taught in schools. The new working group led by Prof Williams has been set up by the Welsh Government to see how the new curriculum could be changed. She said it was essential slavery and injustices faced particularly by black people were taught in schools - but that also more had to be done to showcase role models and cultural diversity. ""If we miss out on this, we are doing a disservice to our own history,"" she said. ""But I don't want to send out the message that we are all terribly disadvantaged and victims. ""This is an appeal to schools and teachers to engage with the positive contribution of black and minority ethnic groups, the richness and vibrancy of it."" Wales' new curriculum, set to be introduced in 2022, is based on six ""areas of learning and experience"" and does not set out exactly what schools should be teaching. But Prof Williams said it would be challenging due to the lack of staff diversity and said teachers needed to be given support to ""be bold and brave"". Fewer than 1% of teachers in Wales say they are black, Asian, or from other or mixed minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2019-2020 school workforce census. Forty of the 1,065 students who began training to become teachers in Wales in 2018-2019 said they were from a minority ethnic group. Prof Williams said some teachers may be scared of exploring certain issues due to a fear of sounding racist, a lack of knowledge, or not being ""politically correct"". ""There's this awful thing about fear of saying or doing the wrong thing,"" she said. ""It's about being bold and being brave, and not stigmatising, and to use examples that will turn people's thinking around to a kind of normal thinking."" Growing up in Llandudno, Prof Williams said her family was the only black one in the town. ""I cannot think of examples from my own education that were pertinent to me and my identity and my heritage,"" she said. ""I grew up not understanding my place and my identity and how I fitted in Wales. I think that's what happening to children, they can't necessarily connect."" According to the most recent school census in January 2019, more than 33,000 pupils over the age of five had a black, Asian, minority ethnic or mixed background, making up 8.3% of students in Wales. But this varied widely by area, from 2% in Blaenau Gwent, to 28% in Cardiff. ""We used to go away to West Africa and we would come back, we'd had this fantastic experience, but no-one would ask us about it,"" Prof Williams said. ""Children are not asked and then they don't expect, which is even sadder, when they don't think their knowledge and their experience has anything to do with where they are."" She said making sure children in seemingly ""all-white, monocultural"" communities learnt about Wales' multicultural heritage would be challenging, but it was important all children did so and saw themselves reflected in lessons they were taught. This could mean encouraging schools to showcase more literature, music and art by minority ethnic artists or teaching traditional recipes in lessons, as well as learning about how different groups had influenced and shaped their community. ""I'm not afraid to say that I think it will take time, I think there are challenges,"" she said. ""I'm very enthusiastic about Wales and it's propensity to be progressive and forward thinking in what it does and how it approaches these issues."" Going to school in a mainly white school, as a teenager Asha Fletcher-Peters says she felt ""isolated"" and ""like an alien"". Having moved from London to the Vale of Glamorgan when she was nine, she went from being in a multicultural school where they celebrated Eid and Diwali, to one where she felt like an outsider. ""So many people had never seen anyone like me before,"" said Asha, now 25. ""Everyone wanted to be skinny, blonde and rich"". ""I just wanted to be like all the other girls. I used to get people using the n-word around me, thinking it was a fun thing to say."" Asha, who is now a professional musician and actress, said teachers did not cast her as lead roles in shows, as there was no ""black part"", and she was faced with white faces in history books and text books. ""No-one told me that black women did these different things, that there were women in hijabs, and not just white men - we didn't see ourselves in those spaces,"" said Asha. ""I felt so isolated my whole life. If I had seen women like me in my science books, I might have chosen differently, I might have ended up in a career in science."" Asha said one pupil wrote an essay about her, because they had never met a black person before, and she remembers trying to stay out of the sun so her skin would not get darker. ""People do not realise how damaging these things are,"" she said. ""I want the next generation to be themselves, to have their goals and their dreams, not to feel like they have to fit in this cookie-cutter shape."""

Also an education centre, it will be built by Sir David Adjaye in a park next to the Houses of Parliament. A jury that included Holocaust survivors, the Communities Secretary, and the Chief Rabbi unanimously selected the design. But, questions were raised over whether Victoria Tower Gardens is a suitable location for the memorial. ""We wanted to orchestrate an experience that reminds us of the fragility and constant strife for a more equitable world,"" Sir David said. ""It is critical these highly important and emotive historical touchpoints are explored, so that future generations are able to experience, learn, reflect and act."" Sir David has teamed up with Israeli designer Ron Arad and landscape architects Gustafson Porter + Bowman on the project. The memorial, due for completion by 2021, will honour the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust, and all other victims of Nazi persecution, including Roma, gay and disabled people. A shortlist of 10 finalists was whittled down from 92 entries submitted by architecture and design teams from 26 countries. The project will be a ""statement by the British people that our nation will remember those who suffered, and that we will always strive for a better future"" Sir Peter Bazalgette, Chair of the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation said. Ghanaian-born Sir David's recent work includes the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC and the Idea Stores in London's Tower Hamlets."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51369960,Blasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam,Mila posted a video criticising Islam. Death threats followed and she has not gone back to school.,4 Feb 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A teenager has sparked a national debate about blasphemy in France after an Instagram post calling Islam a ""religion of hate"". Mila, 16, posted her comments online after receiving homophobic abuse from a Muslim commenter.  She received death threats and has not attended school since. But Mila has refused to back down, saying in her first television interview that she ""wanted to blaspheme"". She has since deactivated her Instagram account. The post has sparked a huge debate in France over freedom of speech. The country has no national blasphemy laws and has a rigidly secular constitution. Police initially opened two investigations: the first into whether Mila was guilty of hate speech, and the second into her online attackers. They have since dropped the hate speech case as Mila was expressing a personal opinion on religion and not targeting individuals. On Tuesday, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told the National Assembly that Mila and her family were under police protection. Appearing on the Quotidien programme on the TMC channel, Mila apologised for insulting people who practise their religion ""in peace"" and said she regretted the ""vulgarity"" of her words and their spread online. But she defended her remarks. ""I have absolutely no regrets about what I said, it was really my thought,"" she told the interviewer.  Mina said her life was ""clearly on hold"" amid the controversy. She had to leave school because of the threats against her, saying she could have been ""burned with acid, hit, stripped naked in public or buried alive"". On Monday, education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that authorities were trying to ""return her to school peacefully so that she can have a normal life"". The controversy began on 18 January, after Mila did a live broadcast on her Instagram account. After speaking about her sexuality she was called a ""dirty lesbian"" by a Muslim commenter. In response, Mila posted an attack on Islam. ""I hate religion. The Koran is a religion of hate,"" she said, before using stronger words to attack Islam. ""I am not racist. You cannot be racist towards a religion. I said what I thought, you're not going to make me regret it."" Critics said her comments were offensive. Some sent her death threats, and others posted her personal information online. The head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, Mohammed Moussaoui, said nothing justified death threats no matter how serious her remarks. Supporters defended her right to attack Islam, and the hashtag #JeSuisMila (I am Mila) started trending in France. Opponents hit back with the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasMila. French justice minister Nicole Belloubet waded into the controversy, saying that death threats against the teenager were ""unacceptable"". However, Ms Belloubet herself was criticised after arguing that an attack on religion was ""an attack on freedom of conscience"". French Senator Laurence Rossignol gave Ms Belloubet ""0/20 in constitutional law"", saying that in France ""it is forbidden to insult the followers of a religion but one can insult a religion, its figures, its symbols"". Ms Belloubet later said her comments had been ""clumsy"". Mila's cause has been embraced by the far right. National Rally leader Marine Le Pen said Mila had ""more courage than the entire political class in power for the past 30 years"". In October, French President Emmanuel Macron warned against ""stigmatising"" Muslims or linking Islam with the fight against terrorism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-41863258,School dinner boycott call in halal row,The call for a boycott follows the council's decision to ban unstunned halal meat from school meals.,3 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Calls have been made for a boycott of school meals in Lancashire after councillors voted to ban unstunned halal meat from its kitchens. Lancashire County Council made the decision to stop using it in 27 council-run schools last month. They described the practice of not stunning animals before slaughtering them as ""abhorrent"" and ""really cruel"". Lancashire Council of Mosques said the decision would ""only serve to increase Islamophobia and anti-Semitism"". The group said the decision, which will take effect from December, meant the council would stop providing meals ""in accordance with the universal criteria of Halal"". LCOM's chief executive officer Abdul Hamid Qureshi said: ""Our advice to the community is to stop school meals as soon as this occurs and campaign for change.  ""We recognise that this will have a significant impact on schools across Lancashire and, more importantly, on the children.  ""We are committed to continue working with schools and regret the impact this will have."" Unstunned halal meat is currently supplied to 12,000 pupils at 27 schools in Blackburn, Nelson, Burnley, Rawtenstall, Hyndburn, Clitheroe and Preston. On 26 October, a meeting of the full council backed a move not to provide meat to any of its kitchens ""unless the animal was stunned before it was slaughtered"". Susie Charles, the council's cabinet member for children, young people and schools, said she could see ""no reason"" for a boycott. ""There is always a choice of meals anyway, including vegetarian options. It's a very short-sighted view and it's depriving children of good nutritious food,"" she said. ""Eighty-four per cent of halal meat in the country is currently stunned. Also, in New Zealand, all their lamb is stunned, and Saudi Arabia buys New Zealand lamb. If Saudis can eat stunned meat, I don't see why people in Lancashire can't."" The Conservative councillor also rejected LCOM's claim that the council's decision would result in more fear or hatred of Muslims or Jews.  She said: ""I don't see why it should. And why are they bringing the Jews into it? We don't supply any kosher food at all. The Jews buy their own food for their schools."" Council leader Geoff Driver said the decision was ""democratic"" and a ""huge majority"" had voted for the ban. He said he ""very sincerely"" hoped it would not lead to Islamophobic sentiment in the community. He added: ""If anybody looks at it objectively, they will see that the people who could cause these problems are the Lancashire Council of Mosques themselves. They are the ones who are making such a big issue of it."" More than 80% of halal meat in the UK is pre-stunned and is acceptable to many Muslims, according to the British Veterinary Association."

Rev Richard Cameron shouted at Mr Corbyn as he entered a community centre on Wednesday. It later emerged that he had made Islamophobic and homophobic comments on social media. The Church of Scotland has confirmed he will not be allowed to work as a minister while inquiries continue. A spokeswoman for the church said: ""In accordance with our procedures Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended. ""This is to allow us to carry out an inquiry in relation to the incident which took place earlier this week and the subsequent complaints about his social media use."" In one tweet Rev Cameron, the minister at Scotstoun Parish Church in Glasgow, compared homosexuality to incest, describing them as ""unnatural"".  ""Both cause harm by breaking sensibly held taboos,"" he added. In September, he tweeted: ""Christ has the power to help and change anyone. Obviously many gays hate this because want to carry on their perversion.""  He also shared a series of controversial views on Islam, describing terrorism as ""a problem Islam needs to deal with"", a full face veil as ""oppressive and unBritish"" and the Prophet Muhammad as ""a violent man"". In another post, he said: ""The best way to defeat Islam is to preach Christ"". When initially alerted to the tweets, the church said it ""deplored comments which were Islamophobic or homophobic"".  Rev Cameron, who worked in pharmaceutical sales before joining the church, has been minister at Scotstoun since 2000.  The 60-year-old heckled Mr Corbyn during a two-day trip to Scotland, branding him a ""terrorist sympathiser"".  As Mr Corbyn was telling reporters about a scarf given to him by the Who Cares? Scotland charity, Rev Cameron shouted that he thought the Labour leader would be wearing an ""Islamic jihad scarf"". ""Do you think the man that's going to be prime minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?"" he added. ""Who's going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you're prime minister?"" The Labour leader did not react and he was ushered into the community centre by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-52576336,"Drag Race: The most political, troubled season ever?",The reality show has reminded US viewers to register to vote every week during its 12th season.,29 May 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Strip the format of RuPaul's Drag Race back to its most basic and you might think it's a TV show about people competing to see who's the best at dancing around while pretending to sing a song. But the 12th season has urged its US viewers to register to vote every week and made no secret of its political agenda. This weekend, finalists Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall and Crystal Methyd will compete (on a Zoom call) to be crowned the next drag superstar of the world. Season 12 has been a bumpy ride for viewers though and negative press about the behaviour of contestants - as well as host RuPaul - threaten to overshadow its message. In one episode, contestants Jackie Cox and Widow Von Du performed a lip-sync to Katy Perry's Firework - Jackie in a hijab based on the American flag, Widow in a gown inspired by the Black Panther Party. When Democratic politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared on the show as a guest judge, Jackie spoke about her Iranian mum's experiences in the US as an immigrant. ""People would tell her to go back to where she came from,"" explained a tearful Jackie. ""When I was young, I hid this part of my heritage for so long. She's an American citizen now. Seeing you standing up for people like my mum gives me so much hope."" One episode included a challenge where contestants took part in a fake rally to become the first-ever drag President of the United States - a format that hasn't been seen on Drag Race since 2012. And every episode has ended with contestants dancing on stage carrying signs reading ""register to vote"". There's political bias on Drag Race, no doubt. It's a left-wing show with a strong anti-Trump message, one that's been ramped up ahead of the US election in November 2020. Since coming to power in 2016, President Donald Trump has introduced, or tried to introduce, a number of measures which have stripped rights from LGBT people in America. ""Drag Race is a show that appeals to queer people, to women, to the groups that need to get out and vote,"" says Kevin O'Keefe, a US journalist who covers Drag Race for LGBT publication Xtra Magazine and considers himself a Drag Race ""herstorian"". ""It's mentioning politics more and more."" In the 2016 US election, only 50% of the population turned out to vote. ""Young people don't vote. That's a generalisation but the exit polls bear it out. A simple weekly reminder is useful,"" Kevin adds. ""Seeing those placards at the end of every episode, people may think it's showmanship, but that kind of repeated messaging actually does work."" Season 12 isn't the first season where politics has played an obvious part. Democrat Nancy Pelosi (the Speaker of the House of Representatives) made a brief appearance in the 2018 series of All Stars.  Contestants in 2016 had to produce smear campaigns against each other in season eight and in 2011 there were messages of support for US troops in season three. But some Drag Race experts say the very nature of the show is political, even when it's not directly referencing what's going on in Washington. ""Drag Race has always shown that people come for the drag, but you stay because you fall in love with these queer people,"" says Mikelle Street, digital director of Out magazine.  ""They always talk about issues that this community is dealing with."" In previous series', contestant Dusty Ray Bottoms spoke about their experience of conversion therapy, Nina West revealed they were threatened with murder by a far-right hate group while at college, Latrice Royale talked about spending time in prison. ""I don't know if season 12 is a return to politics, because I'm not sure the show ever left that,"" Mikelle adds. Kevin says that just because politics has been mentioned more doesn't make it the most political season. ""There's part of me that just wants to say that season one was the most political because it presented drag in this very rough around the edges way, something the show has shied away from since,"" he says. ""To me, letting drag queens be their messiest selves and presenting Cameroonian drag in BeBe Zahara Benet and pageant drag in Shannel - that to me will always seem more political than holding up a 'register to vote' sign."" Despite grand political ambitions for the 12th season of Drag Race, it's also been the most troubled. A contestant was disqualified before the series started when sexual misconduct allegations were made against them, leading to a hasty re-edit of every episode to remove them from the show. Comments made by Jeff Goldblum about Islam's stance on homosexuality were widely criticised and even RuPaul faced their own controversy when it was revealed they lease part of their 60,000 acre Wyoming ranch to oil companies for fracking. ""The reality is that people like Ru were progressive when they were coming up,"" says Mikelle.  ""But what happens with some of them - like Ru, like Ellen - is that they were progressive for their time when they were first coming in, and the movement continued to progress and they didn't necessarily move with it."" But even if this is at odds with the left-wing stance the show has, the negative press didn't seem do any damage to viewing figures. Drag Race was the most-watched show for 18 to 34-year-olds in the US on Friday nights. The show has also been affected by coronavirus, with its finale and reunion shows being filmed online due to social distancing measures. Season 12's big political storyline ended just before the final when Jackie was eliminated in the last of the episodes filmed in 2019. Kevin believes her time on the show will resonate with many LGBT viewers on a personal level. ""All of the stuff about her mum's experience as an immigrant, about her challenges with her former faith being Muslim, that all is a genuine weight on Jackie,"" he says.  ""I think a small push opens the floodgates, a lot of queer people wear that stuff on their sleeve and it doesn't take much for that to come out."" Going into the final, both Kevin and Mikelle are backing the same contestant to win: Jaida Essence Hall. ""Jaida represents something we haven't seen since Tyra Sanchez won season two,"" says Kevin.  ""She is a polished, gorgeous pageant girl. We've seen Asia O'Hara falter, we've seen Akeria Chanel Davenport falter - and I would be really bummed if it happened to Jaida."" But with the political agenda of season 12, RuPaul and the producers of Drag Race seem to want viewers to think about more than just who should become the world's next drag superstar when they watch the show. ""We're thinking about this administration, we're thinking about the election that's coming up,"" says Mikelle.  ""Those are the things that we're all thinking about and the ways in which the policies or lack of policies from the administration are affecting our daily lives.""

The son of the 62-year-old man found dead days after failing a lie-detector test on the programme tells the Daily Mail the presenter had ""ripped into him"" on stage.  The Sun says Jeremy Kyle fears ITV bosses will make him a scapegoat amid growing calls for the show to be axed. It has the headline: ""Kyle on trial."" The i newspaper reports that mental health campaigners have questioned whether the show can ever be safe.  The Spectator website says the shouting and screaming and fractious arguments presented for our titillation have been a concern for some time.  It adds that our desire for reality TV has led us down a dark and twisted path where a programme on which contestants are mocked by viewers based on their class, background and appearance remains such a huge draw. There are many accounts of the treatment of guests who have appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show.  One tells the Guardian his appearance was ""the worst thing that has ever happened in my life"".   A TV producer hired to film behind the scenes tells the Daily Mirror: ""It was distressing to see so many worlds torn apart and so little done to mend them afterwards.""  ITV has said participants are supported by the guest welfare team throughout filming and in the days afterwards. Few believe the show can survive. The Daily Mirror describes the programme as ""toxic telly"", and says television bosses must think carefully about what happens next.  Downing Street's announcement that the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill is to be brought to the Commons next month is widely reported.  ""The Fourth Vote Awakens"", the Huffpost UK website declares. The Sun says Theresa May will face a June D-Day.   For the Times, it will be a moment of truth for the prime minister and her Brexit deal.   The Telegraph says Mrs May has tried to delay her resignation for almost three months by telling ministers she can get a deal done if she's allowed to stay in Number 10 until the end of July. The announcement comes as a surprise to some. The Politico website says that with nothing yet agreed in the talks with Labour, and large factions in both main parties implacably opposed to the Brexit deal, it remains unclear how Mrs May hopes to win a Commons majority.   The LabourList website thinks that relying on either Conservative or Labour votes in the Commons is unlikely to produce a positive outcome for her. The Sun reports that the prime minister came under heavy pressure from her ""frustrated"" cabinet to bring the bill forward.  The Politics Home website says she will hope the move will be enough to satisfy Tory MPs demanding that she sets out a timetable for her departure from Number 10.  The Guardian says Mrs May hopes the bill will help to fend off calls for an imminent no-confidence vote from her backbenchers. The pledge by new Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt to introduce an amnesty on historical prosecutions for military veterans makes the lead for the Guardian and the Express.  The amnesty will not apply to legacy cases arising in Northern Ireland, with the Telegraph quoting sources who suggest that the political tensions there have made the issue too difficult to resolve. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The Times leads with a warning by the leader of Britain's police chiefs to Theresa May that anti-terrorist operations would be hampered if she bows to pressure to create an official definition of Islamophobia.   The paper says the adoption of the definition could in effect make it racist to criticise Islam or ""Muslimness"".   In a letter to the Prime Minister seen by the Times, Martin Hewitt - chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council - says the definition poses a threat to terror laws, stop-and-search at ports and the outlawing of terrorist groups. Finally, the Guardian reports that cubs and scouts are marching back into inner cities, with membership boosted by 20,000 in some of the most deprived parts of Britain over the past five years.  It says the recruitment is part of a concerted drive by the scouts to widen their appeal and defeat a stereotype that scouting is only for white, middle-class people.  According to the paper, the movement also wants to rebuild its previously deep connections in cities where it used to promote scouting as a way to learn skills to beat unemployment."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-48093032,Monkey chants 'aimed at child footballers',"Children as young as seven regularly suffer racist abuse, members of a new ethnic football forum say.",6 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Footballers as young as seven have experienced racist abuse at matches, a new anti-discrimination group has said. The Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Football Forum (BFF) has begun collating grassroots experiences of discrimination from across the country. Vice chair Ahmed Maravia, who runs a club in Leicester, said ""little kids"" often heard monkey chants and Islamophobic remarks at games. Leicestershire FA said discrimination did not belong in football. Mr Maravia, the chief executive of the Community Football Academy, said some of his under-14s once left the pitch in tears, despite winning, because of abuse. He said his players, who were predominantly Muslim, had been called the ""P-word"" and told - by opposing footballers, managers and coaches - they should be ""blowing things up, not playing football"". He said among the abuse victims were children as young as seven. ""Racist and Islamophobic remarks have been made and some of [them] don't understand, they're just little kids,"" he said. ""They just want to play football."" He said he had also heard ""monkey chants"" at an under-nines game and told how a parent once offered a banana to a child, saying they ""should be used to it"". Mr Maravia said providing evidence to the FA could be difficult and asked why a report of discrimination was not enough. ""[Those committing the abuse] don't do it in front of a match official,"" he said. ""They're not going to say 'hey, referee, stop the game, I want to make a racist remark'."" The forum, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, was planned months before a match in April, between FC Wymeswold and Cosby United, was stopped when a player said he was racially abused by a spectator. Ivan Limburd, the group's chair, said he hoped a survey about discrimination in grassroots football would lead to change and better education. Kelly Ellis, the chief executive of Leicestershire and Rutland FA, said it would engage with the clubs involved in the forum. She said: ""Leicestershire and Rutland County FA have always taken the stance that discrimination of any sort does not belong in football and investigate all allegations of discrimination in accordance with FA rules and procedures.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48083407,Tories 'aim not to fight' Euro elections,Party chairman Brandon Lewis says the priority is passing a Brexit deal before elections take place.,28 Apr 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Brandon Lewis has refused to say when the Tories' European election campaign will launch, saying his priority is not to have to fight them at all. The UK is due to elect new MEPs on 23 May, after Brexit was delayed amid continuing parliamentary deadlock. Several parties have launched their campaigns already but Conservative chair Mr Lewis told the BBC his focus was on next week's local elections. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, or sooner if a deal is agreed. This means the UK must now hold European Parliament elections on 23 May if it wants to avoid leaving the EU without a deal. But if agreement can be reached among MPs before 22 May, the UK could cancel its participation in the elections. The Lib Dems launched their campaign on Friday, with a pledge to do what they can to stop Brexit altogether. Nigel Farage's Brexit Party and pro-Remain party Change UK's have also launched their European election campaigns. Labour's NEC is due to meet on Tuesday to decide on its manifesto for the campaign. But asked about Conservative campaign plans on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Lewis said: ""As a government, our first priority is to not have to fight the EU elections. ""I think we should be doing everything we can to respect that 2016 referendum, if and when we are at the point where we are definitely fighting those EU elections then we will take some decisions about that.""  He said there was ""still time"" for the UK Parliament to approve the withdrawal agreement - which it has so far rejected three times - in time so the UK could leave the EU and would not have to take part in the elections at all. He rejected reports about donors deserting the Conservatives, saying that 2018 had been a ""record peacetime fundraising year"". Some Conservative members reportedly plan to back the Brexit Party at the elections, and Conservative councillors in Derbyshire are refusing to campaign at all in protest at the failure to have left the EU. Mr Lewis said: ""I don't deny the frustration people in our party have over where we are on Brexit. I share that frustration, I want to get this done so we don't fight those European elections."" He added: ""I hope that Conservative members, colleagues, volunteers, activists will come to want to not just vote for, but campaign for Conservatives to get elected, because ultimately Conservative representation is better than any other party."" On Sky News, Labour frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey said the government was still refusing to move on ""any of their red lines"" in cross-party talks aimed at reaching an agreement on Brexit. She said: ""Honestly I think the discussions so far have been productive, they've gone into a lot of detail, there seems to be a willingness on both sides to move towards some form of consensus. ""But as yet we haven't seen the government move on any of their red lines, we're having further discussions this week and hopefully we'll see some movement."" At the end of March, Prime Minister Theresa May said the public would find it ""unacceptable"" to have to elect a new group of 73 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU. But earlier this month, she agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-47947385,Call for same-sex education in primaries,"Teaching about same-sex relationships education must be made compulsory in primaries, a union says.",16 Apr 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Teachers are calling for same-sex relationships education to be made compulsory in UK primary schools. The demand, at the National Education Union conference in Liverpool, comes after protests at several primaries in Birmingham over an equality programme.  The protesters said the programme, No Outsiders, clashed with their religious beliefs. Delegate Deborah Gwynn said primary school pupils would have family members who were members of same-sex couples. ""We want them to feel included,"" she said. The motion claimed parental opposition in Birmingham and elsewhere was being organised by a range of homophobic groups. It called for the union to lobby the government and opposition parties to strengthen Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) guidance so that teaching about Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender relationships becomes statutory in both primary and secondary schools. She added that every child should be ""empowered to be the people that they want to be"". Tanveer Hammeed, a delegate from Leeds, said: ""RSE education needs to be for all, it needs to be inclusive, it needs to go through primary to secondary schools - no ifs, no buts."" Speakers also claimed there had been a conflation of issues of RSE and Islamaphobia, because of the predominance of Muslim parents protesting around the Birmingham schools, and that this was being stirred up by the Far Right. Teachers also expressed concerns about a return to the days when councils, and therefore schools, were banned from promoting homosexuality in any mainstream school. But they acknowledged that schools need to have a clear ""dialogue"" with parents about the necessity of inclusive education. From 2020, relationship, sex and heath education will be compulsory in all schools in England, while relationship and health education must be taught in primaries. But the guidance leaves head teachers to decide exactly what to teach and when. They also have to take into account the religious background of all pupils when planning it. In primaries, pupils will learn about ""healthy family life"" and how other people's families can look different from their own. With regard to education on same sex relationship issues, the government has said all pupils have to learn about them ""in a timely manner"", with the Department for Education recommending that it is ""integral throughout programmes of study"". In a statement, the DfE said: ""Pupils should receive teaching on LGBT relationships during their school years - we expect secondary schools to include LGBT content and primary schools are enabled and encouraged to cover this."" Policies on the issue differ in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was crucial that every young person felt happy and safe at school. ""Too many LGBT+ young people still don't feel they can be themselves at school. This can hit their self-esteem and motivation.  ""We can't address LGBT+ teenagers' self-harm and exclusion rates without talking openly and positively about LGBT+ people and their contributions to society now, and throughout history."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47590209,Anger and solidarity at mosque attack event,Faith and community leaders held a gathering in London for victims of the New Zealand mosque shootings.,16 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"There was a message of solidarity as faith and community leaders, joined by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, held a gathering at the East London Mosque dedicated to victims of the New Zealand mosque shootings. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up at the event in Whitechapel, as one speaker after another called for people to come together, across countries and religions. The Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, Harun Rashid Khan, expressed ""solidarity and companionship with all the people who are suffering from the heinous act of violence against minority communities"".  The Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, said an ""attack on faith anywhere"" was an ""attack on faith everywhere"". But there was also an obvious sense of anger from the Muslim community - not just at the attackers but also the media, politicians, and other public figures for ""demonising"" Muslims. Mohammed Mahmoud, an imam who was praised for his response to an attack outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, London, in 2017, said the security and peace of Muslims was under threat. He said people in power were partly responsible for ""perpetuating the narrative of otherness of a group who are perceived as infiltrators, and the dehumanisation and the vilification of Muslims who, by and large, are peaceful, law-abiding, loving citizens"".  Others were critical of the media for giving a platform to people they say are openly Islamophobic, as well as the coverage of terror attacks. Jusna Begum, 43, who believes Islamophobia is getting worse, said: ""I've stopped reading them, how attacks are covered...  ""A simple headline will always go back to the religion, for example this Australian guy, we won't say white, or Christian, we say mad men."" Lawrence Lewis, 28, said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"".  ""I feel like a lot of the time the Western narrative of the media is to demonise Islam, because they think that the laws and principles of Islam go against their ideology, and it doesn't,"" he said. Sheila McGregor, of the Tower Hamlets Stand Up To Racism group, said the ""demonisation"" of Muslims was a ""global phenomenon"" and had been carried out by politicians for ""decades"". ""This kind of act happens when people feel it is legitimate and it's legitimised from the top,"" she said.  The role of language in fomenting anti-Islam sentiment was touched on by several of the speakers, including the London mayor. Mr Khan did not reference the media or any politicians directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and at their role in people becoming radicalised.  ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use, and the messages we amplify,"" the mayor said.  ""There are some people in our city, in our country, who fan the flames of hatred.""  Others spoke of their shock at the New Zealand attack and their fear that something similar might happen in other mosques. Yelda Mahmood, 28, who had travelled from the US to London, said: ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together.  ""It doesn't matter what race you are or what religion you practice. ""How can someone go to someone's house of worship and do something like that?  ""It happens on the streets and in our neighbourhoods and now in our place of worships.""  In the wake of the attack, police have increased patrols at British mosques to provide reassurance. But Mohammed Mahmoud said there also needed to be more done to prevent people from spreading their Islamophobic views. He added: ""We demand that these platform providers, these people who provide columns and airtime for such individuals are called out and exposed and scandalised for their crimes against not only a group of Muslims who are peace loving, but also the crimes of disturbing the peace.""  Mr Khan said he hoped the increased presence of police at mosques would reassure worshippers. ""As far as we are concerned our diversity is a strength not weakness,"" he said. ""We don't simply tolerate it, we embrace it and respect it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-48730618,Diversity concern as parliament nears anniversary,"Warnings that the Scottish Parliament has ""gone backwards"" when it comes to the diversity of its MSPs.",23 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Diversity among the Scottish Parliament's elected representatives has ""gone backwards"" in some ways, MSPs have warned in a new BBC documentary. It comes 20 years after the first MSPs took their seats at Holyrood. Despite the recent prevalence of female leaders, the 2016 Scottish Parliament election saw fewer women elected compared with 1999. The parliament has also elected only four MSPs from ethnic minority backgrounds in the past two decades. The 1999 Scottish Parliament election returned 48 women to the chamber out of 129 MSPs. By the 2016 election that number had fallen to 45.  Former Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray, who was first elected to Holyrood in 1999, told the documentary, titled Children of the Devolution: ""We've never had a black woman MSP, that's never happened in 20 years. In some ways we've gone backwards."" Anas Sarwar MSP, who last year set up a Cross Party Group on tackling Islamophobia, said Scotland still had a long way to go on issues of equality. Mr Sarwar told the programme: ""You come to the realisation at some point - and part of it is when you become a parent yourself and you see the challenges that your children might face in the future - that I can't stay silent, silence isn't an option any more. ""I genuinely believe that my children are going to grow up in a more divided and a more hate-filled world than the one I grew up in and that frightens the life out of me. ""And I think we need people of all backgrounds talking about (it), and we all care about Scotland and we've got a long, long way to go."" SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, who has also been in the Edinburgh parliament from the start, said: ""If you say that a parliament should reflect the people that it serves, I think we do that in quite a lot of ways. ""We're not quite there yet with equality for women and we're certainly not there yet with other equalities that we need to take notice of. But the will is there."" The first episode of the documentary will reflect primarily on the early years of the new Scottish Parliament, which was formally opened by the Queen on 1 July 1999. One early controversy also centred around the issue of equality and moves by the then Labour-Liberal Democrat executive to scrap the controversial Section 28 or clause 2A law that banned the ""promotion"" of homosexuality in schools. A high-profile campaign to keep the clause was led by businessman Sir Brian Souter, who funded a postal referendum on the issue. After months of bitter political argument, MSPs voted to repeal the law in June 2000. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: ""I really hated that idea that one rich person could have ownership over a whole idea, it really brought home to me that it is not always a fair playing field and that really stuck in my craw."" Ms Davidson also reflected on the 2014 law change that would allow same-sex couples to marry in Scotland. ""When the bill was finally passed, I went back up the stairs to my office and I burst into tears,"" she told the BBC. ""After that, very late on, I went to a get-together in the pub with some of the campaigners and through a weird series of events someone there put me in touch with the person who is now my fiancee, so it almost started another chapter of my life."" Episode one of Children Of The Devolution is on BBC Scotland at 22:00 on Tuesday."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-43632366,'Punish a Muslim' scorned by community,"People gather to ""reclaim April 3 from hatred"" after letters were sent out urging violence.",3 Apr 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Three weeks ago, letters urging people to ""Punish a Muslim"" on 3 April arrived in homes in Bradford, Leicester, London, Cardiff and Sheffield. It sparked fears of violence with some Muslim people being too scared to leave home. But when one Cardiff man heard how scared his young children were, he worked with his community to ""reclaim 3 April from hatred"". Moseem Suleman helped to hastily arrange a social event in the Grangetown area of Cardiff. He said: ""Today is my brother's birthday. It should be joyous occasion. But it became a day my young children were afraid of.  ""They had heard bad things might happen to them. It is all they could talk about on their way home from school and it made me so sad."" Meet the man correcting stories about Muslims Communities unite to defy 'Punish A Muslim Day'  This is my country, too How the hijab became a fashion statement Mr Suleman and other members of Grangetown took less than three weeks to put on a day named Cardiff Together: One Love. So on Tuesday, Grange Gardens was filled with the sound of laugher and idle chat. Families sprawled on blankets on the damp grass, enjoying a mismatched picnic of onion bhajis and cupcakes.  Children thumped a football back and forth, while teenagers huddled in groups, scrolling on their mobile phones and giggling. ""I did not want them to remember this day of fear,"" Mr Suleman told the crowd. ""I wanted them to have happy memories. And because of this event, now they do."" To any passing onlooker, it would appear a normal, relaxed scene of togetherness in one of Cardiff's most diverse communities.   Yet it was organised in response to an ominous threat - a so-called Punish A Muslim day that had spread across the UK via social media.  The planned day - sparked by hate mail sent to individuals in Bradford, Leicester, London, Cardiff and Sheffield - has left many Muslim people too scared to leave their homes for fear of being attacked, with women particularly worried they might have their hijab torn off on the street.   But at the Hideout Café, the day has been used as an incentive to bring people together in defiance.  For Mariyah Zaman, 19, a media student at Cardiff Metropolitan University, the day is a symptom of the growing anti-Muslim sentiment she feels is sweeping across the UK and Europe.  She said: ""As horrific as it is, when I first heard about the Punish a Muslim Day, I wasn't surprised. ""Islamophobia has become normalised - especially against women who are visibly Muslim. ""It's not just in the street; it is present in institutions and work places. Muslims face stigmatisation every day.  ""People need to be educated and equipped with the right information. The biggest cause of Islamophobia is a lack of awareness and an irrational fear."" It is a view Ali Abdi, 30, agrees with. A local community activist who has lived in Grangetown all his life, he dedicates much of his spare time to trying to improve the area.  He said: ""This area has fabulous cohesion and a great history of it.  ""So my message today is that, in the face of division and hatred, as a community we carry on. ""No one is born to hate another person. People are taught it, and anything that is taught can also be untaught."" The event - ""Cardiff together: One love"" - was organised by the Cardiff working group of Muslim Engagement and Development (MEND) -  a national organisation which seeks to empower British Muslims - along with the Muslim Council of Wales.  But it has also been supported by other faith groups.  When invited to address the crowd over the microphone, Aled Edwards, secretary of the Interfaith Council for Wales and himself a Christian, said: ""The friendship and dialogue between the faith communities in Cardiff and Wales is very strong. ""If one of communities is persecuted in this way, we come together very quickly.  ""Tomorrow it might be Jews who are attacked or Hindus or Christians. ""We use it as an excuse to renew our friendship and stand together. But for Yasmin Khan, of Cyncoed, Cardiff, the low turnout of local Grangetown Muslims showed the level of fear the community still have. Waving her arm at the surrounding terrace houses, she said: ""This whole area is full of Muslims. ""But I have spoken to them, and they are too frightened of being attacked, so they haven't come. ""Even some mosques have said 'don't go out'.   ""My view is that this is not right. We have to live harmoniously. We can't just be frightened and made to stay in the house.""  Perhaps those who best sum up the day are two teenage girls - a Muslim and non-Muslim - who live over the road from each other and have bonded playing football on the community pitch.  Kicking a ball back and forth between themselves, one said: ""The Punish a Muslim Day is just so dumb.  ""Why do Muslims get blamed for all the terrorism and bad things that happen?"" Her friend - dressed in a headscarf, jeans and trainers - nods in agreement. ""It's true,"" she said, curling a ball to her friend's feet. ""We're taught in school not to judge people on how they look. ""You have to get to know them first. Adults need to learn that. It's 2018, after all. Not 1800."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44620412,A US civility crisis: Total political war,"In an increasingly acrimonious political scene, has the tenor of US civil discourse ever been worse?",1 Jul 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Interrupted dinners, driveway confrontations, threatening leaflets. Donald Trump administration officials are increasingly facing harassment from liberals enraged by the president's words and actions.  Is it a reflection of an increasingly acrimonious political environment, a sign that liberals are spinning out of control or a reasonable response by citizens faced with what some see as a historic national crisis and a president who critics say likes to stoke the fires of discord? It depends on who you ask and - in an increasing fractured US society - their partisan proclivities. The recent round of actions and reactions, accusations and recriminations, began last week when a group protesting against the administration's policy of separating undocumented migrant families at the border forced Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to cut short a dinner in a Washington Mexican restaurant. There have been protests since the start of the Trump presidency, of course, but the audio recordings and first-person accounts of crying children and despondent parents have sent a shock of crackling anger through already frayed nerves of those on the left. A few days after the Nielsen incident, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, an early Trump supporter, was chased out of a theatre by activists questioning her support for the administration's immigration and healthcare policies. The same night, in the western Virginia town of Lexington, the owner of an organic restaurant, the Red Hen, asked White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to dine somewhere else. Ms Sanders, one of the most visible members of the Trump administration, complied. Stephanie Wilkinson would later tell the Washington Post that she decided to make the request because she and members of her restaurant staff viewed the Trump administration's policies towards gays, and immigrant families at the border as ""inhumane and unethical"". ""I'm not a huge fan of confrontation,"" she said. ""This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals."" One of the restaurant's waiters posted about the incident on Facebook, and Ms Sanders responded to media requests for comment with a tweet confirming - and condemning - the incident. The restaurant, the Red Hen, was inundated by a mix of threats and praise, and Ms Sanders reportedly will begin receiving US Secret Service security protection. Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters, at a rally in California, applauded the restaurant confrontations - and encouraged more protests. ""The American people have put up with this president long enough,"" she said. ""If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them!"" On Monday, Mr Trump entered the fray, tweeting about the Red Hen incident and calling into question the restaurant's cleanliness. He also issued what seemed like a thinly veiled warning to Ms Waters, adding that she is an ""extraordinarily low IQ person"". ""She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement,"" he wrote. ""Be careful what you wish for Max!"" Since then, protesters have demonstrated outside the apartment complex of Stephen Miller, a White House adviser considered one of the architects of Mr Trump's immigration policy, handing out ""wanted"" leaflets alluding to the family-separation practice and accusing him of being guilty of kidnapping children, ""crimes against humanity"", Islamophobia and promoting Nazism and white supremacy. Pro-immigration activists also shouted at Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell at Georgetown University, before they were confronted by his wife, Trump administration Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. By Thursday night, Mr Trump was leaning into the growing political conflagration, saying that the restaurant protesters ""really want anarchy"" and that his government would ensure ""really strong law and order"". It's Mr Trump's style, displayed on the campaign trail and in the White House, to never back down from a fight. A traditional role of the president has been to play mediator, not instigator - a force for civic reconciliation, not confrontation.  This president, however, frequently finds strength in conflict, and he appears to sense that railing against enemies on the left could be a useful way to animate his political base. In tone and demeanour, the differences between Mr Trump and his predecessor have never seemed greater. In a fundraiser on Thursday night, Barack Obama told Democrats that his party needs to preach hope and unity in the forthcoming mid-term congressional election campaigns. ""The majority of the country doesn't want to see a dog-eat-dog world where everybody is angry all the time,"" he said. The confrontational nature of the recent protests and restaurant demonstrations has set off a debate, playing out on social media, television airwaves and newspaper opinion pages over whether American discourse is becoming unacceptably coarse. The Daily Beast's Matt Lewis called it the start of an ""Uncivil War"", where the each side of the political divide believes the other is ""evil and illegitimate"" - and acts accordingly. Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, says that while things are bad, the current ""level of vitriol"" is far from unprecedented. She points to acrimony following the 2000 presidential race, which had to be resolved by the US Supreme Court, Vietnam War protests and civil rights upheaval in the 1960s and, of course, the real Civil War - the one resolved by bullets and cannons - as times when things were worse. America was founded in revolution and war, she notes, so confrontation and conflict are, in a way, hardwired into the nation's DNA. ""In the 1960s our leaders were being gunned down in the streets or at their political rallies,"" she says. ""Sarah Huckabee Sanders being asked to leave a restaurant, we're going to put that in the same category? No."" If there's something that's different now, it's the ubiquity of social media and the immediacy that it gives every instance of confrontation and conflict. Where in the past, Perry says, an unpleasant restaurant episode might take days to make it into a newspaper or appear in a political memoir decades later, modern society means within hours the entire nation can be tuned in with outrage or approval.   A November 2017 Marist poll confirmed that more Americans are feeling as though the ""overall tone and level of civility"" in Washington during the Trump presidency is getting worse (67%) rather than improving (6%). Dive a little deeper, however, and the partisan finger-pointing is on full display. When asked whether Republicans ""cross the line"" in terms of attacking the other side, 80% of Democrats say yes. When Republicans are asked about Democrats, fully 87% say their opponents go too far. A May CBS/YouGov survey may offer some hints about Mr Trump's appeal, with 78% of Republicans in battleground congressional districts saying they ""mostly like"" how Mr Trump upsets the ""elites and the establishment"".  If confrontation is Mr Trump's brand, at least among Republicans it's a winning tactic. But do Democrats want that to be their brand, too? Within liberal ranks, a subsidiary debate is taking place over whether the strategy of aggressive confrontation is appropriate or a step too far, a needed escalation or a counterproductive effort. ""Hard to understand this argument that tossing [Ms Sanders] is somehow 'doing something' that will help elect Democrats, defeat Trump or change policy,"" tweets former Obama strategist David Axelrod. ""It won't."" He calls it a ""total political gift"" to Mr Trump. Others groused at what they saw as a double standard being applied to the political left. ""The one-sided nature of the 'civility' debate - where only liberals are lectured about this, while Trump mocks disabled people and Gold Star families, but liberals are told to play nice - reminds me, as usual, of the dynamics of abuse,"" tweets Salon politics writer Amanda Marcotte. On Thursday afternoon, a man walked into an Annapolis, Maryland, newspaper office and killed five journalists. Although local police report the suspect had a long-running grudge with the publication, it wasn't long before that tragic event, too, was subsumed by political recriminations and accusations that opponents had created an environment for the violence.  Many on the left pointed out that Mr Trump had repeatedly called journalists ""enemies of the American people"". Fox's Sean Hannity said Ms Waters' comments created a political atmosphere where such violence was more likely. In World War II, military conflict expanded into ""total war"" - where entire nations and peoples were mobilised and consumed in the flames of battle. There was no escape from the carnage. What US society now may be experiencing is total political war, where - thanks to media and technology - partisan discord is inescapable, whether in the corridors of power in Washington and theatres in Florida, the border with Mexico or restaurants in rural Virginia."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-47471903,Row in Scottish Labour ahead of conference,The former leader of Scottish Labour launches an attack on her successor over Brexit just days before the party's conference.,6 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The former leader of Scottish Labour has launched an attack on her successor just days before the party's conference.  Kezia Dugdale strongly criticised Richard Leonard's approach to Brexit in a letter that that was later leaked.  She also accused him of ""censoring"" two of the party's MEPs over their support for another referendum on EU membership.  A Labour source said this had been the result of a ""misunderstanding"".  And he said Mr Leonard had written to the two MEPs - Catherine Stihler and David Martin - to apologise.  The party's conference in Dundee begins on Friday and lasts until Sunday. In her letter, Ms Dugdale said she wanted to ""formally complain"" to Mr Leonard about the way in which Ms Stihler and Mr Martin had been treated ahead of the conference. She also claimed Ms Stihler's section in the conference guide had originally included a statement in support of a so-called People's Vote on Brexit which had been changed without her consent.  Ms Dugdale wrote: ""From what I can see from the agenda, there is no formal opportunity for them to speak or indeed a formal item to thank them for their combined 55 years of electoral service to the party. ""If that wasn't bad enough, I was shocked to discover from Catherine that her statement in the conference guide had been amended without her consent. ""When that was challenged, she was told it was on your direction and that you had the final say on what was printed."" Ms Dugdale, who has been a prominent campaigner for another referendum on Brexit, claimed the section had originally said: ""Brexit is a tragedy for our country and for the workers and communities that Labour represents.  ""That's why David and Catherine fully support a People's Vote with the option to remain in the EU."" However, according to Ms Dugdale, the section was replaced with: ""The complete mess the Tories have made of Brexit means they are putting Scottish people's jobs and our industries at risk. Labour will always put them first."" Ms Dugdale said changing the section without Ms Stihler's permission was ""wholly inappropriate"", adding: ""I can't possibly understand why you would seek to censor her final words to party members, especially since what she states is party policy and has been since last September."" A Labour source told BBC Scotland: ""This was a genuine misunderstanding and Richard has written to Catherine and David to apologise.""  Mr Leonard was also criticised in the email for his stance on Brexit, with Ms Dugdale expressing her disappointment that his support for holding a People's Vote had not come sooner. She wrote: ""You know that I've found the party's position on Brexit and a second EU referendum disappointing for some time. ""As I said at group last week and repeatedly over the past few months, I don't believe there is such a thing as a good Brexit or indeed a 'jobs first Brexit'. ""The move towards supporting a People's Vote is a welcome one, but it should have happened much, much earlier. I note from your roundtable with journalists last week that you'd sooner we left the EU than give people a final say. ""That's disappointing for the many party members who fervently back a final say and indeed all of our voters who are now a bit lost for a home."" Mr Leonard is a close ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who had previously resisted pressure from Remain supporters in his own party to get behind another referendum, insisting he preferred to force a general election. But Mr Corbyn announced a change of heart last month, telling his MPs: ""One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May's overwhelmingly rejected deal. ""That's why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country."" Mr Leonard later told BBC Scotland he backed the move, saying it could be the only way to break the deadlock over Brexit at Westminster.  He also said he was ""disappointed"" that Labour's investigation into claims of Islamophobia against a Dumfries and Galloway councillor was taking so long.  Jim Dempster was suspended by Labour in March of last year after admitting telling transport officials that ""no-one would have seen [then-transport minister Humza Yousaf] under his burka"". Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland he was hurt that the case had still not been dealt with almost a year after it was referred to Labour's national disciplinary body in London. But Mr Leonard said: ""The case is being dealt with through due process. I'm disappointed that it's taking as long as it has - the person involved in the complaint is still suspended from the Labour Party and I hope this will be resolved very quickly indeed"". Mr Dempster apologised to Mr Yousaf at the time, saying he was ""thoroughly ashamed and embarrassed"" by the comments he had made, and that ""my ignorance is totally inexcusable."""

When you think of a place that teaches groups of children - all day, every day - the word most people would use is ""school"". But the law in England is surprisingly vague on what a school actually is.  More than 350 sites - suspected of being unregistered schools - have been investigated in England by education watchdog Ofsted since a specialist taskforce was set up two years ago. Ofsted inspectors say they don't have proper powers to inspect or close them. The people running these sites say they are not schools at all.  Some of them are on industrial estates, in church basements and even in pubs. The BBC has obtained pictures showing squalor, appalling food hygiene and dangerous wiring. Some premises have blocked fire escapes and no access to clean drinking water. Many sites do no criminal records checking of staff. But because of the confusing legal situation, most remain open. Suri's son is about to leave his primary and go to big school.  Not every parent is happy about the choice of education they end up with, but Suri - not her real name - breaks down in tears when she thinks about where her boy is going.  Later this year he will start at a ""yeshiva"" in the Haredi ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill, north London. It is not registered and its premises and teaching go unmonitored by the authorities.  Suri's son will never do GCSEs there, as these yeshivas usually don't provide any maths, English or science despite operating full-time. Instead they offer a wholly religious education for boys, focused on scripture, from the age of 13. At their schools, girls are often able to study secular subjects and do exams, but after a Haredi boy's Bar Mitzvah, devotion to religious education is imperative. Those who run yeshivas would argue that they are not schools and therefore don't have to abide by the rules that the state imposes.   If you have any information or experience with unregistered schools that you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch with us, in confidence, at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk And the Department for Education seems to accept that yeshivas are not technically schools.  In a statement, the DfE told the BBC that yeshivas ""do not meet the definition of a school and cannot therefore be prosecuted for operating as an unregistered school"". The DfE guidelines for England say that any place that teaches five or more children for at least 18 hours a week needs to be registered as a school. In Wales, anywhere offering ""full-time education"" is expected to register. In Northern Ireland the law requires all independent schools to register. The same applies in Scotland. But legal guidance known to have been cited by the DfE says a site is not technically a school if it doesn't teach general classes of education, such as maths, English or science.  Hence any place that only teaches religious education - be it Muslim, Jewish, Christian or any other faith - is arguably not a school.  But critics say that it is bizarre that a building - where children of school age are taught full-time - is not deemed a school. ""Of course they're schools,"" says Jay Harman, of pressure group Humanists UK, which campaigns on the issue of unregistered schools. ""These are places which provide children their only education from dawn till dusk. The fact that it's scriptural doesn't detract from their status as schools."" For the critics, to define the yeshivas as anything other than schools would suggest that the children are getting their main form of education elsewhere. The law demands all children have an efficient full-time education, whether at a school or at home. That's simply not happening, says Izzy Posen, 23, who was at a Stamford Hill yeshiva from the age of 13.  ""Children are in a yeshiva from as early as 8am until as late as 9pm - if that isn't a school, I'm not sure what is.  ""They're not taught anything else at home. There's no secular studies but this is the sole education I got - I didn't get any other. I couldn't speak or write English.  ""When I came out of these yeshivas, I had to teach myself English because I was never taught English. ""I remember at 18 reading an elementary school text book. I had no idea what the maths Pi symbol meant."" Certainly Suri believes that going to yeshiva will mean that her son does not get a full education.  ""There is no education at all and we're living in Britain - boys can't speak English,"" Suri says. She acknowledges that many Haredi parents are happy for their children to only have religious education.  But Suri believes her sons will struggle to get jobs if they ever want to find work. ""They'll have no future. They'll be stuck on benefits and left behind. Culture is important, identity is important, but there has to be a balance."" Suri belongs to one of the more conservative groupings within the Haredi community. She says if she were to try to enrol her son in a different school - even another Haredi one in Stamford Hill - she would face shame both in her community and within her own family. ""We'd be considered bad parents. We'd be ostracised."" Suri took an unusual step and contacted Hackney Council and Ofsted to press them to close the unregistered schools or launch inspections. Despite acknowledging that these places exist, the authorities said they couldn't help her.   But as well as the yeshivas for boys aged 13-16, the BBC has found two suspected Haredi primaries that have never been inspected by Ofsted. One was based in a building belonging to a synagogue in Westcliff-on-Sea, in Essex, but run separately by a Haredi group. The children there were much younger than those one would see at a yeshiva. The synagogue denies that an unregistered school is being run on the premises.  It says that the education provided is within the 18-hour limit. But when the BBC observed it, it was operating for longer hours. We filmed footage of a teacher appearing to manhandle a distressed child on one occasion, and strike a different boy on another. These incidents showed ""huge safeguarding issues"", according to Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner. The synagogue said it had not been aware of any assaults and has requested more information. It has since suspended the school. Another suspected unregistered primary school was located in a house in Hackney, where at least 30 young boys could be observed arriving at the beginning of the school day. When we knocked at the door we were told it was a club and advised to speak to a man - Moses Lewis - who says he advises ""schools and non-schools"" in the area.  He points out that there are many more registered schools than unregistered ones. ""I don't think we give the country much trouble by the way we educate our children."" He says he is confident that the law is not being broken. ""If somebody's got the courage, be it the Department for Education, be it Ofsted, let them pluck up the courage and bring a prosecution and let's fight it out in court."" In January, Hackney Council released its long-delayed investigation into the 30 or so unregistered educational sites in the borough. It called for greater inspection powers. Eli Spitzer is the headmaster of a registered school in north London, but attended two unregistered schools himself. He took GCSEs after graduating from a yeshiva and believes a solution can be found if the Department for Education acts. ""The overwhelming majority of schools are registered. ""If parents are reassured that what the authorities want is purely and simply compliance with the law, and are willing to accommodate their desire to educate their children in this type of way, I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to find a solution to this."" While he acknowledges there are some major obstacles - such as the teaching of sex education - he says regulatory inertia is responsible for the presence of so many unregistered schools. ""Like every industry that is unregulated, people just act with impunity, start taking advantage, start cutting corners - compliance and health and safety for example."" On a morning in July 2017, three Ofsted inspectors visited a building in central London they suspected of housing an unregistered school. Just a mile's walk from the Tower of London, the site in Whitechapel was housed in a four-storey block on a stretch of Commercial Road, surrounded by women's clothes wholesalers and curry restaurants. After they arrived, inspectors allege they were called ""Britain First paedophiles"" - a reference to the far-right group - by a former headteacher, Mohammed Umair. Umair is now facing prosecution for racially abusing Ofsted inspectors. He denies abusing them. Umair was issued with a warning notice by the inspectors for allegedly running a school on the site.  The year before, Ayasofia Primary, a registered school he had run from a building nearby was shut down after inspections found failings.  But Umair maintains he wasn't operating an unregistered school and says the centre was being run by someone else on a part-time basis.  Last September, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu addressed the general issue of unregistered schools. He said in ""segregated and isolated communities, unregulated and home schooling are a breeding ground for extremism and future terrorism"". The BBC has obtained a book from an unregistered school for young children in Birmingham that advocates the murder of gay people.  ""Those guilty of this crime are to be killed by the sword,"" says a passage in Forbidden, written by Muhammad Saleh al-Munajjid.  Another chapter warns a wife against refusing sex with her husband. Elsewhere it says a woman wearing perfume is an adulterer. The book ""undermines the values which British schools seek to promote"" and ""could potentially isolate young impressionable minds of Muslim schoolchildren"", according to Dr Iqtidar Cheema, director of the Institute for Leadership and Community Development, run by the charity Muslim Aid. ""Such moral and conceptual isolation is the first step to radicalisation."" Dr Farid Panjwani of the Institute of Education says some Muslims perceive they are marginalised and that unregistered schools may be a product of that.  A number of factors, including the government's anti-radicalisation Prevent strategy and episodes of Islamophobia, lead to some Muslims feeling ""disproportionate scrutiny"", he says. ""We should not generalise. The vast majority of schools with Muslim religious character are registered and doing well, some of them are performing at the top of the country."" In September 2015 a mixed school called Enterprise Diamond was set up in the basement of St Swithun's Church in Lewisham, south-east London. Nine pupils were enrolled.  Some had previously been home schooled. The parents of others did not want them going to a Pupil Referral Unit - a centre that educates children who are expelled or otherwise unable to attend school. The school was set up by Kay Johnston. She had attempted to register it but started lessons before the process was finished. Soon after, Johnston faced serious allegations from her time at another school in 2014. She was accused of assaulting a five year-old pupil with learning difficulties. Johnston was also claimed to have pushed the child off a chair.  After reviewing CCTV footage, a panel from the National College for Teaching and Leadership banned Johnston from teaching in January 2016. She denies striking the child and says she was bitten and kicked several times. Johnston appealed and continued to run Enterprise Diamond before it was inspected by Ofsted in March 2016 and served with a warning notice for running an unregistered school. She closed the school shortly after. There is no suggestion any child was harmed at the school. ""I never set out to do anything illegal,"" Johnston says. ""I was threatened with a jail sentence for rescuing vulnerable children who have been given up on by mainstream schools, caring for them, educating them at my own expense."" One mother, whose son and daughter both attended, says she chose to educate them there because she was unhappy with the alternatives offered by the state. Pupil referral units in the area are ""a pipeline to failure"", she says, leading to a life of crime.    The BBC has learned that local authorities across England and Wales have received 52 safeguarding alerts - concerns or suspicions of abuse or neglect - since January 2014 from unregistered schools. The majority of reports concerned allegations of physical abuse, but alerts were also made about sexual abuse and grooming. Alerts were received across England, with one in Wales. None were reported in Scotland and Northern Ireland. When Ofsted finds a suspected unregistered school, they can only issue a warning notice and seek to prosecute the individual running the school. The Department for Education has to approve this, then evidence is passed to the Crown Prosecution Service, before the education secretary is given the final decision to proceed. ""It takes an inordinately long time and [lots of] resources,"" says Victor Shafiee, Ofsted's deputy director for unregistered schools. ""It's not good enough.""  Ofsted says it has limited investigative powers - that it is not allowed to take away any evidence, force entry to premises with locked doors or compel witnesses to be interviewed. Despite investigating 359 suspected unregistered schools, it has yet to secure a single prosecution against a proprietor for running one.  Ofsted Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman says that her ""hands are tied"" and that the DfE ""could and should"" have approved cases to be put forward to the CPS. The DfE says it works very closely with Ofsted and jointly agrees which cases are sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. ""The CPS then determine whether the evidential and public interest tests are met. If the Director of Public Prosecutions takes a decision to charge, the case then comes to the secretary of state for his consent. So far no cases have reached that stage. ""No child should be placed at risk and where a school is operating illegally action must be taken. We fund a joint team with Ofsted to target these organisations and as a result of that, 192 inspections have taken place and 50 warning notices have been issued.  ""Thirty-eight unregistered schools have subsequently ceased to operate as schools and investigations are ongoing into the remainder."" Ofsted says there is anecdotal evidence of some places opening on new sites. Shafiee says a change in the law is needed to shut these places down when inspectors visit them. Ministers have regularly been warned about the issue. Ed Balls was told about the problem of unregistered schools in Hackney by civil servants when he was the education secretary in 2009. The civil servants said yeshivas were ""operating illegally and without the most basic health, safety and child welfare checks"". Then in 2014, details of a dozen unregistered schools in London were sent to the department, then led by Michael Gove. His successor, Nicky Morgan, was also alerted to the issue in a confidential advice note from 2015. ""Her Majesty's Chief Inspector is very concerned that the children and young people attending these unregistered schools are potentially at risk,"" it said. ""It is of utmost importance that urgent action is taken to ensure that they are kept safe and receive a suitable education."" In October 2015, it looked as if change was afoot. In his party conference speech, Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to introduce greater regulation of what he called supplementary schools. ""These children should be having their minds opened, their horizons broadened, not having their heads filled with poison and their hearts filled with hate,"" he said. ""If an institution is teaching children intensively, then whatever its religion, we will, like any other school, make it register so it can be inspected."" But Cameron's promise never materialised. One of the reasons for the failure to act is understood to have been the objections raised by the Church of England. New proposals would have allowed Ofsted powers over any place supervising pupils for more than eight hours a week. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, believed the measures would impose a burden on even the smallest church Sunday schools. But the BBC understands there may be another reason for the DfE's reluctance to act. We have seen legal guidance from 2014 known to have been cited by the DfE. The guidance suggests the DfE would lose in court if there was an attempt to close an unregistered Jewish yeshiva. Daniel Greenberg QC, acting for a yeshiva, argued that somewhere providing only ""specialised religious education"" did not count as a school because it offers no secular teaching whatsoever. The DfE makes a distinction between ""unregistered schools"" and ""out-of-school settings"". In the latter it includes ""full-time settings that only teach a religious curriculum, and therefore do not qualify as schools"". Dame Louise Casey - who led a review of community cohesion in 2016 - says it's a ""crazy policy"" for the DfE to have. ""We do not want kids growing up here who are only taught one religious way of thinking, and that religion covers their whole way of life from what they can work as, who they can be, what kind of jobs they can do, how they treat women. ""Even if it's technically legal, it's wrong.""

Images of Sam Farrell at a party on 23 March wearing striped pyjamas with a Holocaust number were tweeted by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) who said they were ""extremely concerned"". The president-elect had been due to take up the role at Edge Hill University in Ormskirk on 1 July. He said he was ""deeply sorry"". The UJS welcomed the apology but said his ""consistent history of antisemitic, Islamophobic, homophobic, transphobic, sexist and ableist social media posts deem him unfit for a role such as SU president"". Edge Hill Students' Union (SU) said they plan to organise anti-Semitism training for all new student officers after being contacted by a UJS representative. Mr Farrell had previously been disciplined over the incident but a fresh action was opened on 24 March due to new evidence, the SU said. At the time he said: ""Despite what my past posts may suggest, I do understand the severity of making light of events from history, especially when that history plays a fundamental role in reminding us of the needless persecution of others. ""I only hope I can convey how genuine I am when I say that I now realise how naïve and ignorant my past behaviour was. It was wrong, it will not happen again, and it should not have happened in the first place."" The SU said it would now ""be considering our options for the role for the forthcoming academic year"". In a statement, Edge Hill University said it welcomed the decision.  ""While the Students' Union is a wholly independent organisation, responsible for the election and appointment of its officers, the university has always been clear that it will not tolerate abhorrent, abusive or racist behaviour of any kind and would not hesitate to use its own procedures if necessary if the matter was not dealt with appropriately."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48434202,Call for Tory Islamophobia investigation,"The Muslim Council of Britain says a problem ""runs deep into the party"" and is demanding an inquiry.",28 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Muslim Council of Britain has formally asked the UK's human rights watchdog to investigate accusations of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. In a letter to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, the MCB said a problem ""runs deep into the party"".  The EHRC said in response that it was considering complaints about the party in line with its ""usual processes"".  In March, party deputy chairman James Cleverly insisted ""immediate action"" was taken after any racism claims. The MCB is an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies, including mosques, schools, and charitable associations. It has called repeatedly for an independent investigation into discrimination claims. Now, in its letter filing a formal complaint to the EHRC, it accused the Conservatives of not taking action against Islamophobia shown by Tory MPs, and tolerating discrimination towards party members.  The MCB said there was ""sufficient evidence"" to suggest the party may have breached anti-discrimination law, and accused it of showing a ""callous attitude to complaints"".  Among the allegations, it cited comments made by Boris Johnson about women wearing burkas looking like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"" as an example of when Tory MPs had created an ""atmosphere of hostility towards the Muslim members of the party"". The former foreign secretary was later cleared of breaking the Tories' code of conduct - a decision the MCB criticised at the time.  The group also criticised the unsuccessful London mayoral campaign of Zac Goldsmith in 2016 - in which he ran against Sadiq Khan - arguing it demonstrated a ""tolerance for Islamophobia"" within the Conservative Party.  The MCB complaint comes on the same day that the EHRC announced a formal investigation into the Labour Party over allegations of anti-Semitism. Conservative peer Baroness Warsi, who was the first female Muslim cabinet minister, has long criticised her party over the issue. In April, Tory chairman Brandon Lewis insisted the party's approach to Islamophobia was ""transparent"" but would not say how many complaints it had received. An EHRC spokesman said the body had written to the Conservative Party ""to ask for information in order to help assess the complaints"".  Earlier this month, the MCB criticised the government for rejecting a definition of Islamophobia created by a cross-party group of MPs. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims wanted to define it to tackle what it called a ""social evil"". Its wording has the support of various political parties - including Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Conservatives - and several Muslim groups. But a government spokesman said it needed ""further careful consideration"" and had ""not been broadly accepted""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47488047,Rudd apologises over 'coloured' term,"Diane Abbott says Amber Rudd's use of the word ""coloured"" was ""outdated"" and ""offensive"".",8 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has apologised for using the word ""coloured"" in a BBC interview.  Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised the use of the term, saying it was ""outdated"", ""offensive"" and a ""revealing choice of words"". During a discussion about MP abuse, Ms Rudd said: ""It's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse."" In her apology, Ms Rudd said she was ""mortified at my clumsy language"". The prime minister's official spokeswoman said making an apology was ""absolutely the right thing to do"". Historically, the word is associated with segregation, especially in the US, where black people were kept separate from white people - on public transport, or at drinking fountains which were described as ""coloured-only"" for example. It is regarded as an offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday life. The exchange happened during an interview on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. Host Jeremy Vine asked Ms Rudd: ""The question is, given that all people in the public eye seem to get terrible tweets from strangers, whether it's worse if you're a woman?"" Ms Rudd replied: ""It definitely is worse if you're a woman, it's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. ""I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, that's something we need to call out."" But Ms Abbott responded on Twitter, saying it was a ""revealing choice of words"". Former home secretary Ms Rudd apologised on Twitter. Separately, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has been criticised for her response to a question from Labour MP Naz Shah, about Islamophobia. The shadow women and equalities minister had called for a Commons debate, after the former Tory minister Baroness Warsi criticised the Conservatives over Islamophobia.  Ms Shah added that the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims had recently published a definition of Islamophobia. Mrs Leadsom replied that the Conservatives had an ""extremely robust and urgent"" response to Islamophobia but went on to suggest that, on the definition of Islamophobia, Ms Shah ""can discuss with Foreign Office ministers whether that would be a useful way forward"". Ms Shah said later: ""To say that British Muslims facing Islamophobia here in the UK is a 'Foreign Office' issue is truly baffling and horrifically alludes to British Muslims as foreigners. ""It just goes to show how out of touch the Tories are with a problem that their politicians and councillors are exacerbating."" A spokesman for the Commons Leader's office spokesman said: ""Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place. ""It was thought the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia.  ""International efforts to combat Islamophobia (and all forms of religious persecution and prejudice) are lead by the PM's special envoy on freedom of religion or belief, Lord Ahmad, at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. ""Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swiftly by the Home Office or Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government as appropriate."" But Baroness Warsi, a Conservative peer, tweeted: ""What is wrong with some of my colleagues?"""

It meant private companies were responsible for monitoring medium and low-risk offenders, with payment linked to results. But now those changes will be reversed by the end of 2020. In March the National Audit Office said problems with the new system had cost taxpayers almost £500m, and that numbers returning to prison for breaching their licence had ""skyrocketed"". Chief probation inspector Dame Glenys Stacey said the model of part-privatisation was ""irredeemably flawed"". Dame Glenys said she was ""delighted"" about Justice Secretary David Gauke's decision. But Janine McDowell, of Sodexo Justice Services in the UK & Ireland, claimed it would ""increase cost and risk"".

Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent The decision to renationalise offender supervision will be seen as an admission by the government that Chris Grayling's flagship reforms have failed. He went ahead in 2014 despite numerous warnings about the considerable risks of splitting probation services between different providers and introducing a method of payment-by-results. Probation unions and criminal justice experts urged him to at least pilot the new approach, so problems could be identified and rectified. But Mr Grayling went for quick, wholesale change. He wanted the contracts with the private companies firmly in place before the 2015 general election so the system couldn't be undone if there was a change of government. However, inspection after inspection signalled serious problems, with the nail in the coffin being Dame Glenys Stacey's report in March.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-41920794,Carl Sargeant's death: The emails,The family of Carl Sargeant have released correspondence sent between the former minister's solicitors and Labour before his death.,8 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The family of Carl Sargeant have released correspondence sent between the former minister's solicitors and the Labour Party before his death.  It constitutes both an email, with attached letter, sent to Labour from Mr Sargeant's solicitors on Monday this week, and an email sent by Labour to the solicitors on the day Mr Sargeant was sacked. What follows is the bulk of what was released to the media. On 6 November, Mr Sargeant's solicitor Huw Bowden emailed Sam Matthews, head of disputes at the Labour Party in London, at 16:48. He wrote: ""I write further to our telephone conversation on Friday and the letter Carl received by email on Friday to which I provide a letter in response. I would be grateful if you would acknowledge safe receipt. ""The understanding given to Carl and I on Friday was that you would now be dealing with the investigation and indeed a case number and investigations officer had been allocated to the case. To date neither Carl or I have heard from your investigations officer. ""Despite this the First Minister has felt able to conduct interviews with the BBC. In those interviews he has indicated he became 'aware of a number of incidents at the beginning of last week'. He says 'I asked my office to speak to those women involved who had provided detail of those incidents. As a result of those conversations I felt I had no choice but to refer the matter to the party'. ""In the light of the correspondence with Mr Sargeant on Friday this is clearly prejudicing what is allegedly an independent enquiry by your office. ""It would seem that already a large number of people have spoken to the complainant or complainants yet we still have received no disclosure of the complaint or complainants.  ""On Friday the First Minister of Wales advised our client he could not provide details of the complaint or complainants other than that his special advisor Matt Greenough had spoken to the complainant or complainants to verify the complaint."" The email added: ""We would ask that a full and complete log of contact with the witnesses be maintained, that the details of the complaints be disclosed and the content of our letter addressed as a matter of urgency."" The attached letter reads: ""Dear Sam, ""Re: Notice of administrative suspension from holding office or representing the Labour Party (and from the National Assembly Labour Party) ""Further to your telephone conversation with our Mr Bowden and Mr Sargeant on Friday 3rd November, as you are aware we have been formally instructed by Mr Sargeant in relation to the administrative decision to suspend him from the Labour Party and the National Assembly Party. ""We understand a decision was taken initially by the First Minister of Wales Mr Carwyn Jones on Friday 3rd November 2017 to dismiss him from his job as cabinet secretary. Mr Sargeant then received an email from Louise Magee, General Secretary of the Welsh Labour Party at 14.40 enclosing a letter from you dated 3rd November 2017. It is to this letter that we respond on his behalf. We also refer to the telephone conversation with Mr Sargeant and our Mr Bowden on 3rd November 2017 as referred to above and your email to Mr Sargeant and Mr Bowden received at 16.36 on 3rd November 2017. ""We would make it clear at the outset that our client categorically denies any allegation that he has acted in a manner that is either prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party. We are led to believe the allegations concern conduct that you described as our client having acted towards others in such a way as alleged to be 'unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping'. We make it clear that any such allegations are categorically denied. ""We would request immediate details as to the nature of the allegations that have been made against our client to enable him both to defend himself and to be satisfied as to the legitimacy and transparency of the procedure conducted upon receipt of the complaint. ""We would request information surrounding when, by whom and in what circumstances, were the complaint or complaints received. Was there one or more complaint? Were the complaints all received at the same time or on separate occasions and if so when? ""We also request details as to who received the complain on behalf of the Labour Party and how the complaint was dealt with upon its receipt. Was there an immediate investigation of those complaints and if so what was the outcome of that investigation? ""Upon review of the timescale for the progress of your investigation, the laying of charges and any hearing, we are gravely concerned that further delay will severely prejudice him. There will clearly be time needed to speak to witnesses of fact. In these circumstances we would require an urgent response to the above mentioned questioned raised. At the very least we would request the details of the names of the complainants and the dates, places and times that the allegations took place. ""When you spoke to our Mr Bowden on 3rd November you confirmed you were not aware of any parallel investigations being undertaken or having been contemplated. You confirmed that if you became aware of such parallel investigations then your investigation would be postponed then your investigation would be postponed and we would be notified immediately. ""With regard to the future progress of this case and the anticipated hearing, you mentioned a date of 16th January 2018. We would request the receipt of any charge and case papers at the earliest opportunity. We appreciate the papers should be received by Mr Sargeant no later than 6 weeks before the hearing (5th December 2017) however as the delay caused already has the potential to seriously prejudice our client we would ask for any papers to be forward to him as soon as possible. ""We are sure you appreciate the anxiety and distress being caused to our client particularly as he is yet to receive any details of the allegations that have led to the decisions taken to date by the First Minister of Wales, the Labour Party in Wales and the Labour Party head office. There is the potential requirement to interview a number of witnesses of fact and with the Christmas period intervening and the ongoing delay is both prejudicial to the preparation of our clients case but also to his physical and mental wellbeing. ""With regard to the potential hearing on 16th January 2018 we reserve the right to seek separate hearings if the allegations are separated in fact and time. We would also put you on notice that our client will be represented by solicitor and counsel at the hearing. ""Finally we seek clarification in relation to our client's legal costs. We would be grateful if you would confirm by return the liability of The Labour Party in that regard. Clearly our client faces serious and career threatening allegations. He maintains his innocence and indeed to date is unaware of the allegations made. As a committed member of the Labour Party he is anxious to ensure his name and the reputation of the Labour Party is preserved and as such he needs to be able to properly defend himself and accordingly we would seek confirmation that his reasonable legal fees will be covered.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47472902,Tory councillors quit in Islamophobia row,The two representatives were accused of sharing offensive Facebook posts about Labour's Sadiq Khan.,6 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Two Tory councillors have quit after being accused of sharing Islamophobic posts on social media. Len Milner and Chris Smith, who sit on East Staffordshire council, ""liked"" a cartoon posted on Facebook depicting a mock beheading of Labour's Sadiq Khan. Mr Milner said he had been cleared of wrongdoing by the council but had quit to avoid upsetting the party.  It comes amid claims that the party has ""buried its head in the sand"" over the extent of Islamophobia in its ranks.  Ex-Tory chairwoman Baroness Warsi has claimed senior officials ignored her warnings about the prevalence of anti-Muslim prejudice and Theresa May had failed to get to grips with the issue.  She widened her attack on senior figures on Tuesday, accusing Home Secretary Sajid Javid of ""dog whistle"" politics for comments he had made about grooming of young girls by young Muslim men.  ""I've called out Sajid on at least three occasions now on the language that he has used to deal with some very important technical and legal issues,"" she told BBC Politics Live. ""I've told Sajid very clearly that he is better than this."" The Conservatives say they have taken swift action when told about Islamophobic activity. On Monday, 14 Tory members were suspended for allegedly liking offensive comments posted on a Facebook group. In East Staffordshire, the two members of the party, including the current Mayor Chris Smith, have resigned amid claims they endorsed Islamophobic posts.  The posts appear to have been deleted from their respective Facebook accounts.  But Labour members on the council said one featured a meme of the Muslim mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, being beheaded while being knighted.  Members of the Labour group walked out of a council meeting on Monday ""in solidarity"" with Muslim colleagues and to ""stand up to racism"".  Mr Milner quit after being suspended by the party although he insisted his decision had nothing to do with the Conservatives beginning an internal investigation.  The East Staffordshire Conservative Association confirmed that Mr Smith had also resigned. ""We are a proudly anti-racist association and will not tolerate any form of prejudice including Islamophobia or anti-Semitism,"" its treasurer Aaron Bell said.  Mr Milner said the police had examined his Twitter history and told him ""there is nothing that gives any cause for concern and nothing that indicated right wing tendencies or affiliations"". East Staffordshire Council said its decision not to take action against Mr Milner did not mean that it had ""exonerated"" him. It said its investigation had concluded the tweets ""were not unlawful and while it is the case that people may disagree with the contents of his posts, or even be offended by them, that would not be sufficient to interfere with his right to freedom of expression"".  Meanwhile, a Conservative councillor in Kent has apologised for re-tweeting a message hailing the former English Defence Leader Tommy Robinson as a ""patriot"". Andrew Bowles, who has led Swale Borough Council for 16 years, was suspended after appearing to back a message criticising Facebook's decision to ban the anti-Islamic activist from its pages. The message contained a doctored image of the movie The Patriot featuring Mr Robinson's face superimposed on the body of the main character, played in the film by Mel Gibson. It said Mr Robinson's Facebook ban was due to him being ""racist to Muslims"", arguing that this was a ""disgraceful injustice"" and ""this corruptness needs to stop"". Mr Bowles said he had not meant to endorse Mr Robinson's ""racist and intolerant views"" which he found abhorrent. Instead, he wanted to make the point that ""silencing"" him risked turning him into a martyr.  He said he would attend a training course on acceptable social media conduct. Facebook removed Mr Robinson's official page and Instagram profile last month, saying its contents violated its policies on hate speech and the social network's community standards.  Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi said anyone engaging in Islamophobic activity or any kind of bigotry had no future in the party.  But he told BBC Radio 4's World at One he did not agree with Baroness Warsi it was an institutional problem. ""The Conservative Party has demonstrated that it deals with these things robustly,"" he said.  ""I would remind the country that what we do with a Muslim in the Conservative Party is make him home secretary."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55349800,Labour publishes plan to rid party of anti-Semitism,The plan is the party's official response to a highly critical report from the equalities watchdog.,17 Dec 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour has published a new plan for handling anti-Semitism in the party. It is a response to a highly critical report from the equalities watchdog, which found the party under its previous leadership had broken the law when handling anti-Semitism claims. The plan has been approved by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. It commits Labour to establishing an independent complaints process and addressing the backlog of anti-Semitism cases. Complaints of anti-Semitism dogged the party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. Following the publication of the EHRC's report, Mr Corbyn was briefly suspended from the party. He was later re-admitted but denied the parliamentary whip. In a foreword to the new plan, the party's now leader and deputy leader, Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, said tackling anti-Semitism was ""our number one priority"". The EHRC report was ""incredibly difficult reading for everyone who loves our party and wants it be a force for good"", the pair wrote.  ""But its findings were clear and stark: the Labour Party breached the Equality Act in terms of unlawful harassment and indirect discrimination towards our Jewish members,"" they said, adding that the party must take action. The party had been criticised for allowing political interference by the leader's office in the existing complaints process. The new plan commits the party to hiring external lawyers to advise panel hearings on anti-Semitism complaints. An investigation by the EHRC found evidence of 23 instances of ""inappropriate involvement"" by Mr Corbyn's office out of the 70 files it looked at. The new independents complaints process will handle any complaints of ""anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, sexual harassment and any discrimination based on protected characteristics"". Sir Keir and Ms Rayner said they would ""not hesitate to sanction those who breach our rules and regulations."" The plan also includes strengthening social media guidelines and due-diligence checks for prospective Labour candidates. The party will also set up an advisory board of Jewish members and developing educational material on anti-Semitism. This comes after the EHRC found the party had not provided adequate training for those responsible for handling complaints. The Jewish Labour Movement, one of the party's affiliate groups, said many of the plan's steps are ""those the JLM has been asking the party to implement for years"". In a statement on Twitter, the group said it was disappointed that it took the intervention of the EHRC to secure the publication of the plan, but added it was ""pleased that we now have a new leadership committed to act"". The statement concluded: ""While we welcome the reform of processes, by itself it is not enough. Recent events have shown a toxic culture persists in many parts of the party. Solving this is as essential as introducing an independent disciplinary process."" The campaign group Labour Against Anti-Semitism said the plan ""provides a good framework for tackling institutional anti-Jewish racism within the organisation."" But it called for the new process to be used in a ""full review"" of all historic reports of anti-Semitism since 2015, when Mr Corbyn became leader. ""Ultimately, the value of this plan will be measured by its effectiveness in driving all those who voice, promote and amplify anti-Semitic views out of the Labour Party. That objective is still, unfortunately, a long way from being met,"" it added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47822227,Paint-by-numbers inventor dies at 93,Dan Robbins' idea for DIY pictures inspired a generation of American hobbyists.,5 Apr 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Dan Robbins, the artist behind the paint-by-numbers craze that swept America, has died in Sylvania, Ohio, at the age of 93, his son told the AP news agency. He was working at a paint products firm in the 1940s when he invented the kits.  By the 1950s millions were being sold across the US every year. His inspiration for the idea came from Leonardo da Vinci, who used a similar method when teaching his apprentices how to paint. Mr Robbins first joined Palmer Paint, a company selling children's paint sets, after serving in World War Two.  In a post-war era of increasing leisure time, the company's owner, Max Klein, asked Mr Robbins to find a way to market the paint to adults.  ""I remembered hearing that Leonardo used numbered background patterns for his students and apprentices, and I decided to try something like that,"" Mr Robbins told an audience at the Chicago gallery Intuit in 2004.  He put together an abstract still life, a mix of ""Picasso, some Bracque and some Robbins"". Mr Klein told him he hated the painting but liked the idea of painting by numbers.  The kits, which contained canvasses with printed numbers corresponding to numbered paints, brushes and a palette, originally cost $2.50 (£2). The paintings ranged from landscapes to bullfighters, ballerinas to kittens. The company's most popular work was The Last Supper.  In 2013, Mr Robbins was asked if paint-by-numbers counted as art. ""No, it's only the experience of picking up a brush,"" he said. The aim, he added, was to recreate what a real artist goes through. Sales took off in the 1950s, reaching $20m (£15m) in 1955. But other brands soon caught on to the craze and the market became saturated. By 1957, sales were significantly down and Mr Klein was forced to sell up.  Mr Robbins stayed on when the company was bought out by General Mills, later moving to a Chicago cake decorations manufacturer. He retired in 1973 and started painting on a freelance basis.  A collection of paint-by-number artworks were exhibited at the prestigious Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in 2001."

Ryan Houghton - a candidate in the Aberdeen North constituency - confirmed his suspension on Monday after The National published the allegations. He has apologised for any hurt caused but insisted the comments were taken out of context. The Scottish Conservatives said the blog comments were ""unacceptable"". Mr Houghton remains a candidate but the Conservatives have withdrawn their support for his campaign while an investigation takes place. The National listed a number of posts, including one where he argued that while there was ""no credible evidence to suggest the Holocaust did not happen"" he went on to say: ""I do find some of the events fabricated."" Mr Houghton was also quoted as saying he did not see how homosexuality was good for the human race. In other alleged comments he said Islam's core teachings had the goal of ""world domination"" and that some Muslims had big families with the aim of creating ""Eurabia"". He released a statement on his Twitter feed, saying the comments were taken ""out of context"" and insisted he had never held anti-Semitic, racist or homophobic views.  Mr Houghton said: ""At the age of 20 on an online forum, I took part in a range of political discussions. These included terrorism, LGBT rights and anti-Semitism."" He said that in one of the threads he had discussed freedom of speech and he had discussed comments made by Holocaust denier David Irving. He said he made clear in subsequent posts that he was not defending the views and strongly opposed Holocaust denial. The candidate added: ""I apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish community in Aberdeen."" A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ""The comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result.  ""The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North.  ""The Scottish Conservatives deplore all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism."" It comes just a week Labour candidate Kate Ramsden quit in Aberdeenshire following a row over anti-Semitism.  She stood down in the Gordon constituency after the Jewish Chronicle highlighted a blog in which she compared Israel to an abused child who becomes an abusive adult. Another Scottish Labour candidate, Frances Hoole, was also been dropped over a social media post attacking her SNP opponent."

Darwin Martinez Torres, 25, assaulted Nabra Hassanen on 18 June 2017 in Sterling, about 30 miles (48km) west of Washington DC. Torres admitted all eight counts in a plea deal that will spare him the possibility of the death penalty. Investigators said they found no evidence it was a hate crime. Nabra and her friends were walking back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) mosque after a pre-dawn, fast-food meal when Torres pulled over in what police described as a road rage incident. The construction worker drove at the group, ramming his car into the curb.  He followed the group in his car as they ran into a parking lot before jumping out wielding a baseball bat. He attacked Nabra and pulled her into his car. Police said they found Torres hours later, circling the area with blood stains in his vehicle. He eventually confessed and led police to where he dumped her body in a pond in Loudoun County, Virginia. Nabra died of blunt force trauma, according to a medical examiner. ADAMS Center spokeswoman Hurunnessa Fariad said in a statement emailed to the BBC: ""We are confident that justice will be served for Nabra and her family.""  ""We pray that the sentencing of Mr Torres will bring peace and closure to the family and friends of Nabra Hassanen and allow for them to heal with loving memories of a smiling and gracious young lady."" Nabra's death sparked widespread concerns over the safety of Muslim Americans. Her parents told US media they were certain Nabra was targeted because of her faith, but investigators said the incident was not a hate crime.  Across the country, hundreds joined vigils in her honour. As Torres entered the packed court for a preliminary hearing last October, Nabra's mother threw a shoe at the defendant, and her father lunged at him, shouting: ""You killed my daughter!""   NBC News reported that Torres showed no reaction. He will now be sentenced to life in prison. His defence team had argued he is intellectually disabled with a low IQ. Originally from El Salvador, US media report he is suspected of being in the country illegally."

Hisham Muhammad, of Victoria Avenue, Bury, is accused of planning both a ""lone-wolf attack"" and a drone attack. The 26-year-old told the Old Bailey he had ""long held the suspicion"" the group was ""misrepresented or exaggerated in order to increase Islamophobia"". He denies engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism. His cousin Faisal Abu Ahmad, 25, denies failing to alert authorities of the alleged attack plan. In a defence statement read to the court, Mr Muhammad said he had watched extremist videos as research because he had ""long held the suspicion as a devout Muslim that much of the material about Islamic State is misrepresented or exaggerated in order to increase Islamophobia"". He said that was ""especially"" the case in countries like the UK ""where there is a desire to restrict Muslim immigration"". He told the jury ""a lot more research"" needed to be done into the group, adding: ""I don't believe it exists... I believe it was created by America to take away the rights of Muslims."" Mr Muhammad watched dozens of videos ""umpteen times"", which contained ""nothing nice"", prosecutor Anne Whyte QC said. She said of one that it was not a film of ""civilians harmlessly praising their god"", but of ""jihadis speaking of holy war"". Responding to a song he watched, which had the lyrics ""by the knife of horror we cut their necks"", Mr Muhammad said he did not support the violence, but ""liked the tune"" and listened to other music which featured violent lyrics. ""The point I am trying to make is that I listen to gangster rap, but I don't support it,"" he said. Jurors were also told he had searched terms including ""armed police Manchester"", ""suicide belt"", ""Isis"", ""machete"" and ""Manchester Victoria Station"" in May 2018, shortly before the first anniversary of the terror attack in the foyer of Manchester Arena, which stands adjacent to the station. He said he had had a job interview near the station and told Ms Whyte he could not remember if the interview was arranged after the searches. He added that the other search terms were down to his ""interest in weapons"". He had ""always had an interest in this stuff"", he said, before stating he had ""never heard of a suicide belt before, that's why I researched it"". The case continues.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-48187786,Viggo Mortensen rejects 'neo-fascist' Vox,The Spanish political party had tweeted an image of Mortensen playing Aragorn in Lord of the Rings,7 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Viggo Mortensen has denounced far right Spanish political party Vox after it tweeted a meme featuring the actor playing Aragorn in Lord of the Rings. The meme, shared by the nationalist party's official Twitter account in April, showed Aragorn lining up to face off against the assembled hordes of Vox's apparent enemies, including the media, Catalan separatists and a small ghost wearing the colours of the rainbow flag typically used to represent LGBT pride. ""Let the battle begin,"" the party tweeted. In a letter to the editor of Spanish newspaper El Pais, published on Tuesday, Mortensen said Vox's use of his image was ""absurd"". ""Not only is it absurd that I, the actor who embodied this character for [Lord of the Rings director] Peter Jackson, and a person interested in the rich variety of cultures and languages that exist in Spain and the world, is linked to an ultra-nationalist and neo-fascist political party,"" the actor wrote, ""it is even more ridiculous to use the character of Aragorn, a polyglot statesman who advocates knowledge and inclusion of the diverse races, customs and languages of Middle Earth, to legitimise an anti-immigrant, anti-feminist and Islamophobic political group. ""We must be attentive and proactive, like Aragorn in the Tolkien saga."" The letter's publication has drawn a significant reaction online. Both the name of the actor and his most famous character have been used widely on Twitter. Many of those to comment supported the actor's stance, while others pointed to Vox's electoral success as proof of its popular appeal. Vox won 24 seats in April's general election promising to ""make Spain great again"". The party opposes multiculturalism, unrestricted migration and what it calls ""radical feminism"". It rejects the far-right label, but its policies on immigration and Islam place it in line with other far-right and populist parties in Europe. The party's success marks the first time a far right party has won seats in the Spanish parliament in almost 40 years. In the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, based on J.R.R. Tolkien's books of the same name, Mortensen plays Aragorn, a ranger in love with an elf. One part of the fellowship which sets off to save Middle Earth from the evil Sauron, his companions include hobbits, a man, an elf, a dwarf and a wizard. Warner Bros, the studio which made the film series, confirmed in April that it had not given permission for its intellectual property to be used by Vox. ""We know that the Lord of the Rings has many fans,"" the studio tweeted in Spanish. ""But Warner Bros has not authorised the use of our intellectual property for any political campaign."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-59312289,‘Racist abuse made my son ask to be painted white’,"A family was forced to move from their home, schools and jobs by their neighbours' harassment.",7 Dec 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A family has described suffering years of racist abuse from neighbours that led to their son asking if he could be painted white. The couple and their two children were forced to move from their home, schools and jobs, even fearing their house would be burned down. Their neighbours were fined but the abuse continued, with racist graffiti left outside the family's home. They have now been moved by Sovereign Housing, which has not commented. The family, who live in the south of England, said they were still targeted even after a restraining order was taken out against their neighbours.  Because the family wanted to remain anonymous, the BBC worked with Southampton Solent University to create an animation voiced by actors, allowing them to discuss the abuse in their own words. The father said: ""The only time it's really affected me, I was in the bath, just lying in the bath and my son was there playing with the bubbles in the bath. ""And he said: 'Dad, why don't we get that paint that's left over from the house and we just paint me, you' and his older brother.  ""'We paint ourselves all white and then we don't have any problems.' ""And that's the time I can honestly say in my life that has actually drawn tears to my eyes.""   He said the abuse first started in September 2017, but it was only in the summer of 2020 they were finally moved by their housing association. The man said: ""[It was] totally out of the blue. We pulled up outside our house, started ushering the children inside. I heard someone shout 'weirdo'.  ""I looked and there was this chap, one of our neighbours, just standing opposite, hailing abuse at us. ""And then they came closer and closer. They teamed up and shouted more racial abuse."" The family reported the abuse to the police, and their neighbours were summoned to court. A woman admitted a racial public order offence and was issued with a £200 fine in November 2017, while a man admitted the same charge in January 2018. He was also fined £200.  A civil case was taken against them by Sovereign Housing, which owns housing across the south and west of England.  It was triggered after a member of its staff was shocked by threats of violence against the family.  But the family said the abuse continued - and that no further action was taken.  The father said: ""They shouted: 'We'll get you, we'll burn you up in your house.' ""I had a bucket, ready to fill up with water if need be, because I was worried that these people were going to set fire to us while we were in our house.""  The police force that dealt with the reports of the racial abuse said officers had spoken to an independent witness within 48 hours of the first report.   A spokesperson said: ""We know that hate crimes have a disproportionate impact on victims, their families and the wider community.  ""We want our residents to know that we take all reports of hate crime very seriously and that there is support available for them.""  Prosecutors said they asked the court for sentence uplifts for the abusers, and they received an increased fine to reflect the racist nature of their offending.  A CPS spokesperson said: ""We recognise that the victims in this case will have suffered greatly from being racially abused by their neighbours.  ""No one should have to live in fear of being a victim of crime, and it is clear they have had to endure incredibly offensive language directed at them. ""The defendants were prosecuted in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors for using racially offensive language.  ""The CPS secured guilty pleas from both defendants, which meant that the victims did not have to give evidence at a trial.""  Sovereign Housing has been approached for a comment.

Apsana Begum, 31, who represents the constituency of Poplar and Limehouse, was accused of three counts of making dishonest applications for council homes to Tower Hamlets Council.  She told Snaresbrook Crown Court her ""controlling"" husband was in charge of her finances and she was ""shocked"" to discover the paperwork was in her name. Ms Begum said the accusations had been ""driven by malicious intent"". The Labour MP collapsed and wept in the dock after the verdicts were returned. In a statement, Ms Begum said the trial ""caused me great distress and damage to my reputation"". She said: ""As a survivor of domestic abuse facing these vexatious charges, the last 18 months of false accusations, online sexist, racist and Islamophobic abuse, and threats to my safety have been exceedingly difficult."" Ms Begum said she would be ""consulting and considering"" on how to ensure ""something like this does not happen again to anyone else"".  The court heard Ms Begum, who won her seat in the 2019 general election, had applied to go on the council's social housing register on 22 July 2011. Her charges related to separate periods between 18 January and 21 May 2013, 21 May 2013 and 23 March 2014, and 28 October 2015 and 21 March 2016.  Ms Begum was alleged to have attempted to gain social housing in the first period by claiming she lived in an overcrowded three-bedroom house, making her a higher priority in the social housing queue. However, according to a social housing application made in 2009 by Ms Begum's aunt, the house had four bedrooms. Ms Begum maintained there had only ever been three bedrooms in the house and that she had never had her own bedroom while living there. She could not explain why her family members had said there were four bedrooms. She later moved into a different property with her then-partner Ehtashamul Haque without informing the council, where she lived for more than two years. Ms Begum claims Mr Haque was ""controlling and coercive"" and took over her finances. During this period, bids for housing were made in Ms Begum's name. She denied making the bids. ""I'm shocked to see these records,"" she told the court. Jurors found Ms Begum not guilty of all charges after the judge gave a majority direction."

Leigh Trust said it was suspending the No Outsiders programme until an agreement with parents was reached. Earlier this month the city's Parkfield Community School suspended the lessons after protests were held.  Campaigner Amir Ahmed said some Muslims felt ""victimised"" but an LGBT group leader said No Outsiders helped pupils understand it is OK to be different. In a letter seen by the BBC, Leigh Trust said it was halting the lessons until after Ramadan, which finishes in June. The schools involved are Leigh Primary School, Alston Primary School, Marlborough Junior and Infants School and Wyndcliff Primary School.  Leigh Trust - which is yet to comment publicly - said it wanted to discuss the programme with parents to find ""a positive way"" of teaching about the Equalities Act. Some parents at Parkfield, and the other four schools, claim the classes are inappropriate for young children and the schools' LGBT message contradicts Islam. The No Outsiders project was created and piloted at Parkfield in 2014 by assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat, who was made an MBE for services to equality and diversity in education in 2017. Ofsted has deemed the lessons as ""age-appropriate"". Mr Ahmed, one of the leaders of the Parkfield protests, said he had seen a presentation about the programme that was to be shown to the government as part of the school's Prevent strategy - which is aimed at reducing radicalisation. ""I think that's outrageous,"" he said. ""It's quite disgusting that the school has presented our children as potential radicals."" A spokesperson for Parkfield Community School said: ""The powerpoint was written four years ago in line with Prevent duty at that time.  ""No Outsiders is all about tolerance, accepting difference and respect, which are all key aspects of community cohesion and our fundamental British values."" Mr Ahmed said his community was ""respectful and tolerant"" of British values but now felt victimised. He claimed parents who had protested were ""effectively seen as homophobes in the wider community"". ""Fundamentally the issue we have with No Outsiders is that it is changing our children's moral position on family values on sexuality and we are a traditional community. ""Morally we do not accept homosexuality as a valid sexual relationship to have. It's not about being homophobic... that's like saying, if you don't believe in Islam, you're Islamophobic."" But Khakan Qureshi, a gay Muslim activist who runs Birmingham South Asian LGBT and was invited to visit Parkfield School last week, said he supported the need for the lessons. ""Myself and many others knew from a young age that we were different and we wish we had this sort of education,"" he said. He feels the Muslim community as a whole is not homophobic, but believes a minority within the protesters are ""agitating"". ""The attitudes of the protesters towards the No Outsiders programme is completely homophobic,"" he said. ""No matter how they package it, it still comes across as homophobic."" He said given the existing legislation to stop discrimination, ""I don't understand why certain communities here in the UK are not adhering to those laws"".

Heinz-Christian Strache posted a caricature of a banker with a hooked nose, wearing Star of David cufflinks. Austrian Jewish leader Oskar Deutsch likened it to images used by the Nazis in the 1930s. Mr Strache, who leads the Freedom Party, has denied he was being anti-Semitic. The cartoon was posted on Saturday, accompanied by a comment from Mr Strache decrying ""EU banking speculators"" for taking tax money from Austrians. On Sunday Mr Strache posted a second version, labelled in English. The Star of David emblems had been removed from the banker's cufflinks and the shape of his nose had also been changed. Both images show another figure labelled ""The Government"" pouring a drink for the banker, while a third, poorly clothed and thin figure labelled ""The People"", sits opposite the banker with a bone on his plate. Jewish leader Oskar Deutsch (L) likened the cartoon to Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda ""It is not a coincidence that a caricature of Jews, similar to the ones in 'Der Stuermer' in the 1930s and 1940s, appeared on the Facebook page of Freedom Party leader Mr Strache,"" Mr Deutsch said, referring to a newspaper published by the Nazis. Austrian politicians from both centre-left and conservative parties have condemned the cartoon. The conservative People's Party called on the Freedom Party (FPO) to address ""the incendiary and discriminating tones within the party itself"". A lawyer in Vienna has also said he will sue the FPO for holocaust denial, which is illegal in Austria. Mr Strache and the FPO have frequently faced accusations of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. On Sunday Mr Strache responded to the backlash with a further comment on Facebook saying he did not tolerate anti-Semitism and insisted that he was highlighting his scorn for ""the caste of greedy bankers"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60229869,Patel 'sickened' by Charing Cross police behaviour,The home secretary condemns culture of misogyny and discrimination at Met Police uncovered in a report.,2 Feb 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Home Secretary Priti Patel has said she was ""appalled and sickened"" by the behaviour of Metropolitan Police officers revealed in a report. The officers mainly based at Charing Cross, in London, were found to have joked about rape, killing black children and beating their wives. The Met said it was ""deeply sorry"", after the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) published its findings. But Ms Patel said the force had ""problems"" with its culture. She told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that examples of ""appalling conduct"" by serving officers could not be dismissed as ""one-off"" incidents. Asked if the Met was institutionally misogynist, she said it had ""cultural and attitudinal"" issues, suggesting a ""failure of leadership in some quarters"". But she said she had confidence in Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick to make the changes that were required. Pressed about Ms Dick's future, Ms Patel said she was ""very clear and upfront with the commissioner about the problems… I'm very challenging with the commissioner and I will continue to be so."" Ms Patel did not rule out launching a major inquiry into policing, like the 1999 Macpherson report into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, which labelled the Met ""institutionally racist"". The home secretary said: ""There are no excuses for the appalling behaviour and what we have seen in that IOPC report and it is quite clear there are cultural problems and issues in policing."" But, she added she wanted to ""find out what on earth is going on"" through existing, smaller scale inquiries launched after the murder of Sarah Everard by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, before deciding whether to go further. One probe, led by Dame Elish Angiolini QC, will look at previous criminal and misconduct allegations against Couzens, and whether any red flags were missed when he was vetted. A separate review, led by Baroness Louise Casey, is looking at the culture and standards within the Met Police, and its vetting, recruitment and training procedures. The IOPC launched its investigation in 2018 after an officer allegedly had sex with a vulnerable woman in a room inside a London police station - although this allegation was never proven. In its report, published on Tuesday, the police watchdog identified ""bullying and aggressive behaviour; 'banter' used to excuse oppressive and offensive behaviours; discrimination; toxic masculinity, misogyny and sexual harassment"". ""We believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few 'bad apples',"" the IOPC said in a statement. Evidence uncovered included: Of the 14 officers investigated, two were dismissed for gross misconduct and put on the barred list, preventing future employment with the police. Another two resigned and several others faced disciplinary action, the IOPC said. Nine are still serving with the force, while another is working as a contractor in a staff role. In Parliament on Wednesday, MPs expressed disgust at the findings of the IOPC report, which Home Office Minister Kit Malthouse said described ""abhorrent behaviour"" that ""shamed"" the Met Police. Conservative MP Matthew Offord, who called for the urgent question, criticised the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.  ""We need leadership on keeping London safe and that is not happening,"" Mr Offord said. Mr Khan has said he was ""utterly disgusted"" by the findings, adding: ""Anyone found to be responsible for sexism, racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, bullying or harassment does not deserve to wear the Met uniform and must be rooted out."" In a statement, the Met said: ""We are deeply sorry to Londoners and everyone they have failed with their appalling conduct and acknowledge how this will damage the trust and confidence of many in the Met. ""Since this reprehensible behaviour was uncovered in 2017 we have taken a series of measures to hold those responsible to account and stamp out unacceptable behaviour."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-56537585,Watchdog warns against naming prophet row teacher,"Making a teacher fear for their safety is ""unacceptable"", the equality commission chair says.",27 Mar 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Sharing the identity of a teacher who showed pupils an ""offensive"" cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad could result in police action, a watchdog has warned. Protests were held outside Batley Grammar School, where the staff member was suspended after complaints. Baroness Kishwer Falkner said making a teacher fear for their safety was ""simply unacceptable"".  The Equality and Human Rights Commission chair said the school ""ought to be trusted"" to take action. ""A teacher's identity being shared, making them fear for their safety, is simply unacceptable and could result in enforcement action from the police,"" she said. Gary Kibble, head teacher of the West Yorkshire school, said the teacher had ""given their most sincere apologies"" for the caricature being shown and said an investigation had begun. Demonstrators, who first gathered outside the grounds on Thursday morning, staged a second protest on Friday but had moved on by mid-afternoon. Some had demanded the teacher's sacking and accused staff of failing to take the issue seriously. Baroness Falkner said children's education ""should not be disrupted by protests in what has already been a difficult year"". ""Schools are places where children learn about ideas, values, difference and respect.  ""This sometimes involves exposing them to contentious issues and different views and ideas."" ""For schools to meet their legal duty to foster good relations between people from different groups, this should be done in a balanced, respectful and sensitive way."" Speaking on Friday morning, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick called for the ""deeply unsettling"" scenes outside the school to ""come to an end"". He defended the right of teachers to ""appropriately"" show images of the Prophet Muhammed and said ""no-one should be feeling intimidated or threatened as they go into school"". A petition calling for the teacher to be reinstated has received more than 10,000 signatures. Dr Shazad Amin, deputy chair of MEND, which helps Muslims engage with British media and politics, said its Islamophobia Response Unit had been helping several parents liaise with the school. He said he saw ""no problem"" with blasphemy being discussed at the school but said the particular image shown to pupils was ""deeply offensive"" and ""furthered stereotypes and anti-Islamic tropes"". As a result, he said, people in the local community had ""a right to feel hurt and a right to feel angry"" but called for them to allow the matter to be properly investigated. He said parents were ""fairly positive"" about the action taken so far by the school. Former Conservative Party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the debate had been hijacked by ""extremists on both sides"" to fuel a ""culture war"" at the expense of ""kids and their learning"".   Labour MP for Batley and Spen, Tracey Brabin, condemned those who ""seek to fan the flames of this incident"", and said she welcomed the school's apology. West Yorkshire Police said no arrests had been made and officers remained at the school.  Parts of the Koran are taken to mean that neither Allah nor Muhammad can be captured in an image by human hand and any attempt to do so is seen as an insult. Kirklees Council said Batley Grammar is an academy school so the authority only has a ""very limited role"" in its running, but it praised staff for taking ""swift action"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54678826,French anger over Turkey's 'rude' Macron comments,"France recalls its ambassador after President Erdogan suggests French leader needs ""mental check"".",25 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"France has recalled its ambassador to Turkey for consultations after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insulted his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. He said Mr Macron needed a mental health check for pledging to defend secular values and fight radical Islam. Mr Macron has spoken out forcefully on these issues after a French teacher was murdered for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class. France ""will not give up our cartoons"", he said earlier this week. Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslims because Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God). But state secularism - or laïcité - is central to France's national identity. Curbing freedom of expression to protect the feelings of one particular community, the state says, undermines the country's unity. Responding to Mr Macron's campaign to defend such values - which began before the teacher was murdered - Mr Erdogan asked in a speech: ""What's the problem of the individual called Macron with Islam and with the Muslims?""  He added: ""Macron needs treatment on a mental level. ""What else can be said to a head of state who does not understand freedom of belief and who behaves in this way to millions of people living in his country who are members of a different faith?"" In the wake of the remarks, a French presidential official told AFP news agency that France's ambassador to Turkey was being recalled for consultations, and would be meeting Mr Macron. ""President Erdogan's comments are unacceptable. Excess and rudeness are not a method. We demand that Erdogan change the course of his policy because it is dangerous in every respect,"" the official was quoted as saying. Erodgan is a pious Muslim who has sought to move Islam into Turkey's mainstream politics since his Islamist-rooted AK Party came to power in 2002.  The diplomatic spat is latest issue to strain relations between France and Turkey, who are allies under Nato but disagree on a range of geo-political issues, including the civil wars in Syria and Libya, and the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over disputed Nagorno-Karabakh. Seven people, including two students, have been charged over the beheading of French teacher Samuel Paty on 16 October near Paris. His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack, which took place near Mr Paty's school. In 2015, 12 people were killed in an attack on the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The publication was targeted by extremists for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Earlier this month, Mr Macron described Islam as a religion ""in crisis,"" and announced plans for tougher laws to tackle what he called ""Islamist separatism"" in France. He said a minority of France's estimated six million Muslims were in danger of forming a ""counter-society"". Some in Western Europe's largest Muslim community have accused Mr Macron of trying to repress their religion and say his campaign risks legitimising Islamophobia."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48723274,The Left Behind: TV drama unmasks the far right,The increase in hate crimes in the UK is the focus of a new film.,10 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The makers of a BBC docudrama about the rise of far-right movements in the UK believe it's largely driven by a growing sense of ""hopelessness"" in some sections of society. The Left Behind, produced by the Bafta-winning team behind Killed By My Debt, tells the story of a young Welsh man with no job security, housing or hope, who is drawn into committing an  Islamophobic hate crime. The docudrama draws on the research of Professor Hilary Pilkington, who spent time with the English Defence League (EDL) for her book Loud and Proud. It notes that in 2018 there was a 36% increase in the number of far-right extremists referred to the UK government's counter-terrorism programme, Prevent. It also details that there were 94,098 hate crimes in England and Wales that year - an increase of 123% in five years. Director Joseph Bullman believes lead character, Gethin - portrayed by Sion Daniel Young - is a victim of a broken system and representative of some British people living insecure lives. ""People live in structural conditions where these kinds of opinions are being bred,"" says the director, at a Q&A following the film's London premiere. ""Anyone who has grown up in a working class community will know that the vast overwhelming majority of  people love their families and just want to get on and make decent lives for their kids, but there are a minority who are being attracted to these perspectives because people are genuinely hopeless and I think that hopelessness is the thing that is driving this."" He adds: ""Most of those people, when you read the studies, live ultra-insecure lives in ultra-low wage jobs and they can't have a narrative for their lives. They feel humiliated, excluded and left behind and they've reached very wrong conclusions about migrants. We've just stopped listening to them - and it hasn't worked."" Bullman claims the map of the concentration of support for such movements closely mirrors a map of ""Britain's post-industrial towns and cities"".  It is, he adds, poor working class communities with ""real grievances"" about employment, housing and social care, that are increasingly turning to extremism. ""There aren't that many far-right groups in Hampstead and Richmond-upon-Thames,"" he says. Responding to the film-maker's comments, a government spokesperson tells the BBC the reasons for people becoming ""radicalised"" are more complex than that, and in running the Prevent programme they are doing what they can to stop it. ""Government and academic research has consistently indicated that there is no single socio-demographic profile of a terrorist in the UK,"" they say, ""and no single pathway leading to involvement in terrorism."" The strategy, the spokesperson adds, is about ""safeguarding vulnerable people from all walks of life who are at risk of radicalisation,"" and constitutes ""a comprehensive approach to tackling all forms of extremism, including the far right"". ""We will not tolerate any group or individual that spreads hate by demonising those of other faiths or ethnicities or stokes fear within our communities."" Bullman approached Welsh playwright Alan Harris (Sugar Baby, How My Light is Spent), to come up with the script for The Left Behind. The story is based loosely around the Ely estate in Cardiff and Bullman says they tried to cast actors who ""felt authentic"" and had ""some sense of the communities we were talking about"".  This led Young, who lived locally, to turn down another guaranteed film part and to write Bullman a letter asking to be considered for the lead role. ""You don't get that many stories of this weight and magnitude set in a world that I know,"" says Young, whose character's dad is also homeless and living on the streets. Writer Harris says for him the most memorable scene involves Gethin and his increasingly radical friends, with a group of desperate constituents (played by supporting artists) ""ripping shreds"" off their local councillor. In researching the film, Harris stumbled upon the chilling phrase and refrain ""don't become a ghost,"" which is used as a recurring motif. ""There are a lot of people in this country who feel as though they really don't matter,"" he explains, ""as if they are see-through. ""They are as effective as ghosts and that's a proper worry for people, you become kind of nothing really."" The factual drama begins with Gethin's gang attacking a halal butchers, while wearing pig masks, and then works backwards to attempt to understand their motives. Immigration has been a key talking point in British politics in recent history and will continue to be as Brexit plays out. Executive producer Aysha Rafaele stresses the importance of bringing these difficult images to the screen. ""The big divide in the country at the moment is really between what the effects of globalisation are,"" she says. ""Editorially we all know what we're trying to do with a film like this, where you are going to be accused of giving people a platform. Wouldn't it be better to just bury it? As a British Pakistan Muslim the answer is no, we should not be burying it. It is our responsibility as film-makers to allow voices you don't ordinarily hear."" The best thing policy makers can do, Rafaele says, is listen to the grievances of local communities in the UK, as that is ""the only way British Muslims are going to become safe"". ""Immigration and anti-immigrant sentiment actually embodies so many other things - it's about the boarded-up high street, it's about the fact industry in the area has shut down, it's about the fact the jobs people are doing are precarious. ""Austerity is a political choice not an inevitably, and the impact of globalisation is also a choice.""   The Left Behind is available now on BBC Three online and also airs on Wednesday on BBC One at 22:35 BST and on BBC One Wales at 21:00.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53418762,'Our neighbours made us Covid-19 pariahs',"As the virus spreads across India, so do fear and stigma attached to the disease.",20 Jul 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Last week, a bedridden retiree living with his wife in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) began feeling feverish with a bit of tightness in his chest - tell-tale signs of Covid-19. Satya Deo Prasad, 68, had possibly picked up the infection from his visits to a local hospital to get dialysis for his failing kidneys.  His daughter, based some 1,900km (1,180 miles) away in the western city of Pune, called a Kolkata helpline for an ambulance to pick her father up and take him to the hospital. After three hours, an ambulance arrived. It carried no attendant and the driver parked it some distance away from Mr Deo's house and refused to go any further. Over the telephone, Alka Prasad begged the driver to pick her father up from the house, telling him that her 62-year-old mother was in no state to bring him to the vehicle. But to no avail. ""I am not going to touch a Covid 'body',"" the driver, who was in protective gear, said flatly. ""He will have to come out and walk into the ambulance."" The panic-stricken daughter called the helpline again, which sent another ambulance with volunteers and picked up Mr Deo later that evening.  ""It took a full day to take him to hospital. Stigma attached to the disease was the primary reason,"" Ms Prasad told me. With more than one million reported infections, India has the world's third-largest case load of Covid-19. As the virus spreads, so do fear and stigma, inflicting the rich and the poor, and pervading cities and villages.   ""Fear and stigma have devoured us,"" says M Mitra, a Kolkata-based homemaker whose father had tested positive for the disease.  At the receiving end of the stigma are people who have been infected and recovered from the disease, health workers and doctors. The United Nations says ""fears, rumours and stigma"" are key challenges accompanying Covid-19 globally. In India, social stigma around the disease has led to people being labelled and discriminated against. It has forced people to hide illness, avoid tests and delay hospitalisation, often with fatal consequences. Stigma attached to quarantine has meant that people returning from isolation are often treated as outcasts. In April an incident involving an Indian Islamic organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, caused massive outrage and led to reports of Islamophobia across the country. Such social pressure can have catastrophic consequences. Hours after the death of her husband from Covid-19 in early July, a homemaker in Siliguri in West Bengal picked up her two children, hailed an auto-rickshaw and got off at near the nearest railway track. There, they tried to kill themselves by throwing themselves in front of a moving train, before being rescued by locals. In many parts of their town, authorities had marked houses with Covid-19 patients by putting up bamboo barricades in front. In other parts, they put up signs like ""Danger, Covid ahead"", pointing to houses with patients. ""The virus is like a death sentence for many. They believe if the disease doesn't kill you, the stigma will,"" says Abhijit Chowdhury, a physician who runs Covid Care Network, comprising a group of volunteers and a helpline to tackle stigma. Quarantine stickers outside homes in cities and towns prominently display the name of resident patients. ""Nowhere in the world are such things done. We need a movement against stigmatisation,"" Dr Ambarish Satwik, a Delhi-based surgeon says. A doctor working in a Covid-19 ward in a Mumbai hospital told me bodies were piling up because relatives were refusing to collect them due to fear of contracting the infection. At crematoriums in Delhi, priests have complained that some relatives do not tell them that the deceased had died of Covid-19.  Twenty-six-year-old Amrita Panda learnt about Covid-related social exclusion the hard way after four members of her family were infected in May. Most of them had mild symptoms and were quarantined at home in Howrah, a suburb of Kolkata.  Ms Panda's 82-year-old grandfather, however, developed breathing problems, and had to be taken to a hospital, where he recovered after treatment. ""There were raging rumours in my neighbourhood that my father and grandfather had died of the disease. Neighbours stopped approaching us. We had to let go of our domestic maid because her other employers threatened to sack her for working at our place,"" she told me. Even after the family recovered and completed their quarantine time, neighbours have continued to avoid them. A local bank refused to let Ms Panda's father enter its premises. ""It feels that contracting the disease is a crime. Even when we go out for our chores sometimes, people shout at us and scream, look the Covid people are out and about!"" says Ms Panda. In her upscale high-rise complex in Kolkata, government official Sangeeta Banerjee Barua also faced discrimination after she tested positive after weeks of working at a quarantine centre.  ""I had mild symptoms and recovered at home. But our neighbours who are doctors and engineers and teachers asked us to shut our windows, not come out in the balcony. Neighbours tell us we are high-risk even after recovery. They have made us pariahs,"" she said. In June, Dr Jagadish Hiremath tried to rent an apartment near his 100-bed hospital in the southern city of Bangalore so he could live away from his family while he treated Covid patients. ""I looked at middle class apartments, luxury apartments. No landlord was willing to rent it to me because I was a doctor. They said let the pandemic end first,"" he told me.  The local grocery and milk shop refused to sell to his hospital workers. When an operating room technician boarded a bus to come to work, he was asked to get off, saying the bus didn't allow hospital workers. ""It's basically a cultural problem. The messaging about the disease has been poor. If this continues, we will have nobody left to work in the hospitals,"" Dr Hiremath said. Many believe that screechy, over-the-top coverage of the disease by news networks and feeble communication by the government is responsible for this. The networks are full of ""doomsday stories"" of how the disease kills and graphic visuals of the dead, a survivor complained.  K Sujatha Rao, a former health secretary, believes the stigma is due to fear and lack of trust in the public health system. ""There is no confidence in the government or health system to help people if they get the infection. The fear is of not being able to get treatment due to unaffordability. It is a fear born of an acute sense of helplessness,"" she told me. There could be cultural reasons as well. Esi Thompson, who has studied stigma in the context of Ebola, says local leaders, survivors, and community members had to be engaged as volunteers and advocates to fight stigma.  ""It is of uttermost importance to be sensitive to national, social and cultural norms in communicating any health risk. It is also important to consider how information about new health risks are communicated and interpreted in the light of people's lived realities,"" Dr Thompson, a professor of health risk and communication at Indiana University Bloomington, told me. It is not clear whether any of this is being done effectively in India as yet. ""My fear is that this stigmatisation of Covid-19 will survive the vaccine and the cure,"" says Pradeep Krishnatray, a former director of research and strategic planning, Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs. ""Remember, we still continue to stigmatise leprosy in India""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-48339080,Head teacher threatened over LGBT lessons,"Police are investigating the messages while an MP calls for a protest exclusion zone ""to protect children"".",20 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A head teacher at a primary school giving lessons on LGBT equality has received threatening emails and phone calls. Police are investigating messages sent to Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson at Anderton Park Primary School in Birmingham. There have been seven weeks of protests outside the site from which ""hundreds"" of pupils were kept away on Monday. Birmingham MP Jess Phillips has called for an exclusion zone at the school to limit where people can demonstrate. Ms Hewitt-Clarkson has branded the protests aggressive. The city council is looking into Ms Phillips' request, with the authority's leader saying some outside the school are ""peddling hatred"". The complaints at Anderton Park, mainly from Muslim protesters, focus on lessons for which pupils have been given books featuring cross-dressing children and gay families. The protests' leader says that amounts to ""social engineering"".   Similar teaching has been opposed in letters sent predominantly by conservative Muslims to schools across England, BBC Newsnight reported last week. Ms Hewitt-Clarkson said of the protests: ""There's a whole variety of emotions: embarrassment for lots of our community and our parents who think this is just awful what's happening; frustration that it's going on so long; frustration that great British laws like 'you can protest peacefully' actually are causing us a problem. ""It's interesting what a normal person on the street would think peaceful means and what actually is peaceful outside here."" She described the scene in the Sparkhill area of the city as ""very loud, it's very aggressive, it's tiresome"". Ms Hewitt-Clarkson said she was ""meeting lots of parents"", with a series of 12 meetings set up between now and the end of June. She also denied a claim from some parents that she is Islamophobic, saying she believed in ""equality for everybody"". In England, relationships education will be compulsory for all primary pupils from September 2020.  Shakeel Afsar is the leader of the Anderton Park protests, although he has no children at the school. He said the school had pulled ""the shutters down"" on parental engagement and was promoting LGBT lifestyles to children. He said 600 pupils were kept from school on Monday ""to make it crystal clear we will not have our children indoctrinated or participating in any social engineering programmes which undermine our family values by promoting child sexualisation"". Anderton Park said more than half of the 700-strong student body had attended school. The council has been contacted to confirm attendance figures. Overnight, counter-protesters adorned the site with heart-shaped messages featuring the words ""love is the answer"".  West Midlands Police, which is investigating the threats against Ms Hewitt-Clarkson, said officers were also looking into ""disorder"" outside the school in which eggs were thrown at the counter-protesters. The force said it was investigating three reports of assault and two of criminal damage. Outside the school earlier, Mr Afsar was involved in a stand-up disagreement with Ms Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley. She said protesters could not ""pick and choose"" which equality they could and could not have. Saying the worst thing about the protests was damage ""to the reputation of a peaceful"" community, she called for an exclusion area ""to protect the 700 children in this school"". Ian Ward, leader of Birmingham City Council, said he had asked authority officers to see whether they could use a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) to counter the protests. He said: ""If a PSPO is not appropriate, then we will look at alternative options, because the children and staff at Anderton Park have a right to attend school without this daily disruption. ""It's one thing for parents to ask questions about elements of a school curriculum, it's quite another for others to pounce on the situation as an excuse to peddle hatred and misinformation."" A council spokesperson said PSPO proposals would normally go out to public consultation and, based on response, a decision made by the authority and ""police leads""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43893791,The Labour anti-Semitism row explained,Allegations of anti-Semitism continue to dog the Labour Party. Here's an overview of the row so far.,27 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Jeremy Corbyn has come under fire for not saying he is sorry for anti-Semitism in the Labour Party in a BBC interview. It's something that's been going on for a while now and Mr Corbyn has apologised to Jewish people in the past. But when asked, four times, for an apology this week, Mr Corbyn didn't offer one. He described racism as ""a total poison"" in our society and said he wanted to work with all communities to eliminate it. Mr Corbyn has said this before, and in early November 2019 spoke about suspending members of the Labour party for anti-Semitic activity. To understand the issue, you first have to know two very important definitions. Zionism is a political movement which supports the right of Jewish people to their own homeland in the land of their ancestors - modern-day Israel. There are variations of Zionism - for example, some Zionists believe Israel has a right to some areas of land beyond its territory. Other Zionists disagree. The vast majority of Jewish people are Zionists, though a small minority oppose Zionism, for either religious or political reasons. Non-Jewish people can be Zionists as well. Anti-Zionism can be generally defined as opposition to the existence of the State of Israel. Anti-Semitism, on the other hand, means prejudice against Jewish people and has existed for centuries. The State of Israel was declared in 1948. Since then, in some cases when people have strongly criticised Israel it has been difficult to know whether or not the criticism is motivated by anti-Semitism. This has led to accusations that anti-Zionism - rejection of the Jewish state - is merely a modern form of anti-Semitism. Those who reject this comparison say this argument is used as a tool by Israel's supporters to silence reasonable criticism of Israel by portraying that criticism as racist. Anti-Semitism is not just a problem in the left wing of British politics. In fact, historically, most Jewish people voted for the Labour Party, when it was supportive of the State of Israel. But the party's stance on Israel began to change after the 1967 Middle East war - when Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip came under Israeli occupation. Traditionally the left wing has spoken up for the rights of oppressed minorities in the UK and around the world - and the Labour Party now aligns itself with the Palestinian cause. Palestinians want their own state and face some severe restrictions from Israel. Israel says that, in the absence of any peace settlement, these measures are to protect it from Palestinian violence. By the 1980s, people with strong views on Israel became more prominent within Labour. This contributed to the party developing an association with anti-Zionism, something which had previously been limited to the far-left. This story dates back to 2016, when Mr Corbyn announced an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the Labour Party. The inquiry found that there is an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Speaking to the BBC in April 2018, the chairwoman of the inquiry accepted that her recommendations hadn't fully been implemented by the party.  In July 2018, John Woodcock MP resigned from the Labour Party and a month later, Frank Field MP quit the party's group in Parliament. They both gave anti-Semitism within the party as among their reasons for quitting - although it wasn't the only reason. Then in February 2019, the MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, was the centre of a row within the party when her local branch tried to deselect her. She has been critical of the party's handling of anti-Semitism and has also been the target of abuse online. She was one of seven MPs to quit Labour at that time - although not all of them left due to concerns over anti-Semitism.   Then in May 2019, the Equality and Human Rights Commission launched a formal investigation into the Labour Party over allegations of anti-Semitism. Labour said it would co-operate fully with the watchdog. A party spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle anti-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". The charge against the Labour leader isn't usually that he's anti-Semitic himself - but that he has been too slow to take action to stamp it out. He has insisted time and time again there is no place for anti-Semitism in Labour. The issue flared up again in March 2018, when Luciana Berger shared screenshots which showed a Facebook post from 2012. American graffiti artist Mear One had posted a picture of his street art, which was alleged to have been anti-Semitic and was eventually removed. The allegation was that it promoted a conspiracy of powerful Jewish people controlling and oppressing others. The six men all have exaggerated physical features often used to ridicule and stereotype Jewish people. It emerged that Jeremy Corbyn had commented under the Facebook post, questioning the removal of the wall painting. He has since expressed ""sincere regret"" for not looking more closely at the picture before he commented on it. Labour's former Deputy Leader Tom Watson called it ""a horrible anti-Semitic mural that was rightly taken down"". The artist Mear One denies it was an anti-Semitic piece of work, saying it was about ""class and privilege"". Protests were held at the time against anti-Semitism and the Labour leader met Jewish leaders to address the issue. The leaders claimed Mr Corbyn did not agree to any of the concrete actions they asked for, but he said he was ""committed to rooting out anti-Semitism"". Ever since he became Labour leader in 2015, Jeremy Corbyn has had to oversee a divided party. Some of his allies say that the anti-Semitism row is a plot to undermine his leadership. The seven MPs who quit in 2019 were all well-known critics of Corbyn and have said bullying within the party as well as its handling of Brexit were reasons they split. Some people in the party deny the claim that he has not taken action to solve the problem.  They say that he has now speeded up the complaints system and is doing everything possible to rid the party of the problem. In the 10 months up to January 2019, 96 members were immediately suspended from the party for their conduct and 12 were expelled.  Labour party figures also point to the fact that many complaints have been made about the Tories' attitude to Islamophobia. There are  calls from the Muslim Council to hold a full investigation into what is going on in the Conservative Party, just as the EHRC is undertaking a formal inquiry into the Labour Party.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-40382557,'UKIP should not become anti-Islam',Nathan Gill says trying to ban full face veils - as UKIP pledged - is not a matter for government.,26 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"UKIP's main focus should not become anti-Islam, the party's MEP in Wales has said. Nathan Gill has criticised his party's general election campaign pledge to ban full face veils worn by Muslim women. He said the move to announce it early in the campaign meant the party could not talk about anything else. Mr Gill argued government should not dictate what ""you can and can't wear"" and said he did not want to associate himself with the campaign. UKIP said the veil was an ""instrument of oppression"", adding it sought to ""lift the veil"" on ""that oppression"" and it had been banned in other countries. ""If we are to bring communities together, we must begin by removing the implements of oppression and division,"" a party spokesman said. UKIP saw its UK-wide vote share fall by 10.8% to 1.8% at the 2017 general election. It won no seats and leader Paul Nuttall resigned the day after. At the launch of the party's general election manifesto, which took place in the days after the Manchester terror attack, former leader Mr Nuttall said radical Islam was a ""cancer that needs to be cut out"". Mr Gill told BBC Wales: ""I don't want our party's raison d'etre to become anti-Islam. ""Ultimately we all live on a very small island. We've all got to get on. ""It's pointless us talking about very emotive words like cancers and things like that, when we should be talking about harmonisation and us getting on together as a people. ""The amount of people who have a problem with Islam, or Muslim immigration or things like that, must be 1% of the population."" Criticising the fact that UKIP's campaign was ""kicked off"" by the announcement of a face veil ban, Mr Gill said: ""It meant that we couldn't talk about anything else because that was always going to be brought up by the media and by the opposition. ""We should have kicked the campaign off with a positive vision of a post-Brexit Britain."" Mr Gill, who sits as an independent AM in the assembly and led UKIP Wales during the EU referendum campaign, said: ""I don't want government dictating to us, to the level of what you can and can't wear, and to the level of how you worship, or all these different things. ""I didn't do anything during the general election campaign - I didn't really want to be associated with it."" Mr Gill also said a claim by Neil Hamilton, assembly UKIP group leader, that there was no problem with Islamophobia in Britain was ""nonsense"". ""Some people just enjoy media attention. I never sought that,"" he said. ""There's no point making silly claims and there's no point saying things that you don't really fully understand or that you've not fully researched. ""I just feel that we don't have to tout ourselves in front of the media saying outrageous things."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44964740,Arctics and Jorja Smith on Mercury list,The Arctic Monkeys receive their fourth nomination as the Mercury Prize reveals its shortlist.,26 Jul 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Arctic Monkeys, arguably Britain's biggest rock band, are among the 12 nominees for the 2018 Mercury Prize. Their space lounge concept album, Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino, earns the band a fourth nomination for the award, established in 1992 as a high-minded alternative to the Brits. But the quartet face stiff competition from the likes of Jorja Smith, Lily Allen and Florence + The Machine. Other nominees include Wolf Alice, Noel Gallagher and jazz act Sons of Kemet. Last year's winner, Sampha, also features on the soulful Everything Is Recorded, a collaborative album put together by the head of XL Records, Richard Russell - aka ""the man who signed Adele"". The Arctics, Gallagher and Florence are 4-1 favourites at bookmakers William Hill, with Wolf Alice, Smith and Allen given odds of 6-1.  Several of the shortlisted albums are overtly political. Both Nadine Shah's Holiday Destination and Everything Everything's A Fever Dream address the rise in nationalism and xenophobia, coupled with a decline in empathy. London MC Novelist, meanwhile, delivers a strong anti-violence message on his self-produced debut album, Novelist Guy; and Sons Of Kemet's Your Queen Is A Reptile celebrates powerful black women who've been overlooked by history. ""It was really important to document the times we're living in,"" Shah told the BBC.  ""As a Muslim woman [living during] a rise in Islamophobia, I'm scared. I'm genuinely scared. So I needed to speak about that."" Other nominees turn their attention inwards, with Florence + The Machine displaying a new level of vulnerability on High As Hope; and Jorja Smith chronicling the bumpy road to adulthood on her streetwise debut Lost & Found. Pop star Lily Allen receives her first ever nomination for her fourth album, No Shame, an emotional depiction of her marital breakdown and struggles with self-worth. ""Making this record was really tough and it was a slog,"" she told the BBC.  ""I felt very disconnected from myself as I was making it. I was trying to find me in and amongst it all. The fact it's connected to other people, it just feels really great."" The full shortlist for the 2018 prize is: The 2018 shortlist was drawn up by a panel of judges including musicians Marcus Mumford, Jamie Cullum and Ella Eyre, alongside broadcasters Clara Amfo and Mistajam, and a handful of music critics and journalists. They said the nominees held a ""shared belief in the importance of music for navigating life's challenges - whether personal or political, falling in or out of love, growing up or looking back, angry or ecstatic."" Although the award has a reputation for rewarding up-and-coming acts, there are only three debut albums on this year's list, alongside two number one records and five former nominees. Radio 1's Huw Stephens welcomed the inclusion of artists on their third, fourth or (in Noel Gallagher's case) 10th albums. ""Hopefully it says that we're not as flash-in-the-pan as we have been in the past and that artists have time to build and to grow."" ""Artists like Arctic Monkeys and Florence + The Machine are being allowed time to develop. They don't always have to go to number one and sell out stadiums and headline Glastonbury. They can just work at their craft for years."" Arctic Monkeys, who won the prize for their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, are now the second most-nominated act in the Mercury's 26-year history. Only Radiohead have more nominations, with five, although they've never taken home the trophy.  PJ Harvey also has four nominations - and is the only artist to win the award twice, for Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea in 2001 and Let England Shake in 2011. This year's winner will be unveiled at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 20 September. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Yems, 63, has been banned from football until June 2024.Â  An independent panel found him guilty of racist abuse towards his players following a hearing in November. However, a report from the disciplinary commission said comments made by Yems were ""not a case of conscious racism"". Last week the FA said it ""fundamentally disagreed"" with that view and had already requested a longer suspension than the 18 months given to Yems. In publishing the written reasons for his ban last week the report said that Yems used ""offensive, racist and Islamophobic"" language, including joking that a Muslim player was a terrorist. ""We are appealing the sanction imposed by the independent panel on John Yems,"" said an FA spokesperson. ""We believe a longer sanction is appropriate."" Football Daily podcast: 72+: Yems' racism ban and more change at Cardiff Yems used 'offensive, racist and Islamophobic' slurs FA disagrees that Yems abuse 'not conscious racism' Anger over calling manager 'not conscious racist' Yems was suspended by Crawley on 23 April last year amid ""serious and credible accusations"" that he used discriminatory language and behaviour towards his players between 2019 and 2022. He then parted company with the League Two club 13 days later, two days after the FA announced it was investigating the allegations against him. Yems admitted one FA charge of making comments that had a reference to either ethnic origin, race, nationality, religion, gender or colour but denied 15 other charges. The independent regulatory commission found 11 of them to be proven and four unproven during a hearing and banned Yems until 1 June 2024. A further charge of segregating the players at the club along racial lines was withdrawn by the FA before the hearing. The tribunal's report stated how, in his defence, Yems ""categorically denied that he was in any way racist"". The panel was made up of barrister Robert Englehart KC, former Sheffield United striker Tony Agana and Wolverhampton Wanderers club secretary Matt Wild. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said the FA's decision to appeal against the length of the ban was ""absolutely right"". ""[The disciplinary commission's] full written reasons essentially excuse behaviour and language which has resulted in 11 charges of discriminatory behaviour being upheld and a ban being given,"" said PFA senior equalities education executive Jason Lee, who made more than 650 appearances in a 23-year career. ""They have offered a justification that is wholly unnecessary and, in our view, completely without merit. ""They have caused anger and upset to many.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58523450,What matters most to Canadian voters,"Three people tell the BBC what issues are at stake and who they are voting for, as election day nears.",11 Sep 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Canadian voters are set to decide the makeup of their next government when they head to the polls on 20 September.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the snap election last month. Opinion polls suggest Mr Trudeau's centre-left Liberals are tied in first place with the centre-right Conservatives, the main opposition party, led by Erin O'Toole. Other parties - the New Democratic Party (NDP), the Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, the Green Party, and the People's Party of Canada - are also running.  Three voters - a Liberal, a Conservative and a New Democrat - shared their thoughts with the BBC as party leaders wrapped up back-to-back debate nights. Alex is a college student who was born and raised in Ottawa. A first-time voter, he intends to vote Liberal because pandemic recovery is his highest priority. What is your ""ballot box"" issue and why? Getting us out of the pandemic. When we're in this pandemic, we can't get the economy back to normal because it's not a normal time period. We can't really focus on climate change either because we know a lot of people are relying on [oil and gas] jobs to feed their families and heat their homes. Until we can deal with the pandemic and get past it, I don't think we can start focusing on the economy. That's the biggest priority for me. Who are you voting for and why? I'm planning to vote for the Liberals. Out of all the options available to me and the makeup of my riding [electoral district], I think that's the best option. The NDP has a really good plan for getting us out of the pandemic; I don't really believe the Conservatives because they're not mandating vaccines for their own candidates and trying to play both sides of the vaccine choice debate; but the Liberal camp has done a pretty good job, although not perfect, and I have trust in them to keep us going. In terms of the economy, although I liked what I heard from the Conservative plan, I have concerns especially with their approach to climate change. My local candidate indicated that, in terms of the economy and climate change, we've got to do one or the other, and I don't really believe in that message. We're all in this together and we've got to work together. Ultimately, I'm not 100% sold on really any of the parties but ultimately I just feel like the Liberals and the Liberal candidate in my riding are the best choice for me. Did the debate change your mind about any of the candidates? I think, for most decided voters, debates do very little to change people's minds most of the time. But I was reminded that I don't believe in the Conservatives' climate policy or Covid policy. I do support a lot of the social policies of the NDP, but the NDP is basically never elected in my riding and I do have a couple of concerns with costs in their platform. In general, the whole debate was a little bit hectic, basically trading one-liners and campaign slogans with each other. But there was a very good question about building trust amongst indigenous communities in Canada and I don't know if any of the parties really have a great plan for how to do that. Bernadette is a single mother who runs a fully female consulting firm. She is afraid of more Liberal spending and, after considering a vote for the People's Party of Canada, now intends to vote for the Conservatives. What is your ""ballot box"" issue and why? Fiscal responsibility. One of the big things the Liberals spoke about was the middle class, but I'm middle class through and through. I'm a small business owner, a single mom, a property owner. I'm all these things, but my taxes have gone up. Responsible spending is better than raising taxes. I don't want you guys to keep spending money. I want you guys to improve the economy so that we can make the money and then give you the money to spend responsibly. I think the government forgets that it's our money they are spending frivolously without our input. Who are you voting for and why? As much as I support the People's Party, I'm going to vote Conservative. What Canadians need is jobs, not handouts, at this moment in time. Because we still have to pay for, and our children have to pay for, handouts. We need a working economy. The Conservatives have got the best perspective on how to achieve that. The oil and gas industry is in decline. I understand the need for clean energy, but you cannot flip a switch. It has to be done sustainably. You have to rely on the current industry in order to generate capital that can move over, not switch it off, because that kills jobs and we have no way to make money as a country. I'm OK with a slower way of reducing emissions because it means that we can maintain the economy at the same time; it's got to be a balance. Did the debate change your mind about any of the candidates? The debate changed my mind purely because I found that Erin O'Toole was confident and calm in his answers, even when he was getting harassed by other party leaders. As much as I feel that the Conservatives are a little bit like fake Liberals, which I don't like about them, I still think we need to have a Conservative government in order to get back on track. If we don't get the Conservatives in, Canada's got a fairly bleak future over the next four years, particularly if the Liberals get a majority. I can't even imagine the spending or how bad the job market will be. I don't want to bash anybody but Trudeau was having a bit of a temper tantrum. He's feeling the pressure of losing, maybe even losing his minority. What stood out to me was that many of the leaders were talking about what they wanted to do, but it was only [NDP leader] Jagmeet Singh and Erin O'Toole who seemed to have a how. The Bloc and the Greens do not matter to me as much. The Liberals have not delivered. This is the first time I've ever even considered this, but I'd prefer to have a Conservative majority with an NDP opposition. Jagmeet Singh would make an excellent opposition party leader. To me, that's a good balance for the country. Jaffar is a Muslim immigrant and retired chartered accountant. He believes Canada's economic recovery, inclusiveness and global image are all at stake in this election. What is your ""ballot box"" issue and why? Firstly, the economy and fixing the impacts of the pandemic. Then, Canada's foreign policy, the environment and climate change. Islamophobia is very scary in Canada. It's spreading fast and innocent people have been killed. They didn't discuss that at all in the debate. To Mr Trudeau and Mr O'Toole, it's not even an issue. I would like Jagmeet Singh to talk more about issues of race, religion and extremism. It's a real thing that's happening and we've got to do something. Somebody I know went with their wife to [a popular restaurant in Toronto] for dessert and they were refused service because of her hijab. Native and residential school issues took up about two minutes in the debate. The discovery of these unmarked graves is a national shame. People of colour, particularly First Nations, don't have any representation in the corridors of power. We need to make sure there is fair representation. Who are you voting for and why? I'm voting for the NDP this time. What Jagmeet Singh has been saying is sincere and will benefit us all. He has some really good ideas on housing, job re-training, the economy and healthcare. I think Jagmeet might also fine tune Canada's foreign policy because he talked about Canada's respect in the world and that's an important one for me. He's talking about a lot of spending though, so I wonder where that's going to come from. So I have some question marks. I feel it's going to end up hitting us in the middle class because we're creating a lot of debt in Canada to support the economy through this pandemic. But overall I think he is great. Did the debate change your mind about any of the candidates? I didn't appreciate Mr O'Toole very much. I have congratulated him on passing a resolution in the Canadian Parliament condemning China for its treatment of Uighurs, but I haven't heard a peep out of him about human rights violations in other places because it suits them to be selective in their condemnation. Canada has lost its respect in the world because it is speaking from both sides of its mouth. And that applies to Mr Trudeau, who is continuing to sell arms to Saudi Arabia as the war in Yemen goes on. I was a little bit more impressed with [Green Party leader] Annamie Paul. She didn't say much but talked sense about how we need to work together."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-42650106,The schoolchildren bullied for being Muslim,"In her book Mothering a Muslim, writer Nazia Erum says children as young as five are being targeted.",13 Jan 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Schools and playgrounds can be dangerous places where children are isolated or bullied. Children often use differences in appearance, skin colour, food habits, misogyny, homophobia and casteism to inflict pain on their peers. And now, according to a new book out in India, Muslim children are increasingly being targeted in posh schools for their religious identity because of the growing Islamophobia in India and across the world. Writer Nazia Erum, who spoke to 145 families in 12 cities and 100 children studying in 25 elite Delhi schools while researching her book Mothering a Muslim, says that children as young as five are being targeted. ""What I found during my research was shocking, I didn't think it was happening in these elite schools,"" Ms Erum told the BBC. ""When five and six year olds say they were called a Pakistani or a terrorist, how do you respond to that? And how do you complain to the school?"" she asks. ""A lot of it is said in jest, it's meant to be funny, to evoke a laugh. It's subtle and it can seem like harmless banter, but it's not. It's actually bullying and tormenting.""  The children she interviewed for her book told her about some of the questions and comments that are regularly hurled at them: Since its launch, the book has started a conversation around religious hate and prejudice in schools and last weekend, #MotheringAMuslim trended high on Twitter, with many taking to social media to share their own experiences. Nearly 80% of India's population of 1.3 billion is Hindu, while Muslims make up 14.2%. For the most part, the two communities have lived peacefully, but religious resentment has always simmered below the surface since 1947 when India and Pakistan were carved out of a single nation. The parting was bloody - between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence.  Ms Erum says while anti-Muslim slurs have been used since the 1990s, after the demolition of the Babri mosque by Hindu hardline groups and the Hindu-Muslim riots that followed, in recent years their tone and intensity have changed. She became acutely aware of it in 2014, after she gave birth to her first child. ""As I held my little daughter Myra in my arms, for the first time I was afraid,"" Ms Erum said, adding that she was worried about even giving the baby a name that could be easily identified as Muslim.  It was a time of sharp religious divisions in India. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was running a hugely polarising election campaign, which helped sweep Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power.  There was a rise in Hindu nationalist sentiment and some television channels were presenting a distorted narrative that painted Muslims as ""invaders, anti-national and a threat to national security"".  ""Since 2014, my identity as a Muslim was in my face, and all my other identities had become secondary to that. There was a sense of palpable fear among the entire community,"" Ms Erum says.  And since then, the fault lines have only widened. The polarising arguments and debates on television have entrenched biases, which are now being passed around from the adults to children. ""So in playgrounds, schools, classrooms and school buses, a Muslim child is singled out, pushed into a corner, called a Pakistani, IS, Bagdadi and terrorist,"" says Ms Erum. The stories of children she cites in the book make for grim reading: Being bullied on account of one's religion in schools is not limited to India, it's happening across the world.  In the US, it's been described as the ""Trump Effect"" after reports that his presidential campaign had produced an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of colour and inflamed racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom.  So can the increased bullying of Muslim children in Indian schools be described as the ""Modi Effect""? ""All politicians are using a similar tone, including those from Islamic parties,"" Ms Erum says. She adds that schools have refused to accept that religious bullying took place on their premises.  That, she says, could also be since most cases go unreported - children don't want to be seen as tattletales and most parents dismiss them as random incidents. But what is worrying is that a form of self-censorship has crept into their lives and many Muslim parents have begun telling their children to be on their best behaviour at all times - don't argue, don't be good at computer games that involve bombs or guns, don't crack a joke at the airport, don't wear traditional outfits when you go out. Ms Erum says these are warning signs and parents and schools must do everything possible to counter communal bullying. ""The first step is to accept that there's a problem, and then have a conversation about it. Whataboutery is not going to help,"" she says. ""If this issue is not addressed, it's not going to be restricted to 9pm debates in television studios or newspaper headlines, because hate swallows all, it impacts both the tormentor and the tormented equally."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-57641242,Rising Islamophobia 'should shame us all',A report into racism against Muslims recommends lessons in school and a more diverse police service.,29 Jun 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The first public inquiry into Islamophobia in Scotland has found that racism against Muslims has escalated. Verbal and physical assaults have intensified, especially on public transport, with more participants in Glasgow experiencing abuse. Labour leader Anas Sarwar, who leads the group of MSPs behind the report, said the results ""should shame us all"". Several recommendations have been made for the Scottish government to act upon. The inquiry was set up in 2018 by a cross-party group of MSPs charged with tackling islamophobia after levels of hatred increased. The report, produced by Newcastle University professor Peter Hopkins, calls for the integration of an understanding of Islamophobia into Scotland's education curriculum. It also wants to see the recruiting of more police officers from diverse communities. It asks that all political parties in Scotland adopt a ""no tolerance"" approach to Islamophobia. The report suggests that the Scottish government funds and supports initiatives to educate people about the damage Islamophobia does to society. And it calls on the Scottish government to instigate a full independent review. Mr Sarwar started the group after he was allegedly subjected to racist comments by a Labour councillor. He wrote to the first minister outlining a series of proposals to tackle ""everyday racism and Islamophobia"" across Scotland. He also called for a review of the legal framework surrounding racist and Islamophobic abuse on social media. Responding to the report, Mr Sarwar said: ""We pride ourselves on being a welcome and tolerant country, but it's clear how much more work we have to do. ""There are people in Scotland who feel scared to leave their homes for fear of verbal of physical attack, are withdrawing from public services with devastating knock-on consequences on their health and education and feel they are outsiders in their own country. ""This should shame us all."" He said it was clear that efforts had to be redoubled to challenge and overcome hatred and prejudice. And he added: ""The fight against hate is a fight for all of us."" The review was told by its participants that the abuse takes place most commonly in the street. Public spaces such as shops or restaurants and public transport were also hotspots, then at work and places of education to a lesser extent.  Muslim women were more likely to encounter Islamophobia than men. Report author Prof Hopkins has been researching issues of racism and Islamophobia in Scotland for 20 years.  He said: ""The evidence submitted to this inquiry makes it clear that Scotland has a very serious set of issues to address in relation to everyday Islamophobia and racism.  ""Inquiry evidence included numerous references to verbal and physical abuse, attacks in and around mosques and religious buildings, and experiences of threatening behaviour on public transport.  ""Almost four fifths of respondents were fearful of experiencing Islamophobia and this had real consequences for how they lived their lives.  ""Islamophobia permeates all domains of Scottish society; it is not only restricted to one context. It threatens education, limits employment prospects, and impacts everyday issues including health, wellbeing and housing.  ""It is time to address the issue of Scotland's Islamophobia rather than denying its existence."" He added: ""The recommendations make it clear that all sectors, agencies and departments need to make long-term changes to eradicate Islamophobia from Scottish society.""  A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We are committed to tackling hate crime and prejudice, including Islamophobia in all its forms and we will carefully consider this inquiry's recommendations. ""New hate crime laws ensure our police and courts will have the powers they need so those who would deliberately target others due to their religion or other characteristics can be prosecuted. ""Later this year we will report on the progress of our Tackling Prejudice and Building Connected Communities Action Plan, which was published in 2017 and included actions on raising awareness of hate crime and encourage reporting."" She said the government would develop a new hate crime strategy later this year in consultation with stakeholders. ""As part of this, we will consider the need to define Islamophobia, including consideration of the UK's All-Party Parliamentary Group's definition,"" she added."

The paper says the officers have provided detailed testimonies, with one source saying the accounts are ""extremely damning"". The Telegraph also suggests that the PM's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, will be interviewed by Ms Gray later. The Guardian says the prime minister has been ""pulled"" into a row over Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. The paper says Boris Johnson is facing calls for an independent inquiry after an allegation from the former minister, Nusrat Ghani, who was told her ""Muslimness"" made colleagues uncomfortable. No 10 says Mr Johnson encouraged her to make a formal complaint at the time, but Ms Ghani says the party procedure was not appropriate, and the PM told her he could not get involved.   The Daily Express leads on an interview with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who declares Mr Johnson understands the need for change at No 10. Mr Shapps tells the paper that the prime minister has the ability to bring people together in a way that no other politician can.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-41914331,Has the arena attack changed Manchester?,How life has changed for people in the city six months on.,22 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"It has been six months since 22 people were killed and hundreds more injured in the suicide bombing at Manchester Arena. BBC News talks to people about how the city has changed since the attack.  At the Christmas market in Manchester's Albert Square, shopper Nicola Depetrillo said people were ""defiant"" in the wake of the terror attack on 22 May. ""I think it's the same for everybody now, life's changed for us,"" she said.  ""It will be in the back of your mind all the time and you are more aware of what is around you. But you've got to go about your everyday life. You can't stop going out. ""Why should we stay away? This is our city.""  Charlotte Powell said she recently took part in an event which involved chasing people in the city centre while collecting clues.  She described how one man thought they were running out of fear and began sprinting with them. ""His face was shocked and you could see the fear. He said 'I thought it was another attack' and all we were doing was running down the road,"" she said. ""So people are a bit edgy."" Tibyan Sanoh was on the tram when the attack happened and heard the bang as the bomb exploded in the arena. She said: ""For a couple of weeks it was really scary. But on the whole I feel like everyone's just got back to normal, which is strange. ""When something happens people automatically think it's a terrorist attack. But aside from that I feel Manchester is a hard-faced city anyway, so you just crack on.""  Catherine Jones, from Cheadle Hulme, said on Remembrance Sunday a cannon fired to mark the beginning of the silence made her jump.  ""My immediate reaction was it was a bomb again. You think about it more in the city centre when you're in enclosed shopping centres. I'd rather be out where you can run if it happens again."" She said people were more vigilant and the attack had increased awareness around reporting anything suspicious. ""We wouldn't stop coming in to Manchester because of it [though].  Life has to go on.""   As visitors enjoy German sausages at the markets and sip mulled wine, they are being joined by armed police.  Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham announced officers would for the first time patrol the market to provide the ""reassurance people will want"". Armed officers have also been deployed to Manchester Airport and events such as the Great Manchester Run. Hanouf Alosaimi, who was visiting the market, said: ""If I see armed police, everything is safe and good. When I see police everywhere, everything is secure and I am very happy with it.  ""[I think Manchester in general] is more secure. I feel very, very safe."" ""Security has been massively vamped up,"" says David Adu-Dwumaa  who works in the city centre but lives in Leigh. ""Some people would see it and be paranoid about what could happen, but it can always happen, so I think it's better for [reinforcements] to be there."" However, Caniko Behdjet, from Whitefield, said she felt ""concerned, rather than reassured and protected"" when she saw police with guns. ""As soon as I got off the tram there was something over the loud speaker about keeping your belongings with you or they will be destroyed. It makes you feel a bit uneasy.""  Barriers have also been put up at key locations in the city centre. Councillor Pat Kearney said he had visited the market in Berlin where a lorry ploughed into shoppers and killed 12 people and had ""learned lessons"". ""A year or two ago we wouldn't talk so openly about the security measures. But now I think the public actually want to be reassured that the council and police have thought through the security,"" he added. Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce (GMCC) reported an ""immediate dip"" in tourism and hotel bookings following the attack. But levels of tourism, visitors and conferences are now as ""high as ever"", according to its head of research and policy, Christian Spence. ""This year's festivals and events in the city centre have all been huge successes and the Manchester 'buzz' is very much in evidence,"" he said. Hotel occupancy rates initially ""struggled"" after the attack but showed signs of recovery by August, a report to Manchester City Council's Economy Scrutiny Committee said. Marketing Manchester said hotel occupancy up to the end of September was nudging ahead of the 2016 figures. ""We are confident we will end the year ahead of last year,"" a spokesperson said.  This contrasts with hotel performance data following the terror attack in Paris in November 2015 which left 130 people dead, when ""mixed performance levels were still evident a year later"".   Reports of Islamophobic hate crimes and incidents in Greater Manchester rose by 500% in the month following the attack, police figures showed. They included a bomb threat, racist taunts, and graffiti. After this initial spike, and a high of 1,061 reported incidents, the figures have since dropped but remain slightly above 2016 levels. In October there were 711 incidents of reported hate crime, compared to 564 the previous year.  Greater Manchester Police's Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said events in Manchester and across the UK have had a ""huge impact"" on figures, but one month after the attack levels of hate crime ""returned to similar levels"" as before. He said hate crime was often under-reported and encouraged people to come forward. Firms closest to the arena, which had to be closed for several days in the immediate aftermath of the attack, were offered help by Manchester City Council. Three applied for business rate relief and received support totalling £7,640, while others were contacted for potential support from a hardship scheme. Several businesses responded and identified potential losses totalling about £50,000, the Economy Scrutiny Committee report found. But Mr Spence said that when compared to ""the physical devastation"" of the IRA bombing in 1996, the biggest impact of the recent bombing was ""on those who lost loved ones... those injured... and the psychological impact on people who live and work in the city centre."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44109371,Racist hate mail sent with O2 Sim cards,"Phone company apologises for mail addressed to ""Mr Isis Terroriste"" and ""Mr Getout Ofengland"".",15 May 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"O2 has apologised after two items of ""shocking"" racist hate mail were sent to a British-Iraqi family in London.  Addressed to ""Mr Isis Terroriste"" and ""Mr Getout Ofengland"" at the exact family address in Wembley, north London, they contained free pay-as-you-go Sim cards ordered online in August 2017 by an unknown third party. The family, who presumed they were junk mail, only recently read the envelopes. The Muslim Council of Britain said the ""Islamophobia"" was deeply concerning. The family told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Programme: ""We were really saddened to come across these letters, especially having a younger child in the house who we don't want to grow up witnessing such hateful language.  ""It's even sadder to think that such hate speech has become normalised despite living in such a uniquely multicultural and diverse city like London."" Family friend and lawyer Sura Jawad said the letters were hateful.  ""It's horrible to think that there are people who have so much hatred in them that they set out to deliberately make others feel isolated and unwelcome or who take comments like these light-heartedly,"" she said. ""Either scenario shows that racism and Islamophobia are very much rife issues, particularly in a post-Brexit climate."" O2 said its Sim card postage and printing was managed by a third-party partner, Williams Lea Tag, and was automated. Human checks were in place but only once a query had been identified. And in this case no query had been raised before postage.  The company said it would be working with this partner to review the entire process as a result of this issue - including where human checking was used.  O2 added that it ""has a rigorous data-cleansing process in place to prevent any of our free products being sent to addresses with obscenities or offensive names, and so this is a rare occurrence"". ""If the family decide to report this case, we will work closely with the police as part of their investigation."" After speaking to a friend of the family affected, Miqdaad Versi, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: ""These Islamophobic bigots are finding more and more ways to spread their hatred.  ""Whilst it is imperative that corporations upgrade safeguards to prevent such incidents recurring, there are broader concerns about the government not taking Islamophobia seriously.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43782111,Chakrabarti on Labour and anti-Semitism,"The Labour peer says officials have the ""resources"" and political will to address ""serious problem"".",16 Apr 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour officials have the ""resources""  to tackle anti-Semitism within the party, shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti has insisted. The peer implied to the BBC there was still a ""serious problem"", nearly two years after a report she wrote for Jeremy Corbyn urged action to address an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". She accepted not all her June 2016 recommendations had been implemented. But she said general secretary Jennie Formby had prioritised the issue. Jewish groups, which demonstrated outside Parliament last month, have demanded urgent action - including the full implementation of the 2016 report - after a number of high-profile rows. It is understood that Mr Corbyn will meet representatives from the Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council for talks on 24 April amid calls for investigations into cases of alleged anti-Semitism, including that of suspended former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, to be expedited. Baroness Chakrabarti's 2016 investigation concluded Labour was ""not overrun"" by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or other forms of racism but made a number of recommendations to confront what it found was clear evidence of ""ignorant attitudes"" among some party members.  These included procedural rule changes to improve the party's disciplinary process, the adoption and publication of a complaints procedure and the appointment of a general counsel to give advice on issues including disciplinary matters and to take responsibility for instructing external lawyers. Asked if she conceded there was a ""more serious problem"" with anti-Semitism now than in 2016, Baroness Chakrabarti told BBC Radio 4's Today she thought ""there was a serious problem at the time"". ""But what I am glad to say is that I have spent some time in recent days with Jennie Formby and she shares my serious concern."" Asked as a shadow cabinet member whether she bore some responsibility for the fact her report had not been fully implemented, she said it was clear that further action was needed.  ""I clearly have not, by myself, been able to achieve that. The new general secretary has the resources and has made this an absolute priority."" She added: ""I think it is time to tackle some of the tropes that have been promoted on the left of politics as well as on the far-right of politics, particularly any confusion between anti-elitism and anti-Semitism. That really has to stop."""

Police confirmed that the 68-year-old has been released on an undertaking to appear in court at a later date. Mr Sarwar, a Labour MSP for the Glasgow region, recently launched a cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia. He has also spoken out about his experience of racism while he was standing as a candidate for the Scottish Labour leadership."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43544155,Concern over 'vile' Islamophobic letters,"MSPs tasked with tackling Islamophobia will meet police about the ""Punish a Muslim"" letters.",27 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"MSPs are to consider further action to tackle an ""abhorrent"" letter and social media campaign encouraging people to ""punish a Muslim"". Counter-terrorism police have been investigating letters sent out around the UK as a possible hate crime. Images of the A4 notes, which contain a list of violent acts alongside a number of ""points"" for performing them, have been widely shared online. There are fears the campaign may have led to physical attacks in Scotland. Holyrood's cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia is to discuss the ""Punish a Muslim day"" letters with Police Scotland representatives on Tuesday. Concerns have also been raised about them in the House of Commons, with MPs describing the ""abhorrent"" letters as a ""really urgent situation"". No-one in Scotland is known to have received a copy, but Labour MSP Anas Sarwar said there has been a ""spike"" in racist and Islamophobic crimes in Glasgow. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that he knew of five ""very serious"" hate crimes in the city over the last 10 days.  In one case, he said a schoolgirl was asked if someone could rip off her hijab so they could film it and earn 25 points from the ""Punish a Muslim"" campaign.  Mr Sarwar said a woman was also assaulted outside a supermarket, where she was sworn at and told to go home.  Another woman was attacked in a shopping centre and a third was abused and assaulted on train by three men.  ""So all of these things - added to this Punish a Muslim campaign running on social media - is causing genuine fear and alarm,"" the MSP added.  Mr Sarwar said he had been contacted by people unsure as to how to keep themselves safe.  ""What we're trying to do is find a coordinated response, saying please go about your daily business as you normally would,"" he said.  ""Let's not let these people change our everyday way of life, but be more vigilant, look out for your friends and family, and if you see anything, suspect anything or experience anything, please share that with the police."" Earlier, Mr Sarwar said MSPs would be discussing the issue with police at the cross-party group meeting, where they will identify additional action to reassure people.  ""We have a duty to stand against racism and prejudice in all its forms. MSPs will come together to show support and solidarity with the communities being targeted by this vile Islamophobic campaign,"" he added. Dr Muhammad Adrees, convener of the Muslim Council of Scotland, said the letters were ""a chilling reminder of the very real danger and hatred facing ordinary Muslims every day"". He said: ""Although there are no known recipients in Scotland, they have nonetheless caused considerable alarm and the community needs reassurance, especially since the letters have already triggered Islamophobic incidents here.  ""Our advice to members of the public is to remain vigilant and alert but not alarmed. Go about your everyday business, taking some extra precautions. If you feel threatened or are at risk, contact the police immediately."" Supt David Pettigrew, of Police Scotland, said: ""Police Scotland is aware of the recent media coverage of letters received by some individuals in England over the past few weeks that are anti-Islamic in nature.  ""While there are no known recipients in Scotland to date, Police Scotland recognise that there is the potential for a rise in fears amongst some community members and also for some incidents of hate to be perceived to have been caused by the publicity around the letters. ""Police Scotland officers are liaising with relevant forces and continues to monitor the situation. ""Regular reviews are being conducted and any action taken will be proportionate and measured, whilst being careful not to inadvertently raise any additional fears or concerns."" Mr Sarwar has also been selected to raise the matter with Nicola Sturgeon at her weekly question session at Holyrood on Thursday."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41394265,Labour MP shocked by '1930s' anti-Semitism,"John Cryer says some material seen by the disciplinary panel ""makes your hair stand up"".",26 Sep 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A senior Labour MP has said he is shocked at some of the anti-Semitic tweets by party members that come before its disciplinary panel. John Cryer said some of what is written ""makes your hair stand up"", adding: ""This stuff is redolent of the 1930s."" He was speaking at a fringe debate at the Labour conference in Brighton. Labour says it condemns anti-Semitism in the ""strongest possible terms"" with ""tough new rules"" recently agreed by the party's ruling executive committee. These changes to the rule book will be voted on by delegates in Brighton on Tuesday. The fringe debate, organised by the Holocaust Educational Trust and the Anti-Semitism Policy Trust, looked at anti-Semitism on the left of politics. Panellists agreed there had been a recent increase in people questioning the Holocaust. Mr Cryer, Labour MP for Leyton and Wanstead, described a ""seeping poison"" and warned that future generations might not realise that when it came to Nazism, ""we were right and they were wrong"". As chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, he sits on the disputes panel of the National Executive Committee, which rules on what members have ""said, written or tweeted"", he told the audience. ""I have seen some of the tweets from paid up Labour Party members and I am not kidding you, it makes your hair stand up,"" he said. Some Labour members dismiss reports of anti-Semitism as a myth, he said. ""But you don't have to look very far before you see it's not a myth...and there's no place in the Labour Party for stuff like that."" Another MP, Wes Streeting, said a ""rump"" of anti-Semites in Labour should be ""driven out"" of the party. ""It isn't anti-Semitic to criticise the Israeli government,"" he said. ""Unfortunately we see too many people examples of anti-Semitic language being used in order to do so."" Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""Why do people want to question the truth of the Holocaust?  ""Do we question whether the earth is flat? There are certain stories that can't have two sides."" Last year, an inquiry was carried out into claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party following the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone. It found there was evidence of ""ignorant attitudes"" but that the ""Labour Party is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of racism"".  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was then criticised when its author, Shami Chakrabarti, was nominated to become a Labour peer. Mr Livingstone, who denies accusations of anti-Semitism, is currently suspended from Labour over comments he made about Adolf Hitler and Zionism. A party spokesman said: ""Labour condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest possible terms and our NEC unanimously passed tough new rule changes last week. ""All groupings in the party should treat one another with respect. We will not tolerate anti-Semitism or Holocaust denial."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40854797,US mosque bombing 'an act of terror',No one was hurt in the weekend blast but there were 20 people inside at the time.,7 Aug 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"An explosive that shattered windows and damaged a room at a Minnesota mosque was ""a criminal act of terrorism"", the state's governor Mark Dayton has said. Congregants were arriving for prayer early on Saturday when the explosion went off at the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center in a Minneapolis suburb. The FBI are investigating what Mr Dayton called ""a terrible, dastardly, cowardly"" act. They said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device. No one was injured in Saturday's attack at 0500 local time (0900 GMT), but the imam's office was heavily damaged.  As many as 20 people were inside at the time of the explosion.  Mohamed Omar, the executive director of the mosque, told CBS News a member of the congregation saw a truck flee the centre's car park at high speed after the blast. The office's windows were shattered either by an explosive or another object was thrown inside, authorities said.   ""The destruction done to this sacred site is just unthinkable, unforgivable. I hope and pray the perpetrator will be caught and prosecuted to the full extent of the law,"" Mr Dayton said at a news conference outside the mosque, located in Bloomington, Minnesota. He was joined by state Representative Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American legislator in the US, and US Representative Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress.  ""What makes Minnesota unlike no other [state] is how we accept and love members of our community, no matter the religion they practise, the language they speak, or where they come from,"" Mr Ellison said.  He added ""hate is becoming too prevalent in our society"" and that it must be countered ""with love and the values we hold so dear"". The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is offering a $10,000 (£7,700) reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the attack. The organisation has also urged mosques and Islamic centres across the country to increase security in the wake of Saturday's attack.  The Muslim American Society of Minnesota also said it would offer a $10,000 reward for information on the attacker.  A fundraising page created to help pay for costs to repair the mosque raised more than $40,000 as of Monday morning.  An estimated 3.3 million Muslims live in the US, around 1% of the population, according to a recent Pew Research Center report. Minnesota is home to the largest population of Somalis living in the US and the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center largely serves people from the Somali community.  Minnesota authorities reported a record high of 14 anti-Muslim bias incidents in 2016, The Star Tribune reported."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59753043,French outcry over academic in Islamophobia row,Dozens of academics warn that freedom of expression is at risk after a German professor is suspended.,22 Dec 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Dozens of French academics have warned that freedom of expression is at risk after a German professor was suspended over a row with politics students. Klaus Kinzler has been locked in dispute for months over accusations of Islamophobia at Sciences Po Grenoble.  In a case that has provoked allegations of left-wing cancel culture, the political studies institute has suspended him for ""defamatory remarks"". The institute is now set to lose local funding because of the row. Laurent Wauquiez, the right-wing leader of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, said an annual €100,000 (£85,000) subsidy was being suspended. His decision was widely welcomed by figures on the right of French politics, with just four months to go before a presidential election in which centrist sitting President Emmanuel Macron is leading the opinion polls. But the politics institute said the removal of funding was politically motivated and jeopardised students who struggled to access higher education. Forty people, mostly academics, have now signed an open letter to Higher Education Minister Frédérique Vidal, warning that pluralism in teaching and research is under threat, with teachers and students alike resorting to self-censorship. CANCEL CULTURE: France resists US challenge to its values At the heart of the row is Prof Kinzler, who has been challenged for months by a group of politics students who accused him of fascism and Islamophobia. The professor of German civilisation initially got into an email argument with a colleague over a day of debates on racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. Prof Kinzler reportedly argued that it was not appropriate to equate Islamophobia with racism and anti-Semitism.  A left-wing union accused him of Islamophobia, but the disagreement took on a new lease of life last March when posters were put up on the Grenoble campus that read ""Fascists in our lecture halls. Islamophobia kills"", targeting Prof Kinzler and a colleague. The head of the political studies institute, Sabine Saurugger, said she had repeatedly asked Prof Kinzler not to talk to the media about the row. However, he gave a series of interviews this month, accusing the institute of being a ""political re-education camp"", with a management impotent in the face of a hard core of academics spreading ""wokeism"". Prof Kinzler's lawyers have spoken of a ""witch hunt"", adding that he was forced to speak out after he had been subjected to a political attack. Ms Saurugger told Le Monde newspaper that the management had supported Prof Kinzler when he had come under attack from ""shocking and unacceptable posters"". However, she said it was ""my duty to intervene when the reputation of the institution is targeted, when I hear of 'a political re-education camp'."" She called on Laurent Wauquiez, the regional political head who is also a former Republicans (centre-right) party leader, to visit the university away from the media storm to see the reality of its teaching. However, with next April's presidential elections looming, the row has roused widespread political comment. Far-right candidates have backed the decision to withhold funding. An MP from President Macron's party, François Jolivet, has called for the university to be placed under supervision, while Republicans leader Valérie Pécresse has said she fears freedom of expression is no longer guaranteed there.

A vigil was be held in Cardiff on Friday night to honour the victims of the mosque shootings in New Zealand. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales stood with New Zealand in its ""resistance to the forces of darkness"". The Muslim Council of Wales called on the Welsh Government to develop a ""specific strategy for countering far-right extremism"". Speaking at the vigil, which took place at the Temple of Peace in Cathays Park, Mr Drakeford said the gathering showed the level of ""strength and solidarity"" in Wales towards those affected by the ""awful events"" in New Zealand. He added: ""It is also a message to communities here in Wales, who are fearful that what they have seen elsewhere may give license to people in this part of the world."" Wales rugby captain Alun Wyn Jones, said: ""On behalf of the Welsh Rugby Union players and staff we pass our respects to everyone affected with events that have gone on in New Zealand. ""Obviously there's close links with a lot of our staff and a few players so we would like to extend that."" The Muslim Council of Wales said it was ""shocked and hurt"" by the shootings in ""such an idyllic and quiet place"". It called them a reminder that ""hatred can appear any place and at any time"". The council said religious hate crime had ""rocketed by 40% across England and Wales in just one year, with more than half targeted at Muslims"". In Wales, the council added there had also been a ""resurgence in the activity and organising of far-right groups"". It called on public bodies to adopt the All Party Parliamentary Group definition of Islamophobia ""as steps towards preventing future tragedies such as this from taking place"". South Wales Police said that in common with other UK forces, it would carry out extra patrols on Friday and over the weekend. South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes tweeted that such tragedies sent ""shockwaves across faith communities"", and his force would provide a ""visible presence at our mosques"". Dyfed-Powys Police also said it would step up ""reassurance patrols"" around mosques and increase contacts with communities of all faiths. Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner Jeff Cuthbert said: ""Today we must stand together in solidarity to remember all those who lost their lives in this hateful, abhorrent terrorist attack.  ""We all have a responsibility to teach people that hate abuse is wrong from a young age and stand up against vicious extremism in all its forms."" PC Robert Newton-Miller, of North Wales Police, said the force was placing officers at mosques, and had been in touch with imams. ""I will be attending Friday prayers today to deliver a message to the communities in North Wales in order to promote our support and reassurance during these difficult times,"" said PC Newton-Miller. The Church in Wales said: ""In the face of this kind of hatred, it is more important than ever that we reach out in friendship and solidarity to our neighbours. We pray that God will be close to those most deeply affected, and give courage to all those who may now be fearful of showing their faith. The Bishop of St Davids, Joanna Penberthy, added: ""All of us together must condemn violence and stand against hatred and prejudice."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45096519,Johnson 'won't apologise' for burka comments,The former foreign secretary stands by his remarks despite the Tory chairman telling him to apologise.,8 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Boris Johnson has stood by his remarks about the burka after the Conservative Party chairman told him to apologise. The former foreign secretary has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and comparing them to ""bank robbers"". PM Theresa May has backed calls for Mr Johnson to apologise, saying the remarks have ""clearly caused offence"". But a source close to Mr Johnson said he ""won't be apologising"", adding it was ""ridiculous"" to attack his views. ""We must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues,"" the source added.  ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" Mr Johnson's remarks, in a Daily Telegraph article, have provoked criticism from Muslim groups, some Tory MPs and opposition parties. In the article, Mr Johnson said full-face veils should not be banned but that it was ""ridiculous"" people chose to wear them. However, the founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum said the remarks would harm community relations. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said he agreed with Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt that there had been degree of offence in Mr Johnson's comments, and called on the former London mayor to apologise. By BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca The criticism pitted at Boris Johnson has largely been around the words that he used - ""letter boxes"" and ""bank robbers"" to describe Muslim women wearing face veils.  But Mr Johnson hasn't directly responded to the accusation that it is his language which caused the offence.  Instead, the statement that has come from a source close to him suggests Mr Johnson wants to turn this into a debate about whether or not women should wear the burka at all.  Keeping a high profile is important to Mr Johnson.  He is seen by some in the Conservative Party as a contender for leadership - particularly since his resignation in which he criticised the prime minister's plan for Brexit.  But he risks being seen as weak if he is forced into an apology by the party chairman.  So his refusal to apologise, and an attempt to now put himself on the side of ""liberal values"", could be an example of Mr Johnson trying to save face while maintaining his profile. Former Conservative chairwoman Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet, welcomed Mr Lewis's intervention and called for disciplinary action against Mr Johnson if he did not apologise. She described the remarks as ""offensive and deliberately provocative, but very clever politics"". A debate about the burka should be had ""in a serious way"", she said, rather than ""trying to get airtime and attention on an issue which he knows will resonate with a certain part of the Tory Party"". Shazia Awan-Scully, a Muslim who ran as a Conservative candidate in 2010, said she did not agree with wearing the burka but it was up to women to make up their own minds. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Some women choose to wear it, some women are conditioned to wear it, but it's certainly out of the question for me to tell a woman what to wear."" She added that the language used by Mr Johnson showed he was ""pandering to this Islamophobic attitude bubbling away in the Conservative Party"", which she said she had experienced herself. Conservative backbench MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Johnson had raised an important subject in a ""light-hearted way"". The reaction ""says a lot about internal Conservative Party politics"", he told the BBC. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who supports banning face veils, said Mr Johnson had been ""tactless"".  The 50-year-old said wearing a full-face veil was a ""new phenomenon"" and she didn't consider it a religious right, adding that she would be ""very opposed"" to it becoming normalised in British society.  By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Last year, Zaynab Hussein, a mother from Leicester, was left fighting for her life after a man she didn't know smashed into her with his car - and then ran over her again. She was attacked because she was a Muslim.  Tell Mama, the national organisation that collects anti-Muslim attack statistics, says that the majority of street victims of such abuse and violence are women, for the same reason that Mrs Hussein was singled out: some Muslim women are easily identifiable by their mode of dress - and therefore easy to target.  Seven years ago Baroness Warsi said prejudice against Muslims had passed the ""dinner table test"".  And Mr Johnson's critics regard his ""letter box"" and ""bank robber"" comments as part of the problem the peer defined: normalising prejudice and dehumanising women, rather than calmly debating the complexities of the veil in an open society.  Since Baroness Warsi's warning, there has been the launch of a cross-departmental working group to tackle anti-Muslim hatred.  But it has been criticised as toothless, not least because the government can't agree a definition for Islamophobia.  In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West, and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation""."

The Conservative Party said it had suspended the membership of Waveney council deputy leader Stephen Ardley and had started an investigation. After the election of Sadiq Khan, Mr Ardley is alleged to have said it was ""unbelievable"" a Muslim was elected London Mayor in a Christian country. Mr Ardley, a former Lowestoft mayor, has yet to comment on the allegations. The Conservative Party said: ""Stephen Ardley has been suspended and an investigation is under way."" Mark Bee, Conservative leader of Waveney District Council, said: ""The allegation was made to Brandon Lewis [MP for Great Yarmouth] regarding Stephen Ardley about comments alleged to have been made on social media two years ago. ""Because of the nature of the allegations Stephen has had to be suspended straightaway from the district council and the county council and from his cabinet positions."" He said he met with Mr Ardley, who is also a Suffolk County councilllor, to tell him the news on Friday afternoon. Mr Bee said Mr Ardley was ""disappointed"" to not be involved with the council at this time but ""recognised the need for it [the complaint] to be properly investigated"". A Muslim Council of Britain spokesman said: ""It is no longer good enough to say that these cases are being investigated.  ""There needs to be an independent inquiry and we continue to hope that the [Conservative] party will heed our call."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55314832,A 'lost baby' in a battle over love and religion,A young Hindu says she miscarried after being separated from her Muslim husband under a new law.,17 Dec 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Reports that a pregnant Hindu woman who was forcibly separated from her Muslim husband and may then have miscarried have highlighted controversies over a new anti-conversion law in India. Earlier this month, a video clip went viral in India. It showed a group of men, with orange scarves draped around their necks, heckling a woman in Moradabad town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. ""It's because of people like you that this law had to be enacted,"" one of the men scolds her. The hecklers were from Bajrang Dal, a hardline Hindu group which supports Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  The law they are talking about is the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance that the state recently brought in to target ""love jihad"" - an Islamophobic term radical Hindu groups use to imply that Muslim men prey on Hindu women to convert them to Islam through marriage. The incident in the video took place on 5 December. The Bajrang Dal activists handed over the 22-year-old woman, her husband and his brother to the police, who then sent her to a government shelter and arrested the men.  Days later, the woman, who was seven weeks pregnant, alleged she suffered a miscarriage while in custody.  Earlier this week, a court allowed her to return to her husband's home after she told the magistrate that she was an adult and had married the Muslim man by choice. Her husband and brother-in-law remain in jail. In media interviews since being released on Monday evening, she has accused the staff at the shelter of mistreating her and said that her initial complaints of stomach pain were ignored. The shelter has denied the allegations. ""When my condition deteriorated, they took me to a hospital [on 11 December]. After a blood test, I was admitted and they gave me injections, after which I started bleeding."" Two days later, she said, she was given more injections. The bleeding increased and her health worsened, leading to the loss of her baby, she says. Whether that is true and what exactly happened in the hospital is still unclear.  On Monday morning, while she was still in detention, the authorities rubbished reports that she had miscarried. The reports were based on interviews with her mother-in-law. The chairperson of the Child Protection Commission, Vishesh Gupta, denied all reports of the miscarriage and went as far as to insist that ""the baby is safe"".  A gynaecologist at the hospital where she was treated told reporters that ""the seven-week-old foetus could be seen in the ultrasound"". However, the doctor added only ""a trans-vaginal test could confirm whether the baby was safe or not"". But the authorities have not yet commented on the allegations she has made since her release. They have also not given her the results of her ultrasound examinations or details of which medicines she was injected with. So, five days after she was first taken to hospital, there's still no clarity on the status of the baby, raising questions and doubts. But reports that the young woman may have had a miscarriage have caused outrage in India, with many taking to social media to blame the authorities for it. In India, interfaith marriages have long attracted censure, with families often opposing such unions.  But the new law, which stipulates that anyone wishing to convert must seek approval from the district authorities, gives the state a direct power over the citizens' right to love and choose a spouse.  It carries a jail term of up to 10 years and offences under it are non-bailable. At least four other BJP-governed states are drafting similar laws against ""love jihad"".  Critics have called the law regressive and offensive and said it would be used as a tool to target interfaith couples, especially liaisons between Hindu women and Muslim men.  A petition has also been filed in the Supreme Court, demanding that it be scrapped. In the short time since it was passed on 29 November, at least half a dozen cases have been reported under the controversial law.  Weddings of interfaith couples, between consenting adults and even those involving parental approval, have been halted and Muslim grooms have been arrested.  The 22-year-old woman says she had converted to Islam and married her Muslim husband in July in Dehradun, a city in the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand. They were intercepted when they came to Moradabad to register their wedding.  ""The biggest problem with a law like this is that it treats interfaith love as a criminal activity,"" says historian Charu Gupta. ""It also refuses to believe that a woman has agency, it disregards her free will. Isn't it a woman's choice who she wants to marry? And even if she wants to convert to another religion, what is the problem? ""This law,"" she says, ""is so wide in its range and scope, and it puts the onus on those charged under it to prove their innocence. And that is very dangerous."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-59622430,Why Salah's new Liverpool deal goes beyond football,"The ""Egyptian King"" has won as many, if not more, plaudits for his persona and conduct off the pitch.",2 Jul 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Ask any Liverpool fan what they think of Mohamed Salah's new contract and you will get a mixture of relief and joy that he will be ""running down the wing"" for another three years. In his first season after moving from Italian club Roma in 2017, the ""Egyptian King"" was the Premier League's top scorer, and he then went on to help the club become European and English champions. But he's won as many - if not more - plaudits for his persona and conduct off the pitch, helping to change perceptions of elite footballers and break cultural boundaries. His charitable contributions - to education, healthcare and animal rights projects - have won praise and prompted a former football communications officer to remark that he has ""never forgotten his roots"". But it was his act of prostrating in prayer after goals that reverberated in the wider global consciousness, even among those who don't follow football. In 2015, two Liverpool fans performing the ritual Islamic prayer at Anfield were described as a ""disgrace"" by one Twitter user, who received widespread criticism for his comment.  Dr Solava Ibrahim, an Egyptian-British lecturer in international politics at Anglia Ruskin University, describes the then ""dominant discourse"" about Muslims as ""being violent or constantly linked to terrorist attacks or debates around women's subjugation"". So as a long-time Liverpool supporter, she says it was ""a huge wow moment"" when fans started singing that Salah was ""a gift from Allah"" and that ""if he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too"". ""It was showing not just acceptance but his position as a role model - not just for Arabs, Middle East and Africa but also for UK youngsters,"" she adds. Najib Al-Hakimi, who works as a co-ordinator at the Liverpool Arabic Centre said he was ""thrilled"" by the song, ""because people were looking at Muslims as if they were ignorant and terrorists"".  ""But by his actions, he was able to change that,"" he adds. He has since noticed more members of the local Arab community going to Anfield in recent years, adding: ""Most of the youth are wearing his shirt and they'll talk about him, how good he is."" Liverpool fan Neil Atkinson, who writes for The Anfield Wrap, has also noticed that ""there's definitely been an element of shifting"" across Merseyside. ""If people feel that the Muslim faith is other, Salah's actions are significant,"" he says. ""After he prays on the pitch, I love that he'll turn to celebrate with the crowd and he's also celebrating himself, which are good things."" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has previously spoken about how the team incorporate time for Salah to perform religious rituals as part of match preparations.  Club captain Jordan Henderson has also said the team opts for non-alcoholic champagne at trophy presentations, adding: ""Within the dressing rooms there's none of that [intolerance] so why isn't that the case in the outside world?"" Mr Atkinson believes the wider city of Liverpool ""sees itself as quite different to the rest of England because it's a port… it wants to be more outward-looking"". Salah also gets a hero's reception when he is spotted out and about around Liverpool. One young boy famously faced the force of his - literally - unswerving devotion when he ran into a lamppost while chasing Salah's car in 2019.  Louis Fowler bust his nose but was said to be ""made up"" when the player turned back to check on him. Dr Ibrahim says the incident demonstrates Salah's ""human touch and accessibility"". ""He is much more famous than a lot of Nobel Prize winners but he's not seen as someone up in the clouds or in the elite classes, I think that's part of why his messages get through,"" she says. Salah has previously spoken about how women ""deserve more than what [society] give her now"" and has since appeared in a Women's Day promotional video with his eldest daughter Makka, while also asking his wife Magi to accept the Golden Foot award on his behalf last year. ""You need to see the message,"" says Dr Ibrahim.  ""It's not just rhetoric and action - and that's the power. It's subtle and real."" In one of many academic studies of what's now known as the ""Salah effect"", a number of Brits shared their views about how he had ""opened people up to thinking about Islam in a different way"". Prof Grant Jarvie, who co-authored the research for the University of Edinburgh, said: ""We were surprised - not so much about the impact of Mohamed Salah - but with these sort of studies, you normally get a mix of criticism and good things. But generally speaking, people were positive about Salah on and off the field.""  He says the striker demonstrates ""soft power potential"", adding that ""sport can be a good enabler of cultural relations"". The player's impact in reducing Islamophobia - particularly in a city with Britain's oldest mosque - has been described as ""phenomenal"" by Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram, while Time magazine named Salah among the world's 100 most influential people in 2019. It's not been all goals and glory though.  Salah divided public opinion during the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations after suggesting an Egyptian team-mate who apologised for committing sexual harassment should be given a ""second chance"".   Merseyside Police also had to remind him not to use a mobile phone while driving after he was filmed using a device in a car, which was surrounded by fans.   However, Salah's reputation remains relatively untarnished and with that comes a boost for Liverpool as a city.  While the region played a key role during the British Empire and later in culture and sport, its landmarks are becoming an increasingly familiar backdrop for adverts by Salah's international sponsors. In echoes of The Beatles film A Hard Day's Night, a recent one shows him being chased by fans in a Pepsi commercial for Middle Eastern audiences. Mr Atkinson says Salah's contract extension enables the striker to thrive in ""that reflected glory of being Muslim, Arab, Egyptian, all the different parts of his identity - it makes everything brilliant for himself and Liverpool"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-59171107,'I could have been a racist killer',"As a teenager, Mike was an armed and angry US Nazi. Looking back, he fears he came close to murder.",13 Nov 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In his late teens, Mike became a Nazi. Now, only six years later, he is a supporter of Black Lives Matter - and it worries him deeply to think how close he came, at the angriest stage of his life, to going out with his gun and shooting people.  When Mike locked eyes for a brief moment with the man who had just fallen to the ground, he could tell that he was going to die. It was a frantic night in downtown Oakland, California, and the wind was sharp with the sting of tear gas as it whipped palm trees up into a frenzy.  Three days after the murder of George Floyd, protests in support of Black Lives Matter were breaking out across the US. Mike had been protesting with his girlfriend but as night fell and the police started firing rubber bullets and tear gas, they decided to leave. They were walking back to their car, along streets filled with the black smoke of burning rubbish bins, when they saw a white van pull up. Then they heard the gunshots. The van pulled away as a man in uniform slumped to the ground. Mike moved towards him, trying to remember the first aid training he had learned in the military. But a police car arrived and a jittery gun-wielding officer jumped out and ordered Mike to leave. Later he learned that Dave Patrick Underwood, a federal officer who had been guarding the courthouse, had died at the scene. More than a year on, it still haunts Mike that he couldn't do more to save him. By coincidence, Mike had a connection to Underwood; he had been marching that day with members of his family. But he was also connected to the man who was later charged with his murder. Steven Carillo was a sergeant at the same California Air Force base where Mike had enlisted just a few years earlier. And that wasn't all.   Mike had a secret. At home in his wardrobe there was a uniform made of grey-green khaki fabric, with a Nazi symbol on the collar.  Mike kept it hanging there to remind himself of the person he used to be, someone who wanted to go out and kill people.  Like Carillo, Mike had fallen down the rabbit hole of extremism, and become a follower of America's violent far-right. In the summer before Mike's final year at school he watched as the first wave of Black Lives Matter protests rolled out across the US, but taking part was the furthest thing from his mind. ""I thought they were Satan incarnate,"" he says. He had just met a new friend through a messaging group online. Paul (not his real name) invited Mike to visit his home, where he lived with his parents. It was an ordinary house on a quiet cul-de-sac in an upmarket suburb of a major US city. They were meeting to ""shoot some propaganda videos"". Paul opened the door in full Nazi uniform. He took Mike straight to his garage. ""It was just like a clothing store for Nazis,"" Mike says. The walls were lined with weapons - ammunition, cartridges and many guns."" Paul had gathered a few other young men for the shoot. They loaded guns and ammunition into a truck and drove out to some nearby hills. ""We were on a state park firing semi-automatic and automatic weapons, filming and running around in Nazi uniforms,"" Mike says. Then the park rangers appeared. Paul was annoyed. ""He was just kind of standing there and he's not really having any of it. He's not wanting to listen to this government authority telling him that he cannot do what he thinks he's entitled to do, which is make videos and pretend to be the Wehrmacht [the armed forces of Nazi Germany]."" The rangers confiscated all the guns they could see, but the boys had hidden some of them and just loaded them back in the truck once they were alone again. Then they went back to Paul's house and hung out with his parents - still wearing their Nazi uniforms. Mike was 17 and says he had become the perfect vessel for toxic extremism. He had spent his childhood in a small, rural, mostly white town. Days were spent kayaking on the lake or cycling around town with his tight-knit group of friends. Adults and kids would hang out together and dinner parties and barbecues were spontaneous. It was a place where everybody knew everybody. But Mike's stepfather was an alcoholic who could lash out violently, and when Mike was 12 his mother got a divorce and moved with the children to another part of the country. Suddenly Mike was living in a sweltering, multi-racial urban neighbourhood, and he hated it. ""There were people there who didn't look like anything that I had ever seen before, the food was different, the water tasted different, everything just completely different."" They were also much less well off now, and the stepfather - whom Mike had been close to, despite his violent outbursts - never kept a promise to visit the children. All this made Mike angry, and he found an outlet for that anger in the alt-right.  Encouraged by the father of a friend, Mike began listening to right-wing talk show host Sean Hannity, and when he searched for similar content online he found alt-right videos and podcasts on Facebook and YouTube. Social media algorithms were already creating what is known as the rabbit-hole effect - leading him to content that became more and more extreme. Here he was told, for example, that divorce was a Jewish conspiracy meant to destroy the ideal white family. ""For whatever reason, for me that was easier to believe than that my stepdad was a degenerate alcoholic,"" he says. Eventually Mike migrated to the darkest corners of the internet - to white nationalist message boards on 4chan and 8chan. These sites were like a social club for racists, Nazis and white nationalists, where people could say the N-word while getting to know one another, Mike says. He started exchanging messages with a group of neo-Nazis in the San Francisco Bay area and that is how he ended up on Paul's doorstep that summer afternoon. ""I was just looking for a place to put all my anger,"" Mike says. ""And it found a perfect home."" A year later, Mike finished school. When he didn't get into his preferred universities, he said he would join the Navy instead, but his mother was against the idea. They settled on a completely different plan - Mike would go to a business school in London.  In the UK, Mike expected bowler hats and gentlemen - his image of London was like something out of a Victorian novel. The reality was very different. His school was in Whitechapel, an area with a vibrant Muslim community. ""I was an 18-year-old, radical white nationalist deeply fearful, deeply Islamophobic and I arrived in Whitechapel at a flat that was sandwiched between the Royal London Hospital and the East London Mosque,"" he says. ""I definitely didn't see the diversity there as a positive thing, I looked at it as an example of everything that was wrong in the world."" During his time in London, Mike sank deeper and deeper into white nationalism. Most of his activity was online - he digitally stalked and harassed American left-wing celebrities for months with a team of other extremists - though one day he also walked up to a mosque and dropped a packet of bacon on the doorstep.  He stopped going to classes and after a few months he got a letter from the Home Office that his student visa was going to be revoked. One afternoon in April 2017, he was on his way to meet some friends at a pub on Parliament Square. While he was on the train passengers were told that Westminster station had been closed because of a police operation - they had to get off at the station before. A vehicle had mounted the footpath on Westminster Bridge at 70mph and mowed down pedestrians. The driver then got out and stabbed a police officer; six people died, including the attacker, and 50 were injured. Mike emerged from the Tube station to a scene of panic. The sight of two children wrapped in foil blankets handed out by the emergency services is imprinted on his mind. At this stage, IS was still a powerful force in the Middle East. It said it was responsible for the attack, one of a number carried out across Europe while it was at its most influential. Mike tried to sign up to the military the next day. Some of the white nationalists he had been speaking to online were military men and he took his cue from them. He was rejected from the RAF because of his nationality, but within weeks he was back in California enlisting with the USAF. ""I was supercharged, like really supercharged. I mean, there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to go to somebody else's country, whether it be Iraq or Afghanistan, put on a uniform and pick up a gun and kill them."" In the weeks before he began his military training, he spent hours in his garage drinking and chain-smoking cigarettes, full of rage. ""I almost always had a gun with me,"" he says. ""And I was at the point where if somebody had told me to do something, I would have done it."" In that period, he could have become a Steven Carillo, he now fears - though there was another incident later in 2020 where this feeling hit him with particular intensity. A few months after the protests in Oakland, rioting engulfed Kenosha in Wisconsin when a black man was shot in an encounter with police.  A 17-year-old boy called Kyle Rittenhouse joined a vigilante group formed to defend the city from what an organiser called ""evil thugs"". He shot three people with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and is now on trial accused of intentional homicide and recklessly endangering safety. Mike found it hard to read about. ""I look at that young teenager and I'm like, 'Wow, that was really close to being me,'"" he says. In February this year, the Pentagon issued a ""stand down"" against extremism - an order to leaders across the military to address extremism in their troops. At the same time, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin set up a working group to determine how to spot ""insider threats"" and explained that prospective recruits would now be screened for extremist affiliations. These moves came after early analyses of those arrested in the Capitol Hill riots on 6 January suggested a troubling proportion were acting or former servicemen and women - including Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran killed by a police officer as she tried to break through a barricaded door. A 2020 Military Times online poll of 1,108 readers on active duty, found that just under a third had seen signs of racist or white supremacist behaviour within the military.  Among those charged with offences in 2020 - apart from Steve Carillo - were US Army private Ethan Melzer, accused of preparing the ground for a deadly ambush on his unit by sending information to a neo-Nazi group, and three extremist veterans accused of carrying Molotov cocktails to throw at police during a Black Lives Matter protest in Las Vegas. But perhaps surprisingly, for Mike the military would be the start of his journey out of far-right extremism.  In late 2017, he was in the second month of his training, stationed deep in the woods of Missouri. ""I was just stuck in the middle of nowhere with all sorts of people from all over the US - including black guys, Jewish guys, a guy from Guam who taught me how to spear fish,"" he says. ""I was making friends with people who I would never have considered being friends with before."" He found military boot camp difficult. The hours were gruelling and the lack of autonomy - the control that his superiors had over his every move - was hard to deal with. ""It's one thing to be some kid, chain-smoking and reading 4chan and getting riled up in your garage,"" he says. ""To then finding yourself in the middle of nowhere, on an Air Force base that you cannot leave and people are screaming at you."" He was miserable and tried to quit basic training six times in eight weeks. His mother wasn't talking to him - he thinks perhaps she knew he had joined the military for the wrong reasons. Letters were a lifeline for recruits but in the first five weeks Mike received none. When the other trainees had time each week to read their letters, Mike sat alone wallowing in his misery. One day another recruit, who was black, noticed this. ""Hey man,"" he said, picking up a Bible. ""Let's pray together."" It was one of many small gestures that helped Mike to survive basic training and ultimately changed his outlook on life. ""Why are you helping me?"" Mike thought. ""I thought you wanted to destroy me."" Over the next few weeks, this recruit and another young Jewish man would support Mike through his darkest moments, with a friendly pat on the back when he was struggling or a quiet, ""Hey man, you can do this."" During training he was also removed from the echo chamber that had been reinforcing his racist beliefs. He didn't have time to go online and without the toxic propaganda that had filled his days, hate was loosening its grip on him. By the time he emerged from basic training Mike knew he didn't want to be in the military. He spent several months working at an Air Force base, but he was deeply depressed.  He reached his lowest ebb shortly before he was due to be sent to Afghanistan. ""I knew I was being deployed. I was under a lot of stress, [there was] just too much alcohol about one night and access to a firearm."" He came close to killing himself and was put on unpaid medical leave. It's an episode he finds difficult to discuss. Although in his case basic training helped him break away from extremism, Mike doesn't think it's a coincidence that a number of those involved in far-right violence in recent years served in the military. He believes that some extremists may join the military, as he did, eager for an opportunity to kill people of a different race. Others, he suggests, sign up because they think the training will help them overthrow the state, while a third group become disillusioned and radicalised as a result of their experience in the ranks. ""They feel taken advantage of, not understood and lied to,"" he says. One of these is a friend who Mike has seen on social media showing support for an anti-government militia group. ""He served for 16 to 20 years and he's been to two wars - two wars that were about a lie,"" Mike says, referring to Iraq and Afghanistan. Last month the Institute for Strategic Dialogue released a report looking at discussion of the military by far-right extremists on the messaging app Telegram. They found a small number of extremists claimed to be veterans, but they also saw that the military was generally discussed in a negative light. ""This is largely due to the perception that the US's interventions abroad serve Israeli interests rather than those of the white race,"" the report says. Mike also started to believe that America's wars were pointless, but he accepted his racism was pointless too. ""I started kind of realising, about 70 years later than everybody else, that Hitler was clearly wrong,"" he says. As Mike's ideas on race started to change he got in touch with Christian Picciolini, a former neo-Nazi who now channels his energies into deradicalisation. ""He told me to practise empathy, being non-judgmental, being honest, and always being self-reflective - essentially to find a way to make good happen,"" Mike says. He started working at a music venue and became enamoured of the punk rock scene. It was the outlet that he needed for anger he'd built up from his unsettled childhood. Punk became his saviour. ""My punk rock community has been the one of the biggest things in getting me out. I think how vital it is to have an outlet and to have a group where you feel like you belong. But a constructive group,"" he says. After his medical leave ran out, Mike didn't return to the military and was classified as Awol. Then, last December, to his surprise, he was honourably discharged.  Sometimes he worries that extremism still has a grip over him. Towards the end of 2019 a deli that he was working in was robbed by two young black men and an older woman was assaulted, Mike tried to stop them and they pulled out a gun. Later that night Mike recognised the same ugly, dehumanising, racist ideas crowding his thoughts again but he fought against them. ""I've made continual efforts to be anti-racist, to be actively anti-racist. But it is difficult and I don't want to pretend like it isn't."" As he clawed his way out of the extremist rabbit hole, he saw some Americans fall deeper into it. Oakland and Kenosha weren't the only places where Black Lives Matters protesters were injured and Mike was horrified by the attack on Capitol Hill. The US is a loosely bound ""union of otherwise warring clans"", he says. ""And when you decide to drop a match on it, it can get incredibly dangerous. I've already seen a tremendous amount of violence."" Mike wants people to understand how easy it is in America today for extremist ideology to take over someone's life. ""I was a teenager with basic internet access in suburban California, and I became radicalised enough to want to commit acts of violence against people because of the colour of their skin or their religion,"" he says. ""The thing I want people to know is that I was a Nazi. Not in 1939 Bavaria but in modern-day America."" Mike is a pseudonym Just one conversation was enough to recruit Christian Picciolini into the neo-Nazi movement, but it took him years to get out. To make amends for his wrongdoing, he has spent the last quarter of a century persuading hundreds of others to make a break with extremism.

A Polish sausage store and an Eastern European bakery sit alongside a Yemeni department store and a Bengali clothing shop. Church bells ring out along with the Islamic call to prayer.  ""The world in two square miles"" - Hamtramck lives up to its slogan, with around 30 languages spoken within its 5 sq km area. This month, the Midwestern city of 28,000 has reached a milestone. Hamtramck has elected an all-Muslim City Council and a Muslim mayor, becoming the first in the US to have a Muslim-American government. Once faced with discrimination, Muslim residents have become integral to this multicultural city, and now make up more than half its population.  And despite economic challenges and intense cultural debates, residents in Hamtramck from different religious and cultural backgrounds coexist in harmony, making the city a meaningful case study for America's future of rising diversity. But will Hamtramck be an exception or a rule? The arc of Hamtramck's history from beginnings as a town of German settlers to the modern day - it was America's first majority-Muslim city - is etched in its streets.  Storefronts display signs in Arabic and Bengali,  embroidered Bangladeshi garments and Jambiyas, a type of short curved blade from Yemen, are seen in store windows. Muslim residents queue up to buy paczki, a kind of custard-filled Polish doughnut. ""It's not unusual to see some with miniskirts and tattoos and some in burqas walking on the same street. This is all about us,"" said Zlatan Sadikovic, a Bosnian immigrant who owns a café in downtown Hamtramck.  A stone's throw outside central Detroit, which largely envelops the city, Hamtramck was once part of the epicentre of America's automotive industry, dominated by the General Motors plant that straddled its border with 'Motor City'. The first Cadillac Eldorado rolled off the assembly line in Hamtramck in the 1980s. Over the course of the 20th Century, it became known as ""Little Warsaw"", as Polish immigrants flocked in for the blue-collar jobs. The city was one of the stops of Polish-born Pope John Paul II's US tour in 1987. In 1970, as much as 90% of the city was of Polish origin.  However, that decade saw the beginning of the long decline of US car manufacturing, and younger, wealthier Polish Americans began moving to the suburbs. The change made Hamtramck one of Michigan's poorest cities, but the affordability attracted immigrants. Over the last 30 years, Hamtramck transformed again, to become a landing pad for Arab and Asian immigrants, notably those from Yemen and Bangladesh. A significant portion of the city's residents today - 42% - are foreign born. More than half are believed to be practising Muslims. The newly elected government's makeup reflects the changing demographics in Hamtramck. The city council will include two Bengali Americans, three Yemeni Americans and a Polish-American convert to Islam. Winning 68% of the vote, Amer Ghalib will be the first Yemeni-American mayor in the US. ""I feel honoured and proud, but I know it's a big responsibility,"" Mr Ghalib, 41, said. Born in a village in Yemen, he moved to the US when he was 17, first working in a factory making plastic car parts near Hamtramck. He later learned English and received medical training, and now works as a healthcare professional. Rather than being a ""melting pot"" or ""salad bowl"", Hamtramck is more like a ""seven-layer cake"" where different groups retain their distinct cultures while closely co-existing with each other, said city councilmember-elect Amanda Jaczkowski. ""People are still proud of their culture specifically, whereas if it's assimilation, we would lose the uniqueness."" ""When you live this close to each other, you are forced to overcome those differences,"" Ms Jaczkowski, 29, said. But Hamtramck ""is not Disneyland"", said Karen Majewski, the outgoing mayor who will have served in office for 15 years before stepping down. ""It's just a small place. And we do have conflicts."" Friction arose in 2004 following a vote to broadcast the Islamic call to prayer in public. Some residents have argued that a ban on bars near mosques hurts the local economy. Six years ago, when it became the first American city to elect a Muslim-majority government, press from all over the world descended upon Hamtramck. Some media reports at the time painted a picture of a ""tense"" town with an influx of Muslims. A national TV anchor asked whether Ms Majewski was afraid of being mayor.  There was even speculation from some that a Muslim-controlled city council might impose Shariah law. ""In Hamtramck, people roll their eyes at that kind of talk,"" said Ms Majewski.  She was ""gratified"" that Hamtramck has been a welcoming community, she said, and it's ""natural"" for new residents to vote for those who understand their experience and their languages. The US Census Bureau does not collect information about religion, but the Pew Research Center think tank estimates that there were about 3.85 million Muslims living in the US in 2020, making up about 1.1% of the total population. By 2040, Muslims are projected to become the second largest religious group in the US, after Christians. Despite their growing presence, Muslims in America have often been subjected to prejudice.  Twenty years after the 9/11 attack, Islamophobia still haunts Muslims and other Arab Americans. Close to half of Muslim-American adults told Pew in 2016 that they had personally experienced some form of discrimination, when the then-candidate Donald Trump proposed a ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries entering the US. Researchers also found that among all religious groups, Muslims still face the most negative views from the American public.  More than half of Americans say they do not personally know any Muslims, but those who personally know a believer are less likely to think that Islam encourages violence more than other religions.  Hamtramck is a living example of how personal knowledge curtails Islamophobia.  When Shahab Ahmed ran for city councilmember shortly after the 9/11 attack, he faced an uphill battle. ""There were flyers all over the city saying I am the 20th hijacker that didn't make it to the airplanes,"" the Bengali American said. After he lost the election in 2001, Mr Ahmed knocked on neighbours' doors to introduce himself. He was elected two years later, becoming Hamtramck's first Muslim city official. Since then, support for the Muslim community has grown in the city. In 2017, when the Trump administration imposed the entry ban, residents came together to protest. ""In a way it mobilised and unified a lot of people because everybody knows that in order to live in Hamtramck, you have to respect other people,"" said Razi Jafri, co-director of documentary film ""Hamtramck, USA"". Nationally, Muslim Americans have also become more politically visible. In 2007, Minnesotan Democrat Keith Ellison became the first Muslim congressman. The current US Congress has four Muslim members.  On Hamtramck election day this month, dozens of residents gathered in front of a polling station to greet each other, many showing off their Election Day souvenir, the ""I voted"" sticker. Immigrants were excited to participate in democracy, Ms Jaczkowski said. ""It's a very American thing to be able to bring people together"". But as with the rest of the country, intense cultural debates are taking place in the city. In June, when the city government approved flying a gay pride flag in front of the city hall, some residents were incensed. Several pride flags hanging outside of private businesses and homes were torn down, including one outside of a vintage clothing store downtown owned by Ms Majewski. ""That sends a really alarming message to people,"" she said. Marijuana has also become a source of controversy. Three dispensaries opening in Hamtramck have prompted dismay from some in both Muslim and Polish-Catholic communities. Other residents are concerned about a lack of women's political participation in conservative Muslim communities.  On election night, Mr Ghalib, the mayor-elect, was surrounded by a jubilant Yemeni-American crowd in a post-election party serving baklava and kebabs. More than 100 supporters were there, all of them men. Women participated in his campaign, Mr Ghalib said, but segregation of the sexes remains traditional,  even as it is being challenged by younger generations who have become more ""Americanised"", he said.  Hamtramck also faces challenges common to Rust Belt cities, from decayed infrastructure to limited economic opportunity. Heavy rains over the summer overwhelmed the city's sewers and flooded many homes. High levels of lead were found in city drinking water samples, garnering national attention. Nearly half of the city is below the poverty line. These are just some of the pressing issues that the new city leadership would have to grapple with. ""What does democracy look like in a Muslim majority city? Like everywhere else, messy and complicated,"" said the documentary filmmaker Mr Jafri, ""So when the novelty wears off, the work needs to be done."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51596125,Ryanair boss criticised for Muslim profiling claim,"The Ryanair boss says Muslim men should be profiled at airports because ""that is where the threat is"".",22 Feb 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has been criticised for saying Muslim men should be profiled at airports. The chief executive told the Times that ""males of a Muslim persuasion"" who are single and travelling alone pose the largest terror threat to airlines. The Muslim Council of Britain said Mr O'Leary's comments were ""racist and discriminatory"".  Ryanair later said Mr O'Leary was ""only calling for more effective airport security checks"". In the wide-ranging interview, Mr O'Leary, 58, said: ""Who are the bombers? They are going to be single males travelling on their own. If you are travelling with a family of kids, on you go; the chances you are going to blow them all up is zero. ""You can't say stuff, because it's racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion. Thirty years ago it was the Irish. If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat."" The MCB described Mr O'Leary's comments as the ""definition of Islamophobia"" and said Muslims face institutional discrimination in many aspects of life. ""Institutional discrimination against Muslims is well established: whether it is the ability to get a job, buy a flat or even getting car insurance. The challenges of #flyingwhilstMuslim are well documented across the globe,"" a spokesperson said. ""It is a shame that such racism is being expressed so openly, and that the CEO of a large airline would so want to discriminate against his customers so brazenly."" Ryanair said in a statement released on Saturday that ""no call for extra checks on any group or persons was made"" by Mr O'Leary in the Times interview, headlined ""Airline boss wants extra checks on Muslim men"". ""Michael was only calling for more effective airport security checks which would do away with much of the unnecessary queues at airport security today for all passengers,"" a spokesperson said. ""He apologises sincerely for any offence caused to any group by today's inaccurate headline."" Civil liberty groups have argued profiling, including on the basis of race, religion or gender, violates people's rights. One profiling expert previously told the BBC that the benefit of such profiling only outweighs the cost in exceptional circumstances. Airlines in the UK have previously said airport security checks should be reduced to improve the experience for passengers. People arriving and leaving the UK are already profiled by border agencies and police through advanced passenger information, including payment details and passport numbers. Mr O'Leary, who has worked for Ryanair for 30 years, also used the interview to lament planning rules requiring the company to provide facilities for disabled staff and referred to obese passengers as ""monsters"" who ""may need to buy two seats"". And on the introduction of its new Boeing 737 Max planes, Mr O'Leary suggested Ryanair may offer discounts to entice passengers to fly on the crisis-hit aeroplane when it eventually re-enters service. He said the jet - which has been grounded worldwide since March 2019 following two fatal crashes - ""will be the safest, most checked"" plane. He added: ""But we have a customer confidence issue. We will deal with that by hopefully having lower fares onboard the plane while trying it out."" Mr O'Leary told the Independent last year passengers would not get a refund if they refused to fly on a Ryanair 737 Max."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43208945,Is Salah helping Muslim fans engage with football?,Is the success of Premier League players like Mohamed Salah and Mesut Ozil helping Muslim fans engage with football?,1 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Mohamed Salah has scored 23 goals in 27 Premier League games this season Mesut Ozil, Mousa Dembele, Riyad Mahrez, Paul Pogba and Mohamed Salah are among the Muslim players now starring in the Premier League. Their faith can be seen in their mannerisms on the pitch - cupping hands in silent pre-kick-off prayer or prostration after hitting the back of the net.  For Salah, who has 23 Premier League goals for Liverpool this season, his religion has become the unlikely inspiration for some Liverpool fans to rewrite the lyrics to 1996 hit Good Enough by Dodgy. The words of the chorus are adjusted to celebrate the feats of the Egyptian striker: ""If he's good enough for you he's good enough for me, if he scores another few then I'll be Muslim too. If he's good enough for you he's good enough for me, he's sitting in the mosque that's where I wanna be."" A video posted on Twitter with a group of Reds fans performing the song went viral, and tens of thousands of hits later even non-Liverpool fans have put allegiances aside in praise of the video and its lyrics. This video can not be played Mohamed Salah inspires 'I'll be Muslim too' chant In his hometown of Besayoun near Cairo, Salah would have been four years old at the time of the song's original release so it is unlikely that he would have heard it then. The 25-year-old has certainly heard it now. The video has received mainstream media coverage and Liverpool fan and club member Asif Bodi believes it is an exercise in inclusivity. He likes the song's message and is adamant that Salah and the video have had a unifying effect in Liverpool, which was the home of solicitor William Quilliam, the first English Muslim convert to Islam in 1887, and where he opened the UK's first mosque and Islamic centre. Abubakar Bulla (left) and Asif Bodi (right) are ardent Liverpool supporters ""The Mo Salah song shows how tolerant and welcoming the people of Liverpool really are. Historically Liverpool has a reputation of welcoming visitors and also is the site of one of the first mosques in the British Isles,"" said Bodi. ""It's great to see all the positive outpouring of affection towards Mohamed. I would get behind any Liverpool player but I can't hide my pride that Mo is not only a great Liverpool player but he is also a fellow devout Muslim too."" A regular at Anfield, Bodi is part of a large number of Muslims who support Liverpool, and he says Salah's performances and goals have seen that number grow. ""The success of Salah has also led to an increase in the Liverpool fan base in the UK and around the Muslim world. I was pleased to hear of a 10-year-old Manchester United fan who became a Liverpool fan because of the song. That can only be good,"" he adds. This video can not be played Liverpool's Mohamed Salah wins 2017 BBC African Footballer of the Year Like Salah, German World Cup winner Ozil is proud of his religion and happy to show it on the pitch. ""I'm a Muslim, I believe in that. You can see before games that I pray and that I'm pleased to be able to go on this path. It gives me a lot of strength,"" he said. ""I'm someone who's always been thankful, someone who doesn't just wish the best for me but for the people. It's a very important part of my life. What's important is to come together and show respect.""  Like an increasing number of grounds in the Premier League, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium incorporates a multi-faith fans' prayer room. When a prayer time arrives during a match, fans have a place to congregate safely to focus on their faith for the few minutes it takes before returning to their seats. Arsenal's Muslim fans and matchday staff cram into their tiny concourse room to offer their prayers. Mesut Ozil prays before a game between Arsenal and Burnley in January 2017 In September 2016, the new main stand at Anfield was completed and a multi-faith fans' prayer room was included in the redevelopment. This was not only in response to the diverse needs of the Liverpool fan base, but also in response to a previous experience for Bodi and fellow solicitor and Reds' Muslim fan Abubakar Bulla in 2015. Images of both Bodi and Bhula praying at Anfield caused a storm on Twitter with one Liverpool fan tweeting ""Muslims praying at half-time at the match yesterday. #Disgrace.""  Liverpool were swift to distance themselves from that comment and condemned the tweet, as did other Liverpool fans on social media. Looking back, Bodi and Bulla wonder if those fans who had a negative view on their praying are now the same fans cheering loudly as Muslim striker Salah smashes in another goal and breaks another goal-scoring record, all celebrated with an on-field prostration to his faith. ""I now think that the negative Twitter reaction to our praying was the reaction of a very small minority, and the Mo Salah song displays the true feelings of Liverpudlians,"" reflected Bodi, who praised Liverpool's fans' prayer room.  ""This facility has undoubtedly led to a greater number of Muslims attending games. Its success can be judged by the fact that it has been outgrown with many more people wishing to use it than it can accommodate at any specific time."" This video can not be played Football Focus: Mohamed Salah joined Liverpool 'to win titles'  In east London in October 2013, during a game between West Ham and Manchester City, a small group of home Muslim fans - with no prayer room available - tried to offer their Maghrib (sunset) prayer on a concourse under the main stand at the club's former home Upton Park.  Videos later emerged on social media of the group suffering horrific racist and Islamophobic abuse. Spurred into action, and to avoid any future misunderstandings, the club ensured that their new home, London Stadium, would have a multi-faith prayer room. Asian Network Reports: Muslims face racist chants at West Ham Over in the West Midlands, the borough of Sandwell has been described as one of the most deprived areas in Britain. Hard-working white and ethnic minority communities live and work here in a catchment area for West Bromwich Albion.  A stone's throw from The Hawthorns is Oldbury, home to Baggies fan Ashley Rawlins. A season ticket holder, Rawlins embraced Islam in 2012. He likes the Salah video, and is well positioned to empathise with fans' understanding on all sides while saluting the performances of Albion's own Muslim players. Ahmed Hegazi was joined by fellow Egyptian Ali Gabr in January. ""I've been on both sides in regards to the Muslim community and seeing the Mo Salah tribute song from Liverpool fans has been such a positive thing,"" he said. ""It shows that football is bringing people together as you wouldn't have seen something like this a few years ago, especially people singing 'sitting in a mosque is where I wanna be'. ""At my club, we have a similar story with regards to Ahmed Hegazi. He is so well received, his bravery in the games has been inspiring and as a result the fans love him. I have his name on the back of my shirt and he is definitely a conversation starter."" Ahmed Hegazi joined West Brom from Egyptian Premier League side Al Ahly In quick time Rawlins, a manager at the Ministry of Justice who also plays semi-professional football, has achieved a greater knowledge and understanding of Islam than many born into the faith. In his office, the 29-year-old is happy to share his knowledge on Islam when he gets asked questions by his fellow workers.  ""At work, I have regular conversations with my team and there is interest in Islam. They ask many questions which I'm happy to answer. If I don't know the answer, I find out and get back to them,"" he said. Away from the top-flight teams, community based clubs need their local fans to turn up and support their team, and if that club is located in a predominantly Muslim community, Rawlins urges them to also attend matches.  But he warns that if the clubs want them to return they will need to address the additional needs, especially when it comes to matchday catering. ""Muslim fans should definitely go to matches to show the general public that there are so many similarities between us, regardless of faith,"" he says. ""I do, however, feel football clubs with a mixed demographic fan base could do more to address the lack of prayer facilities as this is a fundamental part of our faith and many others.""

Salford councillor Mike Pevitt, who represents the Claremont ward, has since deleted the tweets and apologised.  The Conservative opposition have reported Mr Pevitt, alleging that he breached the council's code of conduct. The North West Labour Party refused to comment. But a spokeswoman did confirm that a formal warning had been issued by the party's National Executive Committee (NEC). Mr Pevitt's tweet read: ""You could make it up, nobody bats an eyelid about 350 mosques writing to the Tories about Islamophobia, but Labour get lead in polls and Tories instruct their members to write in."" He has deleted the tweet and apologised for the comments. But Salford City Council's Conservative opposition has called for a council investigation into the tweet and have written to the authority's monitoring officer. Councillor Jillian Collinson, the party's chief whip who represents Boothstown and Ellenbrook, said: ""The Labour Party can do what it likes, this is a breach of the council's standards. ""It's not good enough - if anyone of our group said something like this we would be in big trouble."" Fellow Conservative councillor Rabbi Arnold Saunders added that relations were good between the Jewish community and the Labour Party in Salford. On Tuesday Labour's NEC adopted an international definition of anti-Semitism following months of acrimony. Rabbi Saunders also said: ""Salford's Labour-led council has already adopted this definition of anti-Semitism."" The Labour Party said it takes all such complaints extremely seriously."

There were 224 complaints of attacks and abuse against Muslims in the month after the bombing, on 22 May, in which 22 people were killed. That compares with 37 in the same period in 2016 - a 505% increase. The spike was temporary and hate crime reports have returned to similar levels as before the attack, police said. Immediately after the attack, at an Ariana Grande concert, a bomb threat, racist taunts, and graffiti were among the incidents reported to Greater Manchester Police. Other types of hate crime also increased with a 61% rise in race-related crimes and incidents, a 41% increase in those targeted at disabled people, and a 9% rise related to sexual orientation, according to police figures. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said the city is proud of its diversity and police ""will not tolerate hatred or discrimination of any kind."" It is ""sadly not unusual for there to be a spike"" in hate crimes after this kind of attack but ""thankfully they do decrease again quickly"", he said. Other areas have also reported an increase in attacks. Earlier this month, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, highlighted a five-fold increase in Islamophobic incidents reported to the Met Police since the London attack. ACC Potts said hate crime is often under-reported, echoing Ch Supt Wasim Chaudhry's recent comments that fear is preventing Muslims from reporting hate crimes. He urged people to contact police, Crimestoppers, or organisations like Tell Mama, which supports victims of Islamophobia."

The ban was imposed at a special council session on Sunday in Sisco amid tensions over the brawl, in which five people were hurt. Authorities in Cannes and Villeneuve-Loubet, on the French Riviera, also banned Islamic burkinis this month. Witnesses say hatchets and harpoons were used in the Sisco beach brawl. The five injured on Saturday were later discharged from hospital, but tensions are simmering in the area.  Tension has grown this summer between local communities and Muslims of North African origin in the south of France, especially following the massacre of 85 people by a lorry driver on the seafront at Nice on 14 July.   Court upholds ban on burkinis in Cannes Burkini ban: What do Muslim women think? The Bastille Day massacre in Nice Corsican nationalists warn jihadists Women's rights minister Laurence Rossignol warned that the debate over burkinis was being used for ""ulterior motives"", especially by the far right. While denouncing the burkini as ""profoundly archaic"", she said that in order to combat such outdated ideas, politicians had to maintain their composure. ""I don't want our society being ignited by these subjects."" A woman in a burkini on a French beach: There is heated debate about such costumes But Sisco Mayor Ange-Pierre Vivoni was adamant his decision was ""nothing to do with racism, it's about protecting people's security"". Corsica was ""sitting on a powder-keg"", he said. The ban, which he had considered for some time, was not against Muslims but aimed at protecting people of North African descent as much as anyone else.  The mayors who imposed burkini bans in Cannes and Villeneuve-Loubet are both in the right-wing Republicans (LR) party, while Mr Vivoni is, like the women's rights minister, a Socialist. On Sunday a crowd of more than 200 Corsicans tried to march on a housing estate - Lupino - on the southern edge of Bastia, but were blocked by police. The Muslim families of North African origin were believed to be from Lupino. There were scuffles with police, and some in the crowd chanted ""This is our home!"", France's Le Monde daily reported (in French), external. Finally the crowd dispersed. The justice authorities have launched an investigation to determine exactly what happened on the beach. Police could be seen holding back protesters in the Lupino area of Bastia on Sunday Witnesses say the brawl began after the Muslim families objected to photos being taken by a tourist. When a local teenager, with a group of friends on the beach, also took a photo the brawl erupted. Stones and bottles were thrown. ""It wasn't the burkini that started the row,"" the mayor told French radio. Soon about 40 men from Sisco arrived to defend the youths, witnesses said, and one of the men was slashed with a harpoon blade. According to Le Figaro newspaper (in French), external, some of the older men in the bathing party had attacked the teenagers with hatchets. Villagers allegedly then set alight cars belonging to the bathers.   France has a deep-rooted tradition of secularism, making the wearing of religious symbols in public spaces controversial. Islamic headscarves are banned from French schools and niqabs (full-face veils) and burkas (full-body veils) cannot be worn in public. The head of Corsica's regional executive, Gilles Simeoni, has appealed for calm. At the end of last month, an outlawed Corsican paramilitary group warned Islamist militants against targeting their island.  Mr Vivoni told France Info radio on Monday that the atmosphere in his community was tense and he appealed for the situation to calm down. ""There's a fear but I assure everyone that the community is well protected and in any case I think here we're 'protected from retaliation', so to speak."" A court in Nice has upheld the Cannes ban but a religious group, Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), has said it will take the case to France's highest administrative court.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47583393,Anger as shooter video spreads around world,Why was a video of the shootings shared on social media and what can be done about the wider threat?,17 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A gunman opened fire in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 50 people and injuring 50 more. As he did so, he filmed the entire crime and live-streamed it directly to Facebook. What ensued was an exhausting race for social media pages to take the footage down, as it was replicated seemingly endlessly and shared widely in the wake of the attack. And through social media, it found its way onto the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. This series of events has, once again, shone a spotlight on how sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Reddit try - and fail - to address far-right extremism on their platforms. As the video continued to spread, other members of the public put up their own posts pleading with people to stop sharing it. One pointed out: ""That is what the terrorist wanted."" The video, which shows a first-person view of the killings, has been widely circulated. While huge numbers of people have been duplicating and sharing the footage online, many others responded with disgust - urging others not only not to share the footage, but not even to watch it. Spreading the video, many said, was what the attacker had wanted people to do. A lot of people were particularly angry at media outlets for publishing the footage.  Channel 4 News anchor Krishnan Guru-Murthy, for example, specifically named two British newspaper websites and accused them of hitting ""a new low in clickbait"". Buzzfeed reporter Mark Di Stefano also wrote that MailOnline had allowed readers to download the attacker's 74-page ""manifesto"" from their news report. The website later removed the document, and released a statement saying it was ""an error"".  Daily Mirror editor Lloyd Embley also tweeted that they had removed the footage, and that publishing it was ""not in line with our policy relating to terrorist propaganda videos"". All of the social media firms have sent heartfelt sympathy to the victims of the mass shootings, reiterating that they act quickly to remove inappropriate content.  Facebook said: ""New Zealand Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the live-stream commenced and we removed both the shooter's Facebook account and the video. ""We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware. We will continue working directly with New Zealand Police as their response and investigation continues."" And in a tweet, YouTube said ""our hearts are broken"", adding it was ""working vigilantly"" to remove any violent footage. In terms of what they have done historically to combat the threat of far-right extremists, the social media companies' approach has been more chequered.  Twitter acted to remove alt-right accounts in December 2017. Previously it has removed and then reinstated the account of Richard Spencer, an American white nationalist who popularised the term ""alternative right"". Facebook, which suspended Mr Spencer's account in April 2018, admitted at the time that it was difficult to distinguish between hate speech and legitimate political speech. This month, YouTube was accused of being either incompetent or irresponsible for its handling of a video promoting the banned Neo-Nazi group, National Action. British MP Yvette Cooper said the video-streaming platform had repeatedly promised to block it, only for it to reappear on the service. Dr Ciaran Gillespie, a political scientist from Surrey University, thinks the problem goes far deeper than a video, shocking as that content has been. ""It is not just a question about broadcasting a massacre live. The social media platforms raced to close that down and there is not much they can do about it being shared because of the nature of the platform, but the bigger question is the stuff that goes before it,"" he said. As a political researcher, he uses YouTube ""a lot"" and says that he is often recommended far-right content. ""There is oceans of this content on YouTube and there is no way of estimating how much. YouTube has dealt well with the threat posed by Islamic radicalisation, because this is seen as clearly not legitimate, but the same pressure does not exist to remove far-right content, even though it poses a similar threat. ""There will be more calls for YouTube to stop promoting racist and far-right channels and content."" His views are echoed by Dr Bharath Ganesh, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""Taking down the video is obviously the right thing to do, but social media sites have allowed far-right organisations a place for discussion and there has been no consistent or integrated approach to dealing with it.  ""There has been a tendency to err on the side of freedom of speech, even when it is obvious that some people are spreading toxic and violent ideologies."" Now social media companies need to ""take the threat posed by these ideologies much more seriously"", he added. ""It may mean creating a special category for right-wing extremism, recognising that it has global reach and global networks."" Neither under-estimate the magnitude of the task, especially as many of the exponents of far-right views are adept at, what Dr Gillespie calls, ""legitimate controversy"". ""People will discuss the threat posed by Islam and acknowledge it is contentious but point out that it is legitimate to discuss,"" he said. These grey areas are going to be extremely difficult for the social media firms to tackle, they say, but after the tragedy unfolding in New Zealand, many believe they must try harder."

Professor David Miller was criticised for views he allegedly expressed while working at the University of Bristol.  He was then sacked in 2021 after a disciplinary hearing found he did not meet its ""standards of behaviour"". Speaking at his tribunal, Prof Miller said he was targeted by groups that ""launched attacks on academic freedom"".  The academic drew controversy during a lecture at the university in 2019, when he said the Zionist movement was one of five pillars driving Islamophobia in the UK, the tribunal heard. The University of Bristol subsequently got a complaint from the Community Security Trust charity, which said his lecture was a ""false, vile... antisemitic slur"". An investigation heard the professor of political sociology's behaviour led to Jewish students ""being subjected to weeks of harassment and abuse"". But a report into academic freedom of expression concluded his comments ""did not constitute unlawful speech"". Giving evidence at an employment tribunal at the Bristol Civil Justice Centre on Tuesday, Prof Miller said Bristol University ""refused to defend me against things it knew to be untrue, things which were very damaging to me"". Asked about abuse directed at the then-president of the Bristol University Jewish Society (JSoc), Edward Isaacs, as a result of his criticism of Prof Miller, the academic denied there was any such backlash. Previously employed as a professor of sociology at the universities of Bath and Strathclyde, Prof Miller told the tribunal JSoc was a ""racist"" group because it supported Zionism. Speaking shortly after his dismissal, the former lecturer said the university ""embarrassed itself"" by ""capitulating to a pressure campaign... overseen and directed by a hostile foreign government"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40452360,Trump travel ban comes into effect,"Strict visa rules now apply to people from six mainly Muslim countries, as well as all refugees.",30 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"People from six mainly Muslim countries and all refugees now face tougher US entry due to President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban. It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry.  Lawyers took up positions at US airports, offering free advice. But there was no sign of the chaos that affected travellers when the first version of the ban was brought in at a few hours' notice in January. That is because the executive order does not affect people who already have valid visas or green cards. The Department of Homeland Security said it expected ""business as usual at our ports of entry"". Monday's Supreme Court ruling upheld the temporary ban, a key Trump policy. But the judges provided a major exception, for those who have ""a credible claim of a bona fide relationship"" with someone in the US. The effect is that citizens of the affected countries with a close relative in the US, such as a spouse, parent, child or sibling, will potentially be allowed in. In a last minute change, the Trump administration extended the definition of close family to include fiancés. However grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces are not considered to be ""bona fide"" relations. The rules apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, as well as to all refugees. Moments before the ban began at 20:00 Washington time on Thursday (00:00 GMT), it emerged that the state of Hawaii had asked a federal judge for clarification. Hawaii's attorney general has argued that the definition of ""close family"" is too narrow and may improperly prevent people from travelling to the US. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it would be closely monitoring the guidance and implementation of the order. The Supreme Court is expected to make a final decision on the ban when its next session begins in October. According to the new rules, for the next 90 days those from the six countries without a close relationship will not be able to enter the US. IN - a parent, spouse, fiancé, child, son- or daughter-in-law, or sibling, including step- or half-siblings.  OUT - grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, in-laws, extended family and grandchildren. Also exempt from the new rules are those with business or educational ties to the US.  However, the guidelines specifically state that the relationship must be formal, documented and not formed for the purpose of evading the order. As well as making clear that those with valid visas and legal permanent residents are not affected, the Department of Homeland Security says dual nationals who travel on their passport from the unaffected country will also be allowed entry. The Supreme Court also approved a 120-day ban on refugees entering the US, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who cannot prove the same ties to an American individual or entity. But opponents of the ban point out that refugees are invited to relocate in the US by the UN Refugee Agency, which has well-documented relationships with the people they refer for resettlement.  It remains unclear how many refugees scheduled to resettle in the US will be affected, but the government will fully halt the programme once its quota of 50,000 refugees for the budget year ending in September is met.  The US president insisted his ban was necessary for national security and pointed to terrorist attacks in Paris, London, Brussels and Berlin as evidence.  However, critics called the policy un-American and Islamophobic, and said that this ban would not have stopped atrocities in the US perpetrated by American-born attackers. The original ban, released on 27 January, provoked mass protests at American airports.  It included Iraq among nations whose travellers would be barred from the US, and imposed a full ban on refugees from Syria. The president issued a revised version with a narrower scope on 6 March to overcome some of the legal problems. The policy was left in limbo after it was struck down by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland."

Louis Fowler, 11, was trying to get the Liverpool striker's attention, who was driving out of the club's training base on Saturday, when he ran into the post. The Reds fan fell and ""busted his nose"", his stepfather Joe Cooper said.  He added that they were ""gobsmacked"" when Salah soon turned up at their home nearby to check on Louis' condition.

""Unfortunately, Louis went straight into a lamp-post while running after [Salah's] car and busted his nose when he hit the floor,"" he said. Neighbours took Louis and his brother home, only to be followed shortly afterwards by Salah, who had turned back. ""It all happened so quick we hadn't even had the chance to clean him up,"" Mr Cooper said. ""He'd seen one of the boys had hurt himself and he had the decency to drive back into the close to check that he was OK. No-one could believe it. Everyone was gobsmacked.

Mr Cooper said: ""The face is a bit sore but he is great! He can't stop smiling!"" Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Louis said that he ran into the lamp-post due to the excitement of seeing his idol.  ""I ran with my brother... in my excitement I wasn't focusing on what was in front of me,"" he said.  Louis' brother Isaac, 10, said he ran and ""proper jumped on"" Salah when the star later arrived on their street. ""I was getting carried, and I was like 'Mo!'... I was shouting his name,"" Louis added. And the young fan had one final wish for Salah. ""I love him so much, he's the best and hopefully he scores a hat-trick against Chelsea,"" Louis said. Since joining Liverpool from Roma in 2017, Salah has been praised for his high-scoring performance on the pitch as well as his charitable work off it, including tackling Islamophobia.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42782097,How a mosque shooting showed a community's best and worst,"A year after a gunman killed six during prayers, emotions are still raw in the community.",29 Jan 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A year after a deadly shooting in a Quebec mosque, emotions are still raw among Muslims in the Canadian province.  Mohamed Labidi says there was before 29 January 2017 - and there was after.  ""We were confronted with a new reality,"" says the president of the Quebec City mosque where - on a Sunday evening a year ago - a gunman walked in and opened fire during prayers.  The attack on the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Centre left six dead and 19 injured.  Khaled Belkacemi, 60, Azzedine Soufiane, 57, Abdelkrim Hassane, 41, Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42, Ibrahima Barry, 39, and Aboubaker Thabti, 44, were killed, and 17 children were left without their fathers.  Alexandre Bissonnette, 28, is due to stand trial in March on six counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder.   Labidi says the mosque still receives hateful letters. In August, his car was deliberately torched outside his home.  After that arson, members of the mosque decided to avoid speaking regularly with the media.  ""At some point we said we need to lower the temperature, to step away,"" says Labidi. ""It was possible that people who didn't like us, that it was sparking their rage.""  In the days after the shooting, the mosque opened its doors wide to the world, inviting the media in to tour the grim aftermath of the carnage.  Labidi says they did so to show a violent shooting ""did indeed take place in the heart of the mosque, in the place of prayer"".  ""There were even people killed in the place where they were praying. They didn't have the time to run or hide."" ""It was also to show there's nothing to hide in a mosque,"" he says. ""It's just a place for prayer to what we believe is the creator of the world.""  In the wake of the shooting, Quebec politicians offered messages of tolerance and unity, and spoke about the need to tone down the divisive rhetoric that had sometimes permeated the long simmering debate in the province on religious freedoms and accommodation. ""When I say words matter, it means words can hurt, words can be knives,"" said Premier Philippe Couillard.  ""If we start presenting a foreigner as a threat, a challenge to our identity, something we should steer clear of, that does not advance the idea that we need to try and live together in an inclusive Quebec.""  But Hassan Guillet, an imam who gave the eulogy at the funeral of three of the victims, worries the provincial election this autumn means Quebec might return to what he has called a poisoned atmosphere.  As he took stock of the past year, Guillet says he's been concerned by a number of events.  There was the heated referendum over a proposal for a Muslim-run cemetery in the nearby small town of Saint-Apollinaire. A slashed Koran was sent to the Quebec City mosque in July, days before the vote.  Then there was a baseless news story on a Quebec broadcaster suggesting two Montreal mosques were trying to prevent women from working on a nearby construction site.  The story spread widely in the province, sparking outrage before the mosques denied the allegations and it was debunked. The broadcaster apologised, saying people they interviewed for the report later changed their stories.  And by the end of 2017, the number of police-reported hate crimes targeting Muslims in Quebec City had doubled from the year before. Guillet was also critical of the rejection by most political parties in Quebec of a proposal to mark 29 January as a national day of remembrance and action on Islamophobia.  ""Alexandre Bissonnette was not created in a vacuum,"" says the imam of the alleged gunman, who he has also called a victim - to some criticism from Muslims. Guillet says a debate around state secularism in the run-up to the 2014 provincial election focused a lot of attention on Muslims in Quebec.  The government, then run by Parti Quebecois (PQ), proposed barring the wearing of overt religious symbols or clothing like turbans or hijabs for public employees, and required people to uncover their face when receiving a government service.  While the PQ lost the election to the Liberals, the ensuing discussion - which carried over to the 2015 federal election - has been blamed for fuelling anti-Islamic sentiment in the Canadian province.  ""Everything - unemployment, education, equality of men and women - everything was put under the carpet and the whole debate was about the place of religion in society and the place of Muslims in society,"" Guillet says.  In October, Quebec moved ahead with a religious neutrality law that banned face coverings like the niqab when a person is giving or receiving a public service.  Opponents said it unfairly targeted the handful of Muslim women in the province who cover their faces. It's currently being challenged in court, and a judge suspended the ban in December.  Tariq Syed, who recently released a documentary on the shooting's aftermath, Your Last Walk In The Mosque, says the massacre has pulled the community closer to each other and to the broader Quebec City society.  ""They are more engaged with the society in general now - talking to the interfaith groups, participating, explaining who they are, about Islam, about the faith,"" he says.  Quebecers showed a heartfelt outpouring of support for the Muslim community in the days following the massacre. Thousands attended an emotional vigil the night after the shooting, and thousands more attended the public Montreal services for some of the victims.  Canadians opened their wallets and donated over C$400,000 ($325,000; £228,000) to the families of the victims.  Money is also pouring in to help buy a home adapted to the needs of a paralysed victim, Aymen Derbali, who was hit as he attempted to save lives.  Guillet calls the shooting ""a weight on our conscience"".  ""We are Francophone and Anglophone but we are human beings,"" he says of the emotional response following the massacre.   ""We are fathers, we are mothers.  ""I don't think anybody likes to see his neighbour killed in such a savage way."" And despite his concerns, he has since seen a ""light of hope"" that ""decent people in society started to raise the flag"" in the community's support.  Worshippers at the Quebec City mosque have experienced the best and the worst of humanity since 29 January.  ""The majority of people are of the first kind - that's to say they have sympathy, love, and so on,"" Labidi says.  ""But there is a minority that holds on to hate.""  The mosque will hold several days of events to mark the anniversary, including a prayer service, the screening of Syed's documentary, and a vigil. The commemorations will also pay tribute to acts of solidarity that followed the tragedy.  ""We should not let pessimism stop us from dreaming and hoping and working to improve society and our lives,"" says Guillet."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50398826,Tories suspend members over Islamophobia claims,The party takes action after the Guardian newspaper hands it a dossier of allegations.,13 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservatives have suspended a number of members over claims of Islamophobic social media posts. The Guardian says it has seen details of racist content posted, shared or endorsed by 25 sitting and ex-Tory councillors. The Conservatives say they take ""swift action... on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of any kind"".  But in a tweet Labour accused the party of ""showing their true colours"". The Guardian says it handed a dossier containing the allegations, produced by an anonymous Twitter user, to the Conservative Party. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove reiterated the party's pledge to hold an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party, and promised it would start before the end of the year.  A Conservative spokesperson said the individuals named in the dossier had been ""suspended immediately, pending investigation"".  ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind.  ""That's why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to stamp them out as and when they occur."" It is understood not all the names provided in the dossier are members of the Conservative Party, but the party was unable to say how many members had been suspended. Responding to the disclosures, the Muslim Council of Britain said Islamophobia was ""endemic"" in the Conservative Party. It comes as the Conservative Party faces calls to hold an independent inquiry into Islamophobia following incidents highlighted to the party and in the media. Earlier this year a number of Conservative Party members were suspended, after the BBC highlighted 20 cases to the party of members posting or endorsing Islamophobic material online."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47650948,The lives lost and the world they revealed,"From optimistic refugees to a couple deeply in love, Christchurch was meant to be safe for a new start.",22 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The life stories of the Christchurch mosque victims are a striking reflection of a world in turmoil - one marked by war, poverty and economic inequality. In New Zealand, many thought they had found a safe, remote corner of Earth on which to build new lives. That changed last Friday at 13:40 when a gunman casually opened fire.  ""I was so happy that I had a beautiful country to raise my kids in,"" says Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed, a survivor of those attacks. ""This really hurts me.""  In the week since 50 lives were abruptly taken, Christchurch has come together with powerful messages of unity. For many here, this has opened their eyes to a diverse and complex community they previously gave little attention. But it is also a reminder of how easy it is for hatred to proliferate and then explode - and a closer look at the stories of those who attended the mosques last Friday is also a stark portrait of just how fragile their worlds had always been.   Khaled Mustafa, 44, and his son Hamza, 16, were refugees. They had escaped the war in Syria along with three other family members.  The family had spent time in Jordan at first, before they were accepted under New Zealand's refugee resettlement programme.  They naturally assumed New Zealand was a safe place and had been there for less than a year when they were killed at the Al Noor mosque on Deans Avenue, the site of the first of the two attacks.  Abo Ali, a Syrian man who moved to New Zealand in 1990, says he met the family just once but they were ""so happy to have a better life"". ""They run away from the death, and they die here,"" Mr Ali tells the BBC. Hamza's younger brother, Zaid, was also at the mosque. He survived, but was injured. He attended the funeral of his father and brother on Wednesday in a wheelchair, after surgery. ""I shouldn't be standing in front of you. I should be lying beside you,"" he was reportedly heard muttering at their graveside. Mr Ali says the news hit the local Syrian and Muslim communities hard.   ""But after, when we see the New Zealand people's support, and when we see the Christian people in New Zealand too, their support - believe me, we forget about our problem.""  In many ways, 24-year-old Ansi Alibava's path to New Zealand was an unlikely one.  She was born in Kerala, India, and not into a wealthy family. After her father died in Saudi Arabia, where he had been working, she began looking after the family, aged just 18.  Her husband Abdul Nazer says that when they first met, he was struck by how she was ""supporting everything"".  The couple had migrated from India a year ago to pursue her dream of studying and travelling overseas. It had been his dream to make hers a reality, he said.  It was only when his father agreed to pledge his house for a loan that the pair were able to get to New Zealand. It was the first time either had even been outside of Kerala. After securing jobs in Christchurch they had been supporting both families at home.  Mr Nazer can only manage a few words as he describes the bliss they shared in New Zealand.  She loved her studies, he says, sitting in a room at Christchurch's Lincoln University where she was working towards a masters degree in agricultural engineering. She had recently begun an internship.  He had just been telling his cousin Fahad Ismail Ponnath, who was there to support him, how the campus brought back so many ""lovely memories"" - rooms they had been in together, places they had walked.  But last Friday the couple went to the Al Noor mosque as usual, going their own ways into the male and female areas.  When the gunfire erupted, Mr Nazer fled the building and leapt over a fence into a nearby property. The owner of that house initially didn't let him in ""thinking that he was one of the terrorists maybe,"" Mr Ponnath says.  But he soon left the safety of that house to look for his wife, and he found her lying motionless on a street. As he moved towards her, calling out, other survivors intervened to tell him she had died. Soon the police were there, moving everyone, including her husband, away.    In limited English, Mr Nazer, 34, says of his wife: ""She's a really lovely person. Very kindly."" ""She loved all people,"" he says. ""Cousins, friends. She kept a big space in her mind [for] family members. Especially my father and my mother, my brothers."" Mr Nazer doesn't know for sure whether he'll remain in New Zealand, but it is likely, as he is now committed to supporting Ms Alibava's family - they have no breadwinners left.  On Wednesday, flowers and tributes were starting to pile up outside Mohammed Imran Khan's takeaway shop, Indian Grill. Mr Khan, also known among friends as Imran Bhai, died in the Linwood mosque.  Originally from India, he was an immensely popular figure in Christchurch. ""It's just been an absolutely overwhelming [amount] of texts and messages or communications from people I don't even know - just saying what a lovely man he was,"" his wife Tracey says. ""I knew that people loved him, not so much to this extent, I think. He was a very known man throughout the community for just his heart and giving of time and everything else."" She is focused on looking after their teenage son, as well as her husband's relatives.  ""It's very difficult being over the other side of the world and hearing this, and not having information,"" she says, with relatives arriving from around the world. Having spent much of his life in his native India and then Saudi Arabia, Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed says he ""couldn't comprehend"" how safe and inclusive New Zealand was when he arrived.  He used to tell his friends overseas: ""You're scared to death to go to airports. Here, we love the airport. It's like fun - we enjoy it, it's like a pleasure trip for us. Because this country's safe."" Mr Syed Ahmed says the Linwood mosque was home to a small and close community.  ""We really love to go on Friday and we were praying,"" he says, emphasising the final word. He cannot believe what happened to him and his friends in the country he regards as the greatest on Earth. Mr Syed Ahmed says he froze when he heard three gunshots interrupting Friday prayers.   People continued briefly to pray but his ears ""were completely focused - there is something happening"". Then, he says, one man started yelling: ""Take cover, take cover - move, move, move."" Despite hearing shots, he ran straight towards the main door - he doesn't know why - and took cover in a storage space next to door when the gunman came in. He believes he was saved by another worshipper, Abdul Aziz, who took on the attacker by hurling a credit card machine at him. ""But that time, I saw my friend right in my line of sight,"" Mr Syed Ahmed says. ""[A] big splash of blood was on the wall - I could see that he had died there.""  The dozens of victims largely began their lives outside New Zealand, in South Asia and the Middle East, in Somalia or Fiji, Malaysia and Indonesia. Linda Armstrong, 64, was a New Zealander but her life had been far from conventional, her nephew Kyron Gosse says. At one point, as ""a bit of a hippy"", she had lived on Waiheke Island near her home city of Auckland ""in this little hut in the middle of the bush with only a long drop [toilet] and no shower"", he says. At other times, she had settled in lofts and granny flats, ridden a motorbike, and travelled extensively - once living in Berlin.   Always curious, she found Islam in 2011 while volunteering in a refugee centre in Auckland and talking to people there.  ""She'd want to know - why? What do you believe?"" Mr Gosse says. ""And as she found out more and more about Islam, she told me: 'These are really beautiful people and this religion really resonates with me'."" He describes his aunt as ""a kind of outrageous character"" who had always been rebellious and a bit stubborn.  She brought her stubbornness to the mosque. Following one conversation with a younger relative, she took issue with the plastic waste being generated there - so she went out and bought everyone reusable plates.  She rarely had much money but was endlessly generous. Despite living on welfare payments, she began donating NZ$50 (£25; $34) per month to a refugee family from Syria. ""She never met them, she just heard about it and thought: what can I do?"" Mr Gosse says. Ms Armstrong ""wasn't in the best of health"", so she was seated at the back of the mosque when the violence came. That didn't stop her moving quickly to protect others.  ""She put herself in front of one of her friends, took the bullet, and then died in her arms with the imam saying a prayer over her,"" Mr Gosse tells the BBC. ""We're all pretty proud that that was the sort of person she was."" Across Christchurch this week, locals have been comparing the collective trauma to an earthquake that struck the city in 2011, killing 185 people.  It is, many say, a similar pain although they are fully aware that this particular pain has been inflicted by a person, and on a specific community. After an earthquake, a city can rebuild - a physical healing of its wounds.  One victim, Zakaria Bhuiya was part of that process. He had moved to Christchurch from Bangladesh to work on the post-quake rebuild, according to the Indian Social and Cultural Club.  Mr Bhuiya, a welder, had taken annual leave on Friday to celebrate his 33rd birthday with friends at the Al Noor mosque. ""He lived on the bare basics in order to maximise the money he could send home to support his family,"" his employer AMT Mechanical said. He leaves behind a wife in Bangladesh, Rina Akter.  He had no family in Christchurch, but in the days it took officials to identify his body, the friends he had made staged a small protest outside the mosque.  ""Our brother is missing, give us some information,"" read one sign.  At times in this city of about 400,000 people it feels like everyone knew a victim, or knows someone who did. Peter Higgins, 67, says cardiologist Amjad Hamid had convinced him to retire following ""a heart attack"" and subsequent complications.   ""That bloke really turned my life around,"" he says of Dr Hamid, a 57-year-old Palestinian who migrated decades ago. ""He got shot. And I think, how many people has he saved? And someone decides to play out with a gun."" The tragedy has made many think more deeply about the Muslim community here.   Clare Needham, 72, says Daoud Nabi - the first of the dead to be identified - would turn up frequently to a charity shop where she volunteered, and would haggle over items.  Mr Nabi, 70, told her of his deep love for his grandson. It was only this week that she learned the kind of profile he had within the community. Born in Afghanistan but a long-time New Zealand resident, he was president of a local Afghan association and a known supporter of other migrant groups. One visitor to the tributes, Dave Palmer, was struck by the tolerance of Farid Ahmed, whose wife was killed in the attack, yet who told reporters he had forgiven the shooter. ""I thought: I don't know whether I could ever do that,"" says Mr Palmer, a Christian. ""That takes an amazing amount of strength and courage."" The kind of tolerance personified by Farid Ahmed and Linda Armstrong stands in stark contrast to the gunman and the online communities through which material allegedly posted by him spread.  Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. The gunman live-streamed the massacre on Facebook and a person suspected to be him posted a 65,000-word document online, outlining the alleged reasons for the attacks.  As many have pointed out since, it was littered with coded references that sought to engage specific online communities. It was posted on 8chan - a forum favoured by the alt-right. It showed just how easy it is for intolerance and hate to ignite in such forums, unlike in the wider community, where tolerance is patiently built up over time.  Ultimately, it took just one man and 17 minutes - in the case of the Al Noor attack - to shatter dozens of carefully built, second-chance lives.  Questions have been raised since the attacks about whether forums should be better monitored for evidence of extremism, but experts say this would be challenging for a few reasons - not least the sheer volume of posts. ""We told them our fears about the rise of the alt-right. And the government has not responded adequately,"" says Anjum Rahman, of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, who says she has been pleading with successive governments to address discrimination. Ms Rahman is also sharply critical of the media. ""Where were you?"" she says, arguing there was not enough scrutiny globally. Paul Hunt, New Zealand's chief human rights commissioner, says it has one of the world's best human rights records although it does see Islamophobia, racism and hate crimes in ""some sectors of society"". But if the gunman - whose name Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has sworn she will never speak - had wanted to tear New Zealand apart, judging from the past week he has failed.  On Thursday, the prime minister announced a wide-ranging crackdown on New Zealand's gun laws - including banning all the types of weapons used in the attacks. Unlike after attacks in the US, for example, it's been almost universally well-received - some people had begun turning in their guns before the ban was even announced.  Again and again, locals say they are determined to pull together and ensure this tragedy is not repeated. ""I'm trying to process grief but also anger: how dare he do this to us?"" says Cara Butler, 38. ""But I think he's picked the wrong place - I think he's going to see the opposite of what he thought. He's not going to create division, it's going to create community and more cohesion."" Mr Syed Ahmed, the survivor, says his two children ""have New Zealand, Kiwi values - and I'm so happy with that"". But he fears for them, saying all nations - not just New Zealand - must not become complacent. ""Now I see that people can come to the remotest, peaceful corner of Earth,"" he says. ""This just can't happen to this country. You can't leave it just as another incident. We're [travelling] as far as the Moon and Mars, but our neighbourhoods aren't safe for our kids? ""It's everyone's responsibility to deal with this hate."" ."

His accuser told BBC Scotland he had moved to the village of Sanquhar, near Dumfries, when he was 12 and was almost immediately subjected to ""verbal abuse on quite a sustained, constant and daily level"" from the locals.  The man and his relatives were of Pakistani origin - although he was born in Scotland - and were the only ethnic minority family in the village.  He said: ""They made me feel that I wasn't welcome, that I was different and it was their wee village and I was somehow an interloper and that my kind would never be welcome there. ""That was drummed home to me on a daily basis"".  The man said Mr Dempster was not a councillor at the time, but was a well-known member of the community who later bought a newsagent shop in the village high street after working as a part-time fireman. He said: ""I would always get the impression that Mr Dempster wasn't really happy about me coming into the shop - he didn't like me being there, it almost felt like there was fire burning in his eyes."" He said the third time he went into the shop, Mr Dempster shouted out ""here comes the Paki"" in front of other schoolchildren, adult customers and staff. ""The whole shop erupted in laughter - they thought it was quite funny, especially the kids"", he alleged.  ""I just put the money on the counter and I went away. I blamed myself for it - I thought 'what have I done to this man to warrant this behaviour?""' The man said he had not spoken out at the time.  He explained: ""When you are the only minority in quite a small place, there's not that many people you can go to talk about it so we had to alternative but to brush it under the carpet.""  He said it was only when he saw media reports about Mr Dempster saying that people would not have been able to see Mr Yousaf ""under his burka"" that he contacted the politician with his own experiences.  He said he did not know until later that his sister, who was aged about six when the racist abuse from Mr Dempster is said to have started, had also contacted Mr Yousaf.  He added: ""I only found out after three decades that my sister was abused (by Mr Dempster) - she was called chocolate monkey, he said she smelled of curry. ""At one point he came with a can of air freshener and started to spray it around the shop. It was something we never spoke about as family."" In a statement Mr Dempster said: ""I absolutely refute and deny the allegations made against me"". Referring to a newspaper report that the alleged abuse took place in the 1980s and early 1990s, he said he did not buy the newsagent shop until May 1991.  He added: ""The language and behaviour alleged does not represent me, or how I conducted myself. This can easily be borne out by visiting the local community and seeking their views.  ""Members of the local Muslim community in Upper Nithsdale are keen to speak to the media and describe me as the man they have known for many years."" Mr Yousaf has called for Mr Dempster to resign as a councillor, and to be expelled from Scottish Labour. Labour is looking at the latest claims as part of the investigation into Mr Dempster that was sparked by the councillor telling transport officials that ""no-one would have seen [Mr Yousaf] under his burka"". The councillor later apologised, saying he was ashamed and embarrassed and could offer no defence or explanation.  He also insisted that the ""stupid and ill-judged remark is not representative of who I am"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard told BBC Scotland that he was ""quite angry"" about the claims against Mr Dempster, and acknowledged that such cases should be dealt with ""much more speedily"" by the party. On Tuesday, Mr Dempster issued a joint statement with the imam of the Dumfries Islamic Centre in which he was described as a ""good man""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50397847,Labour vows to outspend Tories on the NHS,"The party says it would tax the ""wealthiest"" to cut hospital waiting times if it wins the election.",13 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour is promising to spend more on the NHS in England than the Tories if it wins the general election. The NHS budget would rise to £155bn by 2023-24 - £6bn more than the government promised the front-line budget would reach by that stage when it set out its five-year plan last year. Labour said the money would cut waiting times and boost mental health services. But the Tories said Labour's plan for a shorter working week would eat into the funding due to the need for more staff. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the working hours policy, announced at Labour's annual conference in September, would ""cripple our economy and cost the NHS billions every year"". But Labour said a 32-hour working-week would be phased in over 10 years so would not have the impact on NHS budgets claimed by the Tories, and it would also be offset by gains in productivity. Announcing his party's flagship election policy at the Royal Society of Medicine, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said after a ""decade of underfunding and cuts"" waiting lists had risen to ""record levels"". ""Only Labour has a plan to rescue the NHS,"" he added.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Labour's policy of taxing the ""richest in society"" and reversing cuts to corporation tax would release money to spend on healthcare. Lib Dem health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said: ""Labour's announcement completely misses the point.  ""They are ignoring the fact that Brexit is the biggest threat to the NHS.""  Labour's proposals were welcomed by NHS leaders. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said the pledge represented a ""significant extra investment"" on top of what has been set by the government. ""If used wisely, it would help to transform services and retain front-line staff.""  During the summer of 2018, the Theresa May government announced a five-year funding settlement for the front line of the NHS in England.  It also meant more money for other parts of the UK - under a system known as the Barnett Formula the devolved nations get the same percentage increases in areas like health - although it is up to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to decide where that is spent. In England it means the budget for NHS England will be £20bn more in 2023-24 than it was in 2018-19 once inflation is taken into account - a rise of 3.4% a year on average during the period. Labour has promised to top this up by £6bn by 2023-24 - an annual rise of 3.9% on average over the coming years. But this front-line budget - £121bn this year - does not cover the entirety of health spending. Another £18bn is being spent on other areas, including training staff, building projects and public health schemes like stop-smoking services. Read more of the BBC's Election 2019 coverage here: Labour has promised to increase these too. The most significant rise will be in the capital budget - for buildings, equipment and infrastructure. This year £7bn is being spent in this area after Boris Johnson increased the budget by £1bn shortly after he became prime minister. Labour says by 2023-24 the budget will top £10bn a year - a sum health academics have argued is needed to deal with the backlog in repairs and bring spending in line with other wealthy nations. The Tories have yet to set the budgets for these areas all the way through to 2023-24, although they have said investing in buildings and infrastructure is a priority. In terms of the front-line budget, Labour says the extra £26bn in real terms by 2023-4 they will be investing will help reduce waiting times in A&E and for routine operations such as knee and hip replacements - both targets for how long patients should wait have been missed for the last few years. They are also prioritising mental health, promising to fund more counselling services for schools, community mental health hubs and crisis teams. The wider increases in the overall health budget will help fund the return of the bursary for nurses and midwives to fund their time spent studying at university - the government scrapped these in 2017 - while they will also benefit from the Labour policy of scrapping tuition fees. Labour believes this will help address the shortage of nurses in the NHS. The party also wants to increase the number of GP training places from 3,500 a year to 5,000.  Free prescriptions and hospital car parking will also be introduced. What is quite remarkable is just how similar the Tories and Labour are in terms of many of the areas they are focusing on. Both are looking to increase the budget by more than it has been in recent years - albeit Labour are promising 4% more by 2023-24 for the front line. Setting aside free prescriptions and car parking, which are not Tory policies, both parties are prioritising training extra staff and investing in new buildings and equipment Last week the Tories too pledged extra training places for GPs, saying they wanted to recruit an extra 6,000 GPs. The prime minister has also promised there will be 40 major hospital building projects in the next decade - although only six have been given a guarantee of funding so far. The Liberal Democrats are yet to give much detail about their policies - although they have promised a penny on income tax will be introduced, which will raise extra money for mental health, public health and social care.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-45236851,People's Vote 'boost' and '100' Tory rebels,Sunday's papers feature a record donation to the People's Vote campaign and a Conservative rebellion.,19 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"As the government prepares to publish the first of its series of documents setting out the consequences of leaving the EU with no deal, the Sunday Express says the battle lines are being drawn in the quest for Brexit.   The paper's lead story reports that up to 100 Tory MPs are preparing to rebel against Theresa May's Chequers plan.   It says Brexiteers have demanded she instead study an alternative plan they believe will deliver the Brexit the UK voted for.   The paper adds that MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg are preparing the alternative proposal, to be published in the next fortnight. On the other side of the argument, the record £1m donation to the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, makes the Observer's main story.   According to the paper, Julian Dunkerton - co-founder of the Superdry fashion label - said that if Brexit had happened 20 years earlier, his brand would never have been a success.   But the paper warns that supporters of a new vote face a race against time before Britain ceases to be an EU member at the end of next March. ""Racists flock to Boris on Facebook"", is the main headline in the Sunday Times.   It says Boris Johnson is at the centre of a new row over racism after an investigation into online abuse revealed his official Facebook page hosts hundreds of Islamophobic messages.   Under entries that publicise Mr Johnson's articles and speeches - the paper adds - his followers have left comments including calls to ban Islam and deport Muslims. The Sunday Telegraph says it can reveal that the government is considering launching a ""Care ISA"" - which would be exempt from inheritance tax - in an effort to solve the social care crisis.   According to the paper, the Treasury has been reviewing proposals to include the ""Care Isa"" in the government's forthcoming social care Green Paper.   The paper explains that at present, Isas are taxed at death, so people are encouraged to spend their savings before they die instead of keeping them to fund their care - often needed at the end of their lives. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning According to the Mail on Sunday, 10 British ships sunk during the Second World War - which are designated as war graves - have been plundered for scrap metal by Chinese pirates. It says vessels that provide the final resting place for more than a thousand sailors have been smashed to pieces and looted by salvagers off the Malaysian and Indonesian coasts. Finally, the Sunday Mirror reports that Lucy Clark - football's only transgender referee - will take to the pitch on Sunday afternoon for the first time under her new identity. Ms Clark - a cab driver from Surrey - is pictured in her referee kit.   She tells the paper: ""I can appreciate people will be a bit shocked when I run on to the pitch. But I'm the same person.  I will just look a bit different""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57390398,Muslim family killed in Canada truck attack,Four members of a family in Ontario were killed in what police believe was a deliberate hate crime.,8 Jun 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Four members of a Muslim family were killed in a ""premeditated"" vehicle attack on Sunday, Canadian police say.  The attack took place in the city of London, Ontario province. A boy aged nine, the family's only survivor, is in hospital with serious injuries.  A 20-year-old Canadian man has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The attack was the worst against Canadian Muslims since six people were killed in a Quebec City mosque in 2017. ""It is believed that these victims were targeted because they were Muslim,"" Det Supt Paul Waight told a news conference on Monday.  Police are weighing possible terrorism charges, he said, adding that it is believed to be a hate crime. Two women - aged 74 and 44 - a 46-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl were all killed. They have not been named, in accordance with the wishes of the family. A nine-year-old boy was in hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, said police. Police named the alleged attacker as Nathanial Veltman, 20, of London, Ontario. He was arrested without incident at a shopping centre about 6km (4.8 miles) from the crime scene.  It is not yet known if the suspect has ties to any hate groups, said Det Supt Waight.  ""There is no known previous connection between the suspect and the victims,"" Det Supt Waight said, adding that the suspect was wearing a vest that appeared to be ""like body armour"".  Police said Mr Veltman had no previous convictions. Officials added that there was good weather and high visibility conditions when the black truck was seen mounting the kerb on Hyde Park Road at around 20:40 local time on Sunday. One witness told CTV News she had to shield her young daughter's eyes from the bodies. Another witness told CTV the scene was ""just chaos"". ""There were people everywhere and running,"" said Paige Martin. ""Citizens were trying to direct the emergency vehicles where to go. There was a lot of pointing and screaming and arm waving."" A 2016 census found that London - a city about 200km (125 miles) south-west of Toronto - is growing increasingly diverse. One in five people was born outside of Canada, with Arabs being the area's largest minority group, and South Asians coming in a close second. Ontario Premier Doug Ford was among those who paid tribute to the victims, tweeting: ""Hate and Islamophobia have NO place in Ontario.""  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that he was ""horrified"" by the news. ""To the loved ones of those who were terrorised by yesterday's act of hatred, we are here for you,"" he wrote. ""This was an act of mass murder, perpetrated against Muslims, against Londoners, and rooted in unspeakable hatred,"" said London Mayor Ed Holder. In a statement, Mayor Holder said he was speaking ""on behalf of all Londoners when I say our hearts are broken"".  ""We grieve for the family, three generations of whom are now deceased."" The mayor's statement added that he had ordered flags outside London City Hall to be lowered for three days of mourning. The National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) said in a statement that the attacker should face terrorism charges. ""A man allegedly got in his car, saw a Muslim family walking down the street, and made the decision that they do not deserve to live,"" said the organisation's CEO Mustafa Farooq. ""He did not know them. This is a terrorist attack on Canadian soil, and should be treated as such,"" his statement continued. Nawaz Tahir, a London lawyer and representative of the Muslim community, said during the police news conference: ""These were innocent human beings who were killed simply because they were Muslim."" ""We will stand strong against Islamophobia. We will stand strong against terror with faith, with love, and a quest for justice,"" he continued.  ""Hate will never overshadow the light of love."" It is not the first time members of the Muslim community in Canada have come under attack. In January 2017, a Canadian man fatally shot six worshippers at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre, and seriously injured five others. The perpetrator was sentenced to life in prison.  Canada's deadliest vehicle-ramming attack happened in 2018, when a self-described ""incel"" (involuntary celibate) ploughed his van into a group of pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 people."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60321129,The young Indians spreading hate online,Young right-wing Hindus in India are finding newer and more outrageous ways to target critics online.,11 Feb 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In May last year, as Muslims around the world celebrated Eid al-Fitr, several women in Pakistan got a shock. Screenshots of photos they had posted of themselves, dressed up for the festival, were livestreamed without their permission on YouTube by two men across the border in India. The livestream, by Ritesh Jha and an accomplice he calls ""Keshu"", was accompanied by misogynist, Islamophobic comments and watched by hundreds. After several users reported the stream, YouTube removed the video and the channel. The women later said they felt ""unsafe"" and ""afraid"" and that their Eid had been ""ruined"". Eight months on, Mr Jha, 23, says he was ""filled with hate at that time"". He claims he wanted to avenge Hindu women whose morphed photos he had spotted on social media. He did not reveal any details about Keshu.  Trolling of women - especially those critical of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - has worsened in recent years amid an increasingly polarised climate both online and offline.  While supporters of all political parties and ideologies harass women online, experts say a churn in the far-right and the spread of technology has emboldened young Hindu nationalists further.  The YouTube livestreaming incident was followed by several cases of women being abused online. Developers of two apps shared photos of Muslim women in a mock ""auction"" meant to humiliate them. Hindu women critical of Mr Modi and the BJP were also put on a fake ""sale"" on audio app Clubhouse, which said it has since suspended the room and taken action against accounts connected with it. In all three cases, there was no actual sale. After a sharp public outcry, police arrested nine people in connection with both apps - all between 18 and 26 years old. Most were active in social media groups where Islamophobic messages were regularly posted.    Mr Jha too has been named in a police complaint in connection with the Clubhouse mock auction and the Youtube livestream incident, a senior police official told the BBC. ""We are investigating the case and will take necessary legal action against him if he does not present himself,"" Rashmi Karandikar, cybercell chief of the Mumbai Police, said. Experts say these are not isolated incidents.  ""I would attribute this to a sweeping radicalisation of the Hindu middle class,"" says journalist and author Snigdha Poonam. ""It's pure bigotry that's coming from deep within Hindu society."" Mr Jha's now-deleted YouTube channel had thousands of followers who engaged with anti-Muslim content he shared. He justifies the offensive jokes targeting Islamic practices as ""dark humour"". He also compares the livestreaming of the women's photos with ""harmless videos on TikTok or Insta Reels"".  Mr Jha was 14 when he got his first smartphone. He says the content he accessed then was his introduction to the right-wing world. ""On it, I saw memes, heard speeches of politicians who screamed that Hindus were in danger,"" he says.  The partisan political debates and toxic narratives that identified Muslims as the enemy slowly turned him into a ""radical"", he says. ""You start to feel you are being discriminated against, so much so you begin thinking of violence,"" Mr Jha says.   This is likely to affect more young people, experts say.  ""The pandemic has also created a febrile environment for radicalisation, by ensuring that millions of people have spent more time online,"" says a study by Canada's Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which studies online behaviour of right-wing extremists in the country. India's right-wing is also going through changes - many now divide themselves into two groups: ""trads"" and ""raytas"".  Trads, or traditionalists, have more extreme views and believe the BJP is not right-wing enough. They call their critics on the right ""raytas"" - a play on the Hindi idiom ""rayta phailana"", which broadly means to mess things up.  Raytas say they prefer to express their views without espousing violence.  Abhishek Banerjee, a right-wing columnist, says this is similar to divisions among those on the left.  ""As the right's position has become influential in politics and power, they are becoming more vocal and visible,"" he adds.  Trads - more right than the right  A young Dalit man, who only wants to be referred to as HR - the initials of his Twitter handle - told the BBC how he was drawn into the trad world.  Dalits (formerly untouchables) are at the bottom of an oppressive Hindu caste system.  In March 2020, HR was invited to join an Instagram group whose stated purpose was to ""disseminate true information about Hinduism"". The person who invited him said he was impressed by HR's skill at arguing ""with Muslims online"".  He was asked to add 14-15 year olds to the group. HR says he was happy to join because he was ""proud"" of the Hindu faith, but was soon disillusioned by the incessant hate members spewed - not just at Muslims but also Dalits.  ""They believed Dalits were not Hindus, that it was okay to rape Muslim women to build a Hindu India and that even the murder of children could be justified,"" he told the BBC through messages on Twitter. HR never disclosed his caste identity to the group and left it six months after he joined. He says he now ""fights"" against trads by reporting their social media handles. ""Trads praise lynching, oppose both Muslims and Christians, believe in the oppressive caste system, and hate all outspoken modern women, whether Hindu or Muslim,"" says writer Saniya Sayed, one of the women whose photos were uploaded on the fake auction apps.  Ms Sayed says she was often added to trad groups online by her harassers so she could see the objectionable comments they made about her.  Delhi Police have said that the man who allegedly created the fake auction app was part of a trad group. Mona Sharma, who calls herself a ""rayta"", says she and other right-wing women have also been targeted by trads online because they do not conform to their notions of how women should behave. She was abused online and her husband's personal information was leaked, says Ms Sharma - she adds that she herself trolls liberals and is subjected to trolling by them on Twitter, but that this is a ""harmless"" activity. ""For the trads, modern educated women are not Hindu enough,"" she says.  Police have had limited success in disrupting this entrenched ecosystem. ""Law enforcement doesn't have the wherewithal to monitor and track millions of accounts on platforms that are owned by foreign companies,"" says Brijesh Singh, a senior Mumbai Police officer. Experts say the problem goes much deeper than social media hate. Ms Poonam believes the radicalisation of Hindus is a grave danger to India's secularism. ""When I am out reporting, you would be surprised at how many times ordinary people keep bringing up Pakistan as a model for India to follow,"" she says. ""There is a strong feeling among a large section of Hindus that India should be for the Hindus, and they feel freer to express it today,"" she adds. Mr Jha tells the BBC his actions were ""morally wrong"" but says people like him are being ""used"".  ""We don't realise how hatred takes root in our mind. It doesn't benefit anyone, except those who are running a hate agenda."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-59250820,What's coming up in Parliament this week?,"Parliament reconvenes, and the Opposition will be trying to force as many votes on awkward subjects as they can.",12 Nov 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Parliament's brief November half term has interrupted a tense political moment, with the aftershocks of the Owen Paterson case still continuing. And, if you look at events a little further back, many government backbenchers are still nursing bruises from the social media backlash over the sewage amendment to the Environment Bill.  With the Lords sending back a number of issues from current legislation for MPs to reconsider, the government whips could be asking their troops to cast some uncomfortable votes, starting on Monday with a vote concerning the removal of the ""triple lock"" on the value of state pensions. Maybe nothing will happen, but the Opposition will certainly be trying to test Tory unity by forcing their MPs into as many awkward votes on sensitive issues as it can. And watch out for the direct ramifications of the Paterson kerfuffle; a vote on the Standards Committee's report is due on Monday, although probably without debate, and moves to reshape the system for policing MPs' ethics look likely to follow. Meanwhile two of the great powers of the land face interrogation by select committees - Yorkshire County Cricket Club and the prime minister. Here's my rundown of the week ahead. MPs resume (14:30) with an hour of Defence questions, probably followed by government statements or urgent questions. Then MPs will deal with the Lords amendments to the Social Security (Uprating of Benefits) Bill.  The Lords amended the normally routine legislation, which uprates a variety of benefits, because it removed the ""triple lock"" on the value of the state pension for a year. This broke a manifesto pledge, because ministers broke the link between pensions and the rise in earnings, after concerns that a post-pandemic rise in average wages would have meant pensions increasing by 8%. The main debate will be on the second reading of the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill, which has already cleared the Lords. The bill aims to reform the technical education system, and introduce a lifelong loan entitlement, as part of a flexible lifetime skills guarantee. And lurking the end of the business is a little item entitled Committee on Standards (Motion), which would approve the original report of the committee on the Owen Paterson case, which recommended a 30 day suspension from the Commons for the now-departed MP.  But the motion will not be debated if the previous business (and any statements or urgent questions) have taken up all the available time, when the music stops at 22:00. At that point remaining business is taken without debate - unless it is objected to, which it might be, if someone wants to push the MPs standards issue further. In Westminster Hall, Monday is Petitions Day, and (16:30) MPs will consider two e-petitions 323926 and 575620 on traffic offences for fatal collisions. The first, signed by 104,324 people, calls for tougher sentences for hit-and-run drivers who cause death. The second, also known as Ryan's Law, calls for the legal definition of causing death by dangerous driving to be widened to include failure to stop, call 999, or render aid on scene. It attracted 167,470 signatures. Then (18:00) they turn to e-petition 582336, entitled Ban Water Companies discharging raw sewage into water courses, which received 111,434 signatures. Committee action includes Treasury (14:30) questioning the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, and members of its Monetary Policy Committee in the wake of their recent decision not to raise interest rates.  In the Lords (14:30), proceedings open with the introduction of two new bishops, the Lord Bishop of Exeter, the Rt Rev Robert Atwell and the Lord Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Rev Paul Bayes, after which ministers face questions on the publication date for the long-awaited White Paper on levelling up, and on the government's definition of Islamophobia. Then peers respond to the Commons in the latest round of parliamentary ping pong on the Telecommunications (Security) Bill. The main event will be day eight of the marathon committee stage consideration of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - this was supposed to be the final day, but the debate has gone slowly and committee will now continue on Wednesday. The Commons opens (11:30) with an hour of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Labour's Emma Hardy, is on flood protection. This is a huge issue in her Hull constituency, where thousands of people live in areas at significant risk. The bill would set national minimum requirements for flood mitigation and protection measures.  The main legislative work is the second reading of the Finance Bill, the measure which puts the October budget into law. Watch out, too, for the adjournment debate led by the former Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland, on funding for autism and neurodiversity research. He wants the government to build on the work he began when he was in charge of the prison system, to assess the number of people in jail who have autism and other conditions.  In Westminster Hall (09:30), Conservative MP Bob Blackman, who's chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health, leads a debate on the delivery of a new Tobacco Control Plan. His group wants to end smoking by 2030 and make the tobacco manufacturers ""pay to end the epidemic"". Labour's Tulip Siddiq has a 90 minute debate on the continuing plight of Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, whose husband is on hunger strike, to pile the pressure on to ministers, and highlight her case. (14:30) Committee action includes Digital, Culture, Media and Sport turning its attention to Yorkshire County Cricket Club's handling of racism allegations from the former player Azeem Rafiq. He's due to give evidence and there is speculation that he will use parliamentary privilege to discuss how senior managers at the club dealt with his case. Given the current turmoil at Headingly, it is not clear which senior figures will appear from the club itself, although the committee will expect to hear from the newly-installed Chair, Lord Patel. And while Yorkshire will be the focus of discussion, it is possible that events in other counties may also feature.   Elsewhere, Justice has a hearing with Lord Burnett, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales - which could see some pungent comments on mooted reforms to the Human Rights Act, and on court backlogs. In the Lords (14:30), questions range across self-isolation rules, and abuse against health and care staff . Next, peers respond to whatever the Commons has done with their amendment to the Social Security (Up-rating of Benefits) Bill. Then there's the report stage of the Dormant Assets Bill - which extends the existing scheme to release money languishing in unused and forgotten bank accounts, to cover around £880 in other dormant assets. The Commons opens (11:30) with half an hour of Wales questions, followed by Prime Minister's Questions. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, proposed by the Conservative Robert Largan, calls for a ban on using disposable barbecues on open moorland, and would give councils the power to ban their sale - Mr Largan has regularly highlighted how they cause moorland wildfires. The big committee event (15:00) is the Liaison Committee holding one of its twice-yearly evidence sessions with the prime minister - will Standards Committee Chair Chris Bryant and maybe Procedure Committee Chair Karen Bradley have a chance to quiz him on his decision to challenge the original verdict of the Standards Committee to suspend former Tory MP Owen Paterson from the Commons for 30 days? Earlier, Work and Pensions (09:15) takes evidence on the Health and Safety Executive's approach to asbestos management with campaigners and HSE managers. In the Lords (15:00) there are questions to ministers on sentencing guidelines for pregnant women offenders, the Dimbleby report on a National Food Strategy and an independent commission on the future constitution of Wales. The main event is an extra day of committee consideration of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Progress has been so slow that there may be a further extra day on Monday 22 - suggesting a marathon report stage in December. The Commons day begins (09:30) with 40 minutes of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport questions, followed by a mini-question time for the Attorney General. There will also be the weekly statement on forthcoming Commons business from the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees Mogg (more Paterson-related argy-bargy?) Then the Commons will yomp through all stages of the Critical Benchmarks (References and Administrators Liability) Bill, a measure to tidy up the implications of the abolition of the LIBOR interest rate. It has already cleared the Lords. Meanwhile, in Westminster Hall there are two Backbench Business Committee debates - on access to Automatic External Defibrillators (13:30) and on visa and permit-free working for musicians in the EU (15:00). In the Lords (11:00), there are questions to ministers on the government's pledge to build 40 new hospitals and on ensuring leaseholders don't pay the cost of repairing safety defects in their building, for which they are not responsible. And that's followed by the monthly half hour question time for the government's Brexit supremo, Lord Frost, the Minister of State at the Cabinet Office. Then come the usual Thursday backbench debates, opening with Labour's Baroness Young of Old Scone on the outcome of COP26, with the Environment Minister, Zac Goldsmith, answering for the government. Labour's Baroness Donaghy leads a debate on initial teacher training, the recruitment of new teachers and the role of universities and other bodies in ensuring the supply and education of new teachers. MPs meet (09:30) to discuss private members bills, and this could be one of those days where several are voted through their second reading (their initial debate) - starting with the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Bill which aims to stop children being forced into marriage by raising the minimum age from 16 to 18.  At the moment, the only way for a child to prevent their marriage is to report that they have not consented which places the burden on children to speak out - and can endanger the child.  The bill was originally proposed by the former Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, and was taken over by Pauline Latham when he was brought back into the government. It has government and cross party support. Second on the agenda - and with a good chance of being debated - is the Conservative Dr Ben Spencer's Planning (Enforcement) Bill, which seeks to clamp down on repeat breaches of planning controls and create a national register of repeat offenders. He hopes this will help end the cycle of ""endless applications and planning breaches on problem sites"". Third is the Conservative Jane Stevenson's Glue Traps (Offences) Bill - this would ban the use of glue traps as a method of pest control, on the argument that they are inhumane and can cause immense suffering to animals. She says her bill has the support of government and animal welfare charities like the RSPCA. There are plenty more bills on the order paper, but it would be surprising if MPs had a chance to debate, still less vote on, more than the first five. The Lords are also sitting (10:00) to debate private members' bills, starting with the second reading of the Age Assurance (Minimum Standards) Bill, which would set the rules for age assurance systems for accessing an online or digital service and ensure they protect the privacy of users. The bill is proposed by the Crossbencher Baroness Kidron, who has long campaigned for greater protection for children online. That is followed by the second reading of Baroness Hayman's Onshore Wind Bill, which deals with planning applications for onshore wind installations, and then by debate on the Coroners (Determination of Suicide) Bill which will require the coroner or jury at an inquest to record an opinion as to whether gambling addiction or other factors are involved in a suicide  - it is proposed by the Bishop of St Albans, Dr Alan Smith, who has regularly raised concerns about fixed odds gambling machines fuelling problem gambling."

Luke Skelton, who was said to have racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic views, was accused of preparing to commit acts of terrorism in the year to October 2021. After seven hours of deliberation, a jury at Teesside Crown Court failed to reach a verdict on the single charge. Mr Skelton, 18, from Oxclose, Washington, could now face a retrial. The prosecution claimed the Gateshead College student took photos of Forth Banks police station in Newcastle last September to carry out ""hostile reconnaissance"". He was said to be a right-wing extremist who idolised Adolf Hitler, approved of the mass murder of Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, researched how to make explosives and had written a ""final note"".  Mr Skelton, who has autism, said in his defence that he was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" of the views he expressed last year and insisted he had no intention of carrying out acts of terrorism. Police found neo-Nazi material that Mr Skelton had downloaded on to his computer, but he said he was ""pushing boundaries"" by having it and told the jury: ""I was being an idiot."" The court heard he had been referred to the government's anti-terror Prevent programme. He had eight sessions with a caseworker before he disengaged with it, when he turned 18. Judge Paul Watson QC praised the jury for their close consideration of the trial when he discharged them from deliberating further. He said: ""You have clearly given this case a great deal of attention and I am grateful to you for it.""  The prosecution was given until Thursday to decide whether to ask for a retrial.

A hashtag calling on Twitter to ban wrestler Babita Phogat is trending. She had used a hashtag derogatory towards Muslims and had said that for India, they were a bigger problem than even the virus. The trend comes a day after Rangoli Chandel was suspended by Twitter. Ms Chandel, who is the sister of actress Kangana Ranaut, attracted many complaints after she advocated violence against Muslims and ""secular media"", accusing the community of attacking and killing doctors. There have been some attacks against medical staff but Ms Chandel did not specify what she was referring to. Some videos purporting to show violence ""by Muslims"" have been discredited. Phogat's account has not been suspended, but many people who are using the hashtag asking Twitter to take action said they were tired of the hate. However, hours later a trend supporting her also emerged on Twitter. Phogat is a Commonwealth gold medallist and recently joined India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). India has seen a rise in Islamophobic tweets related to the virus after an event linked to a Muslim body - the Tablighi Jamaat -  spawned clusters of Covid-19 cases across the country. Police have since brought charges of manslaughter against the head of the organisation, saying that he ignored two notices to stop the event after India went into lockdown. The Tablighi Jamaat has denied all wrongdoing. However, the news has caused many Indians to associate the spread of the virus with Muslims. Many Muslim vendors and shopkeepers have complained that people no longer trade with them, and have even chased them away. The government has called for an end to divisive tweets and posts, and even taken action against some people."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66080504,Iran won't send ambassador to Sweden over Quran burning,Many Muslim countries have summoned Swedish ambassadors to express their condemnation for the act.,2 Jul 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Iranian government has refused to send a new ambassador to Sweden after a protester burned a Quran outside a mosque in the capital, Stockholm.  An Iraqi-born refugee burnt the Muslim holy book outside a mosque on the first day of Eid al-Adha.  Swedish police charged him with agitation against an ethnic or national group last week. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, blamed the government for granting him the protest permit. Plans to burn copies of the Quran have sparked riots in Sweden in recent months. Police had rejected similar protest applications recently, but courts then ruled that they should be allowed on freedom of expression grounds. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Mr Amirabdollahian said despite appointing a new ambassador, Tehran would not be sending them.  ""The process of dispatching them has been held off due to the Swedish government's issuing of a permit to desecrate the Holy Koran"", he said in a statement on Twitter. Iraq's foreign ministry also asked its Swedish counterpart to extradite the man who burned the Quran. They argued that since he still holds an Iraqi citizenship, he should face trial in Baghdad. After the incident, thousands of Iraqi protesters raided the Swedish embassy in Iraq at the instigation of the the populist Shia cleric, Moqtaha al-Sadr. They left after fifteen minutes when a security force was deployed.  The prime minister of Sweden, Ulf Kristersson, denounced the raid on the embassy, but also said it was time for Sweden to reflect on its identity. ""It is of course completely unacceptable for people to unlawfully break into Swedish embassies in other countries. I think we also need to reflect in Sweden. It is a serious security situation, there is no reason to insult other people,"" he said. Following an emergency meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah on Sunday, the Saudi-based organisation called for member states to take ""unified and collective measures"" to stop countries burning copies of Islam's holy book.  The secretary general, Hissein Brahim Taha said the burnings of the Quran were ""not mere ordinary Islamophobia incidents"" and urged countries worldwide to adhere to international law ""which clearly prohibits any advocacy of religious hatred"".  Morocco, Kuwait, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates - among other countries - have recalled their ambassadors to Stockholm following the incident. It has also sparked anger in other Muslim-majority nations including Turkey - a Nato member which has a say over whether Sweden also gains membership. On Wednesday, the country's foreign minister tweeted that it was ""unacceptable to allow anti-Islam protests in the name of freedom of expression""."

The paper says a ""barrage"" of letters demanding a no confidence vote have been submitted.   ""The vultures are circling"" is the Daily Mail's headline. Just as with Margaret Thatcher in 1990, it says rebellious MPs began seeking to oust their leader when she was out of the country.  The Financial Times reports that the prime minister's supporters insist she would win any such vote, but it acknowledges there is now a more ""mutinous mood"" at Westminster than previously.  The Daily Telegraph suggests a vote on her leadership could take place as early as this week - but some Tories want senior ministers to intervene and replace Theresa May with a caretaker before it happens.  The Spectator says there's very little chance Mrs May would resign before a vote were held. As one long-time backbench ally explains: ""She's in defiant mood."" ""France hit once again by terrorism"" is the headline in Le Figaro, as it reports on the attack in Strasbourg. The ""bloody shootout"" burst out in a country already ""bogged down"" by the violence associated with the yellow jacket movement, it says.  'Liberation' has dramatic testimony from the scene, where one of its journalists watched what happened from a fourth floor window. She describes people squatting on the ground behind a soldier, ""screaming and crying"".

Transport for London has agreed a £2bn rescue package with the government to enable it to complete the first phase. Repaying that bailout, the FT says, will eat into money earmarked for the second scheme, which would link Surrey and Hertfordshire. The Times, meanwhile, says the Mayor, Sadiq Khan, is now facing calls to scrap his prized freeze on Tube fares in order to balance the books. Children as young as 11 have been arrested for selling the illegal drug known as Spice, according to an investigation by the Daily Mirror.

Konstantin Kisin was told the following areas were off-limits for his jokes: racism, sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia, as well as being either anti-religion or anti-atheism. In its editorial, the Telegraph says the episode shows that ""for the dogmatically offended, comedy is no laughing matter""."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-49894354,Researchers urge action over BAME discrimination,"A survey suggests there are more reports of discrimination, but fewer people believe the current laws are working.",2 Oct 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Researchers at Edinburgh University have called for more government action to tackle racial prejudice.  They said levels of discrimination against black and ethnic minority (BAME) Scots were persisting.  The Scottish government introduced a Race Equality Framework in 2016 to tackle racial discrimination.  However, a survey published on Wednesday suggested fewer people from the BAME community believed the current anti-discrimination laws were working. The polling company Survation questioned more than 500 members of the BAME community on their experiences since the last survey was conducted in 2017.  More than a third (34%) of those questioned said they had experienced discrimination in the past two years.  Of these more than a quarter (27%) felt it was becoming more frequent.  Lead researcher Professor Nasar Meer, of the Edinburgh University's School of Social and Political Science said: ""This survey builds on others in previous years and points to a persistent trend of racial discrimination black and ethnic minority Scots. ""It is encouraging that black and ethnic minority Scots still have faith in Scottish institutions to tackle racism, but this trust has decreased over time.  ""Although levels of non-reporting have improved, they still remain high so more targeted support is needed to help overcome this."" Researchers found 49% of those who had experienced discrimination did not report it - down from more than 60% in previous years, which they said suggested a greater willingness to register complaints. A total of 42% agreed the Scottish government was doing enough to tackle racial discrimination - down from more than 50% in previous surveys.  A similar pattern was true of reported confidence in the laws (60%), which was lower than in previous years. Instances of discrimination included; Of those who had experienced discrimination at work, 25% said it had happened when applying for a job, 18% said it had affected their promotion chances and a further 18% their attempts to seek equal pay. A Scottish government spokesperson said racism and discrimination have no place in Scotland and it was continuing to take decisive action, including a campaign with Police Scotland to tackle hate crime, explicitly targeting racists. The statement added: ""In addition to our Race Equality Framework, which sets out our long-term goals, our Race Equality Action Plan outlines more than 120 actions we are taking over the course of this Parliament to secure better outcomes for minority ethnic communities in Scotland."""

The investigation, undertaken by the board of governors at Holland Park School in west London, found a culture of ""fear, favouritism and inequality"". It said very little support was provided to students after traumatic events such as the Grenfell fire. Pupils and teachers were also subject to sexism, Islamophobia, and racism. The local authority, Kensington and Chelsea, published a statement saying ""last week a child was harmed and a teacher was taken seriously ill"".  It added: ""This week a teacher has left the school in tears and more than 200 pupils were involved in a riot to protest against the future plans being made about their school and to express their concern about their teachers"". Complaints investigated by the board of governors came from students and staff, and included misleading Ofsted inspectors, safeguarding flaws risking students' welfare, and bullying of both teachers and students. The independent investigation looked into claims of safeguarding breaches, bullying, discrimination and inequality in respect of both teachers and students. It also found a failure to support students who had been victims of peer-on-peer sexual abuse.  The complaints and evidence span from 2004, when the school was under the control of Kensington and Chelsea council, to September 2013 when it became a Single Academy Trust, and then from September 2013 to December 2021. Some former staff and students were ""still traumatised by their experiences at Holland Park School"" and ""at times interviewees were extremely distressed in having to revisit their time at Holland Park School and were visibly shaken"", the report said. The Department for Education previously issued the school with a Notice to Improve in November 2021, highlighting financial mismanagement as well as leaders' ""excessive salaries and failure to seek prior approval from the government for 'novel and contentious' expenditure"". The school announced last year that then-head teacher Colin Hall would retire early, while a new chair of governors was appointed. Before he left the school, Mr Hall said: ""We don't recognise the characterisation of the school or our leadership in the allegations raised."" Sarah Newman, executive director at children's services at Kensington and Chelsea Council, said the situation ""has now escalated to such a level that the council is calling for immediate intervention by the Department for Education"". The board of governors said it was taking the findings ""very seriously"" and would be starting a disciplinary investigation in respect of three staff members. A statement added: ""The board of governors has been reconstituted since the events contained in the report occurred, with almost all governors appointed since September 2021.  ""However, the current board deeply regrets that the independent investigation has concluded that these events have occurred."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-58980384,"Clean out online cesspit now, Starmer tells PM","Boris Johnson promises to push through ""tough"" online safety laws, at Prime Minister's Questions.",20 Oct 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Sir Keir Starmer is demanding urgent government action to ""clean out the cesspit"" of online extremism. The Labour leader offered to work with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to fast track new online safety laws. Mr Johnson promised to get the first stage of the long-awaited Online Safety Bill through the Commons by Christmas. He said it would include criminal sanctions for those allowing ""foul content"" - but did not confirm whether that would include company directors.  Labour is calling for the directors of internet firms to be held liable for the content of messages posted on their sites. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said it was now three years since the government had promised a crackdown on online extremism and hate speech but the proposals had yet to begin their passage into law. ""Meanwhile, the damage caused by harmful content online is worse than ever,"" he told MPs. He criticised ""dangerous algorithms"" on Facebook and Instagram - and said he had been shown examples of ""violent Islamism and far-right propaganda"" on TikTok, a social media site popular with teenagers. But he added: ""Telegram has been described as the app of choice for extremists."" Telegram, which has half-a-billion users, is a messaging app, which also has ""channels"" allowing individuals to broadcast to an unlimited audience. Telegram has risen to global prominence as an app of choice to co-ordinate global protest movements; but has also been accused of not doing enough to purge extremist channels run by those involved with the so-called Islamic State group and the Capitol Hill riots. Campaign group Hope Not Hate and the Board of Deputies of British Jews had both said the free-to-use encrypted messaging service had ""facilitated and nurtured a sub-culture that cheerleads terrorists"", Sir Keir said. The messages shown to Sir Keir by Hope Not Hate, posted by anonymous Telegram users, include threats to ""kill all women"", ""kill politicians"" as well as homophobic, Islamophobic and racist abuse. Sir Keir said ""tough sanctions"" were needed - but the government's proposed legislation did not include criminal sanctions against the directors of online platforms. Mr Johnson said the government would look at ways to ""toughen up"" the law and promised to ""come down hard on those who irresponsibly allow dangerous and extremist content to permeate the internet"". He added: ""What we hope for also, is that no matter how tough the proposals we produce, that the opposition will support it."" Regulator Ofcom would have the power to levy fines of up to £18m or 10% of global profits, whichever is higher, on social media platforms which fail to comply with the new online safety laws. The regulator would also be given the power to block services from the UK if they are deemed to present a risk of significant harm to UK citizens. The bill also includes an option to introduce a new criminal offence for senior managers if further action is needed to ensure compliance - something Labour has been calling for. Asked if Mr Johnson was now backing criminal sanctions, a Downing Street spokesperson said the government was ""alive"" to the issue, adding: ""We will continue to listen and work with the companies involved."" Conservative MP and chairman of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport committee Julian Knight said a quicker timetable for the bill risked undermining scrutiny of it. ""We find ourselves in an unworkable situation where, at the whim of the prime minister at the despatch box, the process of scrutiny of this important piece of legislation to tackle online harms will be undermined. We need urgent clarity on this matter,"" said Mr Knight. By Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed that the messaging app Telegram is ""the app of choice"" for extremists. But is he right? Extremist content has been largely forced off mainstream social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and terror groups have moved elsewhere in attempts to spread their ideologies. Telegram has half a billion users, the vast majority using the service in the way it was designed - to exchange messages, images and video with friends, family, and people with shared interests.  In countries like Iran, it's one of the few platforms where people can speak freely about social issues and politics without fear of persecution. However, there are significant numbers who use Telegram to share extremist content and illegal pornography.  Attracted by the platform's secret chats with end-to-end encryption and its seemingly relaxed content moderation policies, Telegram became a haven for jihadist groups, earning it the name ""Terrorgram"". Working with international law enforcement agencies, Telegram has been successful in eliminating most jihadist content. But other extreme content, including what might be defined as ""terrorist"" is still present. It's easy to find racism, sexist and homophobic abuse, anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism, violent imagery, and encouragement of criminal activity on Telegram from users in the UK and around the world. Telegram told the BBC that it was ""surprised"" by Sir Keir's statement, saying that ""calls for violence are expressly forbidden on Telegram"".  ""Our moderators routinely remove content that violates this rule using a combination of proactive monitoring of public spaces and user reports,"" the Telegram statement concluded."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48687744,BBC defends debate imam vetting process,Abdullah Patel's controversial tweets have led to him being suspended by his employer and his mosque.,19 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The BBC has defended its vetting process after it emerged a guest on its leadership debate show had shared allegedly anti-Semitic tweets. Imam Abdullah Patel said he was sure he had not criticised Jewish people but stood by criticism of Israeli policy.  The broadcaster said: ""Had we been aware of the views he expressed he would not have been selected."" Mr Patel has been suspended as deputy head of a girls' school and also by the Masjid e Umar mosque in Gloucester. The BBC said the tweets had come to light after Mr Patel re-activated a previously inactive Twitter profile in the aftermath of Tuesday's debate, and had not been visible to its researchers before then.  Separately, the BBC faced criticism on Wednesday for choosing as a guest on the programme a solicitor who has previously worked for Labour and once stood as a councillor for the party. It defended the decision, saying: ""A background in politics doesn't disqualify anyone from taking part in a debate show."" A screenshot of Mr Patel's Twitter feed from 2014 posted on the Guido Fawkes website showed he shared a graphic of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"". Labour MP Naz Shah was temporarily suspended from her party three years ago after it emerged she had shared the same image on Facebook.  Another screenshot showed a tweet from Mr Patel, apparently giving advice to women on how to avoid being assaulted by men, saying: ""Generally men are the predators, but women need to realise this and be smarter. It takes two to tango, and if you put yourself in that position, don't expect every man to pass up the opportunity to take advantage of you. Don't be alone with a man!"" BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast presenter Nicky Campbell apologised for having Mr Patel as a guest on his show on Wednesday morning, after the imam had reactivated his controversial social media account, saying it contained ""extremely disturbing"" comments that should have been checked.  Al-Ashraf primary school in Gloucester released a statement saying Mr Patel had been suspended ""from all school duties"" while it investigated comments attributed to him in the media.  It added: ""The 'school' and 'trust' do not share the views attributed to him."" A statement from the Masjid e Umar mosque said: ""We are fully aware of the allegations made against our Imam Maulana Abdullah Patel regarding the contents of historic tweets. We have decided to act immediately and have chosen to give him some time away to allow us the opportunity to conduct a detailed investigation into this matter."" Mr Patel, who has now deactivated the Twitter account again, told the BBC Asian Network the school was ""within its right"" to conduct an investigation. ""I don't wish to comment on their decision,"" he added.  Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire earlier, Mr Patel said he had a very good relationship with the Jewish community. ""The criticism was not of the Jewish community because if you go through my tweets, you'd see support for the Jewish community,"" he said.  ""They're our brothers and sisters, and the Jewish community and I - especially in Gloucester - work very closely together. We actually visited a synagogue just a while ago."" However, he said he stood by any criticism of ""Israel's policy"". Mr Patel was one of several members of the public who were invited to ask the five Conservative leadership candidates questions during the televised debate. He asked MPs about the Islamophobic rhetoric faced by members of the Muslim community and whether they agreed that ""words had consequences"".  BBC presenter Emily Maitlis took responses from the Conservative leader candidates, with Sajid Javid taking the opportunity to ask all the candidates to agree to commit to an independent investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, which they appeared to do. Responding to the controversy over Mr Patel's participation in the debate, Mr Javid tweeted that the imam should ""practise what he preaches"". Former Conservative cabinet minister Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, who earlier welcomed the idea of inquiry, warned the controversy over Mr Patel's social media posts should not be allowed to distract from their ""important commitment"".  ""Are we really going to focus on the vile views of this insignificant questioner to undermine the significant answers on a serious issue from five powerful men, one of whom will become PM?"" she asked on Twitter. In response to criticism about choosing a solicitor who had worked for the Labour Party as a guest on the debate programme, the BBC said: ""Last night's questioners held a range of political views and we did not specify these views nor their backgrounds although some chose to do so themselves. ""The last questioner on the debate is a solicitor who was seconded by his law firm to the Labour Party in the past, rather than being a Labour 'staffer'. He is a Labour supporter and once stood as a councillor."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55049627,The secret behind India's ruling party's success,"The BJP is a rare Indian party that remained united despite internal differences, says a new book.",2 Dec 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"There is little doubt that the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has ruled India uninterruptedly since 2014, has become the country's dominant party.  Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing states, steadfastly expanded its pan-Indian footprint.  The main opposition party, Congress, is adrift and enfeebled; the once-powerful regional parties appear to have exhausted much of their potential; and no credible challenger to Mr Modi is visible on the horizon.   Political scientist Suhas Palshikar calls the BJP India's ""second dominant party system"", the first being former PM Indira Gandhi's Congress which ruled the republic for more than half a century. The BJP is the only and first party to win clear majorities since Rajiv Gandhi of Congress did so in 1984 elections. After Indira Gandhi, who was murdered in 1984, Mr Modi is the ""only leader to truly claim mass appeal almost throughout the country"".  The BJP's electoral success is largely attributed to Mr Modi's charisma and the politics of religious polarisation and strident nationalism.  Its campaign is powered by an indefatigable network of workers, many of whom are foot soldiers of its ideological fountainhead, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), or Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a group described by a political scientist as a ""clamorous and militant sibling of the RSS"".  In recent years, the BJP has also thrived on generous and ""opaque funding""; and the unwavering support of a wide swathe of uncritical mainstream media.  But step back a bit and the ""secret sauce"" of success of the BJP, as well as the RSS, may well be their ""unbending focus on unity"", argues Vinay Sitapati, a political scientist, in his new book Jugalbandi: The BJP Before Modi. (The title loosely means a duet of two solo musicians in Indian classical music, and alludes to the partnership of two of BJP's well-known founders, Atal Behari Vajpayee and LK Advani.) From a very early age, cadres belonging to the RSS, the 95-year-old bedrock of Hindu nationalism, are taught a particular version of Hindu history where ""glorious Hindus lose out because they stab each other in the back and they are not united"", says Prof Sitapati, who teaches political science and legal studies at Ashoka University.  This is reinforced, among other things, through selective telling of history and the group's fabled physical training exercises which are ""not just exercise, but exercise done together"". Cadres are taught to march together, stand on top of each other in a pyramid, and play ""games"" that are more associated with team bonding exercises in private firms. ""All this is to highlight the importance of unity. This unifying belief has become an organisational ethic. This is not like every cadre based party,"" Prof Sitapati told me. The BJP aims at uniting Hindus, who comprise more than 80% of Indians, and make them vote as one. That's why it downplays caste - which has traditionally divided Hindus and their political allegiances - ""ups the volume on Islamophobia"", and emphasises the importance of ancient Hindu texts, according to Prof Sitapati.  Like other parties, the BJP has suffered from its share of discord. It has been in power for barely 12 years of the four decade-long life in electoral politics. Being out of power meant there was no patronage to dole out to its workers for a long time.  Relations between the top leaders - Atal Behari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani - were often rocky. It is well documented, for example, how Vajpayee - now deceased - and a few members of his cabinet were unhappy with Mr Modi's continuation as the chief minister of Gujarat after the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the state under the latter's watch. The riots began after 60 Hindu pilgrims died when a train carrying them was set on fire. Still the party stuck together. ""They have sometimes been like an unhappy family which stays together. Their obsession with unity is based on the deep understanding of the flaws of Indian society,"" says Prof Sitapati. Political parties are coalitions of competing interests and factions usually held together by charismatic leaders, ideologies, organisational prowess and, in India's case, caste. Dissent and intra-party conflict are common. India's parties have been splintered by competing egos of leaders and factional feuds. Leaders have broken away from the Congress to form successful regional parties. Nothing of that sort has happened with the BJP - yet.  Led first by Vajpayee and Mr Advani, and now by Mr Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, the party, with ample support from the RSS, has held together . ""I am revealing no secrets when I say that many BJP leaders dislike Mr Modi. Many BJP, RSS and VHP leaders I interviewed admired Mr Modi's fidelity to ideology and knack for winning elections. But many found him ruthless, self-aggrandising and solitary,"" says Prof Sitapati. It helps that the BJP, in the words of Milan Vaishnav, a political scientist, is an ""unusual party"". ""It is the political wing of a broader constellation of Hindu nationalist organisations. It is very hard to separate the political entity from allied and nominally political entities associated with it. The networked model means that the BJP gains a lot of strength from its grassroots organisations and its dense networks help keep individuals inside the tent, so to speak,"" Prof Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, told me. It is not that dissenters have not left the BJP. ""The puzzle is that they don't survive politically and return to the party. Perhaps the reason is BJP is a deeply ideological party and the ideological glue holds it together - and you will find this in the parties on the Left and Right,"" says Rahul Verma, a political scientist and co-author of Ideology and Identity, a book which explores the role of ideology in Indian politics. Whether the BJP will stick together forever is impossible to predict. Its take-no-prisoners style of politics means they have thrown open their doors to defectors - often tainted - from other parties. This can lead to inevitable contradictions over ideological 'purity'. ""How long you can manage the contradictions?"" wonders Mr Verma.  For as long as the party is winning, surely.  That's why elections are the cornerstone of BJP's existence. Mr Verma says BJP's social base is expanding but their leadership still remains predominantly upper caste. That's another contradiction the party might have to grapple with in the future.  Critics believe BJP's unabashedly majoritarian politics is altering the ""idea of India"", one which was more tolerant and informed by secular values. ""Their idea of India won,"" says Prof Sitapati, ""because they worked as one."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53322950,Why are there so few ethnic minority MSPs?,"With an election on the way in 2021, will Holyrood's record of BAME representation improve?",8 Jul 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"MSPs have hit out at the lack of ethnic minority representation at Holyrood as the Black Lives Matter movement continues to reshape politics. But why has Holyrood had so few members from minority backgrounds, and how could this change in 2021? The Black Lives Matter movement has been debated in the Scottish Parliament, but it has also raised questions about why there are only two MSPs from ethnic minority backgrounds to take part in such debates. In five Holyrood elections since 1999, each electing 129 MSPs, Holyrood has had a total of four members from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities - all of them men of Scots-Pakistani heritage. One of the four - Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf - said that a record of ""no black MSP ever, no female BAME MSP ever"" was ""frankly a failure of all of us, regardless of party"". In a recent speech he also pointed out that the director general of every Scottish government department and the chair of every public body is white, saying ""that is not good enough"". With parties now working on their candidate lists for the 2021 elections, what needs to change? With many MPs and MSPs beginning their careers in local politics, the issue extends to Scotland's councils too. Soryia Siddique is a Labour councillor in Glasgow, and stood for the party in the last Holyrood election in 2016. She told BBC Scotland's The Nine programme that she has had to deal with racism, sexism and Islamophobia, saying that people would frequently mix her up with a colleague who also wore a hijab, with even council officials apparently ""not being able to differentiate between us"". She said: ""When I stood in 2012 as a Muslim woman of colour, some of the comments I heard were 'she's unelectable', 'she needs to be more modernised'.  ""That hurt - you would hear people saying I don't come across as being Scottish enough because of the way I choose to dress. ""In 99% of the meetings I go to I'm the only woman of colour at that meeting. In policy decisions and in terms of policy shaping, it's not acceptable. ""I know there's no lack of talent, no lack of aspiration or lack of ambition. There has to be a recognition that something is happening before people get to that stage. ""Children from a BAME background don't see themselves for example in a senior management role, as senior teachers, or as policy makers and these things have an impact, without a doubt."" Fatima Zahra Joji - an SNP activist from Aberdeenshire - said more has to be done by political parties ""that claim they are progressive and inclusive"", but have not delivered results. She said that ""diversity is key in terms of societal progression, and if you look at today's Scottish society, we have failed in that aspect"". She said: ""If you look at our black and minority ethnic population, we've got 1% who are black and if you include Asian and minority ethnic it's about 5%.  ""It might seem small, but if you look at 5% of 5.5 million, you're talking about hundreds of thousands people. That's hundreds of thousands of people that you're ignoring. ""I think we need to look at our Scottish history, and how our society is rooted in systemic racism and oppression and unconscious bias, to the point where we don't even realise we're doing it. ""You need the diverse experience, the lived experiences if you want to make a society that you claim is representative and progressive, and when many people are held back it's going to affect people who claim they are not."" Efforts are being made to get more young people to at least get a taste of life at Holyrood. The John Smith Centre - a think tank at the University of Glasgow - has recently doubled the number of recruits to its parliamentary internship programme, with the aim of half of them being taken up by students from BAME backgrounds. Rafe Uddin is a student who went on one of these internships, and said that ""the moment you walk into Holyrood, it's quite obvious that you're one of a few people in parliament from an ethnic minority background"". He said too often the onus is put on people from ethnic minority backgrounds to fix the problem themselves - that they are ""sort of burdened with having to find the solution to problems that are very much out of their control"". Rafe said having candidate shortlists that deliberately promote black and Asian women could help boost representation. He said: ""All-women shortlists have been incredibly effective in the Labour party in particular, it's reshaped the composition of that party and put more women in politics and actually at the fore of politics too. ""You can have ethnic minority shortlists as well, and there's nothing to say you couldn't have shortlists with black women and Asian women in particular to actually help both with gender composition and ethnic minority representation."" The SNP said Holyrood needs to ""better reflect our population"", saying the first job was to ""encourage many more BAME members to come forward"" as candidates. A party spokesman said legislation might prevent them from ""addressing this in the same way that we did to increase the number of women being elected"", but said they would ""be taking steps to make sure that BAME candidates are involved in selection contests in as many seats as possible"" The Scottish Conservatives have set up a commission led by former MEP Nosheena Mobarik which aims to get more women and ethnic minority candidates elected. A spokesman said the party has ""a vibrant and diverse range of members, activists and staff from all backgrounds that are now working through the ranks"", and that the best way to improve representation was ""removing barriers that are stopping people from standing"". Meanwhile, the Lib Dems are considering plans to put candidates who are women, disabled or from minority ethnic backgrounds forward in their ""most winnable"" seats in 2021."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-40158469,London attack: Fake news spread online,Find out what's buzzing in the social media world today.,5 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Fake stories, images and misinformation have been circulating on Twitter in the days following the attack on London Bridge.  It's not a new phenomenon, but does seem to be a growing trend, as fake images also circulated online in the aftermath of the Manchester attack last month. Seven people were killed and 48 injured when three attackers drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed several in Borough Market on Saturday night. Soon after the news broke images of the ""missing"" started circulating.   Among the many false missing images shared online was that of David Sherratt. A Twitter user unknown to David shared his image claiming he was his ""missing brother"" and appealed for retweets. David, 20, is based in Cardiff and runs a YouTube page called Alternative Facts. He says he hadn't been to London in months and was only alerted to the tweet by a follower.  David told BBC that he was concerned ""people were going to waste resources looking for me instead of actual victims"". Many YouTubers were also victims of fake missing tweets, including US-based Jacob Sartorius, with one user claiming he was their child. The Twitter account responsible for that post has since been taken down. Other YouTubers whose images were posted with claims they were some of the missing include MattyBraps, Vinny (Vinesauce), and Devon Sweeney. Another user tweeted a photo of Infowars editor Paul Joseph Watson, claiming he was worried about ""his boyfriend who hasn't returned my calls"". The BBC spoke to one of those sharing the fake tweets who told us his aim was to ""see if people would pick up on it"". While a 17-year-old from Pennsylvania, US responsible for another fake tweet said the tweet was a ""public service"" because it made ""people [retweeting it] feel good about themselves"". *We have chosen not to include some of the images and profiles of accounts circulating fake images to prevent the spread of misinformation* Shortly after the attack, many Facebook users in London used the Safety Check feature to reassure family and friends they were ok.  But the tool was also misused by users who requested food or transportation despite being located outside the UK. Others used it to share Islamophobic messages.  Meanwhile, people who weren't located in the area also used the feature to offer their assistance.  One Facebook user living in Wales volunteered to host a family affected by the attack for a weekend while another extended her ""time and support"" and a listening ear in addition to material help. Other online trolls shared a photo supposedly showing the ""suspect that ran down pedestrians on London Bridge"". The man in the image was identified as US comedian Sam Hyde Hyde has been wrongly accused by online trolls of perpetrating a wide range of mass shootings and attacks in the United States.  Users on the social network 4chan have helped perpetuate that narrative. The alt-right Twitter account Tennessee tweeted a screen grab from a live broadcast on Al-Jazeera's Facebook page which it suggested showed ""moderate Muslims"" laughing at the attack. A similar image was also spread online following the Westminster attack in March, and from an Al-Jazeera live Facebook video. The video in question, screen grabbed from Al-Jazeera's page, appears to show a relatively low number of people reacted with a laughing emoji with many more people adding the crying and angry emojis to the stream.  It's also difficult to ascertain the religion and nationality of all the users who reacted to the post from their Facebook profiles.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-66376865,University 'dismissed complaints' over sexist farmer,Two veterinary science students say they were asked to take their tops off and clean holiday lets.,4 Aug 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Two students who said they faced sexist harassment while on a farm placement claim their lecturer dismissed their concerns. The University of Bristol veterinary science students said that while on the farm they were asked to take their tops off and clean holiday rentals. One said a senior lecturer was ""dismissive"" of their concerns, saying it was ""typical farmer behaviour"". The university said it had suspended the farm from its list of placements.  One student, who originally spoke to the Bristol Tab, said she had been worried because she had received a text message from the farmer promising to ""give us alcohol and make it a party"".     Speaking to BBC West, she said the lecturer had warned cancelling would have been ""unprofessional"".  There were ""lots of little comments"" from the farmer, she said.  ""[There were] comments about us being women, not strong, not made for farm work - he made a comment about another girl taking her top off for him to do some painting."" ""When we cleaned his holiday lodge rentals, he said 'you're women, that's your job'."" The students claim they were instructed by lecturers to report anything that made them uncomfortable to the farmer's wife, rather than the university's emergency phone number.  ""There was a helpline we could ring and we were told that was for immediate danger emergencies,"" she said.   The student claimed that after the placement a senior lecturer had been ""really dismissive"" of their complaints.  ""She laughed at us during the meeting, she said it was typical farmer behaviour,"" she said.  ""It was so disappointing to hear it, she literally said 'what do you expect?'."" The pair said the farmer admitted he had previously been removed from the university's placement list following complaints by students.  But he had been asked to take students again during the pandemic due to a shortage of work experience opportunities.  ""The fact they knowingly sent us on the placement was upsetting,"" the student said.   The second student said she felt uncomfortable being left alone with the farmer.  On a warm day, he told her ""it's take-your-top-off weather"", adding he would ""pay to see that"".  As well as cleaning holiday lets, the students were asked to paint walls.  ""He said we should take our tops off to paint,"" the student said.   The farmer also sent her a video of two scantily clad girls dancing, adding he expected ""to see that in the shed on Saturday"".  Professor Sheena Warman, deputy head of the university's veterinary school, said the students' concerns were being taken seriously. ""The behaviour and attitudes they experienced during their placement were completely unacceptable and I am sorry for the distress this has caused,"" she said.  ""I agree that the feedback received from their lecturer when this was raised with them afterwards was disappointing and they have contacted the students themselves to apologise directly."" Prof Warman said the university would be updating its guidance to students ahead of placements and reminding staff ""how best they can offer support"".  ""Whilst we continue to look into the concerns raised, we have taken the farm in question off our placement list and will decide in due course whether it should be removed completely,"" she added. Following the students' complaints, the Association of Veterinary Students UK and Ireland (AVS) said it had received similar allegations of harassment from others on farm placements.  It set up an anonymous survey for members to report concerns and said the results would be released imminently.  Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-61310441,"Terror-accused surveyed police station, jury told","Luke Skelton took photos of a Newcastle police station he considered as a target, a court hears.",3 May 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A student who was referred to the Prevent anti-terror programme carried out ""hostile reconnaissance"" of a police station, a court heard. Luke Skelton, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, harboured racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic views, the jury was told. Teesside Crown Court heard the 18-year-old took photos of Forth Banks police station in Newcastle in September. He denies preparing to commit terrorist acts in the year up to October 2021. Setting out the case for the prosecution, Nicholas de la Poer QC said the purpose of the photographs was to carry out ""hostile reconnaissance"" and Forth Banks was one of three police stations the Gateshead College student considered as potential targets. Mr de la Poer said: ""Luke Skelton believed in an extreme right-wing ideology. An ideology which lionised Adolf Hitler. ""An ideology which approved of the terrible attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. ""An ideology which is racist, sexist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic."" 'Racial war' The jury was told Mr Skelton's autism may be used as factor in his defence, but the Crown maintains he was planning acts of terror. Concerns were raised at the defendant's college about images in his workbook and he told a tutor he had strong right-wing views, the court was told. He was referred to the Prevent programme and had eight sessions with a caseworker before he left the service when he turned 18. In January last year he searched how to make dynamite and began composing a so-called ""final note"" on his phone, intended to be read by others after something had happened, the jury was told. Mr de la Poer said: ""He states the purpose of the final note is to 'clarify the reasoning for why I have committed these acts is to accelerate the coming collapse and racial war'. ""The hope Luke Skelton is expressing is for his act to spark this war."" Mr Skelton was first arrested in June, leading him to change his username for an online group to ""Adolf Hitler"" - ""so the police don't suspect me"", he told Discord users. He was held on suspicion of possessing documents useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, but after he was released he told followers he felt like a coward as he had not done anything yet. In the following days he downloaded a video of the Christchurch mosque atrocity and edited the Friends theme tune over it, which the prosecution allege was done because the lyric ""I'll be there for you"" suggested a kinship with the mass murderer. Mr Skelton also wrote the recipe for an explosive in part of his phone, the jury was told. He talked online about murdering rape gangs and attacking a drag queen and in August wrote a note on his phone about bombing a police station, Mr de la Poer said. He was arrested for a second time in October and charged with a terrorist offence. The next day police found a piece of A4 paper on which he had written a speech expressing his fascist views, Mr de la Poer said. The trial continues.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44436079,Labour racism investigation 'rings hollow',Transport Minister Humza Yousaf claims Scottish Labour has not yet contacted key witnesses after three months.,11 Jun 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Scottish Labour has not contacted key witnesses in a racism investigation it began three months ago, the BBC has learned. The party has yet to ask Transport Scotland officials for evidence in the case of a councillor who made controversial remarks about Transport Minister Humza Yousaf. Mr Yousaf said Labour's promise of swift action appeared to ""ring hollow"". Scottish Labour said investigations were continuing. It is understood the investigation is still at a ""preliminary"" stage. In March, Dumfries and Galloway councillor Jim Dempster was suspended by Labour following a complaint. He had apparently told transport officials that ""no-one would have seen (Mr Yousaf) under his burka"" when he visited the area. The councillor apologised and said he was ""ashamed and embarrassed"". But Mr Yousaf said he should be expelled by Labour. The party leader, Richard Leonard, ordered an investigation. But almost three months later, Transport Scotland said there had been ""no contact at all"" from Labour. In an interview with BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Humza Yousaf said: ""I was told there would be a swift investigation - I've not heard anything.  ""I was heartened a few weeks after the complaint that I made, when Richard Leonard said there would be a zero tolerance approach and he'd be personally accountable for that.  ""Almost three months later, for nothing to have happened, his words really ring hollow"".  It is understood the case is to be considered by Labour's ruling body - the NEC - next month. The party said it would inappropriate to comment. It's not the only racism case under investigation. In January, the Labour MSP Anas Sarwar said the party's council group leader in South Lanarkshire had told him ""Scotland wouldn't vote for a brown, Muslim, Paki"". The councillor - Davie McLachlan - categorically denied making the remarks but was suspended by the party. It's understood this case has been referred to UK Labour's national constitutional committee for a hearing later this year. In February, the MP Hugh Gaffney apologised for making what he said were ""deeply offensive and unacceptable"" remarks about Chinese and LGBT people. He was reprimanded by the party and sent for diversity training. In March, when Councillor Dempster's case was made public it led to further allegations against him. A Sanquhar man of Pakistani origin told the BBC that he had been repeatedly racially abused by Jim Dempster before he was elected. Councillor Dempster has strongly denied that allegation. Around this time, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard told an anti-racism rally that ""we need to be impatient and angry in our pursuit of justice and equality"". A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: ""Investigations into alleged misconduct are continuing and as a result it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."" In May, five members in the Glasgow south-west constituency said they felt ""not wanted and not welcome"" in the Labour party because of their Asian background. They made the complaint in a letter to the party leadership and it's understood they have been invited to discuss their concerns with Mr Leonard after Ramadan. Scottish Labour adopted a plan to tackle racism at its Dundee conference in the spring and Mr Sarwar has established a cross-party group at Holyrood to tackle Islamophobia."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63552011,Christchurch mass killer appeals against conviction,"New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern said Brenton Tarrant's appeal was an attempt to ""revictimise people"".",8 Nov 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The white supremacist who murdered 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand is appealing against his conviction. Brenton Tarrant, 32, has filed an appeal against his case and sentence, court officials said. No hearing for the appeal has been set at this stage. Tarrant was jailed to life without parole in 2020 for the murder and attempted murder of Muslim worshippers. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said he was attempting to ""revictimise people"". Asked about his appeal, Ms Ardern told reporters: ""His is a name that shouldn't be repeated and I'm going to apply that same rule in commenting on his attempts to revictimise people. We should give him nothing."" Her government refuses to publicly name Tarrant to deprive him of any platform or notoriety. Imam Gamal Fouda, a survivor of the attack at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, said he was ""struggling to understand"" a motive for Tarrant to appeal given ""he himself pleaded guilty"". ""I cannot help but think that this is another action from this terrorist to harm his victims again by keeping alive the memory of him and his terrorist actions,"" he told The New Zealand Herald newspaper. Tarrant, an Australian national who moved to New Zealand in 2017, stormed two mosques in the southern city on 15 March 2019, armed with military-grade semi-automatic guns. He had the intention of killing as many Muslim people as he could, his trial heard in 2020. He livestreamed the attack on Facebook via a headcam and also published a 74-page manifesto on extremist forums.  During his trial, he chose to not give any testimony. He pleaded guilty to the charges of murder, attempted murder and terrorism and also declined to oppose the prosecution's call for the maximum sentence possible. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole - the first time New Zealand handed down the punishment. The country does not have the death penalty. His sentencing judge at the time noted Tarrant showed no contrition, remorse or shame for his actions. ""Your crimes are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment,"" said Judge Cameron Mander. A coronial inquest is currently underway in New Zealand into the attack. Authorities on Tuesday said they would consider whether the appeal might affect the inquest. The Christchurch attack was the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's history. The shootings prompted parliament to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners.  51 people lost their lives in the attack on two mosques in the New Zealand city in 2019."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62150063,Diverse line-up in race for PM signals Tory shift,What does the diversity of candidates vying to be Conservative party leader and PM tell us about British politics?,14 Jul 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Whoever wins the race to be the next prime minister, it will have been the most diverse major party leadership contest in UK history. What does this tell us about British politics? Four of the eight Conservative MPs who made it through to the first round of voting are women, and five - Rishi Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat - are from ethnic minority backgrounds. Mr Zahawi was voted out in the first round, along with Jeremy Hunt, and Ms Braverman was knocked out in Thursday's second round. Before Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti dropped out, a third of the Conservative Party's 22 non-white MPs were bidding to be its next leader. In a matter of weeks, the Conservatives could elect only the third national leader from an ethnic minority in Western Europe, after former Irish premier Leo Varadkar, whose parents are white Irish and Indian, and the first, Antonio Costa the prime minister of Portugal whose parents are half Portuguese and half Indian from Goa. This is quite a turnaround for a party that was historically seen as an exclusively white domain, but it did not happen by accident. It is largely the product of a 17-year long effort to increase the diversity of Conservative MPs, launched by former leader David Cameron. When Mr Cameron was elected leader in 2005, the party had just two ethnic minority MPs, both men.  In the teeth of opposition from traditionally-minded colleagues, he created an A-list of diverse candidates for winnable seats, saying he wanted to make the party more representative of modern Britain. Rob Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, said Mr Cameron ""deserves credit"" for persuading local Conservative associations to adopt diverse candidates, whether they were on the A-list or not. The fact that many have risen rapidly through the ranks, into cabinet positions and are now leadership contenders, is no accident either, he argues. ""Cameron wasn't just looking for anyone off the street. They were looking to get really impressive, high flying people from diverse backgrounds."" There is a sense that ""their time has come"", argues Professor Ford. ""They are not just seeing themselves as the right people for this moment, they are being seen by colleagues as right for the moment."" All of those vying to be the next Tory leader have tried to project a compelling personal story - but none have so far made an issue of their race.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who is not among the contenders, said: ""I have always found in the Conservative Party that people were less bothered about where you come from, in terms of your ethnic background, your social background, than they were, for example, in the Labour Party, or in other parties."" He argues that the Conservatives are a ""individualistic"" party where people ""take you as they find you"" and are not interested in ""identity politics"". ""I don't understand why it is incumbent on ethnic politicians to represent their race in a way that it isn't incumbent on other people of the majority population. No one says 'he is a white politician, he is representing me'."" The Conservative Party still lags behind Labour when it comes to ethnic minority representation at Westminster. A record number of 41 black, Asian and minority ethnic Labour MPs were elected in 2019, and there are now more female Labour MPs than men for the first time. Ethnic minority voters still overwhelmingly vote Labour, according to House of Commons library research.  Analysis of the 2010 general election, by Oxford University's Professor Anthony Heath, suggested minorities were not as ""progressive"" in their political views as white British voters, but backed Labour ""because of belief, based on collective experience, that Labour looks after ethnic minorities while the Conservatives do not"". The Conservatives have gained a little ground since 2010 - with 20% of black and minority ethnic voters backing them at the 2019 general election, according to pollsters Ipsos. That support may grow with a black or Asian Tory prime minister.  But many on the left argue that the colour of those in the cabinet, or even at the helm of the party, is irrelevant, as the Conservatives have harmed race relations in the UK. They point to the Windrush scandal, plans to deport illegal immigrants to Rwanda, and an ongoing investigation into Islamophobia in the party, as evidence of deep-rooted discrimination. In a 2020 interview with The Independent, former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott claimed the government was in ""denial"" about systemic racial prejudice within the police, immigration services and the criminal justice system.  Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City university, said: ""It is the most diverse government in history, but it also has the most racist policies of any government."" He argues that black and Asian Conservative ministers are essentially ""fronts for white oppression"", saying they are able to introduce policies that white political leaders would not be able to get away with. There is also the question of social class. The race to be the next PM may be diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity, but most of the contenders fit the traditional Tory profile of well-off, privately educated and from comfortable middle class homes. Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University London, said: ""I do worry that the group that is most missing from Parliament - and most missing from this leadership contest - will be people who come from backgrounds that many people would identify with, and are considered ordinary."" There's no denying that Parliament is now more visibly representative of the country - and this Conservative leadership contest reflects that evolution.  And having a prime minister of colour would undoubtedly be an important milestone in British politics. But the question of representation is a thorny and complex one. Some might feel inspired to see someone who looks like them in a position of power and feel more invested in the government of the day. Others might be put off by wealth, private education, an elite university degree - or any other experience they can't relate to. And still others might see no need for a prime minister to have a similar background to them, so long as they can deliver policies that make a positive impact. Whoever wins this race will be drawing from all different parts of their identity and life story to determine what policies to pursue in office."

Andrew Bowles, who leads Swale Council, was disciplined after appearing to endorse a claim Mr Robinson's Facebook ban was a ""disgraceful injustice"". He has apologised for any offence caused and agreed to attend training on the better use of social media.    Labour said the Tories were in denial about Islamophobia in their ranks. The party has come under fire in recent weeks for its handling of allegations of anti-Muslim prejudice. Former Conservative chairwoman Baroness Warsi has accused party officials of failing to deal with complaints properly and ignoring her warnings about the scale of the problem. The current chairman Brandon Lewis has insisted swift action has been taken when complaints are made although the party has declined to say how many cases are currently being investigated.  Mr Bowles, who has led Swale Borough Council in Kent for 16 years, was suspended after appearing to back a message criticising Facebook's decision to ban the former English Defence leader from its pages. The message contained a doctored image of the movie The Patriot featuring Mr Robinson's face superimposed on the body of the main character, played in the film by Mel Gibson. It said Mr Robinson's Facebook ban was due to him being ""racist to Muslims"", arguing that this was a ""disgraceful injustice"" and ""this corruptness needs to stop"". At the time of his suspension, Mr Bowles insisted he had not meant to endorse Mr Robinson's ""racist and intolerant views"" which he found abhorrent.  Instead, he said he had wanted to make the point that ""silencing"" the campaigner risked turning him into a martyr.  Speaking on Monday, he again apologised for any offence caused by his tweet and disclosed he had received an email from the Mr Lewis' office reinstating his party membership.  The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said no reason had been given by the party for the decision. A Conservative Party spokeswoman said its complaints process was rightly confidential, so as to ""protect the anonymity of potential complainants, so they can come forward in confidence"". ""Selective cases do not provide a complete picture of how complaints are dealt with,"" she said. Shadow equalities minister Naz Shah expressed concern about the speed with which Mr Bowles had had his suspension lifted, suggesting it showed the Conservatives were not taking the issue seriously.  ""They can start by adopting the All-Party Parliamentary Group for British Muslims' definition of Islamophobia, as Labour has done,"" she said. ""But what the Tories really need is an independent inquiry to root out this and other forms of racism within their ranks."" Facebook removed Mr Robinson's official page and Instagram profile last month, saying its contents violated its policies on hate speech and the social network's community standards."

The one-time communist and adviser to former first minister Jack McConnell was given the award just five months into her role by the Herald newspaper. Ms Freeman saw off competition from fellow SNP cabinet member Mike Russell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson to win the title. Mental health campaigner Gillian Murray was named Campaigner of the Year. Her work helped secure a review of care services offered by NHS Tayside following the death of her uncle David Ramsay by suicide in 2016. Ms Freeman took on the role of health secretary in a reshuffle when Shona Robison resigned, citing personal challenges, amid accusations that she had presided over a series of failings in the NHS.  She made changes within weeks of being promoted to Nicola Sturgeon's Cabinet and went on to set out a three-year plan, backed with £850m of funding, in a bid to meet a series of key waiting time targets for NHS Scotland. She also announced NHS board debts were being written off as part of the introduction of a new medium-term financial framework. Speaking after being given the prize at an awards ceremony at Edinburgh's Prestonfield House Hotel, Ms Freeman said: ""I've come a long way from being a student communist, haven't I, and it was a fine discipline to learn. ""One of the things you learn when you move on from that discipline is the point of politics is to make a difference, and the make a difference you have to get elected."" She added: ""The point of politics is to make a difference, that's why we do it. We shouldn't do it to be somebody, we should do it to do something."" Labour's Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney won Best Scot at Westminster, in part in recognition for his lobbying of the UK government in immigration cases such as that of Giorgi Kakava, a 10-year-old orphan who had been threatened with deportation following the death of his mother. While Mr Russell lost out on the top prize, he was named as the Donald Dewar Debater of the Year after spending much of his last year taking on the Tories over Brexit. Meanwhile former minister Bruce Crawford was honoured as the Committee MSP of the Year after the finance and constitution committee he chairs sat through marathon sessions scrutinising the Scottish government's Brexit continuity bill. Kate Forbes, who was made Digital Economy Minister was named as the One to Watch following both her promotion to the government and her campaigning efforts to try to end the use of plastic drinking straws. Efforts to tackle the problem of everyday Islamophobia by Labour MSP Anas Sarwar saw him receive the award for Community MSP of the Year, with Mr Sarwar having set up a cross party group at Holyrood as part of this work. Meanwhile, Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser was given the Politics in Business Award, and Ms Sturgeon was awarded the E-Politician of the Year for her effective use of Twitter, and Dundee City Council leader John Alexander was named Scottish Local Politician of the Year."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-56523179,Prophet cartoon protests 'deeply unsettling',"Robert Jenrick defends the right of teachers to ""appropriately"" show images of the Prophet Muhammed.",26 Mar 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Protests outside a school where pupils were shown a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad are ""deeply unsettling"", a government minister has said. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said teachers should be able to ""appropriately show images of the prophet"" in class. Protests have been staged outside Batley Grammar School, where a teacher has been suspended. The West Yorkshire school has apologised ""unequivocally"".  Head teacher Gary Kibble said the member of staff had been suspended since the image was used in a lesson on Monday.  Demonstrators gathered for a second day on Friday morning, but had moved on by mid-afternoon. The school, which had been due to break up for the Easter holiday, was understood to have switched to a day of remote learning and the gates remained locked. Mr Jenrick called for the ""deeply unsettling"" scenes outside the school to ""come to an end"". ""In a free society we want religions to be taught to children and for children to be able to question and query them,"" he told the BBC. ""We must see teachers protected and no-one should be feeling intimidated or threatened as they go into school."" Protesters had demanded the teacher's sacking, while some parents who spoke to the BBC said they didn't agree with the demonstrations and found them ""intimidating"". As a crowd gathered on Friday, one protester read out a statement at the school gates. He said the group ""do not accept that the school has taken this issue seriously, given that it's taken them four days to merely suspend only one of the teachers involved"". Another protester, who gave his name only as Mr Hussain, told the PA news agency he was a parent at the school and said: ""We would not like any form of extremism, any extremist viewpoints, to be taught to children."" MEND, which helps Muslims engage with British media and politics, said its Islamophobia Response Unit had been helping ""several"" parents liaise with the school over the issue. Deputy chair Dr Shazad Amin, said he saw ""no problem"" with blasphemy being discussed at the school but said the particular image shown to pupils was ""deeply offensive"" and ""furthered stereotypes and anti-Islamic tropes"". As a result, he said people in the local community had ""a right to feel hurt and a right to feel angry"" but called for them to allow the matter to be properly investigated. He said parents were ""fairly positive"" with the action taken so far by the school. Former Conservative Party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the debate has been hijacked by ""extremists on both sides"" to fuel a ""culture war"" at the expense of ""kids and their learning"".   She told the BBC she had spoken to pupils and parents over the last 24 hours and ""that many pupils were left distressed because of what happened"". Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, she said: ""It's about safeguarding children and making sure the school look again, as should every school, to ensure that every pupil in their school is being taught in a way which creates a positive, unifying learning environment."" By Corinne Wheatley, BBC News Around a dozen or so protestors who remained outside Batley Grammar School for most of the morning have now left.  The school was due to break up for the Easter holiday today, but the gates are locked and the school is shut.  The protesters here this morning said they wanted to keep things peaceful after concerns were raised yesterday about threats and intimidation towards school staff.  Some passers-by told me they wanted the protest to wind down so they could work on a dialogue with school and to bring an end to the disruption to the local community. Labour MP for Batley and Spen, Tracey Brabin, condemned those who ""seek to fan the flames of this incident"", and said she welcomed the school's apology. In a statement, she said: ""No teacher should be facing intimidation or threats, there is no excuse for that. ""The focus must be on the welfare and education of the children at this school."" West Yorkshire Police said no arrests had been made and officers remained at the school.  Parts of the Koran are taken to mean that neither Allah nor Muhammad can be captured in an image by human hand and any attempt to do so is seen as an insult. Head teacher Mr Kibble said the teacher had ""given their most sincere apologies"" and been suspended pending an investigation. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called for the school to be allowed to investigate the matter ""without a running commentary in the media, on social media, and outside the school gates"". A petition calling for the teacher to be reinstated has received more than 10,000 signatures. In a statement on Thursday, the Department for Education said it was ""never acceptable to threaten or intimidate teachers"" and that they encouraged dialogue between schools and parents when issues emerged. Kirklees Council said Batley Grammar is an academy school so the authority only has a ""very limited role"" in its running but said it was pleased to see the school had taken ""swift action"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-54432509,'Close mosques' councillor did not breach code,"Councillors accept the ruling on Conservative Beverley Dunlop, but condemn her comments.",6 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Tory councillor accused of making Islamophobic comments on social media did not breach a council's code of conduct, an investigator has ruled. In one post, Dorset councillor Beverley Dunlop suggested banning mosques. Independent investigator Tim Darsley said she had been acting in a personal capacity when she made the comments.  Members of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council's standards committee accepted the report but condemned the ""unacceptable"" remarks. Several posts made by the Moordown ward councillor in two different Facebook groups were included in a dossier sent to The Guardian, highlighting alleged Islamophobia among Conservative councillors, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. In one of the posts, Ms Dunlop said: ""I hate to ban anything really but I'd suggest we start with mosques."" In another she said fundamentalists were ""hiding in plain sight in the Muslim community"" and that this would not change ""until they are more frightened of the British government (because they and their families might get deported) than they are Isis"". Ms Dunlop said her comments had been taken out of context. However, a formal complaint was made to the council by Bournemouth University lecturer Osman Ahmed in November last year. He said the comments brought the council ""into disrepute"" and Ms Dunlop should be ""removed from her position"". The council's standards committee agreed to accept Mr Darsley's finding. However, chairman Steve Baron, from the Poole People Party, said the remarks ""could be looked at as bringing the council into disrepute"". Green Party councillor Chris Rigby said the comments were ""not acceptable"" whether made in a public or private capacity. Conservative member Ann Stribley said: ""This 'get out of jail' card is not a good enough excuse if we want to be respected in the public arena."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50079997,Don't stigmatise Muslims says Macron amid veil row,"Protests erupt in France as a Muslim mother accuses a far-right politician of ""racial violence"".",17 Oct 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"French President Emmanuel Macron has warned against ""stigmatising"" Muslims or linking the Islamic religion with the fight against terrorism. ""We have to stand together with all our fellow citizens,"" Mr Macron said during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday. It came as a French woman said she was taking legal action against far-right politicians who criticised her for wearing an Islamic headscarf in public. France has about five million Muslims. It is the largest Muslim minority in Western Europe. Wearing the Muslim headscarf or veil - known as a hijab - is banned in French schools, and for public servants at their place of work. France is officially a secular state and body-covering garments have been at the centre of a number of controversies in recent years. Last week, a Muslim mother who wore a headscarf during a school trip with her son to the regional parliament in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in eastern France received verbal abuse from the chamber.  An image of the woman - given the name Fatima - embracing her son was widely shared after footage of the incident was posted on social media. It also sparked street demonstrations in the area and has renewed a national debate over the Muslim veil. France currently has no law banning mothers from wearing the hijab on school trips.  On Wednesday, Mr Macron called for a better understanding of the Muslim religion in France and condemned what he described as the ""fatal shortcut"" of linking Islam with terrorism. ""There is a lot of irresponsibility among political commentators,"" he said, adding: ""Communalism is not terrorism."" Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer made clear that the law did not ban women accompanying children from wearing headscarves, although he then said his personal opinion was that wearing a headscarf was ""not desirable in our society"". The incident at the regional parliament building in eastern France occurred during a school trip on Friday 11 October in which Fatima accompanied her young son.  A politician from Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally - formerly known as the National Front - saw her during a debate and ordered her to remove her veil.  Julien Odoul posted his verbal exchange on Twitter along with a message citing a fatal knife attack on four police officers in Paris earlier this month which has been linked to Islamist radicalisation.  ""After the murder of our four policemen, we cannot tolerate this [provocation],"" he wrote.  In an interview with the group Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), Fatima said she was sitting quietly in a corner of the room when she heard someone shout ""in the name of secularism"".  ""People started screaming and getting upset,"" she told CCIF (in French), adding: ""The only thing I saw was the distress of the children - they were really shocked and traumatised. ""I tried to reassure them... my son approached me and jumped on me, crying. I told them I could not stay."" Her lawyer, Sana Ben Hadj, said her client felt ""humiliated"" after images of the incident were widely shared. CCIF said Fatima was filing a complaint in the city of Dijon over ""violence of a racial nature committed... by persons with public authority"", adding that a further complaint would be filed in Paris for ""incitement of racial hatred"". The incident has also sparked a debate over mothers wearing a headscarf going on school trips, when teachers are not allowed to.  The education minister was widely criticised for suggesting the veil was ""not desirable"", and Marine Le Pen has called for it to be banned on school trips. A ban on Muslim headscarves and other ""conspicuous"" religious symbols at state schools in France was introduced in 2004. It received overwhelming political and public support in a country where the separation of state and religion is enshrined in law. In 2011, France became the first European country to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public places, while alternatives such as hijabs, which cover the head and hair, remained legal. Under the ban no woman, French or foreign, is able to leave their home with their face hidden behind a veil without running the risk of a fine. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose administration introduced the ban, said veils oppressed women and were ""not welcome"" in France. Correction 20 November 2019: This article has since been updated to make clear that the ban on headscarves in public relates to public servants in their place of work."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-57387884,Teen calls on victims to speak out against racism,A 17-year-old who was targeted last month says racism is too often ignored by victims.,8 Jun 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A teenager has called for victims of racist abuse to speak out more after being targeted last month. Yasmin, 17, was racially abused as she walked home with a friend in Oswestry. She said her mother, who wears a hijab and has also been racially abused, would have preferred her not to have gone to the police, due to a lack of trust in authorities. However, Yasmin said this attitude meant incidents going underreported, particularly in rural areas. She said a young boy, whom she believed to be in primary school, shouted a highly offensive term. ""I laughed a bit and said I'd not heard that for a while - it's been a couple of years,"" she said. It led to her recalling other incidents in the past which she did not report. ""I remember this one boy, before he'd even met me, went round after the Manchester attack and kept telling everyone that teachers should check my bags in case I had a bomb coming into the school,"" she said. Yasmin said if her friend had not been with her last month, she probably ""wouldn't have told anyone"". ""My family doesn't talk about racism, it's the elephant in the room which is covered up,"" she said. The teenager, who turns 18 this month, was interviewed by West Mercia Police after her friend reported the latest abuse.  When the 17-year-old gave a statement to officers, she said her mother was ""a bit angry"".  ""I told her I wasn't the one in trouble but she said 'no, it's still the police'. She's scared that something might happen to harm us more."" Yasmin said she believed such attitudes meant racism going unnoticed in areas like rural Shropshire. ""My mum, because she wears a hijab, she gets comments, people laughing at her, pointing at her,"" Yasmin said. ""It's very common, but it's not very talked about. We just think there's nothing you can do about it, so we don't make a big deal out of it."" In the 2020-21 financial year, there were 1,524 hate crimes recorded in the West Mercia Police force area, 69% of them having a racial marker. Police and Crime Commissioner John Campion told the BBC these offences were higher than previous years, which he called ""a worrying trend"". ""We need to make sure all communities in West Mercia have confidence in their police service,"" he said. ""What's worrying is that loads isn't reported - there's lots out there that people are just putting up with. ""We don't have to put up with these crimes, something can be done.""

Stephen Antony Savva, a candidate for Brimsdown ward on Enfield Council, made the Twitter comments in 2017 and 2018. In one post, he asked people coming to the UK to ""stop dressing funny"". Enfield North Conservatives said Mr Savva had been suspended from the party after ""reports of offensive tweets"". The association said: ""We are currently investigating the matter and take reports such as these extremely seriously."" One tweet from Mr Savva's account, uncovered by national anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate, stated: ""How about the removal of all immigrants?""  The tweet continued: ""Wouldn't that be wonderful? Just think of all the homes that would suddenly become available? All those school places?"" A reply from Mr Savva's account to an article about TV chef Nadiya Hussain, revealing that she suffers Islamophobic abuse on social media, stated: ""As a westerner she shouldn't wear a headdress. If she integrated more, she wouldn't suffer any abuse."" A further post stated that Mr Savva believed ""those who are privileged enough to come and live here should live by our ways. And stop dressing funny"". Mr Savva previously stood for the Conservatives in Southbury ward, Enfield, in 2014. Gregory Davis, a researcher at Hope Not Hate, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service before the suspension was announced that the comments had made clear that Mr Savva was a ""wildly inappropriate candidate"". Mr David said Mr Savva ""cannot possibly represent the best interests of a diverse constituency"". Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission said Mr Savva would still appear as a Tory candidate on ballot papers during England's local elections on Thursday. ""The nomination process for the elections is now complete and the ballot papers have been printed so a candidate cannot be removed,"" a spokeswoman said.  However, the Conservatives were no longer required to consider Mr Savva as representing the party. ""It would be a matter for the party to make clear to electors that a candidate no longer represented the party if that was the case,"" she added. The controversy comes weeks after another party member in Enfield, Colin Davis, resigned from his position as chair of Enfield Southgate Conservative Association when a photo appearing to show him wear Nazi uniform in the 1980s was uncovered.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49234594,Tories 'will order Islamophobia inquiry',But the party chairman is criticised for saying it must settle on a definition of Islamophobia first.,5 Aug 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservative Party will order an independent inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia within its ranks, the chairman has confirmed. But James Cleverly was criticised for saying the party must agree a definition of Islamophobia first. Earlier this year, the Tories rejected a definition created by a cross-party group of MPs and backed by several other parties, including Labour. Tory peer Baroness Warsi accused her party of ""political hypocrisy"". She said Labour had used exactly the same argument around a definition when it was accused of failing to tackle anti-Semitism, and her Tory colleagues had ""rightly criticised"" them for that. ""And yet we are now adopting exactly the approach we condemned,"" the party's first female Muslim cabinet member tweeted. Since 2018, the Muslim Council of Britain has been calling for the Tories to launch an independent inquiry into alleged Islamophobia, and in May, the council formally asked the UK's human rights watchdog, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), to hold one. The MCB has listed a series of complaints against figures in the party, including Boris Johnson for comments he made about Muslim women before becoming prime minister.   Asked on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether there would be an independent inquiry into the issue, Mr Cleverly replied: ""Yes there will be."" Pressed on whether it would look specifically at Islamophobia or more broadly at all forms of prejudice, he continued: ""One of the things we need to get is the definition of that, so specifically on that point we will be guided by a formal definition of Islamophobia. ""But the point is we do, and will always, take firm action on anyone who steps outside the boundaries of appropriate behaviour."" During the Conservative leadership race, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid challenged the other candidates to commit to an external investigation and the others appeared to agree to it. Later though, Mr Johnson claimed he understood they had committed to an inquiry ""into all types of prejudice and discrimination including anti-Semitism"", not Islamophobia specifically. The EHRC is already investigating Labour over allegations of anti-Semitism. The MCB said the definition of Islamophobia must reflect the lived experiences of Muslims. ""An inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party has been long-awaited and will be welcomed if it is sufficiently independent and robust. Words must be followed by action."" The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims came up with its definition earlier this year and it was endorsed by Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Conservatives and several Muslim groups. It states: ""Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."" A government spokesman said the wording needed ""further careful consideration"" and had ""not been broadly accepted"". Concerns were raised, including by the chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, that the definition was too vague and could undermine efforts to tackle extremism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44410597,Austria to shut seven 'political' mosques,The government's crackdown mostly targets imams alleged to have Turkish nationalist links.,8 Jun 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Austria has said it will close down seven mosques and expel imams who it says are funded by foreign countries.  Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the move was a crackdown on political Islam. Some mosques are suspected of having links to Turkish nationalists. In April images emerged showing children in Turkish army uniforms re-enacting the World War One Battle of Gallipoli. The Turkish president's office called Austria's move ""Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory"". Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin took to Twitter to condemn the move. The Austrian government says 60 of the 260 imams in the country are being investigated, of whom 40 belong to ATIB, an Islamic organisation in Austria close to the Turkish government.  ""Parallel societies, political Islam and radicalisation tendencies have no place in our country,"" said Chancellor Kurz on Friday. The Gallipoli re-enactment performance took place in a Vienna mosque reported to be run by ATIB.  The WW1 battle, one of the last victories of the Ottoman Empire, stopped Allied forces reaching its capital, Constantinople. Austrian media report (in German) that the child actors played dead and were covered with Turkish flags.  Separately, Austrian public broadcaster ORF says photos of children doing the Turkish nationalist Grey Wolves greeting came from a mosque in Vienna's Favoriten district run by the Grey Wolves, a group with branches in several countries. The government is dissolving an organisation called the Arab Religious Community. Six of the mosques targeted for closure are run by it: three in Vienna, two in Upper Austria and one in Carinthia.  In neighbouring Germany, police have been probing links between certain imams and the Turkish state, which funds a Muslim organisation called Ditib. The Austrian authorities have been working with a Muslim community body called IGGÖ to identify mosques and imams suspected of radical Islamist or nationalist connections. They have soured significantly in recent years.  Mr Kurz's election campaign last year drew heavily on anxiety about immigration and the integration of Muslims. His conservative People's Party (ÖVP) formed a coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). Mr Kurz wants the EU to break off Turkey's EU membership negotiations - a stance that has angered Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In May 2017 that anger led Turkey to veto Nato's co-operation with Austria. The move disrupted Nato's partnership activities with 41 countries. Turkey is a key player in Nato operations. President Erdogan's ruling AK Party has roots in political Islam and espouses traditional Muslim values.  He is campaigning for re-election, and both Austria and Germany are wary of his political influence in their Turkish communities.  The governments in Austria and other Central European countries - Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland - want to restrict Muslim immigration to Europe. There is friction between them and Germany, which took in about one million mainly Muslim asylum seekers in 2015.  Turkey is housing more than three million Syrian refugees and says the EU is not doing enough to help."

Mr Erdogan said part of gun suspect Brenton Tarrant's manifesto was to keep Turks from Europe. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters told Turkish officials showing the video was ""unfair"" and endangered his country's citizens abroad. Friday's attack on two mosques in Christchurch left 50 people dead. The attacker live-streamed video of the killings and it was widely shared and downloaded as social media firms raced to take the footage down. In New Zealand the footage has been classified as an objectionable publication and it is an offence to distribute or possess it. Sunday's rallies were aimed at galvanising support among his conservative power base ahead of a local election at the end of this month. The prime motive was to condemn global Islamophobia - along with the West's response to it - and to criticise political opponents inside Turkey as weak. Mr Erdogan pointed to specific mentions of Turkey by the suspect in his manifesto. The president said the suspect had visited Turkey twice and wanted Turkish Muslims removed from Turkey's European territory on the western side of the Bosphorus. Mr Erdogan told a rally in Gaziantep: ""What does it say? That we shouldn't go west of the Bosporus, meaning Europe. Otherwise, he would come to Istanbul, kill us all, drive us out of our land."" Semi-blurred footage of part of the mosque attack was shown on screens at at least three rallies, along with extracts said to be from the online manifesto. Mr Erdogan also criticised the leader of Turkey's main opposition CHP party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, showing a clip of him talking about ""terrorism rooted in the Islamic world"". Mr Peters said he had made clear his opposition to Turkish officials who have travelled to New Zealand in the wake of the killings, including Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. Mr Peters said: ""Anything of that nature that misrepresents this country - given that [the suspect] was a non-New Zealand citizen - imperils the future and safety of the New Zealand people and our people abroad and it's totally unfair. ""We had a long dialogue on the need for any other country, or Turkey for that matter, to ensure that our country, New Zealand, was not misrepresented."" CHP spokesman Faik Oztrak, quoted by the Anadolu news agency, condemned Mr Erdogan for trying to make political capital out of the tragedy. ""Is it worth showing this bloody massacre in order to gain a few more votes?"" he asked. The attacks were live-streamed on the suspect's Facebook page and, despite the original being taken down, footage was quickly replicated and shared widely on other platforms, including YouTube and Twitter. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack around the world in the first 24 hours. But it also found its way on to the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. In the UK the Daily Mirror and MailOnline came under attack for publishing the footage and several Australian media outlets also broadcast it. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that Facebook and other social media giants had ""further questions"" to answer about how they responded to the event. ""Obviously these social media platforms have wide reach,"" she said. ""This is an issue that goes well beyond New Zealand."" An 18-year-old appeared in court in New Zealand on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream under a law experts said was commonly used to target the sharing of child pornography.  The teenager was also charged with publishing a photograph of the mosque with the message ""target acquired"" and faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each charge, according to the prosecution."

One worshipper knocked the axe from the man's hands, and held him down until police arrived, local media reports. A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene in the suburb of Mississauga, and he has since been charged. Some congregants had minor injures from the bear spray, the mosque's imam said. One of the worshippers said the experience was ""terrifying"" and described hearing a scream before turning around to see a man holding an axe and using bear spray - similar to pepper spray - against three people. ""By the time he was spraying, the people in the first row realized something was going on and one of the young men turned around and knocked away the axe before he had a chance to use it,"" Noorani Sairally told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. The young man then held the alleged assailant down until police arrived, the witness said. ""Before he could inflict harm on any worshippers, several congregants bravely were able to stop him in his tracks,"" imam Ibrahim Hindy said in a statement, describing the moment the attacker entered the site. ""Our community will never be broken and we refuse to be intimidated,"" he added. Police have named the man they arrested as Mohammad Moiz Omar, and charged him with six offences including assault with a weapon and administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm. Following initial uncertainty over a possible motive, investigators now say they believe the attack was a ""hate-motivated incident."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of a number of high-profile Canadian public figures to condemn the attack, which he described as ""incredibly disturbing"" and applauded the courage of the worshippers at the mosque. Canada's Muslim community has been targeted in a number of deadly attacks, including in 2017 when a shooting at a Quebec City mosque killed six people and left another eight wounded. And last year, four members of the same Muslim family were killed after a vehicle hit them in London, Ontario, which was described by police as a deliberate Islamophobic attack."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-44916002,Teenage boxing aims to deter extremists,Teenagers are encouraged to take up boxing in one attempt to deter extremist recruiters.,22 Jul 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Politicians and the police are backing a sports project aiming to stop young people being drawn into terrorism.  Knock Out Extremism was launched at the Peterborough Police Boxing Club and attracted teenagers and young people from across the region.  The hope is that by getting involved in a boxing club, some young people will be diverted away from radicalisation.  Boxing can give teenagers firm footing to deter extremist groups, DC Rich Ellison from Hertfordshire Police said. ""Vulnerable youngsters are looking for camaraderie and friendship that extremist groups will home onto. ""We are trying to give young people that friendship within the confines of a boxing club,"" he said. Lewis Richardson, 21, from Essex, who has just joined Team GB's boxing squad, said: ""Boxing can get people off the streets and often gives them a purpose in life."" Peterborough MP Fiona Onsanya said radicalisation was an ever-present problem. ""Islamophobia is a real thing everywhere and anyone can be radicalised irrespective of race or religion,"" she said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-64835061,Racism suspension lifted for Labour MP Rupa Huq,"The MP was suspended for calling then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng ""superficially black"".",3 Mar 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Rupa Huq has been reinstated as a Labour MP, five months after she lost the whip for comments she made about Kwasi Kwarteng. The Ealing Central and Acton MP described then-chancellor Mr Kwarteng as ""superficially black"", at a Labour Party fringe event in September. Labour suspended the whip, which meant she had to sit as an independent MP. Ms Huq, who said she fully accepted the sanction, has apologised and completed anti-racism training. She made the remarks during a Q&A session at a fringe event called What's Next for Labour's Agenda on Race? Ms Huq said: ""He's superficially, he's, a black man but again he's got more in common... he went to Eton, he went to a very expensive prep school, all the way through top schools in the country. ""If you hear him on the Today programme you wouldn't know he's black."" Mr Kwarteng, who had become chancellor earlier that month, was born in east London and has Ghanaian heritage. A recording of those comments was published by the Guido Fawkes website, causing a backlash. Then-Conservative Party chairman Jake Berry described Ms Huq's comments as ""racist"" and ""disgusting"". Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the remarks were ""unacceptable"", while the party's foreign affairs spokesman David Lammy described the comments as ""unfortunate"" adding: ""I wouldn't have made them myself."" Ms Huq then tweeted an apology, saying she had offered ""sincere and heartfelt apologies"" to Mr Kwarteng directly for her ""ill-judged"" comments. Rejoining the Labour benches on Friday, she said: ""During my suspension I have reflected on the offence caused by my remarks at last year's Labour Party Conference and I want to offer, once again, my sincere apologies to everyone affected. ""As I promised at the time, I have undertaken and completed anti-racism and bias training.  ""I want to make clear that I accept fully the conclusion of the party's inquiry and the sanction it has imposed."" Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61679347,Anti-terror strategy 'failing to engage Muslims',"The UK is failing to explain its counter-extremism programme to Muslim communities, an advisor says.",3 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The government's flagship counter-extremism Prevent strategy is failing to engage with Muslim communities, a government adviser has said. Dame Sara Khan said a ""vacuum"" of information about its purpose had been left by the government, which was then being filled by Islamists.  She added the government must address the concerns of Muslim communities. Dame Sara also said fears of racism accusations made some local authorities uncomfortable with tackling extremism. The controversial Prevent scheme was launched in 2007 and was designed to stop people becoming terrorists and to reduce the terror threat to the UK by stopping people from being drawn into terrorism. In the year to March 2020, just over 6,000 people were referred to the Prevent scheme in England and Wales, because of concerns they were at risk of radicalisation. However, it has long been criticised by some Muslim groups for what they see as an unfair focus on their communities.  Speaking on the BBC's Political Thinking podcast, Dame Sara said the government had failed to explain what the counter-terror strategy is to Muslim communities, which ""in essence... left a vacuum"" about the purpose of the scheme to be ""dominated"" by Islamists. ""So those types of challenges have continued and I think continuing to engage with communities, explaining what the programme is, addressing concerns - that's got to continue in a much better way than we've seen previously,"" she added. Dame Sara - a human rights campaigner who advises the government on social cohesion - has been a vocal supporter of Prevent, but has faced previous allegations of being too close to the Home Office.   This intervention, from an adviser admired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, comes as ministers are preparing to publish a review into how effective the strategy is.  Dame Sara, who now advises levelling up secretary Michael Gove on how local communities can counter extremism, also claimed that some groups have used accusations of Islamophobia as a cover for extremist practices.  She said she had seen examples of local councillors who felt unable to push back against the radicalisation of young Muslims.  Dame Sara is not the only Conservative critic of the scheme, with former justice secretary Robert Buckland arguing last year that it needs urgent work and a more ""joined up"" approach, following the killing of Sir David Amess. It later emerged that the man suspected of killing Sir David had been referred to Prevent in the past. You can listen to Political Thinking: The Sara Khan One on BBC Sounds"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-47830317,Week ahead in Parliament,A lot of the agenda is up for grabs after the Easter recess was cancelled - but Brexit will feature.,5 Apr 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Abandon certainty, all ye who enter... Next week's Parliamentary agenda exists - it's right there on the order papers for the Commons and Lords - but no one believes it provides any reliable guide to how events will unfold.  Brexit developments can be expected to reshape each day's agenda. Among the likely additions to the schedule are another round of ""indicative votes"" on alternative Brexit options, a report back from the emergency EU summit on Brexit, and votes on orders to trigger the European Parliamentary elections and to postpone Brexit Day again.  There might even be another attempt by the government to secure a ""Meaningful Vote"" on the prime minister's withdrawal agreement, perhaps with some added content to win over Labour MPs.  I'm not sure where these would be fitted into the schedule, but the leader of the House has left plenty of room for them, so she won't need a crowbar. And after a week which has seen nude protests, a tied Commons vote (not to mention a couple of near-ties), the constitutional innovation of MPs legislating to compel the government to change policy, a surreal filibuster in the Lords and then a flood which forced MPs out of the Commons, who is to say what might happen next?  In between times, there are bleak little jokes about ensuring MPs are supplied with copious quantities of used envelopes, so they can scribble new rules of procedure on the back of them as they go along. I'm told the Commons will be able to convene in their Chamber next week after the flood which struck on Thursday - officials are now confident they won't need to activate their contingency plans for an alternative.  And because this was original scheduled to be a recess week, there's not much action on the Committee Corridor, because the process of organising hearings with panels of witnesses can take quite a while.  So what follows is a brief canter through a rather thin-looking agenda, plus some speculation on the events which may be expected to disrupt it:   The Commons opens at 14.30 BST with Housing, Communities and Local Government Questions. As ever, expect a rash of ministerial statements and urgent questions to follow at 15:30, with the strong likelihood of a statement from the prime minister - or at least a UQ on her request to extend Britain's EU membership until the end of June.  MPs are then expected to consider two Brexit-related Statutory Instruments.  Then there will be a General Debate on UN International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.  But this could be interrupted to allow MPs to consider Lords amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 5) Bill - the measure proposed by Yvette Cooper, which would give the Commons some control over any proposed extension of UK membership of the EU.  The day after the Bill achieves Royal Assent, the prime minister will be required to put down a motion on the date of exit, which will be amendable by MPs.   In the Lords at 14:30, a scheduled debate on the residential construction sector has been cancelled in favour of continuing consideration of the Cooper Bill - aka the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 5) Bill.  Having disposed of the Second Reading on Thursday - after a long filibuster around the Business of the House Motion allowing the Bill to be considered - it has been agreed that peers will complete the Committee stage, Report stage and Third Reading by ""around 20:00"", allowing it to be sent back to the Commons so MPs can consider any amendments that have been made. First up in the Commons at 11.30 is Treasury Questions - which may see some open Brexiteer attacks on the Chancellor, Philip Hammond.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Conservative MP Bob Blackman - who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health - is the Tobacco Companies (Transparency) Bill, which will require the companies to disclose profits, taxes paid, and brand-specific sales and marketing data.  This would include data broken down to local authority level, by product type.  Mr Blackman says this information is already compiled and some of it is provided to HMRC, so his Bill would simply make existing information available to the public. MPs then vote on a series of Brexit SIs maintaining international sanctions against a series of countries - Burma, Venezuela, Iran and Guinea-Bissau to approve the (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.  And that is followed by a general debate on Housing. In Westminster Hall, Scottish Conservative John Lamont will lead a debate on the devolution of welfare at 9.30.  The Scotland Act 2016 devolved 11 DWP benefits totalling about £3bn to the Scottish Parliament.  Mr Lamont will focus on the Scottish Government plans to replace PIP, DLA, attendance allowance and carers allowance, which will not now be completed until 2024.  Other subjects for debate include regulation of the incineration of waste (at 11:00) and NHS funding for age-related macular degeneration (at 16:00).  On the Committee Corridor at 10:45, the special Joint Committee examining the Draft Domestic Abuse Bill will hear from a series of witnesses, including Councillor Simon Blackburn, chair of the Local Government Association's Safer, Stronger Communities Board, Hestia Housing and Support, and Donna Covey, the chief executive of AVA (Against Violence and Abuse). In the Lords at 14:30, peers will consider a series of Brexit related SIs.  MPs begin with 30 minutes of Northern Ireland questions at 11:30, followed by Prime Minister's Question Time at 12:00.  It may be that the PM is absent at the special EU summit on Brexit, in which case her stand in will be the de-facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Labour frontbencher Louise Haigh, is the Parental Rights (Rapists) and Family Courts Bill, designed to remove parental rights from men who father children through rape. The main debate is on the 50th Anniversary of the Continuous at Sea Deterrent - the UK's submarine-launched nuclear missiles.  Expect a key theme to be the issue of replacing the existing Trident submarines.  In Westminster Hall debates include:   On the Committee Corridor at 14:45, the Procedure Committee will ponders whether there should be a Commons Budget Committee, designed to provide better scrutiny of the overall way the government spends taxpayers' money. In the Lords at 15:00, peers will consider Commons amendments to the Offensive Weapons Bill and vote on a series of devolution-related statutory instruments. The Commons opens at 09:30 with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox - now an important player in Brexit issues.  That will be followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom.  If MPs are to sit on Friday to deal with urgent Brexit business, this is when the announcement may come.  Also possible is a report back from the prime minister on that EU summit, and talks about the postponement of Brexit Day.  The main scheduled business is a Backbench Debate on the definition of Islamophobia. In Westminster Hall at 13:30, Labour ex-minister David Hanson will lead a debate on preventing retail crime. In the Lords (11:00) there is another battery of SIs for peers to consider and they also debate the Draft National Policy Statement for Water Resources Infrastructure  And the agenda also contains an ominous little line: ""If necessary, the consideration of secondary legislation relating to exiting the EU"". This is the current default date for Britain to leave the EU.  At the moment, neither House is scheduled to sit. But Mrs Leadsom has warned that could change if there's a need to pass emergency legislation."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51567971,'Far-right extremist' behind Germany killings,Nine people are shot dead in two shisha bars in Hanau in a case being investigated as terrorism.,20 Feb 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A suspected far-right extremist has killed at least nine people in attacks on two shisha bars in a city in western Germany, officials say. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were many signs the attacker in Hanau had acted out of racism.  Federal prosecutors are treating the case as terrorism. Turkey says at least five of the dead were Turkish citizens. The 43-year-old suspect killed himself, police say. He was found dead at his home along with the body of his mother. Local media have identified the suspect as Tobias R, a German citizen. The Bild tabloid reports he had a firearms licence, and that ammunition and gun magazines were found in his car. Authorities are examining a video that appears to be from the suspect, posted online days before the attacks, in which he expresses right-wing conspiracy theories. German media say he also left a letter of confession. The attack comes amid growing concerns about far-right violence in Germany. Speaking in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said: ""Racism is a poison. Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.""  The shootings took place around 22:00 (21:00 GMT) on Wednesday, and the first target was the Midnight shisha bar in the city centre of Hanau. Witnesses reported hearing about a dozen gunshots. The suspect then travelled in a dark car to the Kesselstadt neighbourhood, some 2.5km (1.5 mile) away, and opened fire at the Arena Bar & Cafe. Shisha bars are places where people gather to smoke a pipe known as shisha or hookah. Traditionally found in Middle Eastern and Asian countries, they are also popular in many other parts of the world. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expected the German government to make ""necessary efforts to throw light on all aspects"" of the attack. The shootings sparked an hours-long manhunt through the night while officers, supported by helicopters, searched for what they thought could have been more than one attacker. Police identified the gunman through information from witnesses and surveillance cameras. Early on Thursday, they stormed the suspect's home, near the scene of the second shooting, and found him dead near his 72-year-old mother.  Can-Luca Frisenna, whose father and brother run one of the two bars attacked, told Reuters news agency: ""I heard my father was affected and my little brother... I saw them both - they were horrified and they were crying and everything. So everyone was shocked."" Hanau, in Hesse state, is a city of 100,000 residents about 25km east of Frankfurt.  Hesse Interior Minister Peter Beuth said authorities were also examining a website attributed to the suspect. ""What we know so far is that there is definitely a xenophobic motive. Whether there are claims of responsibility or documents, that's still being investigated,"" he said. The suspect was not known to the authorities, Mr Beuth added. In a brief statement, Mrs Merkel also vowed to do everything possible to clarify the background to the attack, saying: ""There are many indications at the moment that the perpetrator acted on right-wing extremist, racist motives, out of hatred towards people of other origins, religion or appearance."" Gun laws in Germany are among the most stringent in the world, and were tightened further in recent years after other mass shootings.  Nazi salutes, banned swastika emblems and even the playing of the Horst Wessel, the one-time Nazi 'anthem' - all have been cropping up in far right extremist circles as Germany struggles to contain a growing wave of home-grown extremism.  The problem has been particularly acute in - but not confined to - the east of the country, in the former East Germany. There, unemployment levels have been higher than in the rest of Germany and a simmering resentment by some of recent immigrant arrivals has manifested itself in arson attacks on hostels.  In 2015 Germany opened its borders to an estimated 1.5 million refugees from the Middle East. Although the number of subsequent incidents involving them has been very small, their arrival has been used by far right extremists to stoke ethnic tensions and recruit more young men and women to their cause. Hanau Mayor Claus Kaminsky said it had been the ""hardest day in our history"". He said the city had seen centuries of peaceful coexistence between different faiths and cultures - ""That is why it is so hard to understand"". Katja Leikert, who represents Hanau in the German parliament, the Bundestag, said: ""Hopefully the injured recover swiftly. It is a horrific scenario for us all."" Hesse state leader Volker Bouffier said the state parliament had travelled to Hanau to show its solidarity with the victims and their families. He said the attack ""came out of a climate"" that existed ""to some degree worldwide"" in which people are targeted because they are different. ""We will do everything to show that people don't have to be afraid and show them that they belong with us, "" he said. In other reaction: Were you in the area?

Lord Alf Dubs, a former child refugee, has called on the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey's governments to ""share"" the responsibility. More than 11,000 Syrian refugees have been accepted by the UK since 2014 but none have been accepted by the islands. The Home Office would ""welcome"" the assistance, Minister Baroness Williams said. However, the island governments have re-iterated their position of not accepting refugees as part of the UK's Vulnerable Persons Relocation scheme. They cite legal hurdles and also point to the ""life-saving humanitarian aid"" they have funded since the conflict in Syria began. Lord Dubs was the architect of a 2016 scheme which saw hundreds of unaccompanied children come and live in the UK, although it was later scrapped. On the islands taking refugees, he said: ""I have a sense that there is support in the Crown Dependencies, certainly in the Isle of Man there's quite a lot of support. ""It's a matter of sharing responsibility.  ""I think small as the territories are, Jersey and Guernsey are able, I think, to provide a bit of support.  ""They are quite wealthy, they have the resources, and I think in the spirit of international cooperation they could do a little bit to help take some of the refugees - either children or families,"" he added. On Monday 15 October, Lord Dubs was told the UK Government would ""welcome"" any offers from the dependencies to house refugees as part of UK schemes ""now or in the future""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60108377,PM orders inquiry into 'Muslimness' sacking claim,Tory MP Nusrat Ghani says she was told her faith was given as a reason for her sacking as a minister.,24 Jan 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a Cabinet Office inquiry into claims made by a Muslim MP who says her faith was given as a reason for her sacking as a minister in 2020. Nusrat Ghani said a government whip told her ""Muslimness was raised as an issue"". The Conservative MP welcomed the inquiry, saying all she wanted was for the matter to be taken seriously. Conservative Chief Whip Mark Spencer said the claims were completely false. He said Ms Ghani was referring to him and that he considered her allegations to be defamatory. Mr Johnson declined to say if the chief whip could stay in his job while the investigation was conducted.  He said: ""This is something I take extremely seriously. We must wait and see what the investigation produces."" The new Cabinet Office inquiry comes at the beginning of what could be a difficult week for the prime minister, with the expected completion of a report into gatherings on government premises that took place when coronavirus restrictions were in place. Senior civil servant Sue Gray has been asked to look at the nature and purpose of the gatherings, including who went to them ""with reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time"". Mr Johnson has faced calls from some of his MPs to resign over the matter, but others say they are withholding judgement until the findings of Ms Gray's report are published.  On Monday the PM's former aide, Dominic Cummings, said he had sent Ms Gray written evidence but would not be meeting her. Nus Ghani's allegations come at a time when there all these different fuses that have been lit. There are small flames travelling along the line towards Downing Street: whether it is this story, or whether it is the story about a small group of 2019 MPs who have their own claims that the whips have gone beyond what is normal - and MP William Wragg will be talking to the police about all of that. But the biggest threat to Boris Johnson is the Sue Gray report, which might emerge on Wednesday or Thursday. Despite lots of frenzied reporting nobody, other than Ms Gray and her team, knows exactly who she has been talking to, or the evidence being gathered.  The expectation is we will get a series of conclusions, but I would expect calls from the opposition and some Conservative MPs for the whole thing to be published.  Why does the report matter so much right now? It is not just because the public want to know what has been going on. Many MPs see the Sue Gray report as the crucial piece of evidence that will help them make up their mind about whether it is time to end the Johnson leadership. It is going to be a very, very significant week for Downing Street. Responding to news of the inquiry, Ms Ghani, a vice-president of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, said: ""As I said to the prime minister last night all I want is for this to be taken seriously and for him to investigate. ""I welcome his decision to do that now. The terms of reference of the inquiry must include all that was said in Downing Street and by the whip."" No 10 has said that when Ms Ghani first made the allegations, the prime minister recommended that she make a formal complaint to Conservative Campaign Headquarters, but she did not take up this offer. The prime minister's spokesman could not provide details of the terms of reference for the investigation but said officials should be able to ""investigate freely"".  Speaking on Sunday, Ms Ghani said when she had not used the Conservative Party's internal process because it was ""very clearly not appropriate for something that happened on government business"". Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it was ""important"" for the inquiry to go ahead, adding that Ms Ghani was a ""valued colleague"".  He told BBC Breakfast he hoped she would present evidence to the Cabinet Office, adding that it had taken ""a lot of bravery"" to make the allegations. Conservative peer Baroness Sayeeda Warsi - who has frequently spoken about Islamophobia in her party - said Ms Ghani should never have been asked to go through the party's complaint process.  ""This allegation relates to comments made in Downing Street, not Conservative headquarters; it relates to a job in government, not a job in the Conservative Party; the allegations were made by the chief whip, not by the chief executive or chairman of the party,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  ""This was not a party issue, this was a government issue."" Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to attend cabinet, said Ms Ghani's experience had been ""an open secret in Westminster"" and that she had ""struggled to be heard"" for nearly two years.  The former party chair said that she believed there was a ""pattern"" with Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, where ""Islamophobic racism is not viewed as seriously as other forms of racism"" and ""action is rarely taken until the media is involved"". She called for the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to intervene, arguing the government might have broken the law.  Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the prime minister's standards adviser Lord Geidt should investigate if the chief whip broke the ministerial code with his alleged comments. Ms Ghani was appointed to a post at the Department for Transport in 2018, becoming the first female Muslim minister to speak in the Commons. She lost that job in a mini-reshuffle of Mr Johnson's government in February 2020. Speaking to the Sunday Times, Ms Ghani said that when she asked for an explanation, a government whip had told her that ""Muslimness was raised as an issue"" during discussions about the reshuffle, and her status as a ""Muslim woman... was making colleagues uncomfortable"". The Wealden MP said she had dropped the matter after being told that if she ""persisted"" in asking about it she ""would be ostracised and her career and reputation would be destroyed"". After her allegations were published, Mr Spencer identified himself as the person Ms Ghani's claims were made about, saying he did not want other whips to be ""drawn into this matter"".  The Sherwood MP said he had previously provided evidence to the Singh investigation which he said had ""concluded there was no credible basis for the claims"" but he later added the phrase ""to be included in the report"". Prof Swaran Singh's 2021 report - which examined how the Conservative Party dealt with discrimination complaints - found that while ""not systemic"" there was ""evidence of discrimination"" in the Conservative Party, and it called for the complaints process to be overhauled. The report made 16 recommendations - eight of which the Conservative Party says are still to be implemented. The EHRC has said it is monitoring the progress made by the party."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63818164,New Malaysia PM's honeymoon will be brutally short,He finally got his dream job - but Anwar Ibrahim faces a divided country and a weak economy.,3 Dec 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The honeymoon - if there even is one - will be brutally short.  Anwar Ibrahim became Malaysia's 10th prime minister last week, after an epic career in which he had sought the job, and come close to getting it, over a quarter of a century. But whatever jubilation he might have felt must have been tempered by the daunting task now confronting him.  The 75-year-old is a skilled orator with extensive political experience and personal charisma, but he has, in the past, also shown lapses of judgement. He must now muster all his strengths to fix the economy, satisfy long-suppressed demand for reform, ease racial mistrust and keep an unwieldy coalition together. His reformist, multi-ethnic Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition won 82 parliamentary seats in last month's election - more than any other political bloc, but well short of the 112 needed to form a government. Malaysia had its first hung parliament.  It then took five days of intense haggling among the different blocs for King Abdullah to choose Mr Anwar to lead the government. This was only possible because his old nemesis, UMNO, the party whose 61-year monopoly on power had been challenged and eventually ended by Mr Anwar and his allies in 2018, agreed to partner with him. But it's an arrangement that leaves many in both UMNO and PH uneasy. Mr Anwar's first problem has been allocating cabinet posts. UMNO and its allies won only 30 seats in the election. But its price for cooperating with PH was to be given several cabinet posts.  The most controversial is the appointment of Ahmad Zahid, the powerful UMNO president, as one of the two deputy prime ministers. There was strong opposition to the appointment because Mr Zahid faces multiple criminal charges dating back to his time in the discredited administration of former prime minister Najib Razak, who is serving a 12-year prison sentence for corruption.  For its part UMNO has promised to support Mr Anwar in the confidence vote he plans to hold in parliament on 19 December, but said little about how this uncomfortable alliance will work. ""At the moment, the collection of parties backing the Anwar administration seems stable,"" says Tricia Yeoh, CEO of the independent Malaysian think tank IDEAS. ""However, it is a precarious situation where any major faux pas by Anwar could cause dissatisfaction among the UMNO rank-and-file, which may then escalate to the division chiefs, who are the influential power-brokers within the party."" UMNO's general assembly in December will be a test, she adds - rising dissatisfaction could lead to an internal party vote to withdraw support for Mr Anwar as PM. ""If Anwar survives till the end of December, events in the coming year may prove to be additional tests, such as UMNO's party election, expected within the first quarter of 2023, and passing the full 2023 budget,"" Ms Yeoh says.  Then there is the economy, still struggling to recover from the Covid pandemic. The first PH administration in 2018 was accused of neglecting bread-and-butter issues like jobs and food prices, instead pushing its political reform agenda. Mr Anwar, however, has already said that his top priority is helping the living standards of ordinary Malaysians.  The post of finance minister plays a critical role here, and Mr Anwar has decided to take that job himself rather than entrust it to anyone else.  Race, which remains a big factor in multi-ethnic Malaysia's politics, could perhaps pose the trickiest challenge for Mr Anwar. Ethnic Malays, who make up just over half the population, enjoy special protection under the constitution. Since the 1970s, successive governments have given them privileged access to jobs, business opportunities and education. UMNO's main policy since its founding in the 1940s has been to protect that status.  That mantle has now passed to Perikatan Nasional, an alliance comprising PAS, a conservative, Islamist party, and Bersatu, a Malay-based party of politicians who broke away from UMNO. PN, which won 73 seats, refused the king's request that it join a broad national unity government led by Mr Anwar.  For more than 20 years, Mr Anwar's own Keadilan party has tried to persuade Malays to back its vision of a reformist, multi-racial and multi-cultural Malaysia - but with limited success.  In this election it lost seats, dropping from 48 to 31. Mr Anwar's daughter Nurul Izzah, an MP since 2008, lost a seat the family has held for nearly 40 years to a rival from PAS. Keadilan is now a smaller component of PH than the mainly ethnic Chinese Democratic Action Party, which won 40 seats. This makes the new government vulnerable to the charge that it is dominated by ethnic Chinese interests, and all the more dependent on UMNO to show that Malay interests are sufficiently represented.  One of Mr Anwar's long-running goals has been to slim down Malaysia's bloated state-owned enterprises and reduce the risk of corruption. But doing that will open him to accusations that he is attacking the very sector which in the past has given Malays more opportunities. Leading politicians in Perikatan Nasional have a track record of fanning the flames of racial resentment. Bersatu leader and former PM Muhyiddin Yassin was caught on camera ahead of the polls claiming that PH was sponsoring a campaign by Jews and Christians to ""Christianise"" Malaysia. PAS leaders have accused PH of Islamophobia, of being backed by Israel, and suggested those who vote for them would go to hell. ""The primary danger to Anwar is a PN that chooses to be an opposition on the grounds of race and religion, and not on the grounds of policy,"" Ms Yeoh says.  ""That they have chosen to be the main defender of Malay and Muslim interests means they will likely attempt to destabilise Anwar's government precisely on those issues. If this continues, the rhetoric used by PN during the campaign period will not cease, but instead intensify, which will provide dangerous, fertile soil in which the seeds of further ethnic polarisation can grow."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-47645863,North 'faces far-right terror threat',"Right-wing extremism is not being taken seriously enough, a former counter terror expert warns.",23 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Far-right extremism poses the biggest security threat to northern England, a counter-terrorism expert has warned.  Speaking anonymously to BBC News, the former Home Office specialist said the threat of right-wing terrorism was not being taken seriously.  Last year, the highest number of right-wing referrals to counter-terrorism programme Prevent came from the north. The government said it recognised far-right extremism was an emerging threat.  However, the UK's security services said extreme Islamist-based terrorism remained the country's most pressing national security concern.  In the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, ""Simon"" - who worked as a counter-terrorism specialist for the Home Office - said the north of England faced a growing danger from far-right extremists and neo-Nazis.  ""We've got former mill towns and cities across the north where this ideology, that white people are supposedly superior to everyone else, is growing and becoming more entrenched. ""I've no doubt that there are far-right extremists across the north who are planning to use violence to target Muslim or Jewish communities. ""They'll harbour the ambition to copy what happened in Christchurch. He added: ""We've already seen in Yorkshire how this extreme ideology has been used to target members of Parliament.""  Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered in her West Yorkshire constituency in 2016 by Thomas Mair, who was described in court as a lonely Nazi sympathiser.  Prof Matthew Feldman, director of the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, said the threat of right-wing extremists carrying out an atrocity in the UK similar to the Christchurch shootings remained low. ""The biggest barrier to the far right, is the fact that in the UK we have extremely tight gun laws."" ""The far-right do represent a threat to some communities in our country, but more often than not, these are people who are alone online, radicalising themselves, so they don't have a direct support network that could help them to gain access to weapons.""   Statistics from the government's counter terrorism programme Prevent shows that regions in the north accounted for the highest number of initial referrals for right-wing extremism in 2017-18. The number of religious or racially motivated hate crimes in England and Wales, increased from 37,417 in 2013-14 to 79,587 in 2017-18, according to the Home Office. Labour MP Naz Shah said there was a definitive link between a rise in levels of hate crime and support for extreme far-right groups. ""We've seen across the country a rise in Islamaphobia and race hate crimes - this hatred is fuelling support of the far right,"" the Bradford West MP said. ""I've been talking about this problem for years, and it is a growing issue and one that I don't think the government is talking seriously enough.""  Addressing the House of Commons earlier this week, Security Minister Ben Wallace acknowledged far-right extremism was a growing problem.  He added that the UK's counter-terrorism strategy was designed to address all forms of terrorism, whatever ideology it was driven by, and funding would be directed ""wherever the threat emerges"". Det Ch Supt Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said his officers had brought a number of successful prosecutions against extreme right-wing suspects in recent years. ""We are committed to tackling all forms of toxic extremist ideology which has the potential to threaten public safety."""

Make-up vlogger Em Ford tells Newsbeat she ""fundamentally disagrees"" with his controversial video made in Japan's Aokigahara forest. ""It's disappointing to not see any of the good things championed,"" Em tells Newsbeat. Em is annoyed a 2017 campaign raising over £700,000 for Mexico earthquake victims got little media interest. She's part of YouTube's Creators For Change programme, which aims to inspire creators who share positive messages through their videos. Em talks about make-up with her million subscribers for My Pale Skin, but it's showing her struggle with acne that inspires her followers. ""You could look at my channel and say I just review foundations or talk about face masks,"" she says. ""When you have acne, that foundation is the one thing that can give you back the control that acne has stripped away from you and make you feel better about yourself."" (Warning: Third party videos may contain adverts) ""I will keep posting pictures of my face and I will keep encouraging other women to post pictures of their faces regardless of pigmentation, colour or whatever society issue is going on there, until it becomes normal,"" she adds. ""I should not be called 'brave' for posting a picture of my face without make-up."" Both Em and Humza Arshad, who has close to 400,000 subscribers on his Humza Productions channel, say that despite a lack of media coverage for some positive efforts by YouTubers, the impact is seen in the response to their posts. Humza posts mostly comedy videos but one of his most watched clips is a hard-hitting piece on Islamophobia in the UK. It has been watched more than a million times across the world. (Warning: Third party videos may contain adverts) ""It took me maybe 5 or 10 minutes to write but it came from the heart,"" Humza tells Newsbeat.  ""Because it was real it was authentic, I knew a lot of people would relate and react to it."" Humza has tried to put a message in all his YouTube videos since he started uploading comedy sketches about a wannabe gangster called Diary Of A Badman. ""I wanted to do videos that were funny and made people laugh but think at the same time,"" he says. ""I thought it was very important to leave a positive message and not just do pointless comedy."" Humza says YouTubers like him, Em and others working to promote positive messages can ""genuinely change a life,"" and believes even Logan Paul's controversial video prompted a positive discussion about suicide. And Em says that the success she has found on YouTube goes against modern stigma against young people and how they rely on technology and social media. ""There's this stigma that young people are just glued to their phones, YouTube or TV all day long,"" she says. ""When I was 24 I started a company through my phone.

Police found a stash of material on Pawel Golaszewski's computer, including weapon-making instructions and ""silent assassination"" techniques. A judge at the Old Bailey said the 34-year-old's views were ""Islamophobic and of an extreme right-wing nature"". Golaszewski, from Leeds, had previously been convicted of terror offences.  The court was told Golaszewski, of Wensleydale Mews, Armley, was arrested in February by Counter Terrorism Police. He claimed he had obtained the documents as research for work as a security guard and private investigator, and said he had an ambition to join the army. At his home police found a sheathed knife on the wall, two smoke grenades, a lock-knife and a torch with a concealed knife. In a video retrieved from his hard drive, the defendant described Mr Khan in racist terms and voiced ""anti-Muslim and anti-immigration"" views. Golaszewski had denied six counts of possessing terrorist documents but was found guilty on all charges.  Judge Rebecca Oulet QC said: ""Most of these texts contained viable recipes and clear instructions for workable explosive devices or IEDs. ""These were written for someone without expert knowledge.

Rizwan Ahmed, from Bristol Muslim Cultural Society (BMCS), is behind the initiative. He said the ""under-reporting of Islamophobic abuse"" made it difficult to gauge the scale of the problem.  The idea is part of a move by the Tackling Islamophobia Working Group (TIWG), set up to unite Muslim communities, police and other agencies. Rizwan Ahmed said he came up with the idea after the success of a graphic he designed a few years ago, which used important dates from the Islamic calendar to help people plan time off work.  He said it was ""so effective"" that some of his friends in Bristol were ""sent it from as far as Singapore."" He said Islamophobia was ""becoming a growing issue"" and people were not aware of what they could report, such as verbal abuse.  Hasina Khan, from Bristol, is working with TIWG  and said her experience of anti-Muslim hate crime ""still brings back traumatic emotions"".  Ms Khan said: ""My immediate reaction was not to contact the police and to be by myself, stay at home."" She added: ""The aim of this communication is to let Muslims know they do not have to suffer and they aren't alone. People may not be aware that what is happening to them is actually against the law."" She said ""youth in particular who may be more familiar with the hostile environment"" needed to ""realise they have the same rights as everyone else"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50562542,No place for anti-Semitism within Labour - Corbyn,"Jeremy Corbyn urges Jewish community to ""engage"" with him following the chief rabbi's outspoken criticism.",26 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Jeremy Corbyn has insisted there is no place for anti-Semitism within Labour and those guilty of anti-Jewish racism have been ""brought to book"". He urged the Jewish community to ""engage"" with him following outspoken criticism from the chief rabbi. Ephraim Mirvis had claimed ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in the party. Mr Corbyn said anti-Semitism was ""vile"" and ""rapid and effective"" action had been taken against offenders. At the launch of the party's ""race and faith manifesto"", he said anti-Semitism would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government. He said no community would be ""at risk because of its faith, identity, ethnicity or language"".  Mr Mirvis, the Orthodox chief rabbi of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, earlier warned that ""the overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety"" at the prospect of a Labour victory in 12 December's general election. The chief rabbi, who is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, the largest umbrella group of Jewish communities in the country, said Labour's claim it had investigated all cases of anti-Semitism in its ranks was a ""mendacious fiction"". In an article for the Times, he asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the election.  Asked if he regretted not doing enough to tackle the issue, Mr Corbyn said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Mr Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street.  ""Since I became leader, there are disciplinary procedures that didn't exist before. Where people have committed anti-Semitic acts they are brought to book and, if necessary, expelled from the party or suspended, or asked to be educated better about it. ""I want to live in a country where people respect each other's faiths and people feel secure to be Jewish, Muslim, Hindu or Christian. ""But be absolutely clear of this assurance from me: No community will be at risk because of its faith, identity, ethnicity or language. I have spent my life fighting racism. ""I ask those who think things have not been done correctly to talk to me about it but above all engage. I am very happy to engage."" Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.  The BBC's political editor said one of the Labour candidates present at the party's race and faith manifesto launch had herself been accused of making allegedly anti-Semitic comments.  A number of prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party after being the subject of anti-Semitic abuse on social media while others have accused Mr Corbyn of personally endorsing anti-Semitic tropes and imagery. Ms Ellman said the chief rabbi had been right to speak out and his remarks highlighted the ""gravity of the situation"" facing British Jews. ""It is unprecedented for a major political party - a potential party of government - to be perpetuating anti-Semitism,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One.  ""This is not just about Jewish people, it is about the whole of our society."" Any intervention like this from a significant religious leader would be damaging, but the timing is a nightmare - just two weeks from polling day and on the very day Labour launched its race and faith manifesto. And the language the chief rabbi used - it's all bad, bad, bad. Mr Corbyn didn't really take on the chief rabbi's comments. He talked about how anti-Semitism was vile and evil, how if he was PM he would want to ensure greater security and protection for synagogues and mosques. The nearest he actually got to directly addressing the chief rabbi's intervention was to say ""engage""- appealing to all religious groups to engage with him if they have concerns. I take it from that that Team Labour have decided there is not much they can say or do that is going to make any difference to how he is seen by many, many people in the Jewish community. Team Corbyn take the view that they have introduced new disciplinary procedures, fast-tracked them and, as a result, more people are getting turfed out of the party. Mr Corbyn has said again and again and again that he abhors anti-Semitism, and yet it doesn't really seem to have made any difference to his relationship with large sections of the Jewish community. They almost just had to take the hit, move on and hope this blows over and the election moves on to other issues. Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who had been due to lead an independent review into anti-Semitism before the equality watchdog intervened, urged the party to heed the chief rabbi's words.  ""We deserved an attack that strong,"" he told the BBC. ""We need to deal with anti-Semitism properly."" He added: ""I really hope that the chief rabbi's absolutely extraordinary, but justified, intervention will be listened to by my party."" Rabbi Jonathan Romain said he had written ""to my own community"" to say there was ""a serious problem with Corbyn-led Labour"" and that they should vote for whichever party ""is most likely to defeat a Labour candidate"". And historian Simon Sebag Montefiore said the ""overwhelming majority of the Jewish community"" felt anti-Semitism was ""rife and unchecked"" in the Labour Party. But the Labour peer Lord Dubs, the child refugee campaigner who fled Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in the 1930s, said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the tone of the chief rabbi's remarks.  He said he was reassured that Mr Corbyn - a longstanding campaigner for peace in the Middle East and the rights of the Palestinian people - was not personally an anti-Semite. He said where Labour had failed was in not acting ""a bit quicker"" in dealing with the issue. The Labour leader faced criticism from Jewish groups when he said in last week's general election ITV leader's debate that the party had ""investigated every single case"" raised by complainants. He did not address the chief rabbi's claim that 130 cases were outstanding.  Campaigning in Scotland, Conservative leader Boris Johnson said it was ""clearly a failure of leadership"" on Mr Corbyn's part that he ""has not been able to stamp out this virus in the Labour Party"".  But he faced criticism of his own party's record on racism, after the Muslim Council of Britain accused the Conservative Party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia. South-African born Mr Mirvis became chief rabbi in 2013. In a Facebook post in July, he congratulated Mr Johnson on his election as Conservative leader, describing the new prime minister as a ""long-standing friend and champion of the Jewish community"". According to the British Board of Deputies, there are between 260,000 and 300,000 Jews in England and Wales. Around half belong to the Central Orthodox denomination which includes the United Synagogue, led by the chief rabbi."

Yems, 63, was banned from football for 18 months after admitting one charge and being found guilty of 11 others of racist abuse towards his players. Four further charges were found to be unproven by an FA tribunal. A further charge against Yems relating to racial segregation was dropped. In publishing the written reasons for his ban, the FA disciplinary commission ""accepted that Mr Yems is not a conscious racist"". ""Nevertheless, Mr Yems' 'banter' undoubtedly came across to the victims and others as offensive, racist and Islamophobic,"" the report said. ""Mr Yems simply paid no regard to the distress which his misplaced jocularity was causing."" The FA said the case was ""extremely serious"" and ""involved racist bullying over a significant period of time"". It stressed that Yems' ""lack of remorse or insight"" and the ""repetitive nature of the misconduct"" were aggravating factors. However, the tribunal was told that Yems accepted his ban and was remorseful, adding that ""his attempts at jocularity had been thoughtless and misguided but not malevolent"". Yems, who had been in charge at Crawley since December 2019, was suspended by the club on 23 April 2022 and parted company with the League Two side 13 days later, two days after the FA announced it was investigating the allegations against him. He faced 16 charges at the tribunal, which was held in November, one of which he admitted but ""downplayed its gravity"". He contested the other 15, four of which were found to be unproven. A 17th charge of segregating the players at the club along racial lines was withdrawn by the FA before the hearing. The report said two of the players ""who had complained of racist language by Mr Yems, acknowledged that there had not been deliberate segregation along racial lines"" at Crawley. The evidence the tribunal heard included: How Yems used a racial slur to describe some of the club's black players and deliberately mis-pronounced a name to make it sound like a racially offensive term.  Yems used a racial stereotype to two black players who were playing darts. He then repeated a racial slur and ""made gestures as if using a blowpipe"". How one player feigned illness in order to avoid Yems' 'banter' about eating curry. A Muslim player became the subject of jokes about ""being a terrorist"". He was asked if he slept with a gun and if he carried a bomb in his bag. Yems used a racial stereotype to a black player of African origin by asking if he liked jerk chicken - a dish associated with the Caribbean. Another player returning from international duty was told he should not train with the squad. Yems commented on his colour ""then put his hand over his mouth saying he should not say that"". The report stated how, in his defence, Yems ""categorically denied that he was in any way racist"" and that he ""might be viewed as an 'old school' football manager who might be 'robust and industrial' in his use of language; indeed, he fairly acknowledged that he had been less concerned about speaking in a politically correct manner than he should have been"". In the report's summing up it stated that Yems ""is a man of jocular disposition. His aim is to encourage bonding among players by cracking jokes and joining in fun with them"". But it went on to say that ""he has no appreciation that much of the sort of language which might have been in common usage some 40 or 50 years ago has no place in modern society"". The report went on to state: ""There was a considerable weight of evidence to the effect that Mr Yems was in the habit of, in his perception, cracking jokes which were perceived as racist by those who were the butt of the jokes.  ""Probably, Mr Yems gave no thought at all to the effect of his language on those at whom the 'jokes' were aimed.  ""Nor did he give any thought at all to the likely reaction of others to the language he used."" BBC Sport League Two Crawley Town official site"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45602536,How the anti-Semitism row affected Labour’s support,"Accusations of anti-Semitism could have cost Labour in key areas, a study suggests.",28 Sep 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Accusations of anti-Semitism have led to widespread criticism of Labour in recent months. Some supporters have warned it could lose out at future elections unless the relationship is repaired.  At this week's party conference, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told delegates he wanted the party and the Jewish community to ""work together and draw a line"" under the anti-Semitism row. Indeed, relations have been strained for some time, with an inquiry into anti-Semitism in the party launched in 2016.  Last month Labour adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism, although critics said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermined the international definition.  Now, a study of results at the 2017 general election suggests some damage may already have been done before the row intensified this summer.  It appears Labour may have underperformed in the constituencies with the most Jewish people. Across the UK, there are five constituencies where, according to the 2011 Census (the most recent), more than 10% of the population identify as Jewish. Four of them are in or just outside north London - Finchley and Golders Green, Hendon, Hertsmere, and Hackney North and Stoke Newington, where the local MP is shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. The fifth is Bury South, just outside Manchester. In these seats, Labour's share of the vote at the 2017 general election increased by seven points when compared with the 2015 election. However, this was nearly three points below the 9.8 point overall increase the party saw across the country.  This underperformance appears to be greater still if we look at how constituencies voted in the 2016 EU referendum.  In most cases, the higher the Remain vote was, the better Labour did in the election that followed. Once we take this into account, Labour's share of the vote in the constituencies with the most Jewish voters appears to be about 4.5 points below what might have been expected. In two constituencies, Finchley and Golders Green, and Hendon, this is greater than the margin by which it was beaten. Of course, we cannot be certain that the party's apparent difficulties in these seats was the result of its failure to win the support of Jewish voters.  Labour might have had difficulties winning over the many other voters in these areas. Rival candidates may have fought a particularly good campaign. But it would be quite a coincidence if it had these problems in every seat with a large Jewish population. It is a problem that continued at local elections earlier this year, when the party failed to win Barnet (which incorporates Finchley and Golders Green), despite performing strongly elsewhere in the capital.  Its failure prompted a senior Labour politician to say he ""suspects"" the anti-Semitism row was to blame. Despite these problems, Labour has found greater success with a different group of voters. Jeremy Corbyn has long campaigned against Islamophobia and his staunch opposition to the Iraq War is well documented.  So, we might ask whether the Labour leader's record on such issues has enhanced support among Muslim voters. Certainly, the relationship was strained under Tony Blair, following his decision to join the US-led invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The party lost ground heavily in 2005 in constituencies with large Muslim communities.  Although much of that ground had been recovered by the 2015 general election, Labour did especially well in areas with large Muslim populations in 2017. There are 78 constituencies where more than 10% of people identify as Muslim, according to the 2011 Census. In these seats, Labour's vote increased by an average of 11.8 points - a couple of points better than its performance across the country as a whole. However, these were also seats where support for Remain was higher than in the UK overall - by about five points on average.  But even when we take this into account, Labour's vote increased in these areas by just under a point more than we would otherwise have expected. More like this The difference this will have made to Labour's election performance is limited by the reality that most constituencies with a relatively large Muslim population are already safe Labour seats.  Such a small advantage will have simply bolstered the party's already strong position locally.  At most, there are a couple of seats, Keighley and Kensington, where Labour won only very narrowly and where any additional support from Muslims in these areas could conceivably have been decisive. However, in neither case can we say that this is what happened.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48515506,Trump declines to meet 'negative' Corbyn,The US president reveals he turned down a meeting with the Labour leader during his state visit.,5 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Donald Trump has turned down a request from Jeremy Corbyn to meet during his state visit, calling Labour's leader ""somewhat of a negative force"". The US president said he had been approached by Mr Corbyn, who boycotted Monday's banquet held in his honour. Explaining his refusal, Mr Trump said: ""I really don't like critics as much as I respect people who get things done."" Earlier, Mr Corbyn said Mr Trump's policies on immigration, human rights, trade and climate change were divisive. Speaking at a protest rally in Westminster, the Labour leader said he was ""very disappointed"" by Mr Trump's latest attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan, whom the president called a ""stone cold loser"".  But he told protesters he was prepared to have ""a dialogue"" with anybody about building a more peaceful, just world.  The Labour leadership confirmed they had sought a meeting with Mr Trump during his three-day visit to the UK and said Mr Corbyn remained ""ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis"".   Meanwhile, Mr Trump spoke by phone to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - one of the favourites to succeed Theresa May - on Tuesday night and is due to meet rival candidate Michael Gove.  He also had a private meeting with the Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, one of the president's strongest political supporters in the UK.  Mr Farage said afterwards it had been a ""good meeting"". Asked about the snub to Mr Corbyn during a press conference with Theresa May, Mr Trump said he had ""never spoken"" to the leader of the opposition.  ""He wanted to meet with me and I told him no,"" he said.  ""I think that he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think people should look to do things correctly rather than criticise."" However, he later told Piers Morgan in an interview for Good Morning Britain that although it had been ""tough"" and ""probably inappropriate"" to meet Mr Corbyn on this occasion, he would have ""no problem"" with meeting him another time. While it is not mandatory for US presidents to meet opposition leaders and other non-government figures during state visits, it has been standard diplomatic practice. Barack Obama held talks with Ed Miliband in 2011 and also met David Cameron during his first visit to the UK as president in 2009. In his speech, the Labour leader did not mention Mr Trump by name but did refer to ""our visitors"", and said all governments had a duty to oppose racism and misogyny. Mr Corbyn told demonstrators he wanted to have a ""conversation"" with the US president despite their multiple disagreements.  ""I am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody. I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about that better, more peaceful world that we all want to live in."" He appealed to Mr Trump to ""chase down"" all forms of racism, including Islamophobia, and take a more compassionate approach to the plight of refugees from war, religious persecution and the effects of climate change.  ""Racism divides, exploitation of minorities divides, exploitation of minorities brings about hatred,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said he would oppose any post-Brexit trade deal with the US that allowed foreign companies ""in to take over the NHS"" - insisting he would defend a health service free at the point of use ""with every breath in his body"".  But after holding talks with Mrs May, Mr Trump said no area could be excluded from future trade discussions, including the NHS. ""When you are dealing with trade, everything is on the table, so the NHS and anything else.""  This prompted an immediate response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, one of the leading candidates to succeed Mrs May in Downing Street, as well as other candidates. And Dominic Raab, who is also standing, tweeted that the NHS ""is not for sale to any country and never would be"" if he became prime minister.  The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue was now likely to be a factor in the leadership race. On Sunday, the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, told the BBC ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. The SNP's Ian Blackford, who also addressed the anti-Trump demonstration, said Scotland must ""stand up for progressive values and against a damaging Tory-Trump trade deal"".  The Welsh government said devolution must be respected and there was ""absolutely no prospect"" of the NHS being included in any post-Brexit negotiations.  Mr Trump later told Good Morning Britain's Morgan that actually he did not see the NHS as being on the table. ""Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Analysis: By Hugh Pym, BBC Health editor There is nothing to stop American or any other foreign firms bidding for NHS contracts under current rules. The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender.  A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts.   Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK.   The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal Mr Trump would like to negotiate for the US. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation.  Asked about the Tory leadership hopefuls, the president said: ""I know Boris. I like him. I have liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job."" Referring to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, he continued: ""I know Jeremy, I think he would do a very good job."" On Mr Gove - to laughter from the audience - he added: ""I don't know Michael - would he do a good job Jeremy?""  Mr Trump said he had only seen one ""very small protest"" on Tuesday, in contrast to what he claimed were the ""thousands of people"" on the streets welcoming him and his family.  ""I heard there were protests so I said 'where are the protests?'... A lot of it is fake news, I hate to say."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-64625388,PM's ethics adviser takes on MP Islamophobia probe,"The inquiry into claims made by Nus Ghani was launched a year ago, but has yet to be completed.",15 Feb 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Rishi Sunak's ethics adviser has taken over an investigation into claims by a Tory MP that she was sacked as a minister for being Muslim. Nus Ghani said a party manager told her ""Muslimness was raised as an issue"". Labour has said it is ""disgraceful"" that an investigation into her allegations launched last January has yet to be completed. The probe was delayed following the resignation of then-PM Boris Johnson's ethics adviser Lord Geidt. He left in June and was not replaced until December when Mr Sunak appointed Laurie Magnus, who will now carry on the inquiry.  Labour party chair Anneliese Dodds has been pushing for the investigation to be completed, saying the delay ""tells you everything you need to know about the Conservatives' commitment to tackling Islamophobia"".    Asked about the inquiry, Head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission Marcial Boo said he would be following up on it with Sir Laurie. Ms Ghani first made her accusation in the Sunday Times in January 2022.  When appointed to a post at the Department for Transport in 2018, she became the first female Muslim minister to speak in the Commons. After losing that job in a mini-reshuffle of Boris Johnson's government in February 2020 she asked Conservative Party whips for an explanation. ""I was told that at the reshuffle meeting in Downing Street that 'Muslimness' was raised as an 'issue',"" she said. She added that she was told: ""My 'Muslim women minister' status was making colleagues uncomfortable and that there were concerns 'that I wasn't loyal to the party as I didn't do enough to defend the party against Islamophobia allegations'."" The Wealden MP told the paper she had dropped the matter after being told that if she ""persisted"" she ""would be ostracised and her career and reputation would be destroyed"". ""I raised it several more times through official party channels.... I was extremely careful to follow procedure, and when the procedure ran out of road I had no choice but to get on with my career."" In a later statement she said: ""Not a day has gone by without thinking about what I was told and wondering why I was in politics... those that have not had their identity and faith questioned cannot fully appreciate what it does to you."" Mark Spencer, who at the time was chief whip, identified himself as the person Ms Ghani was referring to, saying he did not want others in the whip's office to be ""drawn into this matter"". He added that the accusations were ""completely false and I consider them to be defamatory"". The Sherwood MP went on to say it was ""disappointing"" that at the time Ms Ghani had declined to refer the matter for a formal Conservative Party investigation. Following the accusation, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked the Cabinet Office to conduct an inquiry to ""establish the facts about what happened"".  Since then, Ms Ghani has been brought back into government as a business minister, while Mr Spencer has moved from the whip's office to the environment department.  A year on from the inquiry being launched, the BBC has been told that Sir Laurie was taking it over. EHRC chief executive Marcial Boo said he was in regular contact with the author of a 2021 report into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.  When Ms Ghani made her allegations, the EHRC said it would ""consider any findings"" from the government's inquiry, adding: ""If we are not satisfied with progress, we will not rule out the use of our legal powers."" The BBC has contacted Ms Ghani and Mr Spencer for a comment."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67684309,Pressure mounts on Harvard's president to step down,"But more than 500 faculty members urge Harvard to ""resist political pressures"" to force Dr Gay out.",11 Dec 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Harvard University President Claudine Gay is facing mounting pressure to resign over her congressional testimony on antisemitism on campus. Dr Gay, 53, was forced to apologise after she failed to say whether students calling for the genocide of Jewish people would be disciplined.  Hundreds of Harvard faculty rallied behind her over the weekend, urging the university not to fire her. Her fate may be decided at a meeting of the Harvard Corporation on Monday.  Dr Gay's comments, which were widely criticised, were made at a House of Representatives hearing last week alongside Elizabeth Magill and Sally Kornbluth, her counterparts from the University of Pennsylvania and MIT. During tense questioning from Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Dr Gay said she found calls for the genocide of Jews personally abhorrent but whether it would constitute a violation of Harvard's code of conduct regarding bullying and harassment depended on the context.  ""I am sorry,"" Dr Gay said in a subsequent interview with the Crimson, Harvard's campus newspaper. ""When words amplify distress and pain, I don't know how you could feel anything but regret.""  The 13-member Harvard Corporation - one of the institution's two governing bodies - is scheduled to meet later on Monday and will reportedly discuss Dr Gay's fate and the school's potential courses of action.  Over the weekend, more than 500 faculty members signed a petition calling on Harvard to ""resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard's commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay"". By mid-morning on Monday, the number of faculty members who signed the letter had risen to nearly 700.  Alison Frank Johnson, one of the petition's co-authors, told Reuters that staff ""don't want to lose her because of a political stunt"".  ""I get the impression that many people don't know how much support she has as a scholar, colleague, and administrator within the university, including from people who sometimes disagree with her,"" she said.  In July, Dr Gay became Harvard's first black president in its 368-year history.  More than 70 members of Congress have called for her resignation alongside Ms Magill's and Dr Kornbluth's, In a letter, the mostly Republican lawmakers referred to the college presidents' answers as ""abhorrent"" and standing ""in stark contrast to the principles we expect leaders of top academic institutions to uphold"".  ""It is hard to imagine any Jewish or Israeli student, faculty or staff feeling safe when presidents of your member institutions could not say that calls for the genocide of Jews would have clear consequences on your campus,"" the letter added.  On Saturday, President Magill announced that she had ""voluntarily tendered her resignation"". It came after a major university donor withdrew a $100m (£80m) grant in protest over her comments.  Following Ms Magill's announcement that she was stepping down, Ms Stefanik again took aim at Dr Gay and Dr Kornbluth.  ""One down, two to go,"" she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.  College campuses across the US have been the scene of frequent pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli protests, raising concerns about both Islamophobia and antisemitism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-31607165,Thousands stand with Mariam,"A row over an Australian vest has provoked the ire of American white supremacists, and a hashtag campaign as well.",25 Feb 2015,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The slogan on the vest reads 'If you don't love it, leave' Why are Australians rallying behind one Muslim lawyer? Because she has become the target of racist abuse online from far right groups and white supremacists around the world.  The story starts with a vest on sale at Woolworths. Last year, branches of the Australian retailer began selling a singlet, external carrying a controversial patriotic message. Underneath a picture of the Australian flag, the caption on the vest read ""If you don't love it, leave"".  The slogan could be read as a hostile message aimed at immigrant groups in the country, and that's how it was taken by Mariam Veiszadeh. She's a lawyer, and prominent advocate for the Muslim community in Australia. She tweeted a picture, external of the vest on sale in the shop, saying ""I'm outraged that #WOOLWORTHS are allegedly selling these bigoted singlets at their Cairns stores"". Her message of anger began to trend online, and the retailer quickly pulled the item in question.  But that wasn't the end of the story.  In the months since, Veiszadeh has been subjected to online hate from extremists around the world. It began when the Australian Defence League, a far right group, shared her comments with its 5,000 Facebook fans. One of them - a 22-year-old woman - tracked Veiszadeh down on Facebook where she posted a stream of racist abuse. The incident was reported to the police, and last week the woman was charged with harassment by police in Queensland. Then on Friday, a US-based white supremacist blog - with a significant following in Australia - stepped into the fray. The Daily Stormer published an article using abusive language about Veiszadeh, and containing a call to action. Here's an extract, edited to remove some offensive terms: ""Gentlemen, I think we all know what needs to be done here. Get out your Twitter accounts - make as many as you can... We need to be as hurtful as possible when abusing her, and we need to offend her Moslem sensibilities too."" Right on cue, trolls began tweeting Veiszadeh messages of abuse - and in response she called on her followers to report the offending accounts to Twitter. She herself was one of the first to use the hashtag #IStandWithMariam, external. Many of the accounts sending abusive messages now appear to have been been taken down. People in Australia have begun using the hashtag to post messages of goodwill. It has appeared more than 3,000 times in just over two days. ""#IStandWithMariam because her gender, religion and politics are irrelevant. #IStandWithMariam because she is a good &  decent Australian,"" wrote one, external, and ""#IStandWithMariam against racism, bigotry, discrimination & Islamophobia.

Electronic versions of the candlesticks, which are used to mark Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights, have been placed in public locations in the capital. One attack was reported in Islington Green, north London, and the second in Kensal Rise, north-west London. No arrests have been made in either case.  The menorah in Kensal Rise, which was reported damaged on Thursday, was outside Queen's Park recreational ground. The incident in Islington was also reported on Thursday, with inquiries under way and neighbourhood officers providing community reassurance, the Met said. Kaya Comer-Schwartz, leader of Islington Council, said she was ""utterly appalled"". She said: ""The festival of Hanukkah is a celebration of light and joy. ""This horrific antisemitic attack is completely unacceptable and doesn't reflect the Islington we know and love. ""Hate crime has no place in Islington and we will work with the Metropolitan Police to find the culprit of this attack.  ""Islington will not be cowed by hate crime and we will make sure replacement menorah lights are in place for the remainder of Hanukkah to make sure our community can continue to celebrate."" The force confirmed both menorahs were thought to be ""deliberately damaged"". The Met said it had reported a ""massive increase"" in antisemitic incidents in London since the Hamas attacks on Israel and resulting war. The force said it had also reported a rise in Islamophobic incidents. Hanukkah, or Chanukah, runs from 7 to 15 December this year. Events have been held across the capital, including in Golders Green and Trafalgar Square, to mark the festival.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67693315,Why US-Palestinian families are having 'the talk',American-Palestinian parents have been having difficult conversations with their children about racism.,17 Dec 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"After the shooting of three college students in New England and a string of other incidents, Palestinian Americans say they are worried about their safety.  When Samer Elbandak heard that three young Palestinian men were shot over American Thanksgiving weekend in Burlington, Vermont, he immediately feared for his 16-year-old daughter. His daughter, who lives in Florida, is vocal about the plight of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. On her Instagram page, the Palestinian flag is prominently displayed. Embracing her identity is something that Mr Elbandak, a Palestinian-American Christian who was born and raised in Bethlehem and who immigrated to San Francisco 30 years ago, had always encouraged. But a week after the shooting of Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad - three 20-year-old Palestinian-American students - Mr Elbandak said he decided to fly to Florida to have a difficult conversation with his daughter.  ""I explained to her that she needs to be very careful,"" he said. ""There are some people that are blind, that are full of hatred."" Palestinian parents in the US like Mr Elbandak say they are increasingly having their version of ""the talk"" - a conversation about encountering racism that has long been held in African-American and other minority households - after a recent string of incidents where people who are visibly Palestinian have been attacked. Police in Burlington said they are still investigating whether the 24 November shooting of the three men was a hate crime. The suspect, Jason Eaton, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges.  The victims of the attack maintain they were targeted because of their ethnicity.  They were speaking a mix of Arabic and English at the time of the attack, and two of them were wearing keffiyehs - a traditional, Palestinian black-and-white scarf that often serves as a symbol of Palestinian identity and solidarity.  Some say the incident has left them fearful that being visibly Palestinian in the US has become a risk since the Israel-Gaza war erupted on 7 October. Among those who felt this concern is Anne Bordonaro, a mother of two Palestinian college-aged men born and raised in Burlington. ""I looked at the picture of the three young men and I just felt a gut punch,"" Ms Bordonaro said. ""I said, those are my kids.""  She then called her two boys and had a ""painful conversation"", in which she suggested they avoid wearing their keffiyehs in public.  ""My younger son often wears one, it's just a symbol of identity, it is just part of who he is,"" Ms Bordonaro said, but she added she worried it made him a target.  At the time of the Burlington shootings, the Palestinian community in the US - a small diaspora of around 220,000 - was already reeling from the murder on 14 October of a six-year-old Illinois boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume.  Prosecutors have accused the suspect in Wadea's death of deliberately targeting the child and his mother for being Palestinian.  The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said it had received an ""unprecedented"" amount of reports of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias since 7 October, recording a total of 2,171 requests for help across the US as of December. The wife of a Harvard professor was caught on video harassing a student for wearing a keffiyeh, calling it a ""terrorist scarf"".  On 7 November, a man wearing a keffiyeh was allegedly assaulted while he was at a playground with his son in Brooklyn, New York.  In another incident 10 days later, it is alleged that a Yemeni-American Muslim woman was targeted on the New York subway by a man who called her a ""terrorist"", hit her and broke a Palestinian flag she was carrying.  Ayah Zaki, a civil rights attorney for Cair in New Jersey, said that Palestinian mothers have recently been coming to her for advice on how to speak with their children about the issue. ""There's a fear-saturated conversation happening in households between the children who want to speak up about their identity, and moms who are absolutely terrified of them being in harm's way,"" Ms Zaki said.  Ms Zaki said much of the racism Palestinians are facing is rooted in prejudices against Arabs and Muslims in the US that peaked after the attacks of 11 September 2001. She added the divisive political discourse in the US around the Israel-Gaza war is part of the problem. Abeer Ramadan-Shinnawi, an education consultant and mother based in Maryland, said that as a Palestinian born and raised in the US, she has often felt ""othered"" in American society - something that she said is also experienced by other minorities in the country.  ""There is no sense of acceptance,"" Ms Ramadan-Shinnawi said.  But amid the fear and frustration is also resilience. A few days after the Burlington shootings, two vigils were held back-to-back in the city to honour the three young Palestinian men who were shot. One was held across from the hospital in which they were recovering, where a few people arrived wearing keffiyehs.  And some like Ms Bornadaro have since been reflecting on the agonising conversations they have had with their children. ""I have decided to get myself a keffiyeh again,"" she told the BBC, a few weeks after the Burlington shooting had passed.  ""I used to wear one many years ago,"" she said, adding that she feels compelled to wear it again in solidarity."

The Most Reverend Justin Welby said ""this year, the skies of Bethlehem are full of fear rather than angels and glory"" during a service at Canterbury Cathedral. He also referred to conflict elsewhere including in Ukraine, saying ""around the world, we are beset with violence"". And he talked about the ""age-old sin"" of antisemitism in the UK.  He compared the turbulent background of Jesus' upbringing with the struggles of children in the region today. He said: ""Today a crying child is in a manger somewhere in the world, nobody willing or able to help his parents, or her parents, who so desperately need shelter.  ""Or perhaps lying in an incubator, in a hospital low on electricity, like the Anglican Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza, surrounded by suffering and death. ""Or maybe the newborn lies in a house that still bears the marks of the horrors of 7 October, with family members killed, and a mother who counted her life as lost."" On 7 October, the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which governs Gaza, led a massive attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 240 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a war against it in response, which has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Archbishop Welby also referred to antisemitism in the UK, saying: ""Or maybe they are not a newborn, but someone thinking of next term, having again to hide their Jewishness on their way to school in this country.   ""Or a playgroup in our own cities, fearful of the age-old sin, the atrocious sin, of antisemitism"".  The archbishop said ""serving, not in being served"" was the answer to resolving problems such as climate change, terrorism, economic inequality, antisemitism, Islamophobia and racism. God ""confronts our cruelty with his compassion"" and ""responds to our selfishness with service"", Archbishop Welby said. He referred to a visit to a US church which among other things took in guns from the streets, and said he himself was wearing a cross made out of a melted-down automatic rifle - ""transformed into a sign of hope and life"". He also paid tribute to King Charles III, whose coronation he led in May 2023. ""Two thousand years later, in our culture, it seems natural and right for a king in royal robes to answer a child, 'I come not to be served, but to serve' - and we know that that is the right way to be a king."" Peace was also a strong theme for the leader of Catholicism in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, who spoke about the ""terrible war ravaging parts of the Holy Land"" at Midnight Mass in Westminster Cathedral. ""The angels cry, they cry out for peace - and let our voices join with theirs in prayer for such peace; for a cessation of violence, for the relief of such suffering, and for the release of hostages,"" he said. Pope Francis has also appealed for peace against the ""futile logic of war"" during Christmas Eve mass. The Pope told worshippers at Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican: ""Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231221-steve-mcqueen-occupied-city-a-nazi-era-documentary-that-connects-the-past-to-the-present,A 'chilling' chronicle of Nazi-era Amsterdam,"In his new documentary Occupied City, the acclaimed director Steve McQueen brings Amsterdam's Nazi-era history out of the shadows – and connects the past with the present.",21 Dec 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In his new documentary Occupied City, the acclaimed director Steve McQueen brings Amsterdam's Nazi-era history out of the shadows – and connects the past with the present. Oscar-winning British filmmaker Steve McQueen's mammoth documentary Occupied City arrives in US cinemas on Christmas Day, presenting a chilling chronicle of the systematic and brutal efforts to remove the Jewish population from Amsterdam during World War Two. It is a bold undertaking, four hours and 22 minutes long, and quite different from McQueen's other celebrated features, including 2014 best picture winner 12 Years a Slave, for which he is probably best-known. More like this: -       Small Axe: 'The most exhilarating director working today' -       The artists who outwitted the Nazis -       Did a magician help vanquish the Nazis in WW2? McQueen tells the BBC his interest in the Nazi occupation comes from personal circumstances; he has a Dutch wife, historian and filmmaker Bianca Stigter, and for 25 years has been living in Amsterdam, where history feels ever-present. The Nazis invaded Amsterdam in May 1940, when the city's Jewish population was almost 80,000. By the time the war was over, it's estimated that around 80% of Amsterdam's Jews had been deported and slaughtered at concentration camps.  McQueen says he always felt there was something lurking in the shadows of the city that he wanted to uncover, which is what Occupied City attempts to do. ""I think sometimes the things that you're looking for are right under your nose,"" he tells the BBC. ""When I first started living in Amsterdam, I thought that I was living with ghosts, that there was another narrative going on other than my own. It was the evidence of things not seen."" Stigter provided that evidence, laying the groundwork for the film in a comprehensive book, Atlas of an Occupied City: Amsterdam 1940-1945, published in October 2019. ""The book documents street by street, house by house, and sometimes even floor by floor the extremes of what happened during the Second World War, it was written as a kind of travel guide to the past of Amsterdam,"" she tells the BBC. In the documentary, McQueen uses research from the book and visits 130 Amsterdam addresses once inhabited by Jews. ""In some ways, it is a sort of archaeological dig. We look at the locations which were occupied, where the food was delivered, [where] the people were hiding,"" he says. Viewers, party to this tragic tour, hear the names of Jewish city dwellers read out in a narration provided by actor Melanie Hyams, together with other personal details – and then we learn of their fate. More often than not, their final destination is a concentration camp, which Hyams names, uttering the word ""Auschwitz"" with a shocking finality. The cumulative effect of this constant cataloguing of Jewish lives destroyed is emotionally powerful. Watching the documentary has been described as an immersive experience because it can feel as if you're trapped inside 1940s Amsterdam as the Nazi menace roams the city streets. Hyams's narration adds to the impending doom as she describes the escalating restrictions on Jews as they're banned from parks, pools, shops, cafes and then from all public life. What is conveyed is a growing sense of dread that the extinction of Jewish life was not only imminent but also inevitable. In a bold move, McQueen illustrates his documentary with contemporary footage of life in the city shot during the Covid-19 era. We don't see archival pictures from the 1940s; we don't hear from survivors; there are no talking heads. McQueen is drawn to the dissonance of audiences hearing the text of the commentary detailing the past horrors of Nazi-era Amsterdam while seeing images of the Dutch city today. As Stigter explains: ""You get a double portrait and it is for the viewer to see the connections or not see the connections between the two."" As McQueen sees it, it is a narrative device designed to engage the mind. ""Sometimes the present erases the past, and sometimes it's kind of like knocking into each other, sometimes it merges. It could connect, it might not connect."" He is keen for his documentary to energise people, to instil in them a sense of responsibility for forestalling the kinds of horrors that defined the Nazi era. ""In some ways, [it's] a call to arms in being active in our everyday to change things,"" he explains. ""We have to be proactive, particularly in these times. I think the film is meant to stir the pot."" 'Resilience and triumph' Occupied City arrives in cinemas while Israel and Gaza face international pressure to broker a ceasefire, and amid numerous accounts of a rise in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. The director thinks these incidents and the recent election of Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders add resonance to his documentary. ""That may have made the film more vital, more urgent, if anything,"" he says. McQueen is mindful of the sensitivities regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict, and makes clear his film is not an account of Jewish life, or death, to the exclusion of any other group, nor are its lessons confined to the story of Amsterdam during World War Two. ""This is Jewish people as in us all – Jews, non-Jews – who are resilient. This is about resilience and triumph,"" he says. To that point, the documentary does end on a life-affirming note, perhaps illustrating the sustaining power of human connection in the face of adversity. ""Love is supreme. I think that's the biggest thing about this film, is a want and need to find love,"" says McQueen, who believes his film is a testament to human strength. ""We're so resilient as human beings, and no matter what's put in front of us, we sort of keep on going, and do we have a choice? Not really. Because we don't know what's around the corner. That's hopefully the triumph of the film: Let us not forget, let us not forget."" The documentary's long running time could intimidate those contemplating seeing it. But McQueen maintains that once audiences start watching, they forget about its length. ""Time doesn't really come up in the conversation,"" he says. McQueen's opus certainly has lengthy antecedents including the landmark 1985 nine-hour French Holocaust documentary Shoah from Claude Lanzmann, which relied on oral histories from survivors. But as Stitger points out, documentaries like Occupied City are having to develop new strategies to tell the story of the Holocaust. ""There is no other way, because the eyewitness will not be with us for much longer. So to keep this story in our presence, so to speak, you will have to look for other ways to bring it to the fore,"" she says. As for the film's critical response, Variety's chief critic Owen Gleiberman describes it as ""a trial to sit through"" and ""stultifying"". But Occupied City has won some significant endorsement, from Manohla Dargis of the New York Times, and garnered five stars from The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw. In their view, and among its admirers, Occupied City is monumental cinema from one of Britain's top directors: an artful and original excavation of the terrifying darkness that enveloped Amsterdam just over 80 years ago, brought into stark relief in the context of today. Occupied City is released in the US on 25 December.

Sanjay Bhandari, chair of Kick It Out (KIO) and has been appointed MBE for services to sport. The charity, which started in 1993, has been headed up by Mr Bhandari, of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, since 2019.  He said more supporters were ""calling out racism"", which he saw as progress.  ""I am humbled and honoured to receive an award like this,"" he said. ""It is a recognition of the team that I have a privilege to lead. This is just as much a recognition of that fantastic team, as it is of my small contribution to it."" Mr Bhandhari, 55, said he had seen a drop in racism at matches.  ""For the first 20 years of watching football, I heard racist chants every single match,"" he said. ""Now, I can't remember the last time I heard those particular chants. ""We think that there is less racism and discrimination inside grounds than 30 years ago. We feel KIO has made a positive impact on that. We feel more confident that people want to report incidents, and are less tolerant of discrimination.""  Mr Bhandari has has given evidence at DCMS select committees looking into the challenges of managing online hate. He has also led football's collective efforts to bring forward recommendations for the Online Safety Bill.  Earlier this week, two people were arrested over alleged racist chants at a match between King's Lynn Town and Boston United.  ""There are incidents of racism from crowds to players, like we have seen this week, but thankfully they are isolated incidents; one or two people, not whole crowds,"" he said. ""It's still not good enough. People are now calling it out, which didn't happen 30 years ago and there is consequences for those actions. That in of itself is progress."" Despite progress in tackling racism, Mr Bhandari said the group had seen a rise in other forms of discrimination in football.  ""We want to change the culture of the game, so it's more welcoming to under-represented communities, focussing on homophobic and misogynistic chanting, the rise of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism,"" he said. KIO recently secured a major sponsorship agreement with Sky Sports, guaranteeing it £3m over three years. ""I wanted to bring more partnership with commercial organisations that share our values and ambitions,"" said Mr Bhandari. ""We want to make football a game where everyone feels they belong. That's our mission.""  Mr Bhandari said he planned to take his mother - who turns 96 in several weeks - with him to the palace to receive his honour.

Philip Normal, who represents the Oval ward on the south London council, used a derogatory word for transsexual people, and among other comments, likened Muslim women to penguins. Mr Normal, a former mayor of Lambeth, said he was ""profoundly sorry"". A Lambeth Council spokesperson said the tweets were being investigated. Mr Normal, who describes himself as a ""trans ally"", said the tweets, dating back to 2011 and 2015, did not reflect his current views and values and ""reading them now, I am horrified and deeply disappointed in myself"". He added that he had referred himself to the Labour Party for investigation. ""These messages were written before I was active in the Labour Party. Since being elected as a local councillor, I have been a dedicated campaigner for equality and against homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, Islamophobia or any other form of discrimination. ""I hope my recent hard work on these issues goes some way to showing that my whole approach is very different today but I understand for trust to be rebuilt I must commit myself to a heartfelt process of learning and reflection to show myself worthy of representing such a diverse community and playing part in reducing hatred in society.  ""I can only conclude by saying sorry again and I promise to do better in the future,"" said Mr Normal, who is a fashion designer and has a shop in Brixton.  Mr Normal, who is HIV positive, recently raised £500,000 for the Terrence Higgins Trust by selling T-shirts inspired by the BBC television drama It's a Sin, which is based around a group of friends in London as the Aids crisis develops."

More than a third of MI5’s recent, priority investigations have involved links to overseas terrorist groups, the agency’s Director General Ken McCallum said in a speech in London, with ISIS in particular resuming “efforts to export terrorism.”                 And more than one in eight people being investigated by the service for involvement in terrorism are minors, McCallum said, a three-fold increase since 2021.                 McCallum’s speech comes amid a string of Western warnings about the increasing risk of state-sponsored sabotage by nations including Russia and Iran, and as wars in Ukraine and the Middle East rock global security.                 Overall, his agency has prevented 43 late-stage terror attack plots since March 2017 – with organizers often “in the final days of planning mass murder” – McCallum told reporters. About three-quarters of the agency’s work tackles Islamist extremism, while a quarter relates to far-right groups, he said.                 “We are powerfully alive to the risk that events in the Middle East directly trigger terrorist action in the UK,” he said. But while a rise in public disorder and hate crime has occurred, it hasn’t yet translated into terrorist activity, he said.                 ISIS, however, is once again firmly in the crosshairs of the agency. Five years since the fall of ISIS’ self-proclaimed caliphate across Iraq and Syria, the group has morphed into a terror network with cells spread around the world, including in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.                 “After a few years of being pinned well back, they’ve resumed efforts to export terrorism,” he said. And al Qaeda “has sought to capitalize on conflict in the Middle East, calling for violent action.”                 McCallum said on Tuesday that Russia’s GRU intelligence agency was pressing ahead with a “sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets,” conducting operations that included “arson, sabotage and more.”                 And he revealed that MI5 and British police had responded to 20 Iran-backed terror plots in Britain since the start of 2022.                 “MI5 has one hell of a job on its hands,” McCallum said. “The first 20 years of my career here were crammed full of terrorist threats. We now face those alongside state-backed assassination and sabotage plots, against the backdrop of a major European land war.”                 Speeches by the domestic intelligence chief are uncommon, and tend to be used as an opportunity to update Britain’s public on the nature of the terror threat faced by the country.     Related articleHow ISIS has Europe and the US in sights after deadly Moscow attack             The UK has joined allies including the US in loudly publicizing allegations of Russian sabotage since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Despite the expulsion of more than 750 Russian diplomats from Europe – “many of them spies” – McCallum said “we should expect to see continued acts of aggression here at home.”                 The GRU has long been accused by the West of orchestrating brazen and high-profile attacks, including cyberattacks, interference in US presidential elections and the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England.                 In February, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the American agency had disrupted a network of over 1,000 hacked internet routers that the GRU was using for cyber-espionage operations against the United States and its European allies.                 “If you take money from Iran, Russia or any other state to carry out illegal acts in the UK, you will bring the full weight of the national security apparatus down on you,” McCallum said on Tuesday. “It’s a choice you’ll regret.”                 He meanwhile highlighted a series of new trends his agency was responding to. Among the most striking was the rise in minors being investigated for terrorism offenses; far-right terrorism in particular ropes in young people, he said, “driven by propaganda that shows a canny understanding of online culture.”                 He listed three recent convictions of British teenagers to underline the diversity of threats faced. “One planned to attack a British synagogue. Another posted material that inspired deadly mass shootings in the US. A third drew up plans to stab people at a music festival and shared terrorist propaganda online,” McCallum said.

Inspector-General of Police Razarudin Husain said the raids were conducted after investigations into allegations of child abandonment, deviant teachings and sexual assault at the homes, run by the Global Ikhwan Services and Business Holdings.                 Some 201 boys and 201 girls, aged between 1 to 17 years, were rescued from 18 homes in central Selangor state and two in southern Negeri Sembilan state, he said. The 171 suspects — 66 men and 105 women — included religious teachers and caretakers, he said.                 Children were sexually abused not only by the caretakers but were also forced to do the same to each other at the facilities, Razarudin said in a televised news conference.                 “Those who were sick were not allowed to seek medical attention until their condition became critical,” he said. Some young children were also burnt with a hot spoon when they made mistakes, and caretakers had touched the children’s bodies as if to conduct medical checks, he said.                 Police believed that Global Ikhwan exploited the children and used religious sentiments to collect donations, he said.                 Investigations showed that the children at the welfare homes belonged to members of the Global Ikhwan group, placed by their parents at the homes since they were infants, he said. The children would undergo medical assessment amid ongoing investigations, he added.                 According to its website, Global Ikhwan was founded by Ashaari Mohamad, who headed the Islamic sect Al Arqam which was deemed heretical and banned by the government in 1994. It said the group had undergone a series of rebranding since Ashaari died in 2010.                 The group recently also came under the radar of Islamic authorities amid claims that it was still involved with the deviant teachings of the Al-Arqam sect.                 Global Ikhwan, in a statement Wednesday, denied allegations that it exploited children and said that it would cooperate with authorities. But it made no mention of allegations of sexual abuse against them.                 “The company will not compromise with any activity that goes against the law, particularly regarding the exploitation of children as workers,” the statement said.                 Global Ikhwan’s website said it is involved in a wide range of businesses including food and beverage, media, medical, travel and property. It employs more than 5,000 people and has branches in 20 countries including a chain of restaurants in London, Paris, Australia and Dubai among others.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

The global growth of Islam, and the rise of extremism across religions, also made this an urgent priority.","Sep 5, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Kathleen Magramo,International,"Since his papacy began in 2013, Pope Francis has signaled his intention to build bridges with other faiths. The global growth of Islam, and the rise of extremism across religions, also made this an urgent priority.                 On Thursday, in the biggest mosque in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, the pontiff used a joint statement with Indonesia’s Grand Imam Nasaruddin Umar to pinpoint “two serious crises” facing the world: dehumanization and climate change.                 “The global phenomenon of dehumanization is marked especially by widespread violence and conflict, frequently leading to an alarming number of victims,” said the statement, signed in the sprawling capital Jakarta.                 “It is particularly worrying that religion is often instrumentalized in this regard, causing suffering to many, especially women, children and the elderly,” it continued. “The role of religion, however, should include promoting and safeguarding the dignity of every human life.”                 On climate change, the declaration stated that “human exploitation of creation” had led to “various destructive consequences such as natural disasters, global warming and unpredictable weather patterns,” and an “obstacle to the harmonious coexistence of peoples.”                 Francis arrived at Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, in the morning, driving past streets lined with well-wishers in a metropolis that is one of the fastest sinking cities in the world. That concern has sparked a controversial and expensive plan to relocate Indonesia’s capital entirely.                 Indonesia, a vast archipelago in the tropics, is vulnerable to sea level rise driven by human-caused climate change, as well as hazards triggered by extreme weather, including floods and landslides.                 The mosque is next-door to the city’s Catholic cathedral, and the pope visited an underpass known as the “tunnel of friendship” which connects the places of worship.                 As part of the event, the pope also listened to Islamic prayers being recited by a young blind girl named Syakila, the winner of a national Quran recitation competition.                 His Indonesia trip and the signing of the declaration are in keeping with his bridge-building approach. But while about 87% of Indonesia’s 280 million people practice Islam, the visit also puts the spotlight on its 8.6 million Catholics and other minorities.                 His arrival in the archipelago nation “is good news for us, something that strengthens our faith,” said Father Hieronymus Sridanto Ariwobo, a Catholic priest in Jakarta.     Related articleThese women are about to play Glastonbury. That should be no surprise given their nation is mad about metal             “And secondly, the pope will come here as a symbol (of) the relationship between the Christian and Muslim here in the country.”                 Historically, the country’s form of Islam has been moderate and syncretic, often sitting comfortably alongside animist and other pre-Islamic practices, while the state ideology, known as “Pancasila,” encourages religious freedom and social justice.                 “Indonesia is a great country, a mosaic of cultures, ethnicities and religious traditions, a rich diversity, which is also reflected in the varied ecosystem,” Francis said during Thursday’s inter-faith meeting, which the pontiff spent in a wheelchair. “May no one succumb to the allure of fundamentalism and violence.”                 The 87-year-old is currently on the longest trip of his pontificate, despite facing health challenges and having started to use a wheelchair in recent years.                 He is scheduled to hold a mass at Jakarta’s National Stadium later Thursday, which is expected to be attended by about 80,000 people.                 The following day he leaves for Papua New Guinea, the second leg of a marathon 12-day visit of four countries in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, which also includes East Timor and Singapore.                 Indonesia is a symbolically strong choice for the kind of inter-faith approach Francis has embraced.                 In the 13th century, traders from Arabia, Gujarat and China reached what is now Indonesia, buying cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. Some of those spice-trade merchants also brought with them Islam and, as some settled on the islands of Java and Sumatra, the religion gradually blended with local animist beliefs.                 Christianity came to Indonesia with Portuguese traders more than 200 years later, mainly in the eastern islands of Maluku and Timor. The Jesuit missionary St. Francis Xavier worked in the Maluku islands, but by the late 1600s the Dutch East India Company had expelled all Catholic missionaries.                 After Japanese occupation during the Second World War, nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence in 1945. Muslims and Christians have coexisted in Indonesia for decades since its modern founding, and most of its Islamic believers are broadly moderate and syncretic.     At the start of his Asia-Pacific tour, Pope Francis says the Catholic church is going to step up its efforts to tackle religious extremism and violence across the world. Christopher Lamb explains the Pope's strategy.   Related videoPope Francis warns against religious extremism             But there have been occasional bouts of religious tension. In 2021, two suicide bombers attacked Sacred Heart Cathedral in Makassar on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island during a Palm Sunday Mass, injuring at least 14 people. In 2018, at least seven were killed in three church bombings in Indonesia on the same day.                 Religious minorities have at times faced attacks from vocal Islamist extremist groups and some parts of Indonesia are more conservative, such as the province of Aceh, which practices strict Islamic laws.                 “Indonesia [is] like a huge laboratory for experiencing a different kind of Islam, a different kind of democracy,” said Ulil Abshar Abdalla, a leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s biggest Islamic organization.                 Milawati, a Catholic who like many Indonesians goes by one name, said she hopes the pope’s visit will send a message to her compatriots to “live a life of mutual love, respect and tolerance between other religions” so that the country may progress.                 “⁠As Catholics, we view all religions as having the same goal, living a good and righteous life and believing in God the Creator,” she said.                 And Elia Dimas Indahputro, a 47-year-old sound engineer, said the significance of religion is sometimes overstated in parts of Indonesia, adding that mingling between people of different creeds is common.                 “Even my wife has a different religion, she is Muslim, while I am Catholic,” he told CNN.                 Francis’ Indonesia visit follows trips to other majority-Muslim nations such as Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, with the latter marking the first time a pope had travelled to the Arabian Peninsula. While in Abu Dhabi in 2019, he signed a historic declaration on inter-faith co-operation with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the leading Sunni Muslim leader.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

It’s only getting worse,"The widespread anti-immigrant riots in the United Kingdom of the past week, and the false viral claims that fueled them, may be the clearest, most direct example yet of the way unchecked misinformation on social media can produce violence ...","Aug 9, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Brian Fung,International,"Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index              Latest Market News              Hot Stocks              The widespread anti-immigrant riots in the United Kingdom of the past week, and the false viral claims that fueled them, may be the clearest, most direct example yet of the way unchecked misinformation on social media can produce violence and harm in the real world.                 Even after authorities identified a UK national as the suspect behind a series of deadly stabbings targeting children, false claims about the attacker’s name and origins continued to stoke anti-immigrant fervor and propel far-right demonstrations.                 The fake claims have circulated widely, particularly on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, extremism researchers said. And police have openly blamed that misinformation for the violence that has wracked the country in recent days, with rioters throwing bricks at mosques, setting cars on fire and chanting anti-Islamic slogans while clashing with officers in riot gear.                 The events of the past week are hardly the only example of the link between online misinformation and politically motivated violence: From the Rohingya genocide to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, false and misleading claims have consistently been at the center of high-profile incidences of political unrest and violence.                 It is a pattern that keeps repeating despite years of calls by governments and civil society groups for social media platforms to rein in inflammatory, hateful posts, as well as pledges by companies themselves to do more.     A recent retreat from content moderation by some major platforms, however, suggests that the problem of violence fueled by misinformation may well get worse before it gets better.                 For nearly a decade, governments and civil rights groups have increasingly argued that online platforms have created enormous societal costs.                 Critics of social media have repeatedly accused the industry of putting corporate profits before users’ mental health, or opening the door to foreign meddling, without doing enough to shield the world from those risks.                 An economist might call these negative externalities – like pollution, they are byproducts of a profit-seeking business that, left unaddressed, everyone else must either learn to live with or mitigate, usually at great collective expense. The consequences tend to play out over long timeframes and with large-scale, systemic effects.     Related articleElon Musk says ‘civil war is inevitable’ as UK rocked by far-right riots. He’s part of the problem             This week, it is hard to avoid wondering whether politically motivated violence based on nothing more than bad-faith, evidence-free speculation has become a permanent fixture among social media’s various externalities, and if we are being asked to make peace with it as a condition of living in a digitally connected world.                 Many social media companies have invested heavily in content moderation over the years. But the industry’s recent track record hints at a bet – or perhaps a hope – that just maybe, the public will tolerate a bit more pollution.                 There are some signs of pushback. In the European Union, officials are looking to hold social media companies accountable for spreading misinformation under the new Digital Services Act. In the UK, the Online Safety Act could take effect as soon as this year, requiring, among other things, social media platforms to remove illegal content.                 And even tougher rules may be on the way as a result of the riots. “We’re going to have to look more broadly at social media after this disorder,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a video distributed to media Friday.                 But punishments for online wrongdoing are already being handed out to individual perpetrators. On Friday, Jordan Parlour from Leeds, England, was sentenced to 20 months in jail after being convicted of publishing written material intended to stir racial hatred. The 28-year-old had posted the material on Facebook.                 The United States has lagged on platform regulation, partly due to congressional dysfunction and partly because of legal and constitutional differences that grant online platforms more freedom to manage their own websites.                 Still, lawmakers made some moves last month when the US Senate passed the Kids Online Safety Act, which aims to combat mental health harms for teens linked to social media.                 It may be tempting to dismiss social media’s role in the UK riots as merely a reflection of latent political trends or the result of activism that would have happened on other platforms anyway.                 But that distracts from the calculation that some platforms appear to have made: At least some of the time, some amount of misinformation-fueled violence is a reasonable cost for society to pay.

Imam Hussein bin Ali’s death in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD is believed to have cemented the split between Shiites – who consider him a rightful successor to the prophet – and Sunnis, the world’s most populous Islamic sect.                 Shiites comprise the majority of Muslims in Iran, Iraq and Azerbaijan, with sizable minority populations in a number of countries including Pakistan and India.                 Ashura, or “the 10th day,” falls on the 10th day of Muharram, the first month in the Islamic calendar. It is the holiest day for Shiites, many of whom make pilgrimages to a shrine in Karbala, Iraq, traditionally believed to be Hussein’s tomb.                 Some Shiites express mourning by beating themselves on the back with chains – intended to connect them with Hussein’s suffering and death as an aid to salvation on the Day of Judgement.                 Hussein’s martyrdom is widely interpreted by Shiites as a symbol of the struggle against injustice, tyranny, and oppression.                 Symbols of Shiite piety and repentance include red flags for Hussein’s blood and black garments for mourning.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The Sunni-Muslim Islamist group said in a statement late on Tuesday that three of its “suicide attackers” fired on worshippers at the mosque and exchanged gunfire with Omani security forces until morning, Reuters reported. The group also published what it said was a video of the attack on the Telegram  messaging app.                 The incident has shocked a country that avoided the sectarian violence that gripped some Middle Eastern states, including some of Oman’s oil-rich neighbors, after ISIS declared a state in Iraq and Syria a decade ago and sought to expand throughout the Arabian Peninsula. The group considers Shiites heretics.                 The Royal Oman Police said on Tuesday that nine people were killed in the shooting in the capital Muscat’s Wadi al-Kabir district, including the three perpetrators and a policeman. More than two dozen people of various nationalities were injured, including four Omani first responders, the police said. It didn’t identify a motive for the attack or reveal the identity of the attackers.                 The attack took place at the Imam Ali mosque, according to video obtained by Reuters and geolocated by CNN, during Ashura, the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram, which holds particular significance for Shiite Muslims.                 The oil-producing nation is one of the most stable in the Middle East and is becoming an emerging regional tourism destination as the government promotes the sector to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons.                 Unlike the rest of the Sunni-ruled Gulf states, Oman follows the Ibadi sect of Islam but has a sizable Sunni population and a small but influential Shiite minority. Religious and political leaders often emphasize sectarian harmony and religious tolerance as key to the country’s stability. About 57% of the country’s population of five million are expatriates, many of whom are Hindu or Christian.                 Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday that four Pakistanis were among the dead. Another 30 Pakistanis were injured and currently receiving treatment in hospital, the ministry added. It condemned the incident as a “dastardly terrorist attack.”                 “We are heartened that the government of Oman has neutralized the attackers,” the ministry said.                 Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X Tuesday that he had been “deeply saddened” by the incident.                 “My heart goes out to the families of the victims. I have instructed the Pakistan Embassy in Muscat to extend all possible assistance to the injured and visit the hospitals personally,” he wrote.                 One Indian citizen was killed and another injured, India’s embassy in Muscat announced in a post on X Tuesday.                 The US embassy in Muscat issued a security alert for US citizens, advising them to “remain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities.”                 It said visa appointments scheduled for Tuesday would be canceled as a safety precaution.                 Oman police said military and security procedures have concluded, and an investigation is ongoing.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Announcing the positions on Tuesday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East had caused “a great deal of grief” for Jewish and Islamic communities in Australia.                 “Australians overwhelmingly do not want conflict brought here. What they want here is harmony and for people to be able to get on with each other,” he said.                 The appointments come amid protests in Australia and dissent within the ranks of Albanese’s ruling Labor Party over a war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced more than 2 million people in Gaza.     Related articleDevelopments in Gaza ceasefire talks raise hopes but challenges persist. Here’s what to know             More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, when Israel launched a devastating response to an attack by Hamas militants that killed more than 1,100 Israelis and saw hundreds of others kidnapped to Gaza.                 The two sides remain locked in conflict amid deeply polarized protests around the world over how Israel is fighting the conflict in Gaza where millions of Palestinians are facing famine and Hamas continues to hold hostages.                 Albanese said Tuesday that Jewish lawyer Jillian Segal had been appointed to consult Jewish Australians, experts and the wider community about ways to best address antisemitism.                 “One of the things that I have found quite shocking is the lack of knowledge and experience about antisemitism and about where it leads,” Albanese said from the Jewish Museum in Sydney where he made the announcement.                 “I have spoken with members of the Jewish community here, in Melbourne, right around Australia, who have not felt safe, members of the Jewish community whose children are worried about wearing their school uniform in our capital cities. That’s not acceptable,” he said.                 The Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), which represents the Jewish community, recorded a spike in antisemitic incidents from October to November 2023. The group said Tuesday reports of antisemitic incidents in Australia are still running 400-500% higher than before the conflict.                 In some of the most high-profile incidents in Melbourne this year, windows were smashed on the office of a Jewish lawmaker and antisemitic slogans were written on a Jewish school.                 The Australian government supports a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East and has backed calls for a ceasefire, the safe passage of humanitarian aid, and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.                 Albanese said a “special envoy for Islamophobia” will be appointed “shortly” in a similar role to work with the Muslim community to promote social cohesion.                 Most countries recognize Palestinian statehood, and in May a United Nations resolution on Palestinian membership passed with the support of 143 nations, including Australia.                 In recent weeks the government’s own cohesion has been tested by the resignation of a West Australian senator, who crossed the floor to vote with a rival party on the issue of Palestinian statehood.     Related articleSlovenia becomes latest European country to recognize Palestinian state             “With a heavy heart but a clear conscience, I announce my resignation from the Australian Labor Party,” Sen. Fatima Payman announced last Thursday.                 Payman, Labor’s first Muslim senator, voted with the Greens Party on a motion to recognize Palestinian statehood and threatened to do it again, breaking party rules.                 She was indefinitely suspended from Labor’s parliamentary caucus and later resigned to serve as an independent, accusing her former colleagues of attempting to intimidate her – claims the party denied.                 Protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza are continuing in Australia with four people arrested for climbing onto the roof of Parliament House last week.                 University protests that saw hundreds of students pitch tents on campus grounds around Australia have since ended, with threats of expulsion for some students who took part.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The Texas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations identified the family as Muslim and Palestinian and called on state and federal law enforcement authorities to investigate the incident “as a hate crime and take all precautions to keep the Muslim family and the Muslim community safe,” the organization said in a news release Friday.             On May 19, Euless Police Department officers responded to a call at an apartment complex pool regarding a disturbance between two women. Witnesses told officers “a woman who was very intoxicated had tried to drown a child and argued with the child’s mother,” police said in a news release.                 The woman, identified as Elizabeth Wolf, 42, was approached by officers as she tried to leave and placed under arrest for public intoxication.                 The victim’s mother told police Wolf was questioning where she was from and if the two children playing at the pool were hers, the release said. The mother was visibly Muslim and wore a hijab, or Islamic headscarf, and modest swimwear, according to the council.     Related articleCAIR says it received more than 8,000 complaints of anti-Muslim bias in 2023 – a 56% increase over previous year             Wolf also made statements about the mother not being an American and made other racist statements, according to police.                 “When the mother answered her, she stated that Wolf tried to grab her 6-year-old son but he pulled away from her grasp, which caused a scratch on his finger. The mother began helping her son when Wolf grabbed her 3-year-old daughter and forced her underwater,” the news release said.                 The mother was able to pull her daughter from the water but she “had been yelling for help and was coughing up water.”                 Both children were medically cleared by the Euless Medics, according to the release.                 “We are American citizens, originally from Palestine, and I don’t know where to go to feel safe with my kids,” the council quoted the mother, identified only as Mrs. H, as saying. “My country is facing a war, and we are facing that hate here. My daughter is traumatized; whenever I open the apartment door, she runs away and hides, telling me she is afraid the lady will come and immerse her head in the water again.”                 The Euless Police Department confirmed to CNN that Wolf posted bail out of Tarrant County Jail.                 “The bond for the Attempted Capital Murder charge was $25,000. The bond for the Injury to a Child charge was $15,000,” Capt. Brenda Alvarado told CNN.                 CNN has reached out to Wolf’s attorney for comment.                 “We ask for a hate-crime probe, a higher bail bond, and an open conversation with officials to address this alarming increase in Islamophobia, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian sentiment,” Shaimaa Zayan, the council’s Austin operations manager, said in a statement.

But Salem never made it back to Egypt. He was among the more than 1,300 pilgrims who died during this year’s Hajj as temperatures in Saudi Arabia reached record levels.     Related article‘We are happy he’s buried in Mecca,’ says daughter of man who died in Hajj heat wave             Saudi authorities said that the vast majority of those who died were not authorized to conduct the rituals.                 The tragedy, resulting in one of the highest Hajj death tolls in years, has brought attention to the shadowy industry of unauthorized pilgrimage agents. These agents profit from Muslims’ desire to fulfill their religious obligations by sidestepping official procedures, leading pilgrims on potentially hazardous journeys.                 Saudi authorities said many of those who died “walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort” as the temperature reached a record 125 degrees Fahrenheit (51.7 degrees Celsius).                 For Salem, the process to get to Mecca involved obtaining a personal visit visa to Saudi Arabia instead of a special Hajj visa that would authorize him to access the holy cities and pilgrim facilities, including air-conditioned venues and medical services. A visit visa however bars entry into Mecca, so its holders are forced to take a desert path to access the holy city, often on foot.                 Salem, who was traveling with his wife, had been promised by a representative of the Egyptian travel agency that a bus would be provided to transport the group. However, there was no transport for them to and from Mount Arafat, his son Mahmoud said, so the two had to walk towards Mina, around 8 miles away, to complete the “stoning the devil” ritual.                 On the way, Salem’s wife became exhausted and sat down to rest. Determined to complete the rituals, her husband continued walking. He promised his wife he would return, said Mahmoud.                 But contact with Salem was subsequently lost. His wife searched for him for five days until she found his name on the list of deceased at Al-Ma’aisam Hospital in Mecca.                 “Our mother informed us of the news via a voice message on WhatsApp. The news was a tragedy for us,” Mahmoud said. “Our mother is there, devastated, and no one is there to comfort her.”                 Each year, Saudi authorities issue licenses permitting legal access to Mecca for pilgrims. These licenses provide access to air-conditioned transportation and accommodation facilities for worshipers. However, the number of licenses is limited – 1.8 million this year –  and they can cost several thousand dollars.                 Every country is allocated a number of licenses that is proportional to its Muslim population. This process excludes those who cannot afford the license or are not included in the allocation.                 Hajj is a once-in-a-lifetime religious obligation for every able-bodied Muslim. Many Muslims wait their entire lives to make the journey, often delaying the pilgrimage into their old age until they have saved enough money and fulfilled their family obligations. However, millions are left disappointed when they cannot secure a spot through official channels.                 Each country traditionally gets one Hajj license for every 1,000 Muslims – that’s a 0.1% rate. But according to Egyptian officials cited in state media, Egypt, a Muslim-majority country of 110 million, was allocated 50,000 Hajj licenses this year, a rate of approximately 0.05%.                 This has given rise to a lucrative industry of travel agencies that promise to get pilgrims to Saudi Arabia unofficially, often with assurances of transport and accommodation that may not be fulfilled or are below standard. Coupled with the extreme heat this year, this spelled tragedy for many pilgrims.                 While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year’s gathering was held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom.                 Atef Aglan, a member of the Egyptian Travel Agents Association, says there is a lack of awareness about the procedures of the Hajj among many Egyptians, which allows inexperienced tour operators and some mosque imams to exploit the poor, promising a cheaper Hajj without the appropriate visa or accommodation and transport.                 He proposes criminalizing the phenomenon because “it has become a profession for those with no profession.”                 “This is premeditated murder because this broker knows that the temperatures are above 50 degrees (Celsius), and he knows that these people do not have decent accommodation,” Aglan said.                 A Hajj package from a licensed agency costs pilgrims approximately $4,760, while unauthorized trips cost around $3,700, Aglan says.                 The average annual household income in Egypt is $1,429 as of 2019, according to the latest figures.                 The tragedy has also underscored Saudi authorities’ inability to curb unauthorized pilgrimages or provide adequate care for those who undertake such journeys, which have been taking place for years.                 It is unclear how many unauthorized pilgrims made it to this year’s Hajj, but Saudi news outlet Al Sharq Al Awsat reported Tuesday that 141,000 such pilgrims received free medical treatment during the Hajj season. That amounts to approximately 8% of the 1.8 million pilgrims this year.                 In recent decades, the sheer size of Hajj crowds has been a factor in the number of deadly incidents during the pilgrimage, including a stampede that killed more than 700 people in 2015.     Related articleThe Hajj is back and Saudi Arabia is hoping to cash in             Recognizing the economic potential of religious tourism, Saudi Arabia plans to increase Hajj pilgrim numbers to 5 million by 2030 from just under 2 million now.                 But some pilgrims have lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of the Hajj. Even those on official tours can spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in searing heat.                 Hania Hassan Salama, 65, a homemaker from Egypt, asked her children to draw a mural of the Kaaba on the wall of their house, a tradition in Egypt to announce a pilgrimage. The day the mural was completed, the children lost contact with her. The family was later informed that she had died, her relatives told CNN. Salama had purchased a Hajj package from a licensed tour operator.                 Her nephew Mustafa Mohammed said responsibility for the large number of deaths partly lies with Saudi authorities.                 “This year there was negligence, medical negligence. People were dying in the street and no one was helping them,” he told CNN. “Even if some people went on a visa not designated for Hajj, they do not deserve to be left to die in the street without finding medical help.”                 Two other pilgrims who recently returned from Hajj told CNN there were insufficient medics or basic facilities to protect worshipers from the effects of the sweltering heat in Saudi Arabia last week. Even those pilgrims who made the journey through official channels said authorities failed to provide enough water, shade or medical support to worshipers.                 Some witnesses have told CNN of how they saw worshipers losing consciousness and walked past bodies covered in white cloth.                 A 44-year-old Indonesian man who only wished to be referred to as Ahmad, recalled seeing many dying from the heat.                 “Along the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom (white fabric) cloth.”                 CNN has reached out to Saudi authorities regarding the reportedly inadequate response to this year’s heat and has yet to hear back.                 Before this year’s Hajj season started, Saudi authorities warned pilgrims against using agents selling unauthorized Hajj packages and had been in contact with other governments in an effort to crack down on the trend. Authorities had also arrested some illegal agents and issued warnings about penalties for those found to assist unauthorized pilgrims.                 Ahead of the pilgrimage this month, Director of Public Security and Head of the Hajj Security Committee, Lieutenant General Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Bassami, laid out efforts to crack down on unauthorized pilgrims in a televised address, saying “the security of the pilgrims is a red line.” Regional papers subsequently said that more than 300,000 people had been barred from performing the rites as a result.                 Since the tragedy, Egyptian authorities appear to be clamping down on unauthorized agencies. The government has ordered the revocation of the licenses of 16 Hajj tourism companies involved in making unauthorized pilgrimages to Mecca and has referred their managers to the public prosecutor.                 Salem, the 81-year-old Egyptian who died during the Hajj, was buried in the Al-Baqi cemetery in Medina, Saudi Arabia according to an Islamic tradition that a pilgrim is buried in the holy land if he dies during the pilgrimage. His wife plans to return to Cairo Friday after completing the rituals.                 Until she returns, Mahmoud said the family “is trying to contact her to calm and comfort her, and to urge her to take care of herself because she is there alone.”       CNN’s Abbas Al Lawati and Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Officials are now searching for evidence that Houthi weapons have been delivered to Somalia, and are trying to work out whether Iran, which provides some military and financial support to the Houthis, is involved in the agreement.                 The US has been warning countries in the region about this possible cooperation in recent weeks, according to a senior administration official, and African countries have also begun to proactively bring it up with the US to raise their concerns and get more information.                 “This is a pretty active area of conversation that we’re having with countries on both sides of the Red Sea,” this person said. “And it’s being viewed with a considerable seriousness.”                 It’s not a natural alliance for the two groups, which are divided by sectarianismand are not known to have had a relationship in the past. The Houthis are Zaydi Shiites, and al-Shabaab traditionally has been deeply ideologically opposed to Shiism. But they are separated by only a single body of water — the strategically significant Gulf of Aden — and they both count the United States as a top enemy.                 The intelligence raises the alarming possibility that a marriage of convenience could make things worse both in Somalia and in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, where the Houthis have launched regular attacks on commercial shipping and US military assets since the war in Gaza began.                 A potential deal could offer a new stream of financing for the Houthis, at a time when US officials say there are signs that the group’s primary patron, Iran, has some concerns about the group’s attack strategy. “Being able to sell some weapons would bring them much needed income,” the senior administration official said.                 For al-Shabaab, it could provide access to a new source of weapons — including potentially drones — that are far more sophisticated than their current arsenal and could offer the group the ability to strike US targets.                 There has been some routine smuggling of both small arms and commercial material between different groups in Yemen and Somalia for years. But a weapons agreement between al-Shabaab and the Houthis would be something new, according to US officials.                 “It would be the clearest sign that two organizations that are, ideologically, diametrically opposed to one another — that they prioritized something they have in common, which is hostility towards [the United States],” said Christopher Anzalone, a professor at the Marine Corps University’s Middle East Studies department. “It would be very significant because it shows there is a level of pragmatism in both organizations.”                 Any form of military cooperation between the Houthis and al-Shabaab could also undermine an informal, and fragile, ceasefire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia that has held since 2022, the senior administration official said. And it would “definitely” go against the spirit of a proposed UN roadmap for a more lasting peace, the official said.                 “We still have a strong interest in supporting the roadmap process in Yemen,” the official added, “but this sort of trafficking between the Houthis” and al-Shabaab “would certainly complicate and undermine that effort.”                 Officials say at this point, they aren’t sure what kinds of weapons the Houthis might provide to al-Shabaab. Right now, the Somali group generally only has access to rockets, mortars and homemade IEDs that it has used in its fight against the Somali government — deadly, but relatively smaller arms. The Houthis, by comparison, have weaponized drones, including underwater drones. They also have short-range ballistic missiles. There is a sense that the deal would cover “bigger kit” than just rockets and mortars, said one US official, but beyond that, the intelligence is murky.                 No matter what the Houthis provide, there’s likely limited opportunity for al-Shabaab to fire directly at US assets in the region. Even if the Houthis were to provide them with some of the smaller missiles the group has used to target US MQ-9 drones, Anzalone said, al-Shabaab would likely have to fire them from the north of the country. Pockets of that region of the country are controlled by an increasingly powerful branch of ISIS. Al-Shabaab is often fighting to contest territory there, and as a result, has a much more limited presence and freedom to maneuver.                 “They would love to do that,” Anzalone said, referring to striking directly at US assets. Al-Shabaab views the internationally recognized government of Somalia as a puppet of the United States. But, he said, “I think they would find it hard to do. This is where the intra-jihadist fighting between Shabaab and ISIS is the heaviest.”                 The US has about 480 US troops in Somalia, according to a US official. The US has continued to carry out counterterrorism strikes against both al-Shabaab and ISIS targets in Somalia throughout the Biden administration.                 One major question for US intelligence officials is the degree of involvement Iran might have in the arrangement. There is no direct evidence yet, officials said, but the US is still looking. It fits the pattern of broader Iranian efforts to widen the front against the US and the west by directly or indirectly providing arms to proxy groups.                 “That’s something we definitely have our eyes on,” the senior administration official said.                 But the Houthis are also one of the most independent-minded of the different Iran-aligned groups and are the one over which Tehran exercises arguably the least amount of control. Iran broadly has sought to tightly manage any potential escalation arising from the war in Gaza, calibrating its response to extract costs from the US and Israel without allowing it to spiral into direct conflict.                 And so some US officials are skeptical Iran is involved.                 “Don’t think Iran is actually part of this,” said one military official. “Houthis be a’ Houthi-ing on their own.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Read more CNN Opinion.             It has not been easy being a Muslim in Narendra Modi’s India. With the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) steadfastly refusing to allow my community even a token representation in corridors of power, India’s largest minority, the third largest Muslim population in the world, is left voiceless.                 For the first time since India’s Independence in 1947, the ruling party did not have a single Muslim Member of Parliament.                 Tuesday’s election results, in which Prime Minister Modi sealed a rare third term, only enhance the sense of gloom and doom for Indian Muslims like me. My community may once again not have an MP in the government.                 With the BJP back in power – albeit without the supermajority it had vowed – my only hope lies in a politically weakened Modi now. A weakened Modi shall, hopefully, translate into a more robust India and more secure minorities.                 It may still be a long haul though.                 After the recently concluded, hate-driven campaign led by Modi himself, things may only get worse. As it was before the vote, India is poised to continue transforming itself from a secular democratic republic into possibly a Hindu majoritarian state, with reduced rights and presence of minorities in general – and of Muslims in particular.                 If after Modi’s first victory in 2014, there was a sense of cautious hope, 10 years later, my Muslim community stands orphaned, not just jettisoned by the ruling BJP, but repeatedly marked out as the group responsible for the supposed ills of the nation. There is an overriding feeling of belonging to a group under siege.                 The prime minister kickstarted the invidious campaign by calling India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” in one of his early election speeches.                 His vitriol was, to put it mildly, unprovoked; the state of Rajasthan where he delivered his divisive speech has a strongly guarded border with Muslim-majority Pakistan. The state has only sent one Muslim candidate to the Lok Sabha – the Lower House of Parliament – since the first election back in 1952.             In this year’s election, the two leading political parties, the BJP and the Indian National Congress (INC or, simply, “Congress”), did not give a ticket to a single Muslim to contest the elections in Rajasthan. Yet the invisible Muslim ghost was punched with relish by Modi. It’s worth remembering this is the man who, back in 2002, was the Chief Minister of the state of Gujarat when large-scale violence claimed over 1,000 lives, a vast majority of them Muslims. (Modi denied any wrongdoing, and the Supreme Court cleared him of complicity).                 But let us return to 2024. As the 6-week-long election wore on, Modi mocked the Muslim community’s supposed high fertility rate and repeatedly targeted the community using the opposition – especially Congress – as a mere pretext, accusing it of reserving 15% of the Union Budget for Indian Muslims. (Congress rejected the claim).                 Of course, Modi denied discriminating against Muslims, and in a widely televised interview claimed to have celebrated the Muslim festival of Eid with his friends.             Meanwhile the Islamophobia within the BJP hit a new low when the party’s promotional video showed caricatures of Congress party leaders placing an egg marked “Muslims” in a nest next to three eggs marked “SC,” “OBC” and “ST” (three lower caste groups). As the eggs hatch, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is shown feeding “funds” to the chick wearing a skullcap while ignoring the other chickens. The allusion was not lost on anyone. The video ran for days on social media before the Election Commission wrote to Twitter to take action.                 Muslims stood silenced by the unceasing vitriol. Some were intimidated. Others hoped the election would bring an end to BJP rule. It proved a false hope. The BJP’s much-hyped claim of getting over 400 seats in the Lower House of Parliament did not materialize. The party, in the end, needed help from allies, Telugu Desam and Janata Dal (United), to form a government for the third time in succession – a feat hitherto performed only by the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s Congress immediately after Independence.             Muslims stood silenced by the unceasing vitriol. Some were intimidated. Others hoped the election would bring an end to BJP rule. It proved a false hope.             Ziya Us Salam                 Except for one candidate in the constituency of Kerala, the BJP refused to put up Muslim candidates. This had an unfortunate ripple effect with the number of Muslims getting tickets from other parties showing a decline.                 The main opposition party, Congress, failed to put up a Muslim candidate in the capital, New Delhi, as well as in the commercial center Mumbai and in Mahatma Gandhi’s home state, Gujarat. In fact, the number of Muslim candidates put up by major political parties showed a steep decline, falling from 115 in the 2019 elections, to 78 in 2024.             In the days and months to come, things could get seriously tough for Indian Muslims. With the prime minister failing to condemn the frequent lynching of Muslim men by right-wing vigilantes since 2015, and state governments ruled by the BJP using bulldozers to demolish Muslim establishments as a means of cowing even the odd voice of protest, it is going to be a question of survival for my community.                 Our food habits, clothing, education centers and places of worship are all likely to be under greater scrutiny, possibly even violent attacks in the days of come.                 Already, medieval Indian mosques, some as old as 900 years, are being contested by Hindu outfits in various courts. There have been noises that the world-famous Taj Mahal was originally a Hindu temple, and that the historic Qutb Minar in Delhi was built after demolition of temples.                 A community which has seen the 16th century mosque, the Babri Masjid, become a Hindu temple during Modi’s second term has reason to fear the worst.                 We’ve seen BJP leaders talking of closing Islamic seminaries across the states of Uttar Pradesh and Assam. In the state of Uttarakhand, a hurriedly cobbled together Uniform Civil Code is in place – essentially a single set of laws for all residents that does not take into account the customs or religious laws of different religions or minority groups. It could be the norm for the rest of India soon as the BJP tries to deny Indian Muslims the right to follow Islamic laws in civil matters, a right granted by the Indian Constitution.                 With Hindu Rashtra a virtual reality, it is difficult to see a silver lining for Indian Muslims who chose pluralist India over the theocratic state of Pakistan at the time of Independence.                 In the summer of 2024, my community stands betrayed, forsaken and forlorn.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

As turnout in the polls so far shows a slight dip from five years ago, the popular leader – and overwhelming favorite – has embraced negative campaigning, they say, and received little pushback from civil society or election authorities.                 Followers of Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – and some of its top figures – have long been accused of using inflammatory language to describe the country’s 200 million Muslims, but rarely Modi himself. However this election has brought a clear shift, critics say.                 “What is unique about what we’ve seen recently, is that these statements are being uttered by the Prime Minister himself,” Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Not necessarily by surrogates – the Home Minister, or by the chief minister – or by other kind of party apparatchiks.”                 The shift in tone is making many Indian Muslims nervous.                 “Modi and the BJP have for a long time been making references to the community, but it’s moved on from the dog whistle,” said political researcher and columnist Asim Ali. “It’s painting us as an existential threat to Hindus. It’s coming directly from the prime minister. It’s anti-Muslim, and it’s dangerous.”                 Modi and his BJP have repeatedly said they do not discriminate against minority groups.                 But analysts and observers have noted multiple speeches he’s made during this six-week election campaign, that began last month, specifically refer to Muslims and paint them in a negative light.     Related articleCampaign video targeting Muslims faces India police probe as critics accuse Modi’s party of divisive election tactics             Calling Muslims “infiltrators” with “large families,” Modi has accused his main opposition, the Indian National Congress, without evidence, of intending to redistribute the country’s wealth to Muslims. He warned women that the opposition would take their gold and redistribute it to Muslims. He accused Congress of wanting to choose players on the Indian cricket team “on the basis of religion.” And he has claimed the party is conspiring to commit “vote jihad” by uniting “a certain community” against him.                 The BJP did not respond to a request for comment on the rhetoric being used by party leaders during this campaign. BJP national spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill previously told CNN that the party is not prejudiced against Muslims, and the community has benefited from Modi’s leadership.                 For Irfan Nooruddin, a professor of Indian politics at Georgetown University, the rhetoric has “become much more starkly and overtly communal.”                 “These are very central views within the BJP that are sometimes suppressed to avoid negative press or civil society pushback. With the media and civil society neutralized, the BJP no longer fears such consequences and so can pull back the veil,” he said.                 “The BJP understands that its path to a majority in parliament – especially a super-majority that would allow it to amend the constitution – is to consolidate the Hindu vote and to prevent the opposition from making inroads through economic appeals,” added Nooruddin.                 The prime minister has set an ambitious target for his alliance to win 400 seats in the country’s Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament, in this election.                 Many in the country say their lives have been transformed under his leadership, aided by his far-reaching welfare and development schemes. Weeks before voting began, analysts were certain his party would sweep the polls yet again.                 Since April 19, millions have flocked to polling booths to cast their vote. But turnout across six phases so far has slightly dipped from the record highs of 2019, and this might be causing anxiety among BJP leaders, analysts say.                 The chief minister of Delhi, popular opposition leader and staunch Modi critic, Arvind Kejriwal, was temporarily allowed out of prison earlier this month after being arrested on corruption charges, in a case his allies claimed was politically motivated. His release has galvanized a once flattened opposition, uniting them to deliver a tough fight to Modi and his BJP.                 “This election is becoming competitive,” said political researcher Ali, suggesting that a tighter race in key seats might be motivating the ruling party to ramp up the inflammatory language. “The BJP is a favorite but their target is ambitious, and this rhetoric appeals to their vote bank.”                 Many have accused the prime minister of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his Hindu-nationalist credentials, while diverting from policy failures – such as youth unemployment, which now stands at close to 50% among 20- to 24-year-olds, and the vast wealth gap in the country, which according to a recent study is more unequal than it was during British rule.                 “The BJP’s track record on economic growth, job creation, and poverty alleviation is weak,” Nooruddin, from Georgetown University, said. “These bread-and-butter issues are central to election campaigns and the opposition has really sought to emphasize them. So, I think the BJP’s resort to overt communal rhetoric is an effort to fight an election on its preferred terms rather than on issues where it is vulnerable.”                 Muslim independent journalist Alishan Jafri noted that the day-to-day struggles brought by poverty and unemployment are “affecting Muslims as much as it’s affecting poor Hindus,” pointing to some 800 million people dependent on rations provided by the government.                 “To tell (Hindus) that Muslims will take away even half of that is surely going to scare them and divide the communities on religious lines. That the mainstream media has refused to push back tells us two things: they are compromised, or they support it.”                 Modi’s government posits India as a leader on the global stage. His calendar last year included diplomatic trips to Australia and the United States, and he presents himself as a statesman cementing the country as a modern power.                 Last year India overtook China to become the world’s most populous nation, while the year before it surpassed former colonial power Britain to become the world’s fifth-largest economy. According to Vaishnav, the muted response to Modi’s divisive language from Western leaders must be seen through the prism through which they view India – as a balance against an increasingly assertive China.                 At home, analysts say, his grip on power has allowed him to make such comments with little pushback from civil society.                 “The Election Commission is pretty toothless and what powers it has had have been further weakened by changes made to how commissioners are appointed by making the Prime Minister’s Office more central to that process,” Nooruddin said.                 Modi’s April 21 speech about “infiltrators” has ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians, and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking specifically about undocumented migrants.                 The election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations. But opposition groups and critics say the response is not strong enough.                 Globally, independent polls suggest that India’s image is declining in some countries around the world and there is some criticism about the government’s Hindu nationalist ambitions.                 “The anti-Muslim rhetoric used on the campaign trail will unfortunately further damage India’s reputation globally. This is unnecessary at a time when India should be ascendant,” Nooruddin said.                 For Jafri, the journalist, the effects are clear.                 “I can’t express what millions of people feel as a collective, but I am sure that nobody likes being constantly abused, bullied, betrayed, and singled out,” he said. “Some feel attacked and humiliated. Many have become cynical, and they don’t expect any better from this regime and its supporters.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             When I was growing up, most of my South Asian friends and peers were pushed into medical careers. I was able to go in a different direction, initially attending law school, only to realize early in my first semester that a legal career wasn’t what I wanted.                 Coming from a literary and scholarly Pakistani-American family, I yearned to learn more about my faith. I wanted to challenge misperceptions about Islam. I wanted to teach and empower.                 A year after graduating from college, I enrolled at Columbia University’s Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies, eager to study with the many scholars who approached Islam on its own terms, with respect, rigor, nuance and a love of inquiry.                 In the nearly decade and a half since I graduated with a master’s degree, I’ve continued to draw on the remarkable education I received. That has included designing historical experiences immersing travelers in the Muslim legacy in Europe: A new kind of Sunday school for middle and high schoolers. And global leadership programs for young Muslim professionals from across the West, strongly influenced by the kind of creative and open-ended inquiry I often experienced at Columbia. That is why I found what transpired at Columbia University these last few months so profoundly disappointing.                 The weeks of student protests (which continue at some campuses) should provoke us to reflect on the larger impact of this movement — especially at my alma mater, where the main commencement ceremony, which had been scheduled for this week, was canceled. (Protesters and their supporters organized their own ceremony.)                 The media line fed to the public about weeks of protests at Columbia — and the administrative crackdown that followed — has been selective at best. I know this as an alumnus, a parent with two kids on the verge of college and as someone who teaches young Americans, including high schoolers. I know adolescents and young adults are far more passionate, curious, creative and courageous than older adults sometimes casually assume.     Related articleOpinion: The antisemitic lie at the heart of too many campus protests             America’s universities are the envy of the world and are meant to be laboratories for democracy and engines of innovation, keeping our society democratic and vigorous, economically dynamic and forward-facing. But instead, it appears too many this spring have seemed intent on suffocating debate they don’t endorse, rather than promoting and protecting the exchange of ideas.              I’m incensed by the same realities the student protesters are outraged by: Israel’s occupation and brutalization of Palestinians with our country’s active assistance. Columbia students have made clear that that’s what drives their protests. What’s less widely reported is how they are also driven by double standards in how our leaders address Israeli and Palestinian issues.                 When was the last time you heard a news report about anti-Arab or anti-Muslim animus on campuses? Where is the outcry for the pro-Palestinian students threatened with professional consequences only for protesting? Why, even as numerous students at Columbia and elsewhere have been doxxed, harassed and bullied, were no congressional hearings called?                 Long before our protracted national conversation about antisemitism got underway, some Columbia faculty members have quite arguably crossed a line into anti-Palestinian agitation, with no apparent consequences. And at UCLA, pro-Israel demonstrators even attacked pro-Palestinian student encampments for hours. Police were nowhere to be seen.                 For months now, we’ve seen pro-Palestinian students, including Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims, as well as students of other backgrounds and faiths (including many Jewish students), held to different standards and demonized when they are in fact standing up for fundamental human, basic American and common civic values. There may be no better symbol of this than Columbia’s President Minouche Shafik, who last week was on the losing end of a no-confidence vote by faculty over her handling of the protests.                 When Shafik was called to testify before a biased congressional hearing, she faced a hard choice. Two of her fellow Ivy League president predecessors did not hold onto their jobs very long after appearing before the same House panel, some of whose members seemed gleeful at the prospect of taking down another.                 In my view, Shafik capitulated. She told Republican lawmakers everything that they appeared to want to hear. But she did not have to capitulate. She could have questioned the dubious, even dangerous assumptions inherent in the questions themselves. She could have taken a stand on principle, in support of students expressing their views in the best tradition of campus protest. She might have considered the blatant double standards at her and peer institutions.                 She might have told lawmakers that all speech is free, or none is. She might have invited our national leaders to engage in a more difficult conversation — one which would have been less sensationalistic than the congressional hearing they held, but probably far more substantial.                 Such a dialogue could have addressed how we balance free inquiry in a country of robust pluralism. It might also have raised the question about what it means to balance strong beliefs, academic rigor and mutual respect.     Related articleOpinion: The conversation we can’t avoid about pro-Palestinian campus protests             That’s the kind of engagement we sorely need more of in this country. It’s the kind of discussion a university president such as Shafik would have been uniquely positioned to lead. She capitulated to bad-faith interrogators after the collapse of days of talks, then invited heavily armed police onto campus. Somehow, she and other authorities seemed more concerned with the purported unruliness of the protest than the horrors that prompted it.                 Palestinians in this country, as well as pro-Palestinian demonstrators, have been shot at, menaced, struck with vehicles, merely for who they are or what they stand for. But there has been no congressional hearing about these crimes and hardly even acknowledgement in many quarters that these crimes have happened. That Shafik even had to appear before Congress is just another example of how deeply entrenched our double standards are.                 Students aren’t out of touch with America. A majority of Americans disapprove of Israeli actions in Gaza. Student protesters are confirming what more and more Americans cannot deny, even while many of our elites remain seemingly indifferent. We might on reflection appreciate that it is better to see young Americans exceedingly committed to freedom, debate and challenging our hypocrisies than not.                 That hardly means we are all going to agree on how to protest or on what approach is better — but we should all agree on the right to protest — and the responsibility of the protesters to push our country to do better.                 Just a few weeks ago, I joined some 50 or so American Muslims and allies in Washington, DC, leaders and activists from diverse backgrounds, coming together to explore what it might mean to continue to advocate for our faith communities. That included continuing to hold our government to account for our role in Israel’s war and protecting freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.                 There was a special level of interest in protecting our universities from governmental and elite interference, preserving the unique space campuses provide for hard conversations, political exploration and civic formation. Most of us were deeply disappointed by how our respective alma maters put select donors over institutional integrity. But the energy and engagement underscored the commitment to this cause.                 We left inspired to continue standing up for the right to protest and leverage our resources to put pressure on these colleges and universities to maintain academic freedom, to uphold standards that do not privilege certain politics or positions and to maintain and extend the opportunities our colleges had opened for us — a commitment I believe continues down to this present moment.                 When Shafik arrived at those hearings, she faced some lawmakers who acted as if they believed universities, and those on campus who are allies of the Palestinians, were enemies of America.                 But if Columbia students didn’t care about their university and the values it claims to uphold, they wouldn’t have risked so much with their protests. By the same token, if students didn’t care about our country, they wouldn’t protest so vocally against its policies.                 Maybe these students are mirrors of America, revealing how much work we have left to do. But they also reveal that there is enough passion, commitment and courage that our causes are not lost. Our struggles are not pointless. A better future can be ours.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

The police probe comes as the world’s most populous nation votes in a mammoth weeks-long election in which Modi’s Hindu-nationalist party is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term.                 The party has long denied being anti-Islam but opposition politicians and prominent Muslims have warned that its leaders have been deploying openly divisive rhetoric to turbo-charge their campaign.                 According to a police report seen by CNN on Tuesday, Karnataka state police are investigating whether local BJP leader B. Y. Vijayendra and the unnamed holder of the party’s official local X account “promoted enmity” between religious groups after the clip was posted online on May 4.                 The 17-second animation depicts leaders of India’s main opposition Congress party giving benefits to Muslims, alongside a caption in the local Kannada language: “Beware… Beware… Beware…!”                 It shows caricatures of Congress’s national leader Rahul Gandhi and its Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah feeding “funds” to a large bird wearing a Muslim skullcap, while giving nothing to three smaller birds portraying other marginalized minorities. The large bird then kicks the other birds out of their nest as the Congress politicians laugh.     Related articleModi’s Muslim remarks spark ‘hate speech’ accusations as India’s mammoth election deepens divides             The video was removed Wednesday after a request to X from India’s Election Commission to take it down.                 CNN has reached out to Vijayendra, the BJP and X for comment.                 Critics said Congress’ manifesto makes no mention of redistributing wealth to Muslims, while Congress lawmaker Manickam Tagore said the video was a “blatant demonization of minorities by ruling BJP,” and urged the Election Commission to address its “divisive tactics.”                 Many of India’s more than 200 million Muslims have expressed fear at the prospect of Modi’s re-election, and critics said the video fits a pattern of openly Islamophobic rhetoric during the BJP’s campaign.                 Last month, the BJP’s Instagram account published another animation that claimed the Congress planned to prioritize Muslims.                 “If you are a non-Muslim, Congress will snatch your wealth and distribute it to Muslims,” said a voiceover in the clip, which has since been removed from Instagram.                 That video echoed similar comments by Modi, who sparked a row over hate speech last month while campaigning in BJP-ruled Rajasthan state, when he accused Muslims – who have been present in India for centuries – of being “infiltrators” who deliberately have large families to outgrow the majority Hindu population.                 Modi’s speech ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants.                 The election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations.                 In an interview with local broadcaster Times Now on Monday, Modi said the BJP is “not opposed to Islam and Muslims.”                 But many Muslims were skeptical.                 “This is not a dogwhistle, this is a targeted, direct, brazen hate speech against a community,” prominent Muslim journalist Rana Ayyub said in response to the speech.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The world’s most populous nation is in the midst of a mammoth weeks-long election in which Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term.                 Speaking in front of a large crowd in the country’s western Rajasthan state, Modi said if voted into power, the country’s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, would distribute the country’s wealth among “infiltrators” and “those who have more children,” in apparent reference to the Muslim community.                 “When they (the Congress) were in power, they said Muslims have first right over resources. They will gather all your wealth and distribute it among those who have more children. They will distribute among infiltrators,” Modi said to thunderous roars from the audience.                 “Do you think your hard-earned money should be given to infiltrators? Would you accept this?” Modi said.                 Those remarks have been seized on by the opposition, who have long accused Modi and the BJP of using divisive rhetoric to turbo-charge their increasingly popular brand of Hindu nationalism.                 Opposition members have called on the Election Commission of India (ECI) to investigate whether Modi’s comments break the body’s code of conduct.                 The code states politicians must not appeal to voters based on “caste” and “communal feelings.” Activity which “may aggravate differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension” between communities and religions, is also not allowed.                 CNN has contacted the ECI for comment.                 Modi received widespread backlash from members of the Muslim community for his comments at a time when many fear a third BJP term will deepen the communal fissures already running through the country.                 “This is not a dogwhistle, this is a targeted, direct, brazen hate speech against a community,” prominent Muslim journalist Rana Ayyub wrote on X.     Related articleNarendra Modi: India’s popular but controversial leader seeking a transformative third term             Muslim lawmaker and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, Asaduddin Owaisi, said: “Modi today called Muslims infiltrators and people with many children. Since 2002 till this day, the only Modi guarantee has been to abuse Muslims and get votes.”                 Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge described Modi’s comments as “hate speech” and “a well thought out ploy to divert attention.”                 “Today the prime minister did what he has learnt from the values of the Sangh,” referring to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) a right-wing Hindu paramilitary organization, which Modi was once a youth member of and to which the BJP is affiliated with. “In the history of India, no prime minister has lowered the dignity of his post as much as Modi has.”                 Modi swept to power in 2014 on a promise of development and anti-corruption, rising in popularity during his term and getting re-elected five years later – the second time on a more openly Hindu nationalist ticket.                 Over the last decade, Modi and his BJP have been accused of driving religious polarization with their Hindu nationalist policies, giving rise to a wave of Islamophobia and deadly communal clashes in the world’s largest secular democracy.                 India’s minority Muslim population is enormous – some 230 million people – and Muslims have lived in what is now modern India for centuries. But a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists is to accuse Muslims of being somehow outsiders and spreading a false narrative that they are displacing the country’s Hindu population by deliberately having large families.     Related articleIn face of Modi juggernaut, India’s opposition appears increasingly weak             The BJP has repeatedly said it does not discriminate based on religion and treats all citizens equally.

Anti-Muslim speech has risen dramatically, a recent report by the Washington-based research group India Hate Lab showed, which documented 668 such cases in 2023. Of these cases, 75% took place in BJP-ruled states, the report said.                 India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section which criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs, but rights groups say there is a lack of immediate and adequate action against the alleged perpetrators of such acts, giving right-wing extremists tacit support.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/09/style/muslims-in-america-photography/index.html,Photos challenge misconceptions about what it means to be an American Muslim,British artist Mahtab Hussain felt compelled to photograph the US Muslim community in an ongoing series that celebrates diversity and cultural nuances.,"Apr 9, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Leah Dolan,International,"Editor’s Note: This feature is part of CNN Style’s series Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.             In one photo, Julo stares down the camera dressed in a tie-dye t-shirt, dreadlocks and a red snapback cap. In another, Adbul wears low-waisted jeans, a motorcycle jacket and a decadent fur scarf. Candace is pictured in a pair of Nike Air Jordans, her long platinum hair stark against her black shirt. These are some of the faces featured in “Muslims in America,” an ongoing photography series by British artist Mahtab Hussain.                 “I grew up always being told that Islam is a way of life, but I didn’t really know what that meant,” Hussain told CNN over a video call. “But going to the US and meeting all these communities, people from all walks of life, all over the world, it’s really interesting how this Islam fits in with the culture.”                 Like an intricately woven tapestry, the series stitches together the many people who share his identity, which is underrepresented in the US. In 2017, the Pew Research Center estimated there were 3.45 million Muslims living in the US — and projected that by 2040, Muslims would replace Jews as the country’s second-largest religious group after Christians. By 2050, the same study also predicted that the US Muslim population would grow to a total of 8.1 million, or 2.1% of the total population. Despite these figures, the experience of Muslims today can be misconstrued or entirely lacking from the cultural conversation.                 According to the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, just 1% of all speaking characters across 200 popular TV shows in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand were Muslim. The visibility that does exists has often perpetuated harmful stereotypes. In another study that focused on the portrayals of Muslims in movies, also by the USC Annenberg, nearly 40% of primary and secondary Muslim characters across 200 top-rated films were depicted as perpetrators of violence. “The representation of Muslims on screen feeds the policies that get enacted, the people that get killed, the countries that get invaded,” wrote actor and producer Riz Ahmed, in an accompanying call-to-arms document called “The Blueprint for Muslim Inclusion.” The project outlines ways to boost Muslim representation in TV and film in order to help combat anti-Muslim hate, erasure and stereotypes.                 Hussain, who was born in Glasgow to first-generation immigrants from Kashmir and Pakistan, felt compelled to challenge the misconception of Muslims in America, particularly after Islamophobia rose after the 9/11 attacks. He began the project in 2021, two decades on, as a way to visually commemorate the anniversary from another perspective. “When 9/11 happened, so many people in the communities in the US and the UK shut down, because they were fearful of being seen as being Muslim. The religion was hijacked, their narrative was completely hijacked, a lot of interesting filmmakers, musicians and cultural creatives stopped,” he said. “But in the last 20 years, I’ve seen a new wave of pride emerge about being Muslim.”                 So far, Hussain has documented subjects living in New York, LA, Baltimore and Toronto, Canada. His sitters are a mix of people responding to open casting calls as well as ones he spots while riding his bike through city streets. Some wear hijabs and kufi hats, others are dressed in tank tops, hoodies, cargo pants and mini skirts. As a British Pakistani Muslim, he says he’s noticed that the makeup of the community across the pond is more diverse. “The major difference is diversity. I’ve met people from all over the world in the US who are Muslim: Palestinians, people from all over Africa. LA has one of the largest Iranian populations. It’s not the same in Britain.”     Related articleA new photo series highlights the diverse experiences of breast cancer patients             The result is a rich portfolio, capturing people of different ages and ethnicities as well as their clothing choices — some appear covered up, while others show more skin and tattoos. Not only do Hussain’s photographs visually challenge the way American Muslims have been portrayed, he has also offered space for his subjects to share their experiences. In transcribed interviews printed alongside the images, they open up about issues such as the balancing act of embracing aspects of US culture and honouring their faith. Whether to wear a hijab or not, for example, played on the mind of some of the women he has lensed, while others reflected on the stigma of dressing modestly in a Western society. “There’s no narrative that I’m trying to push through,” he said. “It’s about what the community is saying, and who these people are. That’s how I’ve always made my work.”                 According to Hussain, many of the people he met saw Islam as something forgiving and evolving, rather than strict and fundamentalist. “I’m learning so much from the people I meet,” he told CNN. “The LGBTQ community in New York City absolutely schooled me with regards to what Islam means to them. There’s a narrative that says if you’re gay or queer, you can’t be religious. But they (embraced) their journey and struggle.”                 His next installment will take place in Dearborn, Michigan, a city with the largest population of Muslims in the entire nation. In 2022, Democrat Abdullah Hammoud became Dearborn’s first Arab American mayor, and has been in the spotlight recently for raising concerns about US President Joe Biden’s response to the conflict in Gaza.                 “I worry Biden will be remembered not as the president who saved American democracy but as the president who sacrificed it for Netanyahu,” the mayor wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times in February.                 Many members of  Dearborn’s Arab American and Muslim American communities have openly rejected Biden for his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Hussain, who typically tries to keep the project as positive in tone as possible, is planning a trip to the city in order to capture Muslim residents in this politically-charged atmosphere. (Michigan is a key state in the 2024 election).                 “I think it’s really important there’s a chapter in the work that talks about this,” he said. “Yes, this (series) is about looking positively at a new identity that’s formed in the US, but October 7 shifted the conversation again.” This month, the Pew Research Center published a survey that found 70% of US Muslims believe discrimination against Muslims has increased since the Israel-Hamas war began, and over 50% say they feel  afraid of news around the war.                 “It just shows how delicate this all is, especially for Muslims in the US.”                 Hussain says the response to the series has so far been affirming, with many participants celebrating his mission to broaden Muslim representation. “Everyone was really open to being part of the work,” he said.                 “Strangers would come up to me and hug me. The love that I received, it absolutely changed me as a person.”     More of Mahtab Hussain’s work can be found here.

Ramadan, regarded as the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, is celebrated by Muslims around the world who abstain from eating, drinking, and sexual acts during daylight hours and break their fast after sundown.                 It is a month of deep spiritual reflection and celebration with friends and family – but can also be far from easy, as anyone who has tried fasting can attest.                 In many parts of Malaysia, Muslims caught eating or drinking during daytime hours can find themselves on the wrong side of the law.                 Around 20.6 million of Malaysia’s 34 million-strong population are Muslims, but the country is also home to sizeable ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities that include Buddhists, Christians and Hindus, as well as indigenous communities.     Related galleryIn pictures: Muslims observe Ramadan around the globe             Under the country’s unusual dual track legal system, which is also federal and varies from state to state, Muslims are subject to sharia law on a host of social issues including marriage, divorce and fasting.                 Religious police tend to ramp up their presence during Ramadan, activists note, which ends later this week, patrolling the streets more visibly and staking out at popular eateries – sometimes in disguise – to catch those breaching the rules.                 Those caught eating or drinking during daytime hours face fines of up to 1,000 Malaysian Ringgit (about $200) and prison terms of up to a year. Non-Muslims caught selling food, drinks or tobacco to Muslims during fasting hours are also subject to penalties.                 Arrest figures have not yet been released for this year but in 2023, religious officials in the state of Malacca, a major tourist destination, recorded nearly 100 arrests of Muslims caught eating in public during the fasting month, an increase from 41 arrests the previous year, they said.                 This year, more than 10 “hotspots” were identified throughout the state, said the chairman of its Islamic Religious Department, JAIM.     Related articleOktoberfest is back. But religious politicians in this country want it banned             Rahmad Mariman announced that “frequent monitoring and inspections” were being carried out at popular bars, restaurants, malls and parks. “Through these operations, JAIM enforcement officers will detain Muslims found eating in public and will not hesitate to take action against traders involved in selling food to them,” Mariman said in a statement.                 Up north in the state of Perak, JAIM’s counterpart, the Gerik Islamic Religious Department (JAIPK), took to TikTok to share videos of inspections and fasting raids religious officers had conducted throughout March.                 In one video, set against a spaghetti western soundtrack, JAIPK officers wearing their distinctive black and white uniforms and reflective vests were seen arriving at an open-air eatery in the town of Gerik during the day to question restaurant staff and catch Muslims buying food.                 One man wearing a blue motorcycle helmet, whose face is pixelated in the video, was seen fleeing the restaurant with a plastic bag of food.                 “This was not a reenactment by professionals. It is an actual video of what took place during our recent operations,” JAIPK wrote in a caption accompanying its TikTok video, which went viral – racking up more than 1.7 million views and continuing to draw thousands of comments since it was uploaded on March 15.                 Like much of South and Southeast Asia, Malaysia has historically practiced a moderate form of Islam but religious conservatism has been on the rise in recent years.                 At the forefront of this shift, experts say, is the ultra-conservative hardline Islamist political party PAS, which made historic gains during Malaysia’s 2023 general election and wields great influence in its stronghold conservative states in the north.                 PAS party leader Hadi Awang, also a religious teacher, regularly expresses his support for harsher sharia laws.                 CNN reached out to multiple state religious bodies across Malaysia for comment. One religious enforcement officer from Malacca said that more raids had been carried out this year at various roadside stalls, restaurants and parks as compared to 2023 and 2022.                 “It is our responsibility to protect and preserve the name of Islam during this important time,” said the male officer, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak with international media.                 But not all cases result in arrests, he also stressed. “It is also important that we show compassion, especially on very hot days when we see people drinking water – sometimes it can’t be helped.”                 Moral policing during Ramadan is a longstanding issue in the country, according to Malaysian women’s rights group Sisters in Islam, which advocates against religious policing and points to another controversial area of concern – “khalwat” laws.                 Also known as “close proximity laws”, they vary from state to state and are part of the civil sharia legislation that only applies to Muslims. They are used to prosecute unmarried couples deemed to be overly close to each other.

Complaints were made to the state religious department, media reports said, and the scandal caused a national stir – drawing scorn from conservative politicians and prompting public apologies from the celebrities.                 Sisters in Islam told CNN that overzealous application of religious laws had gotten worse in recent years.                 “These acts of moral policing violate personal freedoms and paint a distorted image of Islam and raises important questions,” said SIS spokeswoman Ameena Siddiqi.                 It is also common practice during Ramadan for public schools in Malaysia to shut their canteens, leaving limited options to eat and rest during the day, Siddiqi notes.                 “This has led to instances where non-Muslim students are forced to ‘respect’ their fasting peers and eat their recess meals in toilets,” Siddiqi said, adding sensitivities around fasting add to “heightened tensions.”                 “Restaurants and eateries have refused to serve food to pregnant women during Ramadan, which goes against the very essence of Islam,” Siddiqi added.                 Anisah Mahmood, a 42-year-old mother of two from Kuala Lumpur now living in London, said she was suspended by her company in 2018 after she was caught eating in public. She was breastfeeding at the time.                 “There are valid reasons for not fasting, mostly medical,” she said. “But this is severely misunderstood in Malaysia, even if you are tired or sick, you will be shamed and made to feel like a bad person.”                 The issue of shuttered school canteens has been hotly debated over the years and was recently revived in parliament by Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek.     Related article‘I don’t trust myself.’ For Muslims with eating disorders, fasting in Ramadan brings another set of challenges             Non-Muslim students, she argued, “should not be forced to eat in storerooms or other inappropriate places” during Ramadan “when canteens are available.”                 Her comments drew criticism from PAS.                 “We think it’s common today that everyone respects those who are fasting and the children that are still learning to fast,” PAS lawmaker Haji Ahmad Bin Yahaya, said in a statement shared online.                 For those who struggle to fast or adhere to the rigors of the faith they were born with, Ramadan can be a stressful time.                 Yusuf, a Malay Muslim man in his 30s who lives in the southern state of Johor, recalled how he was caught buying food during Ramadan by religious police in 2019.                 “As long as you look Malay, you must fast during Ramadan – those are the rules,” Yusuf told CNN.                 He asked not to publish his full name and age given the sensitivities of the topic.                 “No one likes to admit when they don’t fast – especially if they are in Malaysia,” he said.                 “I try to fast and try to be consistent, but it gets mentally taxing and can feel almost impossible when all you want is coffee and a cigarette to help get you through the day.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The opinions in this article are those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.             As the conflict in the Middle East reverberates around the world, many in the West have fallen into the emotional traps of anger, fear and righteousness toward the perceived other side. Exporting the conflict will not bring peace any more than it will bring victory, and the only way to reduce the flames is to learn to coexist.                 My work as an imam and focus on spiritual coexistence in Israel and Palestine has shown me that the best personal defense against destructive emotions is to find the other inside ourselves. A complex identity is a natural antibody that inoculates against hate, and I myself identify as a Muslim, a Bedouin, a Palestinian and an Israeli.                 It is currently the month of Ramadan. This year my coexistence organization, Abrahamic Reunion, has hosted our 20th annual coexistence Iftar meal, this time in Jerusalem. It is especially meaningful to break my fast with my non-Muslim partners in the current context of the war. Ramadan is a time when Muslims have to think about the other who is less fortunate than themselves. Through fasting and charity, we are supposed to come out of the month with a renewed appreciation for our role in this world. That is the essence of spiritual coexistence, in which your self-image makes room for the humanity of others.                 Many people resent that I refuse to choose only one side of my identity; they want me to be angry, empty and broken like them. Members of my own Bedouin Muslim community have threatened and attacked my family and me for simply acknowledging the humanity of Jewish Israelis. My house was shot at after I spoke out against denying the crimes of Hamas on October 7.                 This is not a recent phenomenon. In 2008, after my wife was honored with lighting a torch at a celebration of Israel’s Independence Day, our family’s car was bombed. But these attacks have only ever strengthened my resolve to advocate for spiritual coexistence, and so I have spent years teaching Jewish Israelis about Islam and our need to recognize that both Muslims and Jews belong in this land.     Related articleOpinion: Why antisemitism and anti-Zionism are so deeply intertwined             This has been my life’s mission. My wife Sana and I cofounded the Abrahamic Reunion in the aftermath of the violence of the Second Intifada of the early 2000s, when terror attacks and military operations drove deep divisions between every sector of Israeli and Palestinian society. Abrahamic Reunion’s dream is to reunite the children of Abraham in the Holy Land, and to that end we have had tens of thousands of Muslims, Christians, Jews, Israelis and Palestinians join our activities over the years.                 Spiritual coexistence means building bridges out of celebration, grief and the acknowledgment of God above us, no matter your faith. And it is how we cultivate the other within ourselves. Almost anyone who participates in experiences like these will find themselves more immune to the emotional pull of identity-driven hate, even amid a devastating and personal war such as this one.                 Abrahamic Reunion included participants from Gaza until Hamas made participation illegal in 2013. Before then, we would sit on a hill next to the border and talk through megaphones with Gazans on the other side of the fence. Organizations that feel threatened by coexistence know that it is the greatest threat to their power.                 You can always coexist with other people, but not with every ideology, and on October 7, Hamas declared war against every element of my identity. They murdered Muslims. They kidnapped Bedouin from the desert. They continue to oppress Palestinians in Gaza, stealing aid and using their homes and mosques to launch attacks. They are committed to destroying Israel and every Israeli. I am at war with Hamas because this is their path, but I will never be at war against the people of Gaza.     Related articleOpinion: The crux of Israel’s challenge             My religion is Islam, and as the imam of the southern Israeli town of Tel Sheva, I provide spiritual and moral guidance to my community, as my father and grandfather did before me. My ancestors are related to the Hashemite family, the traditional protectors of Islam’s holy sites.                 The Islam of my tradition has nothing in common with those who proclaimed “Allahu Akbar” while inflicting unspeakable violence upon innocent civilians on October 7. It is because I am a Muslim that I call to immediately release the remaining hostages seized from Israel, Bedouin Muslims among them, and to provide help to Palestinians in desperate need of humanitarian relief in Gaza.                 My ethnicity is Bedouin, and my people have called the Negev desert home for centuries, as nations and empires rose and fell around us. Bedouin tribes are part of the Arab fabric of this land, and I trace my history, traditions and communal codes back to the sands of the Negev. Despite being from a nomadic people, I am not at home anywhere else.                 The Bedouin community in Israel has long suffered from neglect and marginalization by the state, and our society today is riddled with both crime and a lack of respect for its elders. My mission to deliver Tel Sheva back from the hands of criminals is connected to the need to return Islam from the broken souls of political extremists.                 My people are the Palestinian people, and I am inextricably connected to the souls in Gaza for whom the weight of this war is unbearable. I feel their fear, hunger and suffering as my own, and I cry at the images of destruction and loss. Members of my community have family in Gaza, and we pray for their safety every day.                 A solution to this conflict will only come from securing a path to Palestinian freedom, under a government that represents and cares for its people. War will not turn that hope into a reality, and neither will leaving Gaza under the moral vacuum of Hamas.                 My nationality is Israeli. An Israeli who loves the country he has built alongside his Jewish and Arab neighbors. An Israeli whose wife was the first Bedouin woman honored with lighting a torch at Israel’s national Independence Day ceremony. An Israeli who knows that his country must now fight for peace as hard as it fights for survival because the two are dependent on each other. On October 7, Bedouin Muslims like myself saved the lives of our Jewish neighbors, and the Israel Defense Forces defended our homes the same way they did the homes of Jewish Israelis.                 My wife, may Allah have mercy on her, passed away last year. Her final instruction to me was to look after our four beautiful children and continue the journey we started together. I do so today because, beyond my identity as a Muslim, a Bedouin, a Palestinian and an Israeli, I am first and foremost a human being: a father, a husband and a servant of God.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group released its annual civil rights report, which documents incidents reported to CAIR and an analysis of the state of American Muslim civil rights.                 “The new data confirms our worst suspicions: what we are witnessing since October 2023 is nothing short of the largest wave of anti-Muslim hate seen in this country in more than a decade,” Farah Afify, the report’s co-author and CAIR research and advocacy coordinator, said in a statement to CNN.     Related articleCAIR received an ‘unprecedented’ 1,283 reports of anti-Arab and Islamophobic bias in the last month, new data shows             The number of complaints last year had a significant jump – 56% – from 2022, when the group said it received 5,156.                 That year, however, was an aberration because it showed a significant drop in reports – the only such dip in the past 28 years. In 2021, for instance, the number of incidents reported was 6,720.                 CAIR noted the main factor behind the increase in bias complaints was the Israel-Hamas war, which began in October. Just over 44% of the total 2023 complaints were reported in the last three months of the year, the group said.                 CAIR said its local chapters and headquarters record incidents of bias using 20 different categories.  Overall, the top category in 2023 was complaints of immigration and asylum cases with 1,637 reports, followed by 1,201 reports of employment discrimination and 688 complaints of discrimination linked to education settings but excluding instances of bullying or sports discrimination, according to the new data.                 Complaints were, however, broadly spread among the categories. “There are other types of cases that help paint a fuller picture of the experience of being a Muslim in the US,” Corey Saylor, CAIR’s research and advocacy director and one of the report’s authors, told CNN.                 Saylor cited discrimination by financial institutions, a case of a court-appointed attorney making Islamophobic or racist social media posts, and law enforcement approaching people for being Muslim, their origin or speaking a language other than English.                 The full breakdown of complaints made to CAIR and shared with CNN shows there were complaints tracked last year that fell under each of the categories used by the group. In addition to several types of discrimination, other examples include bullying, hate crimes or incidents, placement on the terror watchlist and encounters with law enforcement.                 But the wave of Islamophobia in the last months of the year had a significant impact on the workplace and education settings.     Related articleReports of antisemitism, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias continue to surge across the US, new data shows             “Employers, universities, and schools were among the primary actors suppressing free speech by those who sought to vocally oppose Israel’s genocidal onslaught on Gaza and call attention to Palestinian human rights, particularly Muslims, Arabs, and Palestinians,” the authors wrote in the report.                 In the final months of 2023, there were 662 complaints of employment discrimination, 472 of hate crimes and incidents, and 448 of education discrimination, the data shows.                 The report’s findings “represent the reality on the ground for Muslims, Arabs, and Palestinians, who have been subjected to Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian rhetoric in virtually every sector of American society for vocalizing their support of Palestinian human rights,” Afify said.                 “We suspect that, until we see our political leaders come out forcefully against Islamophobia and with substantive support for a permanent and immediate ceasefire in Gaza, we will continue to see horrifying attacks on American Muslim communities well into 2024.”                 The group said the wave of Islamophobic bias surpassed the one tracked by CAIR following the implementation of the Trump administration’s travel ban on seven Muslim-majority nations in 2017, which saw a 32% jump over the previous year.                 “These findings demonstrate that, even amid moments of perceived progress, Islamophobia persists as an underlying force that is always capable of reemerging to significantly impact the lives of Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim,” the report’s authors wrote.                 In its report, CAIR included a series of recommendations. The group urged public officials and corporate and education leaders who comment on the events in Israel and Palestine to give “equal weight and attention” to “Palestinian suffering.”                 CAIR urged Congress to enhance anti-doxxing laws that limit the dissemination of personally identifying information on the internet. It says students and employees who expressed support for Palestinians in Gaza have been subjected to such intimidation in recent months.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

But last week’s attack on a Moscow concert hall reminded the world of the enduring danger of Islamist terrorism and the ambitions of what is known as IS Khorasan (ISIS-K) far beyond its camps in the mountains of Afghanistan.                 Analysts believe the group has a growing focus on Europe – and point to events such as this year’s Paris Olympics as potential targets.                 ISIS claimed responsibility for the Moscow attack. The fact that Tajik nationals were allegedly involved indicates ISIS-K was responsible; the group draws many members from central Asia and has a record of previous plots in Russia. US officials have also said there is evidence ISIS-K carried out the attack.                 ISIS-K was created nine years ago as an autonomous ‘province’ of the Islamic State, and despite many enemies has survived and proved itself capable of launching attacks in Pakistan, Iran and central Asia. Before the Crocus City attack, it had planned others in Europe and Russia. The commander of US Central Command, Gen. Erik Kurilla, assessed recently that ISIS-K “retains the capability and the will to attack US and Western interests abroad in as little as six months with little to no warning.”                 UN experts and others – including the Russian security services – estimate the strength of ISIS-K at between 4,000 and 6,000 fighters. Sanaullah Ghafari became the group’s leader in 2020 and, despite occasional reports of his demise, terrorism analysts believe he remains an effective leader.                 Both the Taliban and the United States have sought – though not in concert – to expunge ISIS-K from its safe havens in eastern Afghanistan. But a recent analysis in Sentinel, the journal of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, said it “remains a resilient organization, capable of adapting to changing dynamics and evolving to survive difficult circumstances.”                 Edmund Fitton-Brown, a senior adviser to the New York-based Counter Extremism Project, told CNN that ISIS-K “has the desire and a growing ability to project beyond Afghanistan and carry out regional attacks” in Pakistan, Iran and central Asia, bolstered by a robust media output in Tajik, Uzbek and Russian. Fitton-Brown said that in Afghanistan the Taliban’s “Pashto chauvinism has helped ISIS-K recruit from other Afghan ethnic groups.”                 ISIS-K’s most infamous attack until now was the suicide bombing at Kabul airport in 2021 that killed nearly 200 people, including 13 US soldiers guarding the airport.                 It has continued a campaign of suicide bombings and assassinations against the Taliban, which it regards as insufficiently radical and beholden to outside powers. Just last week, an ISIS-K suicide bomber detonated his explosive belt among Taliban militia in the Afghan city of Kandahar, inflicting dozens of casualties, according to local accounts.     Related articleRussia’s security services knew of ISIS threat before concert attack, new evidence from investigative body suggests             But ISIS-K has also expanded its orbit. Amira Jadoon, who has written a book about the group, said that over the last three years ISIS-K “has grown more ambitious and aggressive in its efforts to gain notoriety and relevance across South and Central Asia, launching its most aggressive multilingual propaganda campaign and expanding the types of attacks it conducts.”                 “It has effectively fused a wide range of regional grievances into its global jihadist agenda,” Jadoon told CNN.                 Last year the group executed a devastating bombing against an election rally in Baujur, Pakistan, in which more than 60 people were killed. It has also established a foothold in the restive Pakistani province of Baluchistan bordering Iran.                 In January, ISIS claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings in the Iranian city of Kerman, killing 90 people and injured more than 200. Jadoon, an associate professor at Clemson University, said that given its “proximity to the attacks, its highly sectarian attack strategy, and its diverse membership base, it is highly likely that ISK [as the group is also called] played a role in the Kerman attack.”                 ISIS-K has ambitions far beyond south Asia, aiming to target Russia, western Europe and even the United States. European security agencies are paying heightened attention to the threat, even if ISIS-K’s capabilities are yet to match its ambitions.                 Hans-Jakob Schindler, senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, notes that in July last year seven men were arrested in Germany suspected of planning high-profile attacks and being in contact with ISIS-K planners. All the suspects were from central Asia.                 This month, two Afghan citizens were detained in Germany, accused of making “concrete preparations” to attack Sweden’s parliament in retaliation for a spate of Koran burnings in the country. One had joined ISIS-K last year, prosecutors asserted, and their plans were made “in close consultation with” ISIS-K operatives.                 Christine Abizaid, director of the US National Counterterrorism Center, told Congress last autumn that so far “ISIS-Khorasan has relied primarily on inexperienced operatives in Europe to try to advance attacks in its name.”                 Fitton-Brown – former coordinator of UN sanctions and threat assessment regarding ISIS, al Qaeda and the Taliban – agreed that so far the threat in Europe has been “naïve and embryonic” but warned that ISIS-K “has plugged into the central Asian diaspora, primarily in Russia and Turkey and to some extent in Germany.”                 He regards the Moscow attack as a “breakthrough success” for the group, demonstrating a level of planning not previously seen beyond south Asia. ISIS claimed that the Crocus City Hall had been intensively reconnoitered.                 A leaked US Defense Department assessment last year noted that “ISIS has been developing a cost-effective model for external operations that relies on resources from outside Afghanistan, operatives in target countries, and extensive facilitation networks.”                 Following the Moscow attack, France – which hosts the Olympics this year – raised the terrorist threat level to the maximum. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said thousands more soldiers were ready to boost its counter-terrorism force, adding: “The Islamist threat is real…We are constantly preparing for all scenarios.”                 Fitton-Brown does not see that as alarmist. “I hope I’m wrong,” he told CNN, “but I’m very worried about the Paris Olympics.” He described a “perfect storm” of ISIS-K’s growing reach, ambient rage among radicalized individuals at the situation in Gaza and the release of former jihadis from European jails after serving their sentences.                 Jadoon said the risk of ISIS-K’s “brand resonating with individual sympathizers in Western countries cannot be overlooked.” She explained that as militants see it as “an inspirational and growing force, it may attract individuals from Western nations who are drawn to its ideology. This could lead to attempts by individuals to travel to conflict zones to join its ranks or carry out attacks in their home countries on behalf of the group.”                 Russia may be particularly vulnerable to ISIS-K. Ten years ago, then ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi denounced “the crusaders, their allies, and with them the rest of the nations and religions of kufr (infidel), all being led by America and Russia.”                 A year later, ISIS’ franchise in Sinai claimed responsibility for the bomb that brought down a Russian charter jet flying from Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg, killing all 224 people onboard.                 ISIS’ loathing of Vladimir Putin stems from the Russian role in Syria in support of the Assad regime and the brutal Chechen wars in the early years of the century. Russia’s support for authoritarian regimes in central Asia – which ISIS-K has described as Russia’s “puppets” – has deepened the animus.                 ISIS-K has also derided the Taliban for “befriending Russians, the murderers of Chechen Muslims.” In 2022, an ISIS-K suicide bomber attacked the Russian embassy in Kabul, killing two employees.                 Now it’s clear that the group is trying to establish itself inside Russia. Earlier this month, the Russian security service – the FSB – said it had that killed two ISIS-K operatives in the region of Kaluga who were planning an attack on a Moscow synagogue.                 Jadoon told CNN that “geographic proximity, the inclusion of Central Asian fighters within its ranks, and its determined regional and global propaganda strategy indicates that IS-K likely played a role in this attack, possibly by deploying its own affiliated militants or by providing financial support or training to the perpetrators.”                 Fitton-Brown regards Russia as extremely vulnerable to further attacks, with its security services preoccupied by Ukraine and a vast pool of migrant workers from central Asia, at least some of whom have likely been radicalized. All those arrested since the Crocus City attack are Tajik.                 Several previous ISIS-inspired or claimed attacks in Russia have involved Tajik, Uzbek or Kyrgyz nationals. In 2017 an Uzbek national carried out a suicide bombing on the St Petersburg metro, killing 15.                 Russia’s vulnerability may be heightened by easy travel from Turkey. Turkish security sources confirmed to CNN that two of the alleged Crocus City attackers spent time in Istanbul before flying back to Russia at the beginning of March, a factor that Fitton-Brown regards as “highly significant” given the presence of Tajik migrant workers in Turkey. One Tajik national, Shamil Hukumatov, who according to the UN was one of the group’s “most active propagandists and high-ranking recruiters,” was arrested in Turkey last year.                 The attitude of the Russian government, both pre- and post- the Moscow attack, may not help it confront the threat. After the US warned in early March of the possibility of terror attacks at “large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts,” Putin lambasted “provocative statements by a number of official Western structures…All this resembles blatant blackmail and an intention to sow fear and destabilize our society.”                 Schindler at the Counter Extremism Project said that even if the FSB were aware of such plots, protective deployment of security forces at concerts would have smacked of contradicting the Kremlin - and would therefore have been unwise.                 After the attack, Putin said it was carried out “by the hands of radical Islamists,” but was sponsored elsewhere, suggesting Ukraine had been involved, something strenuously denied by Kyiv and Washington. And according to the director of the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, three countries were behind the terrorist attack: the US, UK and Ukraine.                 The narrative from Moscow is that even if ISIS-K or individuals inspired by it step up their campaign in Russia, they’ll be seen as puppets of darker forces. That may distort intelligence-gathering.                 For ISIS-K, the Moscow attack is a coup. Rita Katz, executive director of SITE Intelligence, said: “ISIS’ global support rests in no small part on its image as a capable organization, and this devastating massacre in Russia will only feed into that image.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Russian authorities have accused four men from the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan of being behind the attack, which left at least 137 people dead and more than 100 injured. The suspects, who are charged with committing a terrorist act and face possible life imprisonment, have been remanded into pre-trial detention through May 22 after appearing in court in Moscow on Sunday.                 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that “radical Islamists” carried out the assault, but also claimed without proof that a “window” had been prepared for the attackers to escape to Ukraine. Kyiv has denied the allegations.                 US officials have tied the attack to ISIS-K, an affiliate that operates in central Asia, which has become one of the region’s most brutal and feared terror groups.                 Since November, the US has received a stream of intelligence that ISIS-K was determined to mount an attack in Russia, sources told CNN, and passed those warnings on to Moscow. US Vice President Kamala Harris said Sunday that “what we know to be the case is that ISIS-K is actually, by all accounts responsible for what happened.”                 Here’s what we know about ISIS-K.             ISIS-K was formed in 2015 and has been active in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. It is a branch of ISIS, the terror group that emerged in Syria and Iraq and, at its peak, controlled a huge stretch of territory.                 Five years since the fall of ISIS’ self-proclaimed caliphate across Iraq and Syria, the group has morphed into a terror network with cells spread around the world, including in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.                 The connection between ISIS-K and its apparent parent group is not entirely clear. The affiliates share an ideology and tactics, but the depth of their relationship – such as the chain of command and control – has never been fully established.                 By 2018, ISIS-K was ranked the world’s fourth-deadliest terror group, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, which monitors global terrorism.                 The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, and the withdrawal of US troops from the country, thrust ISIS-K into the global spotlight – especially after the group orchestrated a deadly bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 US military personnel and 170 Afghans.                 It was ISIS-K’s most globally consequential action to date and drew a promise of retribution from US President Joe Biden.                 The United Nations estimated in 2021 that the group has up to 2,200 core fighters based in Afghanistan’s Kunar and Nangarhar provinces.                 Like its parent organization, ISIS-K aims to create a “pure Islamic state,” according to CSIS – describing the group’s vision of a “global, transnational caliphate” governed by Sharia law.                 ISIS-K has a mutual hatred of the Taliban and attracts those with views even more radical than the Islamist group that rules Afghanistan. It refuses to acknowledge the Taliban as a legitimate Islamic leader because it relies on a narrow base “instead of committing to a universal Islamic jihad,” according to CSIS.                 As such, ISIS-K’s recent attacks have largely been aimed at the Taliban and other symbolic targets, as well as at Afghanistan’s Shia Muslim minorities, in particular the ethnic Hazaras.                 The group’s hatred of the West, including the United States, Britain and Europe, also features prominently in their agenda – as does its enmity toward Russia.                 ISIS has a longstanding animosity against Russia and Putin, several experts told CNN.                 “Russia has been at the top or near the top of the list of ISIS for many years,” said Daniel Byman, director of Georgetown University’s security studies program. He pointed to Moscow’s crucial role in the Syrian civil war, when it intervened in support of the Syrian government and against ISIS.                 ISIS-K has also criticized the Taliban for being “too close to Russia,” Byman added.                 There are other historical grievances, too. ISIS propaganda has long targeted Russia for its brutal tactics in the various Chechen wars, and its scorched-earth policies in the Caucasus affecting Eastern European and Eurasian Muslims, according to John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst.     Related cardWhat we know about the four suspects in the Moscow concert hall attack             In 2022, ISIS-K claimed responsibility for a suicide blast near Russia’s embassy in Kabul, which killed six people, including two consular staff.                 Over the past month, Russia has thwarted several ISIS-related incidents, according to state-run news agency RIA Novosti. At least four incidents in March alone have been reported across Russia that local authorities said involved people connected to ISIS, RIA reported.                 Russian state media reported on March 7 that the FSB, Russia’s security service, prevented an ISIS attack on a synagogue in Moscow, according to Reuters. The ISIS attackers were killed in a gunfight, the reports said.                 To date, the majority of ISIS-K’s most devastating attacks have been in Afghanistan and Pakistan – the Kabul airport blast being a prominent example.                 Others include a May 2020 attack on a Kabul maternity ward that killed 24 people and an attack on Kabul University in November 2020 that killed 22, according to CSIS. ISIS-K was also believed to be behind a horrific car bombing outside a girls’ high school in May 2021 that killed at least 85 people.                 The group was particularly active during its peak around 2018 – when an ISIS-K suicide bomber killed 128 people at an election rally in Mastung, Pakistan, one of the bloodiest attacks anywhere in the world that year.                 While it’s no longer as strong as it was in 2018, ISIS-K continues to plan attacks in Afghanistan. It is the most active terror group in the country, responsible for 73 deaths in 2023, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace.                 The Kabul airport attack had raised global concerns that ISIS-K could pose a major threat across the region and beyond.             In March 2023, the head of the US Central Command told lawmakers that ISIS-K was becoming more emboldened, and that Europe or Asia were more likely targets for terrorist attacks originating in Afghanistan than the US.                 In a 2023 threat assessment report by US intelligence agencies, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said ISIS-K “almost certainly retains the intent to conduct operations in the West and will continue efforts to attack outside Afghanistan.”                 And earlier this year, the UN Security Council warned in a report that ISIS-K was planning or conducting “operational plots” in Europe. Seven people linked to the group were arrested in Germany last year while planning for “high-impact terrorist attacks,” including obtaining weapons and possible targets, the council said.     Related videoRussia expert explains why Putin treated US warning about possible terror attack as ‘blackmail’             It is not the first time that ISIS has struck a concert venue. In November 2015, ISIS gunmen attacked the Bataclan theater in Paris – part of an assault that hit other targets in the city – killing at least 130 people. In May 2017, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena, England, that killed 22 people. ISIS has also inspired terrorists in the US, including the gunman who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 in what was then the most lethal terrorist attack in the US since 9/11.                 Earlier this month, the US government had information about a planned terrorist attack in Moscow – potentially targeting large gatherings, to include concerts – which prompted the State Department to issue a public advisory to Americans in Russia. The US also shared this information with Russian authorities.                 The intelligence that Washington had been getting since November was “fairly specific” and the US intelligence community warned Russia, but it’s not clear if this is directly tied to the March 7 warning by the US embassy in Moscow.                 Putin rejected the US embassy warnings about terror attacks as “provocative” in a speech to the FSB, saying they “resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society.”       CNN’s Rob Picheta, Eliza Mackintosh, Ehsan Popalzai, Antonio Jarne, Lou Robinson, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Mariya Knight, Anna Chernova and Darya Tarasova contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

He is the author of “The Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             If ISIS was indeed responsible for the attack Friday at a Moscow-area concert venue that killed at least 133 people, it would suggest that, unfortunately, the terror group is making something of a comeback.                 ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack; a US official told CNN the US has no reason to doubt it.                 Back in its heyday of 2014 and 2015, ISIS had controlled territory in Iraq and Syria around the size of the United Kingdom and a population of millions of people. During that period, the group also carried out a number of terrorist plots in Europe, including an attack in Paris that killed 130 people in 2015. ISIS had also inspired terrorists in the US, including the gunman who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 in what was then the most lethal terrorist attack in the US since 9/11.     Related articleOpinion: Vladimir Putin’s sham election             But between 2017 and 2018, ISIS lost its so-called geographical “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria, and it has since devolved into a loosely allied group of ISIS affiliates in Africa and Asia with seemingly scant capabilities to carry out large-scale attacks elsewhere.                 One of the most virulent affiliates is ISIS-K in Afghanistan, which killed 13 American service members and some 170 Afghan civilians at Kabul Airport as the Biden administration pulled all US troops from Afghanistan in August 2021.                 Yet, the understanding at the time was that ISIS affiliates in Afghanistan and certain African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo or Somalia were not capable of carrying out major international attacks. But then came a large-scale terrorist attack in Iran in January that killed 84 people at a memorial service commemorating General Qasem Soleimani, one of the most powerful military leaders in Iran who had been killed by a US drone strike in 2020. Through that attack, ISIS-K showed that the group, which is very anti-Shia, could target a hostile state like predominantly Shia Iran.                 In March alone, a Russian state news agency said the country had thwarted multiple ISIS-related incidents, including a plan to attack a synagogue in Moscow.     Related articleOpinion: What Biden needs to know about Rafah             The US embassy in Russia also said on March 7 that it was “monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow,” including concerts. According to a US National Security Council spokesperson, “The US Government also shared this information with Russian authorities in accordance with its longstanding ‘duty to warn’ policy.” But Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the US’ warning as “provocative,” saying, “These actions resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society.”                 Taken together, the fact that Russian authorities had detected a number of ISIS-related plots earlier this month and that US authorities were warning of an attack at the same time indicates that there was an active terrorist threat in Moscow from ISIS that was known not only to the US but also to the Russians.                 But Russian President Vladimir Putin linked the suspects in Friday’s attack to Ukraine during a five-minute address on Saturday. State news agencies said that authorities arrested the four men suspected of attacking the Moscow-area concert venue while they were trying to cross the border into Ukraine, and that they “had relevant contacts on the Ukrainian side,” according to the FSB.                 Ukraine has emphatically denied any role in the attack, and both Ukrainian and American officials expressed concerns that Putin’s comments may be used to justify an escalation in the ongoing war.                 ISIS-K certainly has the capability and motive to attack Russia. When it comes to motive, the Russian support for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, which helped him remain in power during the Syrian civil war, certainly comes to mind. For ISIS, Assad is a mortal enemy, both because he is a member of a Shia sect and because he has systematically killed Sunnis in Syria. Also, historically, Russia has brutally repressed Muslim minorities like the Chechens. As for capability, the ISIS-K attack in Iran earlier this year demonstrated that the group could carry out a large-scale attack outside of its home base in Afghanistan.                 What we do know is that Putin made a glaring mistake by denouncing the US’ warning. And if ISIS-K did attack the concert hall, the Biden administration would have to ask itself some serious questions about whether the decision to pull all American troops out of Afghanistan allowed ISIS to regroup there with the capability to carry out large-scale attacks in other countries. If that were the case, that would be a blow for the Biden administration.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/10/us/atheism-beliefs-explained-cec/index.html,Why people are reluctant to call themselves atheists,"Many people are hesitant to identify as atheists because of social stigma they may face, making it hard to pinpoint connections and differences among this group.","Mar 10, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Harmeet Kaur,International,"In September, standing before a room full of Christian conservatives, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made a bold pronouncement: “I don’t know how you could be a leader without having faith in God.”                 Being an atheist is still a political liability in the US — though it’s not as bad as DeSantis would have you think. While a 2020 Gallup poll found that six in 10 people would vote for a well-qualified atheist presidential candidate, fewer people said they would be willing to vote for an atheist than a candidate who was gay, lesbian or Muslim. Only socialists ranked lower among poll respondents.                 Though the share of Americans who say they don’t believe in a higher power has increased in the past decade, some people still view atheists negatively. A 2017 study found that people believe atheists are more likely to be serial killers than believers, even though federal data suggests they are far less likely to commit crimes than religious people.                 Just like people of faith, not all atheists believe the same things. Aside from their lack of belief in a higher power ﻿or powers, atheists vary widely in their answers to spiritual and existential questions.                 Given the misconceptions surrounding this group, many people are reluctant to say that they’re atheists — which means it’s hard to pinpoint connections and differences among their numbers.                 An atheist is someone “who does not believe in the existence of a god or any gods,” according to Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary.                 Because atheists are defined by what they don’t believe, it’s difficult to generalize what they do believe. In the words of comedian and outspoken atheist Ricky Gervais on X, “Saying ‘Atheism is a belief system’ is like saying ‘not going skiing, is a hobby.’”                 Some atheists, like evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and neuroscientist Sam Harris, are steadfast in their rejection of organized religion. Others are skeptical or apathetic when it comes to philosophical questions of whether a god exists.                 Because of the social stigma atheists may face in the US and around the world, some people have complicated feelings about the term, said Nick Fish, president of the organization American Atheists. Plenty of people who fit the definition of an atheist don’t self-identify as such, instead preferring less fraught terms such as agnostic, humanist or freethinker, he added.                 Then there are the cultural Catholics, the non-practicing Jews, the secular Muslims — people who don’t necessarily believe in a deity but identify with a particular faith because of their family upbringing, ethnicity or culture.                 “A simple dictionary definition doesn’t necessarily encapsulate people’s self identity, and people use a variety of terms even when ultimately they believe the same thing,” Fish said.                 Atheists also have different interpretations of what it means to not believe. While nearly all self-described atheists don’t believe in the God described in the Judeo-Christian Bible, 23% do believe in God or some other higher power or spiritual force in the universe, according to a Pew Research Center report published in January.                 Belief for atheists goes deeper than the question of whether there is a higher power.                 Notably, a fifth of self-described atheists consider themselves spiritual, Pew’s recent survey on the religious “nones” found. The report contains other surprising insights, too: Most atheists say the natural world is all there is, but nearly a quarter believe there’s something spiritual beyond our present environment. About a third believe animals other than humans can have spirits or spiritual energies, and a slightly smaller share believe spiritual energies can be found in parts of nature, like mountains, trees or rivers. Just under one in five atheists believe cemeteries or memorial sites can have spiritual energies, while fewer than one in 10 say the same about objects such as crystals. Nearly a third of atheists believe humans have souls or spirits in addition to their physical body.                 These responses might seem confusing or contradictory, but atheism and spirituality aren’t necessarily at odds. Though some people associate spirituality with a connection to a god, for others it can mean feeling connected to other people or to something else bigger than oneself.                 Indeed, there are atheists who believe in cosmic interconnectedness or in transcendent moments of wonder without considering themselves religious. Long distance swimmer and self-proclaimed atheist Diana Nyad discussed this distinction in a 2013 interview with Oprah.                 “I’m an atheist who’s in awe,” she said. “I think you can be an atheist who doesn’t believe in an overarching being who created all of this and sees over it. But there’s spirituality because we human beings, and we animals and maybe even we plants — but certainly the ocean and the moon and the stars — we all live with something that is cherished and we feel the treasure of it.”              It’s hard to know just how many atheists there are when some people are reluctant to claim the label.                 While a 2018 Pew survey found that 10% of US adults say they don’t believe in any higher power or spiritual force, only about 4% of US adults identify as atheists. A 2022 Gallup poll puts the number of nonbelievers higher, with 17% of Americans saying they don’t believe in God.                 Some scholars, however, consider these numbers underestimates — an analysis by psychologists Will Gervais and Maxine B. Najle suggests the true count is closer to 26%. Gervais points to Cold War era associations of atheists as “godless communists,” as well as Christianity’s enduring influence on American culture, as some reasons people may be hesitant to identify as nonbelievers.                 “The term atheist has attracted some unsavory connotations,” he added. “Also, religion (in the US) is politically and socially rewarded, so people might be reluctant to out themselves as an atheist.”                 It’s also worth noting that atheism — at least in the West — is often defined in relation to monotheistic traditions, namely the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. As the organization American Atheists notes on its website, older dictionaries previously defined atheism as a “belief that there is no God” — the singular, proper noun typically used by Christians and some Jews. Even Gallup’s 2022 poll asked about belief in “God.”                 Framing atheism in these terms doesn’t capture a range of other beliefs that atheists could conceivably hold. Strands of atheist thought can be found in non-theistic traditions such as Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, as well cultures around the world that practice animism.                 There are all kinds of labels to describe nonbelievers. While atheism and agnosticism are among the most common, there are some differences between those terms.                 Though the two are often considered distinct worldviews, technically, they aren’t mutually exclusive. Rather, the terms atheism and agnosticism answer different questions, Nick Fish of American Atheists said. Atheism answers whether a person believes in a god or gods, and agnosticism answers whether it is possible to know if a supreme being exists.                 But again, dictionary definitions prove limiting here. In reality, many people think of agnosticism as a less stringent form of atheism.                 “If you spend a bit of time digging in, I think (many agnostics) will ultimately say, ‘I don’t believe in a God but I’m not sure, so I’m agnostic,’” Fish said.                 Jocelyn Williamson, co-founder of the Central Florida Freethought Community, doesn’t believe in a higher power but says she can’t be certain. Technically, that fits the definition of an agnostic atheist. But she said she typically tells people who ask about her religious beliefs that she’s a secular humanist.                 “Most people don’t know what that means, and then I can actually have a conversation,” Williamson said. “There’s too many preconceived notions if I just say I’m an atheist.”                 The term atheist only conveys what she doesn’t believe in, Williamson said. The term humanist, meanwhile, signals that she’s motivated by compassion for others and that she believes societal decision-making should be grounded in reason and science.                 One of the most common misconceptions about atheists is that they lack morals that others typically attribute to religion.                 In a 2019 Pew survey, 44% of US residents said belief in God was necessary to be moral and have good values — in other countries, that share is much higher.                 Williamson is all too familiar with such notions. When she was first getting to know faith leaders in her state, through her work with the Central Florida Freethought Community, she recalls a clergy member asking her what stops her from killing other people if she doesn’t believe in a higher power.                 “I had always thought that was a meme, a trope,” she said. “I didn’t think anybody actually believed that.”                 In fact, various studies suggest that atheists are no more immoral than religious people. They’re also just as likely to participate in civic life as those who are affiliated with a religion and just as likely to engage in community service, according to Pew’s recent survey of religious “nones.”             Atheists also get stereotyped as angry people who vehemently oppose religion and its followers. Like any other population, though, they aren’t a monolith. Williamson, for example, is part of the Interfaith Council of Central Florida and works with faith leaders toward common goals. Plenty of nonbelievers volunteer with religious organizations out of a desire to serve their communities, she added — her father worked as a local director for the Christian nonprofit Habitat for Humanity despite not being religious.                 Another misconception about atheists is that they’re certain or unwavering in their beliefs, Fish said. People often tell him that they aren’t sure on the big existential questions, and therefore can’t be atheists. But many atheists are figuring it all out, too.                 “Just because we don’t believe in a god doesn’t mean that we have all the answers to everything else,” he said. “In fact, for many, for most of us, it’s the opposite. We recognize that we don’t.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Such violations and crimes include “extrajudicial and unlawful killings and murder, unnecessary and disproportionate use of force, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, torture, rape, enforced disappearances, and gender persecution,” the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a press release Friday.                 It cited a report by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran, a task force set up by the UN Human Rights Council to look at claims of deteriorating human rights conditions in Iran.                 The report said these violations came about in the context of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests sparked by the death of 22-year-old Iranian-Kurdish woman Jina Mahsa Amini in September 2022 after she was arrested for allegedly not observing Iran’s mandatory hijab law.     Related articleIran announces record low election turnout despite calls on voters to participate             She became the face of women calling for greater rights and freedoms curtailed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Protests erupted across Iran again in September last year on the first anniversary of her death.                 The mission said it found that physical violence while in custody of the morality police, a unit dedicated to enforcing strict dress codes for women, such as wearing the compulsory headscarf, led to Mahsa Amini’s “unlawful death.”                 “Rather than investigating this unlawful death promptly, effectively, and thoroughly – as required under international human rights law – the government actively obfuscated the truth, and denied justice,” the UN press release read.                 In a government crackdown against the country-wide protests, Iran mobilized “the entire security apparatus of the state to repress” protesters, the UN Office said, adding that as many as 551 protesters are thought to have been killed by security forces, among them at least 49 women and 68 children.                 The UN Fact-Finding Mission found evidence that forces used “unnecessary and disproportionate force” resulting in “unlawful killing and injuries of protesters,” the UN Office said, citing “a pattern of extensive injuries to protesters’ eyes,” which CNN had previously reported on.              A CNN report in November 2022 also found that Iran’s security forces used rape to quell protests in the country.                 The UN report found that state authorities at the highest levels “encouraged, sanctioned and endorsed human rights violations through statements justifying the acts and conduct of the security forces.”                 Authorities in Iran have also obstructed repatriation efforts of victims and their families, the UN said the mission found, adding that victims face a justice system lacking “independence, transparency and accountability.”                 Chair of the Fact-Finding Mission Sara Hossain urged Iran’s government to stop repressing peaceful protesters, particularly women and girls.                 “These acts form part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in Iran, namely against women, girls, boys and men who have demanded freedom, equality, dignity and accountability,” she said, according to the OHCHR.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The twin demolitions in Uttarakhand state and Delhi came just weeks after Modi inaugurated the controversial Ram Mandir, a temple built on the foundations of a centuries-old mosque that was torn down by hardline Hindu crowds in the early 1990s.                 That ceremony marked a seismic shift away from modern India’s secular founding principles and was hailed by Hindu nationalists as a crowning moment in their decades-long campaign to reshape the nation.                 Deadly violence erupted in Uttarakhand’s Haldwani city last week, after government officials, accompanied by police, razed a mosque and madrassa (an Islamic school), citing “illegal encroachment.”                 But advocates working on behalf of the Muslim community point to court documents, seen by CNN, that show no such order had been given.                 The demolitions drew incensed residents onto the streets and at least six people have been killed in clashes with police. Authorities have imposed curfews, but scared Muslim families told CNN they just want to leave. About a third of Haldwani’s 220,000 people are Muslim, according to the most recent census from 2011.                 Pushkar Dhami, Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, said his government will take strict action against “rioters and miscreants.”                 “Every rioter who indulged in arson and stone pelting is being identified, no miscreant who disturbs harmony and peace will be spared,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.                 The clashes come one week after another madrassa, a centuries-old mosque, a Sufi shrine and dozens of Muslim graves were demolished by government authorities in Delhi, also for alleged “illegal encroachment,” prompting anger and outrage in the Indian capital.     Related articleModi’s ‘divine India’ vision threatens to marginalize millions             Analysts say these incidents underscore an uncomfortable reality in the world’s largest democracy and fear that inter-religious tensions will increase as Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continue to push their populist, yet divisive, policies in the lead up to a nationwide election in just a few months’ time.                 The image of India that Modi wants to project is one of a confident, vibrant, and modern superpower. But many of the country’s 230 million Muslims say they are being sidelined and marginalized in the world’s largest democracy.                 “This is the worst possible time to be a Muslim in India,” said author Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, adding that it has “become normal to demolish mosques in India.”                 “The stigmatization of Muslims is an old story, seen as the new normal. No longer does it shock people.”                 CNN has reached out to the BJP but is yet to receive a response.                 The mosque demolitions come against a backdrop of increased religious polarization and accusations that the BJP is building a Hindu-first state in what is constitutionally meant to be a secular country.                 They follow the opening of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a 16th century mosque that was destroyed by hardline Hindus some 30 years ago, setting off a wave of deadly sectarian violence not seen in India since its bloody 1947 partition.                 Modi presided over a lavish consecration ceremony, where he played the role of a priest and hailed the beginning of a “new divine India.” But his vision is a far cry from the ideas of the modern country’s founding fathers, analysts say.                 And during his decade in power, Modi’s BJP has isolated millions among India’s sizable minorities, analysts say.                 Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform India’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he and his party also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India is inherently a land meant for Hindus.                 About 80% of India’s 1.4 billion people are Hindu, but the country is home to a diverse group of religions and faiths, including Sikhs, Buddhists and one of the world’s largest Muslim populations of some 230 million.                 When he stood for reelection in 2019, Modi’s Hindutva policies became more brazen, according to analysts.                 A few months after winning, he announced he was stripping the statehood of India’s only Muslim-majority territory, Jammu and Kashmir, and turning it into two union territories while bringing it under federal control.     Related articleIndia’s Modi inaugurates Abu Dhabi’s first Hindu temple             And earlier this month, the BJP-ruled state of Uttarakhand became the first in independent India to pass the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a set of contentious common laws that have been criticized by some minority groups for trying to replace their personal religious laws.                 In India, a country of diverse faiths, religious groups follow their own laws for matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. But these have long been considered by some to be regressive, including by many more secular figures.                 The BJP’s attempt to reform these religious laws is seen by some as a welcome move, but critics fear the government’s Hindu nationalist policies could unduly influence the legislation.                 Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim opposition lawmaker, criticized the law, saying it forces Muslims to follow a different religion.                 “I have a right to practice my religion and culture, this Bill forces me to follow a different religion and culture,” he wrote on X. “In our religion, inheritance and marriage are part of religious practice.”                 Earlier this month, a report from Amnesty International said between April and June 2022, a total of 128 properties largely belonging to Muslims across five states were bulldozed by government authorities.                 “The demolitions adversely impacted at least 617 people, including men, women, and children, either rendering them homeless or deprived of their sole livelihood,” the report said.                 Author Mukhopadhyay added: “It is a 360 degree Islamophobic campaign that is going on in every sphere of life.”                 A sense of despair among many Muslims lingers in Delhi’s Mehrauli district, where government authorities razed the 600-year-old Akhondji Mosque to the ground late last month.                 Late last month, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) – the governing body operating under India’s ruling BJP – bulldozed the structure, alleging “illegal encroachment.”                 But Mohammed Zakir Hussain, the mosque’s 40-year-old cleric, says the building was under the control of the city’s Waqf Board, a statutory body established to protect Islamic affairs, and should never have been destroyed.                 He felt “helpless” as he pleaded with authorities to stop tearing the building to the ground, he said.                 The DDA’s lawyer Sanjay Katyal told the Delhi High Court that the body had bought the land for planned development.The case is expected to be heard again later this month.                 Delhi, a metropolis of more than 20 million people, has seen rapid urbanization over the past few decades, with a vast, modern metro system, and a burgeoning middle class that has come to symbolize India’s economic growth.                 But between its meandering roads stand centuries-old monuments and medieval ruins that put the Indian capital on a par with the world’s great ancient cities, historians say.                 Historian Rana Safvi said the architecture of the Akhondji Mosque was typical of the Sultanate era, which flourished in India between 1192 and 1526. Its arched roof and pillars of grey stone had stood for some 600 years before it was torn to the ground.                 “It is like erasing a part of Indian history,” Safvi said. “It is a loss of a mosque, a safe place for one to congregate to pray, especially at a time when namaz in the open or in public areas is frowned upon.”                 And along with the mosque, authorities also broke down the Islamic school that housed dozens of children, including orphans, and destroyed an old graveyard that stood beside it.                 Mohammad Arif, 22, whose father, grandmother and grandfather’s graves are among those ruined, said he arrives at the site every day to try and restore what’s left of it.                 “I come here every day to ask (the guards) to let me go inside and put mud to restore their graves at least. They do not allow it,” he said.                 Mohammad Aman, 32, mourned the deepening divide between Hindus and Muslims.                 “(The government) rationalizes everything by blaming Mughal emperors,” he said, referring to India’s ancient Islamic rulers. “But you’re doing the same thing now. What is the difference between you and him then?”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Now it’s far too little and far too late, writes Haroon Moghul.","Feb 5, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"Editor’s Note: Haroon Moghul is the author of “Two Billion Caliphs: A Vision of a Muslim Future.” An academic, educator and leadership consultant, he lives in Cincinnati. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             In a different world, President Joe Biden’s decision Thursday to sanction certain Israeli settlers involved in violence against West Bank Palestinians might be meaningful. In the world we live in, confronting the shocking violence by the Israel Defense Forces in its war on Gaza that Biden has enabled, empowered and endorsed, it’s a particularly severe instance of far too little and far too late.                 From young voters to Black Christians, many people in solidly Democratic constituencies are reconsidering backing Biden because of his support for Israel. American Muslims might be among the most disillusioned of all. Over the last two decades, we’ve mostly backed Democrats. In the last few months, I’ve talked politics with hundreds of my fellow Muslims. Though not voting for Biden will effectively mean voting for former President Donald Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, I can count on one finger how many Muslims have said they are still riding with Biden.                 After the undeniably awful October 7 attacks Hamas perpetrated on Israelis, Biden could have chosen to pursue a response that acknowledged history and weighed Israeli and Palestinian lives equally. Instead, he has overseen what former State Department advisor Wa’el Alzayat called “an illogical disaster,” offering tepid, toothless criticism of Israel’s military tactics while continuing to ship arms and provide diplomatic cover for a war that has killed more than 27,000 people in Gaza in just months. These numbers are collected by Gaza’s Ministry of Health, which is part of Hamas’ government in Gaza, and their statistics have been relied upon by the United Nations.                 For the American Muslims I’ve spoken to, it’s impossible to overlook these choices. Biden was not compelled to pursue the policies he has. The world is suffering the consequences, and we are now seeing an escalation in bias and bigotry in our own country.                 Amina Barhumi, executive director of the Ohio chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told me about a surge in anti-Muslim “hate crimes, assaults and discriminatory incidents” since October 7. Reports of such incidents rose 172% nationwide year-over-year, she said, with a “600% increase into CAIR-Ohio offices in the four weeks” after October 7. She charged that “one-sided statements from our elected officials” about the conflict contributed to those numbers.     Related articleOpinion: I criticized the war in Gaza. Then I was fired from my job as Santa             Across the US, Muslims have faced violence including at Columbia University, where students protesting about Gaza were targeted with a chemical agent, according to reporting from The Intercept. In Georgia, a young student’s teacher allegedly threatened to behead her. Three Palestinian college students were shot in Vermont, one paralyzed for life. A mother, Hanaan Shahin, was brutally attacked in her own home; badly injured, she survived, but her 6-year-old son, Wadea Al Fayoume, was stabbed 26 times and died.                 When people ask me how American Muslims can abandon Biden in the face of Trump, I wonder if they see what we do. I wonder how anyone would make sense of the incredible moral discrepancies at work.                 Like many American Muslims, I’m in favor of a ceasefire in Gaza followed by a serious commitment, at long last, to a meaningful and fair process that provides Palestinians peace, security and dignity. Instead, through our government’s largely uncritical support for Israel, the US is propelling a violent military operation cheered on by openly eliminationist rhetoric that would face many more obstacles without determined American support.                 In so doing, Biden has seemingly abandoned even the pretense of neutrality, which the US should be committed to defending. It’s morally outrageous. It’s also strategically bonkers. We benefit from international institutions, too, after all. So this approach isn’t just unprincipled. It’s perilous. Many analysts warned Biden’s policies risked American lives; with the recent attack in Jordan, killing three of our soldiers and injuring many more, we are entering ever more worrying territory.     Related articleOpinion: An anti-Muslim tirade inspires a beautiful response             Credible observers warn of the conflagration spreading further, putting more American lives and resources on the line. As far as I know, no Americans voted for this chaos and conflict. Most Americans, including half of Republicans, back a ceasefire, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Yet Biden has time and again declined to use the United States’ enormous leverage to promote de-escalation.                 Have we learned nothing from our recent history? After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, our elites led us into trillions of dollars’ worth of short-sighted, sometimes disastrous responses, worst of all in Iraq. A nation that posed no credible direct threat to us was invaded on false premises. Thousands of Americans and roughly 300,000 Iraqis died, and no one was held responsible.                 Biden, then a US senator chairing the Foreign Relations Committee, voted in support of the resolution authorizing the US invasion of Iraq and has hardly acknowledged his culpability in that catastrophe. Worse still, he might not believe he has to.                 We Americans deserve better. We should demand better, too. For a long time, establishment Democrats wielded Trump like a threat. If you don’t vote for us, they warned, you’re voting for him. But if these Democrats were really concerned about what Trump represented, they’d draw a clearer contrast. If they can’t convince us to vote for Biden, that’s on the party — not on the voters. Biden had a preview of what he can expect when he visited Michigan on Thursday.                 Despite having just issued his executive order against violent Israeli settlers, he was treated to diminished representation from the American Muslim community, which is a considerable voting bloc in the Midwest swing state’s electorate. Days before Biden’s visit, local Muslim leaders were among those who cancelled a meeting with the president’s campaign manager. In December of last year, Muslim leaders gathered in Dearborn, Michigan — the city with the largest per capita Muslim population in the US — to officially launch an effort to “Abandon Biden.”                 A second Trump presidency would be difficult, even harrowing. But I believe the United States can survive four more years of Trump. I’m less certain we can survive four more years of so-called good guys who act so clearly otherwise.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

That’s how critics have described White Christian nationalism, a deviant strain of religion that has infected the political mainstream. White Christian nationalists believe the US was founded as a Christian nation, although the Constitution never mentions God and enshrines the separation of church and state. Its adherents twist biblical language to justify violence, sexism and hostility toward people of color.                 But there is another cost to the spread of White Christian nationalism that no one mentions.                 The relentless coverage of White Christian nationalism is spreading a racist myth: that Whiteness is the default setting for evangelical Christianity.                 This is one of the unintended consequences of the media and public’s fascination with the subject. Feeding this perception is an avalanche of books, articles and now a Hollywood film on the beliefs of White evangelical Christians — the biggest followers of Christian nationalism. In a February 2023 survey, nearly two-thirds of White evangelical Protestants qualified as sympathizers or adherents to Christian nationalism.                 The constant linking of Whiteness with evangelical Christianity, though, obscures another major story. There are millions of Black, Latino, African and Asian evangelical Christians who are already profoundly changing America. They represent what one scholar calls the “de-Europeanization of American Christianity.”                 And these non-White evangelicals will likely not only save the American church but transform the nation’s politics.                 This future will belong to people like Pastor Peter Lim, founder of a growing congregation of Asian-Americans called “4Pointes Church of Atlanta.” Lim, a Korean American evangelical, says the media’s hyperfocus on White Christian nationalism often renders communities like his invisible.                 He says he’s attended evangelical conferences where the only people who are featured onstage are White pastors or leaders. He wrote in an essay that Asian-American evangelicals often experience “perpetual invisibility” — akin to what Asian Americans encounter more broadly in this country.                 “You just feel overlooked — your story or your experience is minimized,” he says. “It’s not done intentionally. But you don’t feel like you belong. It tells you that your stories don’t belong. It does hurt.”                 Lim’s experience is the result of a passive form of racism. It’s not deliberate or malign; it’s a sin of omission rather than commission by many journalists, church leaders and commentators who rightly warn about the dangers posed by White Christian nationalism.                 I’ve done it myself: In the past, when I thought about evangelicals, I only saw White Christians.                 The true definition of “evangelical” has nothing to do with a color or a political party. Evangelicals are loosely defined as Christians who share a “born-again” dramatic personal conversion, who take the Bible seriously or literally and believe they’re supposed to spread their faith to others.                 Today, however, the definition of an evangelical Christian has been reduced to one category: a White conservative Republican.                 Click on any story about evangelicals and you’re liable to see a White person, usually a man, clutching a Bible.                 But it may surprise some people to learn that in 2024, the face of evangelical Christianity in the US is more likely to be brown than White.                 The numbers tell the story:                 —According to a 2017 survey, one in three American evangelicals is a person of color.                 —A higher number of Black Christians — 41% — identify as evangelicals than their White Christian counterparts.                 —The fastest-growing segment of evangelicals in the US are Latino Americans.                 —And at least 80% of the members of evangelical student groups at competitive universities like Princeton, Harvard and Stanford are Asian-American, according to one estimate.                 As Carolyn Chen, a professor at UC Berkeley who is an authority on Asian American religion, said during a 2022 speech: “Today’s evangelical leaders are not just White men with degrees from Oral Roberts University.”                 Two Asian Americans, for example, hold leadership positions at major evangelical organizations. Walter Kim, a Korean American, is the president of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE). And Tom Lin, a Taiwanese American, is the president of  InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA, a nationwide campus Christian ministry.                 The Rev. William Barber II, a Black pastor and activist who has been called the “closest person we have to MLK in contemporary America,” also identifies as an evangelical Christian.                 This change of complexion often produces a change in political perspective. Scholars say non-White evangelicals tend to be conservative on issues like sexuality and abortion but more progressive in politics. A majority of Black evangelicals, for example, say that opposing racism is an essential part of their faith.                 Chen predicts that “America will become more secular, and Christianity less conservative” as non-White evangelicals increase in number.                 Chen says the browning of Christianity in the US owes much to the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. That law paved the way for millions of immigrants from Asian, Africa, and Latin American countries to come to the US.                 “When we tell the story about American Christianity, we might start with the Puritans — it’s basically a European story,” says Chen, author of “Work Pray Code: When Work Becomes Religion in Silicon Valley.” “But what if we were to tell the story of American Christianity by what it’s starting to look like and how it’s changing today? That story begins in a place like Taiwan, Korea, or Mexico.”                 The focus on White evangelicals presents their non-White counterparts with a challenge: How do you reconcile belonging to a church that often doesn’t see you?                 That’s a problem Black evangelicals have faced for centuries, says the Rev. John C. Richards, Jr., a Black evangelical pastor at Saint Mark Baptist Church in Little Rock, Arkansas. He wrote in a 2017 essay that “White Christians have historically controlled the evangelical narrative.”                 “Black Christians have always lived in the peripheral vision of White Evangelicalism — our stories remaining unearthed and untold,” he wrote.                 But Black evangelicals have been in the US since the country’s birth. Richards says they have been the “moral compass of our nation,” clinging to their faith during slavery and Jim Crow. He cited the evangelical scholar Mark Noll, who once said:                 “Black Christians are the ones who have experienced the cross most traumatically in American history yet have not been included in the stories of Evangelicalism.”                 Richards deals with this challenge by asserting his evangelical identity in any forum he can. He uses social media, sermons and his “The Questions Worth Answering” podcast to highlight the faith and contributions of Black evangelicals.                 And he continues to claim the term “evangelical,” despite its association with conservative White Americans.                 “I’m not ready to abandon it just because someone co-opted it and just because people are misusing the word,” he says.                 The Rev. John Onwuchekwa, a pastor and entrepreneur based in Georgia, has a different response.                 The son of Nigerian immigrants, he says he grew exhausted trying to defend his perspective on race while he was a pastor with the Southern Baptist Convention, an ultra-conservative, predominately White evangelical denomination.                 Onwuchekwa and the congregation he co-founded, the Cornerstone Church, eventually left the Southern Baptist Convention.                 Onwuchekwa says he no longer uses the term “evangelical” to describe himself.                 “It’s become an unhelpful label,” he says. “It’s almost become an exclusively political term. The point of a label is to reduce the time it takes to communicate. Whenever you use the term ‘evangelical’ in public discourse, it achieves the opposite because you have to say, ‘Oh, but wait, here’s what I mean.’ ’’               Some non-White evangelicals are ignored in a more subtle way. Their perspective is only sought on issues related to race, like Christian nationalism.                 Onwuchekwa says he was once participating in a panel discussion on theology at a large evangelical conference with another Black pastor. Both answered questions about race for 15 minutes. When the other panelists turned the conversation to other theological matters, no one had a question for either of them for the remaining 45 minutes.                 Sometimes your race or ethnicity is ignored; at other times, that’s all White people see.                 “It made me feel belittled, used and it made me feel like this isn’t the space for me,” says Onwuchekwa, author of “We Go On: Finding Purpose in All of Life’s Sorrows and Joys.”                 “There need to be spaces where the full intricacies of my humanity are more fully appreciated,” says Onwuchekwa, who is also a co-founder of the Crete Collective, which opens churches in communities of color.                 Some non-White evangelicals feel overlooked because church leaders don’t acknowledge their pain.                 Lim, the Korean-American pastor, says several Asian-American families joined his church following a 2021 tragedy that rocked Atlanta’s Asian community. A man entered several Atlanta-area spas and shot and killed eight people, including six Asian women. The shooting underscored a recent surge in hate crimes against Asians in the US.                 Some of the new members of Lim’s church had been congregants in large, White evangelical churches. They told him they left because of the spa shootings, he says.                 “It wasn’t addressed at the churches; it wasn’t even talked about,” Lim says. “These Asian Americans, who were key members of the church, felt invisible. Their hurt was overlooked. That was the final straw for them.”                 It may soon be impossible to ignore the importance of non-White evangelicals because of one reason: demographics.                 At first glance, the numbers don’t look good for Christians in America. Commentators have longed warned that Christianity in the US is dying.                 Church membership in the US has been declining and in 2020 fell below 50% for the first time. Church leaders fret that the American church is poised to follow the path of West European churches: soaring Gothic cathedrals with empty pews and shuttered church sanctuaries converted into nightclubs.                 The numbers look grim for White evangelicals as well. They are the oldest religious group in America, and their numbers are declining, Chen, the UC Berkeley professor, says.                 But for evangelicals, the migration of non-White immigrants to the US from Latin America and Asia could represent a more earthbound form of salvation.                 The US has more immigrants than any country. Many of them are evangelicals and they, along with their children, are bringing their religious fervor with them and planting churches.                 “For so long we’ve talked about Christianity or evangelicalism as a White phenomenon,” says Chen, who is also the executive director of the Asian Pacific American Religions Research Initiative.                 “We’re on the cusp of this demographic change and there’s evidence of it all over. But we don’t even see it because we’re so focused on this population that’s dying out.”                 No one is saying there will be a “great replacement” of White evangelicals by hordes of brown or Black migrants elbowing them out of the pews. White evangelicals will remain a potent political force in American politics.                 But there is a rich and vibrant world of non-White evangelicals in America whose stories remain “unearthed and untold.” Not every discussion of evangelicals should feature White faces.                 It’s time to bury the myth that White Americans have a monopoly on evangelical Christianity.

That’s also true of Harvard, where he teaches.","Feb 1, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"Editor’s Note: Khalil Gibran Muhammad is the Ford Foundation Professor of History, Race and Public Policy at Harvard University, an organizer of the Freedom to Learn movement and co-host of the Some of My Best Friends Are podcast. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. Black History Month, which gets underway this week, is a chance to give Americans the timely reminder that you can’t teach our history honestly without understanding Black struggle and triumph.                 Take race and racism out of the American story and very little about the country is comprehensible. The way we elect our presidents. The civil rights enshrined in the 14th Amendment that gives birthright citizenship to formerly excluded Asian immigrants and grants marriage equality to same-sex couples. The nation’s intergenerational wealth accumulated during 350 years of slavery and segregation. And the outsize cultural visibility of African American creative talent on the world stage.                 Because Black patriots have carried the flame of American democracy for everyone, and for centuries, Black people continue to be overrepresented in pro-democracy movements in the United States — the very movements that some people, particularly some top Republicans and leading figures on the right — seek so desperately to destroy in their zeal to pass voter suppression laws and their efforts to diminish freedom of speech and assembly rights.                 Nowhere are these attacks more evident right now than on college campuses. Many academics who teach about the history of race and racism in America, as I do, are being unjustifiably blamed for the rise in antisemitism on campus and falsely accused of creating racial divisions in the country. This has had the undesirable effect of putting us in the crosshairs of some of the most powerful people in the country, including Republican politicians, conservative activists and billionaire donors.             You can’t teach our history honestly without understanding Black struggle and triumph”             Khalil Gibran Muhammad                 Last week, at my alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, about 100 faculty rallied against what they decried as “anti-democratic” attacks on diversity, academic freedom and free speech. Faculty and staff at private universities across the country now face a similar plight, as do many teachers, librarians and academics at public colleges and universities who have been censored, harassed, physically threatened and fired for doing their jobs over the past year.                 As these dangerous assaults move to private universities, many academics are preparing for the worst. I count myself among them. Last year, for the first time in my 25-year career as an academic historian, my teaching was singled out by a powerful politician for causing hate.                 When GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx opened the December 5 congressional hearing about antisemitism on campus, she targeted a class taught by me as a “prime example” of a “race-based ideology” that has caused Harvard University to be “ground zero for antisemitism following October 7.” Foxx also cited two additional campus examples of “institutional antisemitism and hate” — a Global Health seminar on “Scientific Racism and Anti-Racism” and an initiative at the Harvard Divinity School on “Social and Racial Justice.”     Related articleOpinion: How to fight back against the ‘anti-woke’ movement             Then, on January 2, just hours after Claudine Gay announced her resignation under pressure Foxx promised to keep her congressional investigation into Harvard going because “postsecondary education,” the lawmaker wrote in a statement, has been hijacked by “political activists, woke faculty and partisan administrators.”                 If by “woke” Foxx means teaching the truth about American history, then I’m guilty as charged. There are few aspects of America’s past that haven’t been impacted by conscientious Black people and their resistance to systemic racism and illiberal democracy.                 The charge against me of promulgating a “race-based ideology” that fosters antisemitic views is especially preposterous since the coursework I teach on the history of anti-Jewish hatred and discrimination shows how Blacks and Jews have common enemies in neo-Nazis, replacement theorists and white domestic terrorists in the US. Members of these same groups frequently voice support for the current leader of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump, who has employed language that resembles the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler.                 Right-wing office holders targeting academics is the latest battlefront in a three-year-old political war on education that started with Trump’s ban on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) training in federal agencies, and then metastasized to numerous states criminalizing books and curricula on racism, gender discrimination and sexuality in public primary and secondary schools. Florida recently banned sociology from the core curriculum of the nation’s largest public university system, which serves 430,000 students, because “it has been hijacked by left-wing activists,” according to the state commissioner of education. Related articleOpinion: Three little letters that have Florida’s Ron DeSantis on the attack             Foxx and her political ilk want people to believe that what happens in my classroom and the classrooms of many other academics across the country is a part of a woke conspiracy meant to indoctrinate White Americans to hate themselves and their country. They want the public to believe that those of us who teach the truth about the history of race and racism are the real racists and antisemites in America, as these enemies of racial progress and democracy attempt to stand reality on its head.                 The situation at Harvard has been made more dire by the university’s failure to push back sufficiently against broader political attacks. In his first university statement as interim president, Alan Garber issued a broad affirmation of the university’s commitment to “free inquiry and expression, in a climate of inclusion and mutual respect.” But as the new semester got underway in January, there was no written statement by senior university officials assuring faculty who teach about racism or staff who hold various functions in the area of DEI that we are safe to do our jobs.                 Boilerplate assurances of academic freedom were commonplace before Gay became president and certainly were issued frequently before October 7, when antisemitism became weaponized against anyone teaching about racism or colonialism or who dared to speak about the history of Israel’s occupation of Gaza. And to be clear, I mean anyone — not just Black faculty. Just last week, on the first day of the spring semester, President Garber came under fire for appointing Derek J. Penslar, a prolific and well-respected scholar of Jewish history, to be the co-chair of Harvard’s reconstituted presidential task force combating antisemitism.                 Penslar is accused of being soft on antisemitism by Bill Ackman, the billionaire donor who says DEI is the “root cause” of Harvard’s alleged antisemitism and is a prominent supporter of Foxx’s congressional investigation. Another vocal critic of Penslar is the former Harvard president Lawrence Summers, who was also an outspoken opponent of Gay’s. He wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter) that Penslar’s views are disqualifying because he has invoked “the concept of settler colonialism in analyzing Israel” and has labeled it “an apartheid state.”                 The tragedy is that the academics most committed to learning from the past — who have dedicated their entire careers to staring into the abyss of oppression, in an effort to teach the concept of “Never Again” and how it applies to all people — are the ones least protected in this moment. Black faculty and staff feel especially vulnerable. As my friend who is a Black staffer at a Florida community college told me recently: “I am on the opposite end of the educational spectrum than Harvard, but our realities are the same in many respects.”                 Some Black colleagues on my campus have told me they are concerned about the risk to their careers and reputations from “teaching while Black” in this climate. Even some Black alumni are weighing whether it is safe to speak up about Gay’s swift demise as Harvard’s first Black woman president, especially in light of what was believed by many of us to be a political hit job for her commitment to DEI. “People are afraid,” one alum told me. “If it can happen to her, it can happen to any of us.”                 If the oldest, richest and most powerful American university won’t defend its own people and resist political efforts to interfere with unvarnished truth-telling and academic freedom, then shame on Harvard. As an academic institution, we should be leading the resistance to these assaults on higher education, not bowing to them.                 Silence is a failure of leadership in times like these. Harvard, with its motto “Veritas” — truth — owes it to all of us on the frontlines of these false attacks to defend us for teaching and practicing the very values it claims to uphold.                 And for those of us who believe that a rigorous, equitable, inclusive and above all else honest education is the only kind worth having in a multi-racial democracy, we must be courageous, stand together and continue teaching the truth.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Hordes of illegal immigrants invading the southern border. Gender ideology warping young minds in schools. Sinister globalists plotting in the shadows.                 These are the toxic themes espoused in right-wing media, delivered each day through a mix of internet pipelines and broadcasts to millions of homes across the country. They are also the perturbed views of a 32-year-old man who police say decapitated his father, a federal employee, and then uploaded a highly disturbing video to YouTube showcasing the grisly murder while spewing a toxic potpourri of conspiratorial grievances.                 It’s part of a larger trend of right-wing violence afflicting the country. Over the course of the last several years, America has witnessed a spate of such incidents: the Charlottesville car attack, the Charleston church shooting, the Buffalo supermarket shooting, the El Paso Walmart shooting, and, of course, the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, among others.                 “In recent years, violent and alarming actions by far-right extremists, from seditious plots to interfere with election results to white supremacist mass killing attacks, have thrust the issue of right-wing extremist violence into the headlines on a regular basis,” the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks such incidents, said in a November report. “In today’s America, such terrorism is not merely a threat, it’s a fact of life.”                  The ADL noted in its report that “right-wing extremist terror incidents in the U.S. have been increasing since the mid-2000s,” but stressed that “the past six years have seen their sharpest rise yet.”                 The timing coincides with Donald Trump’s arrival on the national political scene, seizing control of the right-wing media machine and refashioning it into his personal propaganda mouthpiece that pollutes the country’s information environment.                 Prior to Trump’s ascension, conspiracy-laden messages were largely confined to the seedy cesspools of the web like 4chan and Infowars, where fringe hosts such as Alex Jones ranted to marginalized audiences. But the media landscape has deteriorated considerably in recent years. Now, extremist commentary airs regularly on Fox News. It is dispersed on A.M. radios from coast to coast. It is commonplace on conservative news and commentary websites. And it proliferates on social media platforms, where right-wing extremists maintain a loud presence and boast millions of followers.                 “To tap into these ideas, you [once] had to be literally on mailing lists from extremist groups like the Klan,” Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director turned CNN law enforcement analyst, told me Wednesday. “By virtue of logistics, that limited the number of eyeballs consuming this stuff.”                 “Then you have the internet age dawn and outlets like Stormfront bring these views to more audiences. Now, take that times one thousand,” McCabe continued. “You don’t have to go to the fringes. You can just turn your cable news outlet to Fox News or Newsmax or OAN and you’re getting the same kind of content. The same ideas of the Great Replacement Theory. The same ideas of vilifying immigrants. It’s the same messages. It’s a little slicker and better produced. But these messages have the same corrosive effect on people.”                 Millions of people have been trained to distrust credible news organizations and only put their faith in the dishonest voices feeding them a diet of radical rhetoric. And while not everyone who hears such messages will resort to violence, the charged language can suck some people in and eventually lead to real-world action.                 “This act of violence represents the threat posed by mainstreaming hateful and dehumanizing rhetoric,” Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University told me when I asked about the views the suspect in the decapitation recited.                 “This shared belief that a ‘cabal of global elites’ run by Jews and the left are conspiring to steal white America from Christians allows for a tangled web of conspiracies to connect: anti-government extremists, white supremacists, fascists, and everyone in between, sometimes forging unlikely alliances,” Baumgartner added.“This, in turn, allows grievances like a border crisis or a global conflict to inspire a range of ideologically disparate extremists in the name of violence against the other.”                 Too often, however, the public — and journalists whose job it is to shine a bright light on it — turn a blind eye to the dangerous propaganda machine motivating these actors and operating in plain sight.                 Reporters, in particular, very often fail to connect the obvious dots between words and actions. They will note that trees have been cut down in the forest but shy away from pointing out those who are holding the chainsaws in their hands. Media reporting largely is viewed as niche; not vital. Rarely will you see a segment about the information crisis on the evening news or delivered prominently via other vessels of mainstream media. The symptoms of the cancer are discussed at length (election denialism, Trump’s firm grip on the Republican Party, etcetera), but rarely is the underlying disease confronted with the vigor it demands.                 “Top media outlets too often separate political coverage and reporters from incitement/violence/election denialism coverage,” Juliette Kayyem, the faculty chair of the Homeland Security and Security and Global Health Projects at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, told me via email.                 The media figures who peddle extremism to the public, Kayyem added, employ sly tactics to shield themselves from accountability when a perpetrator acts on their words. The language they use, she said, “winks at,” “nurtures,” and “flirts with violence,” but also offers them just enough “plausible deniability” when things go south.                 “The only way to defeat it,” Kayyem said, “is to call it out.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

This represents a 178% increase in complaints compared to a similar period the previous year, the organization said.                 The nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization said the US has experienced a “relentless” wave of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hate since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.                 Corey Saylor, CAIR research and advocacy director, said it’s crucial the public recognizes not only the rise in anti-Muslim, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian incidents happening across the country, but also the emotional impact these incidents have on local communities.                 “The numbers say one thing, but as someone who works on these cases, particularly in October, we were completely shut down with the incoming wave of complaints, intaking people and starting to try to help them out,” Saylor said.                 “I think that it’s always crucial to remember that Islamophobia, anti-Arab bias, anti Semitism, and racism does not contribute to ending the violence,” Saylor said.                 Though the organization has described the number of bias incidents as “staggering,” Saylor said he also recognizes that many more incidents likely go uncounted because people are afraid to speak out.                 “In many cases, Muslims are afraid to reach out to law enforcement, they often also just don’t know where to report it,” he said. “And then the other thing that we’ve found is that the community oftentimes is simply so desensitized, they think it’s normal … All of that is very unfortunate.”                 The three highest categories of complaints the organization said it received were employment discrimination, hate crimes and incidents, and education discrimination.                 Saylor called on American political leaders on both sides of the aisle to demand an end to bias and discrimination.                 “What we’re trying to help people understand is that what’s going on in the Middle East, impacts us here.

Sukru Genc, mayor of the Sariyer district where the church is located, told Turkish independent newspaper BirGün that the man was by the entrance to the church at the time of the attack, which saw two masked gunmen open fire during Sunday service.                 “During the attack, a citizen from Bayburt at the entrance, a Muslim citizen, lost his life,” said the mayor. Turkey’s interior minister Ali Yerlikaya identified the man as Tuncer Murat Cihan in a post on X.                 “According to the priest, he was constantly going to church and the priest knew this person and referred to him as ‘a good person,’” added Genc.                 The priest who was leading mass at the time said one of the attackers’ guns had jammed, according to Genc.                 “When the first gun went off, everyone threw themselves on the ground. After the second explosion, the gun jammed and they [the attackers] came out. It is unknown what would happen next, whether the attack would continue,’” Genc told BirGün.                 Genc said around 35 to 40 people were inside the church at the time, including the Polish Consul General in Istanbul, Witold Lesniak, who was there with his children.                 “Nothing happened to them because they were in the front, but their children and everyone at the service were seriously affected,” he said.                 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s office posted a video on X, showing part of his call with Lesniak.                 “I would be grateful if you would convey my condolences to the entire community,” Erdogan says in the video.

Iranian authorities allege Ghobadlou ran over the official during a protest in Robat Karim, Tehran province, in September 2022, according to rights group Amnesty International.                 He was sentenced to death by judge Abolqasem Salavati – who has been sanctioned by the United States for the notoriously harsh sentences he issued to activists, journalists and political prisoners, CNN previously reported.                 Ghobadlou received two death sentences – one for “corruption on Earth,” issued by a Revolutionary Court and upheld by the Supreme Court, and one for murder, issued by a criminal court in Tehran province, according to Amnesty.                 Mizan reported that the death sentence for “corruption on Earth” was suspended earlier this month until the intentional murder charge was investigated.                 Ghobadlou’s lawyer Amir Raesian said he was not notified about a ruling regarding his client, and called on Mizan to release more information on the execution.                 “If Mizan news agency is telling the truth, it should announce the number and date of issuance of this verdict,” Raesian said in a statement on X.

International law and standards prohibit using the death penalty against people with mental disabilities, according to the rights group.                 Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of Norway-based Iranian human rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR), called Ghobadlou’s execution an “extrajudicial killing.”                 On X, formerly Twitter, he wrote that “the Islamic Republic’s leader Ali Khamenei and his Judiciary must be held accountable for this crime. This execution must be met with strong international condemnations!”                 At least eight protesters are known to have been executed in connection to nationwide demonstrations over the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022.                 Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in the custody of Iran’s morality police after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.

He is the author of “The Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             The Biden administration has gone to great lengths to prevent a larger regional war in the Middle East. Yet, already, there is a de facto regional conflict raging with all the possibilities for screw-ups and escalatory responses that are inherent in such a conflict. Like a frog in a slowly boiling pot of water, the region may wake up one day soon and realize it’s in the midst of an all-out war.                 The danger of growing conflict is rising and threatens to entangle the United States. That’s partly why US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting the Middle East this week: to try to stop the widening hostilities.                 Consider just the past few days: On Thursday, a US drone strike killed the leader of an Iranian-based militia in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have launched at least 118 attacks against US troops in Syria and Iraq since the October 7 attack by Hamas inside Israel.                 The strike in Baghdad was a calculated risk by the Biden administration, especially since there are growing calls in Iraq to expel some 2,500 US troops that remain in the country on a mission to counter ISIS. The Baghdad strike has amplified those calls to expel US troops, according to the leading Arabic-language newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat.                 In purported support of Hamas, the Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that controls much of Yemen, have launched 23 attacks at commercial vessels in the Red Sea since November 19 using a variety of missiles, drones and sea-based drones.                 The Red Sea approach to the Suez Canal is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, and some key shipping companies have suspended their operations in the area.                 On Wednesday, the US and a dozen other allied nations warned the Houthis that they must stop their attacks on commercial shipping or face unspecified consequences. That followed the sinking by the US three days earlier of three Houthi speedboats in the Red Sea to prevent them from hijacking a commercial vessel.                 On Tuesday, a leader of Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, was killed by a drone strike in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, adding to the growing tensions between Hezbollah and Israel. There have been near-daily tit-for-tat exchanges of fire between them along the Israel-Lebanon border since October 7. Al-Arouri was killed in an area of Beirut dominated by Hezbollah, which has vowed to avenge his death.     Opinion: Netanyahu’s reckoning comes after the war. That’s a dangerous timeline             On Monday, Israel launched air strikes in the Syrian capital, Damascus, hitting what it said were Syrian military targets. The Syrian regime was aided by Hezbollah fighters during the Syrian civil war, and it has publicly supported Hamas.                 Adding to all of this on Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for two suicide attacks at a memorial service for the key Iranian military leader General Qassim Suleimani that killed at least 84 people. ISIS is a Sunni jihadist group that regards the Shia clerics who run Iran as heretics. Attacks by Sunni jihadist groups inside Iran have been relatively rare, and this attack marks a significant escalation by ISIS against Iran. Iran’s leaders have promised to seek revenge against the terrorist group.                 The growing conflicts in the region are partly the result of advances in military technology over the past two decades and the growth of proxy warfare in the Middle East during the same time period. It’s easy to forget that before the 9/11 attacks, there were no armed drones capable of carrying out targeted strikes far from the base of the attacker. The use of armed drones by the US became a hallmark of the “war on terror,” and today, countries like Israel and groups like the Houthis have also adopted the tactic.                 Meanwhile, during the same time period, the Middle East saw a surge of proxy forces allied in some fashion with Iran. This phenomenon was precipitated partly by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The war in Iraq produced only one real winner, Iran, according to the official US Army history of the conflict. Iran today continues to support militias in Iraq, according to a 2023 report prepared for the British House of Commons.     Wave of attacks heightens fears of wider Middle East war             In Lebanon, Hezbollah has received hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran, and thousands of its fighters have trained in Iranian camps, according to the US State Department. In Syria, Iran also has considerable influence, and its own forces are based there. The Houthis in Yemen are armed and trained by Iran, while Hamas has also received arms from Iran.                 This all makes for a simmering mess, because while armed drones and proxy forces allow powers like the US, Israel and Iran to avoid all-out conventional wars, reliance on drones and proxies is also playing with fire as they move all these powers closer to all-out conflict. The history of warfare, after all, suggests that it is the most uncertain of human enterprises, and seemingly relatively unimportant events like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, which became a key trigger of World War I, can instigate broader conflicts.                 In Israel, there is now a growing lobby for a war with Hezbollah, a far better armed and more militarily proficient force than Hamas. The last time that Israel and Hezbollah fought a full-scale war was in 2006, and the conflict was something of a draw.                 In Lebanon, there is little appetite for another war as the 2006 conflict destroyed a good chunk of the country, which is reeling from its current economic and financial crises.                 But war may come anyway, given attitudes in Israel about the threat posed by Hezbollah and Hezbollah’s own increasingly strident responses to Israeli attacks.                 In Washington, DC, the national security establishment has for many years focused on the rising threat posed by China, and every administration since President Barack Obama’s has tried to lessen US involvement in the greater Middle East. Obama withdrew all US troops from Iraq in 2011, only to deploy American soldiers back to Iraq in 2014 to counter ISIS. President Donald Trump’s team signed a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban in 2020, and President Joe Biden withdrew all US troops from Afghanistan in 2021.                 Yet the United States keeps getting pulled back into the Middle East because of several factors, including its alliance with Israel, the central role that oil and gas play in the global economy and its longtime competition with Iran, none of which are going to change any time soon. The risk now is that a series of increasingly lethal attacks between Iranian proxy forces, and the US and its allies, including Israel, will embroil the region in a larger war.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

At least 84 people were killed and 284 injured in the blasts on Wednesday, state-run news agency IRNA reported, in what was the deadliest attack in Iran since its 1979 revolution.                 ISIS media wing Al-Furqan issued a statement on Thursday – more than 24 hours after the explosions – claiming two suicide bombers, who are brothers, had detonated their explosive vests as Shiite mourners gathered for the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Soleimani near his grave in his hometown of Kerman.                 The statement, titled “And Kill Them Wherever You Find Them,” named the two bombers and said they targeted a gathering of “polytheists” near the grave of their “dead leader” Soleimani.                 ISIS considers the Shia branch of Islam to be heretical and has targeted shrines and religious sites in Iran previously.                 The group offered no further proof and their account of the blasts differs from that given by Iranian media. The death toll provided by ISIS was also significantly higher than that reported by Iranian officials.                 Iran did not immediately comment on ISIS’ claim of responsibility. But Iran’s official state news agency IRNA, as well as its English-language state media outlet Press TV, both reported on the ISIS claim of responsibility.                 Both referred to the group by its Arabic name “Daesh”, with IRNA posting a screenshot of the terror group’s claim that has appeared on multiple ISIS forums.                 Press TV added in their reporting that in a statement posted on its affiliate Telegram channels, the Islamic State had claimed that two of its members had detonated explosive belts.                 Iran’s interior minister said the two blasts happened in short succession, with the second, deadlier blast coming as others rushed to help the wounded.                 Another state media outlet, IRINN, said the first explosion was caused by a bomb placed in a suitcase inside a car and appeared to have been detonated remotely rather than being caused by a suicide bomber.                 Videos showed large numbers of people running in the area after the explosions, bloodied bodies on the ground and ambulances driving through the packed crowds.                 Iran declared Thursday a day of mourning and President Ebhrahim Raisi canceled a scheduled trip to Turkey.                 Accusations flew in the time between the blasts and ISIS’ statement. Iran’s President Ebhrahim Raisi blamed Israel for the explosions and warned it would pay a “heavy price.” The Israeli military told CNN it had “no comment” on the matter.                 Prior to ISIS’ statement, analysts and a US official had speculated that the blast had the hallmarks of a terror attack.                 “It does look like a terrorist attack, the type of thing we’ve seen ISIS do in the past. And as far as we’re aware, that’s kind of I think our going assumption at the moment,” the official said.                 Soleimani, formerly one of Iran’s most powerful men, was killed by a US airstrike ordered by former President Donald Trump at Baghdad International Airport on January 3, 2020.                 Known as Iran’s “shadow commander,” he was head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, an elite unit that handles Iran’s overseas operations and was deemed to be a foreign terrorist organization by the US. He masterminded Iranian military operations in Iraq and Syria.     This is a developing story and will be updated. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/us/how-to-combat-islamophobia/index.html,"As reports of hate crimes against Muslims grow, here’s how you can help","As the crisis escalates in the Middle East, so do reports of hate crimes in the US.","Dec 20, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"The rise in anti-Muslim acts is undeniable and unnerving. Three Palestinian college students were shot in Vermont, and when a six-year-old was stabbed in Chicago, his mother couldn’t attend his funeral because she’d been stabbed, too.              In Georgia, a middle school teacher was arrested after he allegedly threatened to behead a 13-year-old Muslim student.                 But most incidents of Islamophobia don’t make headlines – or even go reported.                 This recent unprecedented surge of anti-Muslim bias prompted the White House to announce a national strategy to combat Islamophobia.                 Corey Saylor of The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) says his organization receives daily reports of Islamophobia, including incidents where people probably could have helped. In one case, they say, a woman was verbally harassed in a crowded grocery store without a single person coming to her aid.                 Saylor says that’s in stark contrast to a recent incident in the Fort Lauderdale airport, where a Muslim woman was harassed by a man who filmed her and threatened to “report” her to authorities. Two bystanders immediately sat down next to her. Others gathered around the victim. From across the room, a woman pulled out her phone and began recording the man, and then posted the video to TikTok.                 Saylor says this is an example of how when one person rushes in to help, others often follow. It’s easy to be paralyzed in an uncomfortable situation, but offering assistance - if it’s safe to do so - is like giving first aid, says Saylor. You might not know exactly what to do, but you do your best in the situation.                 The Maryland office of CAIR is offering bystander or “upstander” intervention training to teach people how they can help if they see someone being harassed.                 He stresses that if there’s any threat of violence, you need to leave immediately. However, if a person is being verbally harassed but doesn’t seem to be in physical danger, you could shout out from a safe distance. That distraction could be enough to disrupt the situation. You could also walk over to and ask the victim if they want you to call the police. If you’re able to record the occurrence with your phone, that can be useful for law enforcement. If you can’t do that, or you just don’t think of it at the time, immediately jot down everything you remember about the incident. This could be a huge help for the victim in the future.                 The focus of the training, according to Saylor, is to directly support the target of the hate bias while ignoring the perpetrator. That way, the person who’s targeted feels supported, and the oxygen is taken away from the perpetrator. Helping could be as simple as offering a reassuring smile or moving closer to the person being harassed.                 CAIR offers its “upstanders” training both in person and online. The courses are free. If you’re interested in booking one, contact info@cair.com             So what can you do to safely de-escalate a situation if you witness one? And what can Muslims do to keep themselves safe? CAIR has these suggestions:     WHAT BYSTANDERS OR “UPSTANDERS” CAN DO: HELP FOR PALESTINIAN, MUSLIM AND ARAB STUDENTS:              While no one wants young people to be fearful, Muslim organizations encourage students to exercise caution, especially right now. Those concerns led CAIR to put out a list of safety tips for Muslim students.                 Some of their suggestions include:     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

It is her grandmother’s memory that she invokes in seeking justice for victims of the 10/7 Hamas ...","Dec 11, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"Editor’s Note: Alexi Ashe Meyers is an attorney and advocate working in New York City. She has started a movement to bring attention to the sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.              Clara Haras was 17 years old, living in Nazi-occupied Tarnopol, Poland, when a German officer told her he’d save her family under the condition that she have sex with him. He proceeded to rape her. The Nazis then brutally executed her grandparents, mother, father, two little sisters and a brother. Somehow, she summoned the will to survive the next four years of terror. But for the next 60 years, she lived with the nightmare of unspeakable trauma. Yet she never abandoned her Jewish identity.                 Clara is my grandmother. My grandfather also survived the Holocaust, having spent four years in concentration camps. Because of his profession as a dentist, he was ordered to comb through the corpses to extract any gold teeth.                 Aspects of both my grandparents’ stories were shared often throughout my childhood in an effort to make certain that we would never forget. My grandparents recounted their stories at the dinner table, in my history class and at my Hebrew school. But it was only when my grandmother was on her deathbed that she shared that last vestige of her history — her rape by a Nazi. And although I lived with the painful truth of her rape, I was motivated by the collective voices that said, “Never again.”                 And then on October 7, never again happened. When Hamas attacked Israel, they used tactics that have been used to subjugate Jewish women and women worldwide for centuries, as they systematically carried out rape and sexual violence on Israeli women and girls. From the early 20th century pogroms to the Holocaust, rape was routinely used as a weapon of war against the Jewish people to torture, terrorize and suppress us.                 For more than two decades, I have fought to embolden victims of rape and empower those who have been sold into the commercial sex trade, sometimes by their own family members. I am often asked why I work to combat gender violence. My response is always the same: My grandparents are Holocaust survivors and their experiences had a deep impact on my life and left me with the responsibility to stand up against hate.                 I was raised with a deep understanding that injustice happens in a vacuum of silence. If people don’t speak up, evil operates with impunity. In the wake of October 7, I have chosen to speak up. But not everyone has.             If people don’t speak up, evil operates with impunity.             Alexi Ashe Meyers     Sheryl Sandberg: Something we can all agree on             There is overwhelming evidence that the October 7 attacks included horrific and widespread gender-based violence, including rape and sexual mutilation. It includes forensic examinations of numerous Israeli victims’ bodies mangled by acts of rape and sexual torture. It includes testimony by survivors of the attacks who witnessed Hamas terrorists raping and mutilating women.                 It includes the testimony of first responders who found Israeli women and girls, murdered, in conditions that made it clear they had been raped. A witness who gave video testimony spoke about seeing a woman being gang raped. It includes the video of a young Israeli woman, her pants bloodsoaked, being dragged by her hair by Hamas abductors, and footage of other women stripped of their clothing.              It includes testimony gathered by a civil commission headed by an international law expert documenting atrocities against women and children by Hamas on October 7. The mountain of evidence reveals the unimaginable viciousness of the Hamas terrorist attacks.               Last week marked two months since the attacks. And still, many feminist organizations — whose core mission is to fight for the right of every woman and girl, of every nationality, religion and community to live free from all forms of violence, including rape — remain astoundingly silent.     Opinion: This Hanukkah, we Jews could use your help             November 25th, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women came and went, and many remained silent. As I’ve continued to advocate for some of New York’s most vulnerable women and girls these past two months — and as I simultaneously speak out for the women and girls in Israel whose voices were taken from them on October 7 — my grandfather’s often-uttered phrase echoes in my ears: “There’s no question the Nazis were evil monsters, but I blame the bystanders.”                 My grandfather felt profoundly betrayed by the people who had a voice and did not use it. He understood the existential evil of the Nazis, but felt most betrayed by the neighbors, the shop keepers and the friends who stood silent. He never accepted that humanity was unwilling to help.                 Now Israeli families want to know if humanity will help them. Devastated by the horrors of October 7 and tormented by fears for the hostages, they need to hear our voices, to know where we stand.                 So I’ll say it loud and clear: Good people can disagree on the pathway to peace. Good people can disagree on many aspects of the conflict. But good people must use their voices to denounce certain unacceptable acts, and one of them is the use of mass rape as a weapon of war.                 There are innocent people still held captive by Hamas, and they include women and girls who in all likelihood have been subjected — and very likely are still being subjected — to sexual assault by Hamas. They also include men and boys who may have suffered the same horror. People of good conscience must demand to bring them home.                 There’s no question that what happened on October 7 evoked the Holocaust in its barbarity. It has also evoked Holocaust denial as people demand proof and evidence of the terror and sexual violence. Organizations whose mission is to combat gender-based violence should be among the loudest voices. We always stand with survivors, even in the most controversial cases where there is little proof other than a survivor’s word.                 Stand up for the victims and survivors of October 7. Stand up for those still in captivity. If you do not, your silence compounds the pain of the survivors, the erasure of the murdered, the anguish of their families. Your silence empowers the perpetrators. Each of us has a voice, however small.                 Call the White House, or your senator or your representative in Congress. Tell them the return of the hostages is a priority for you and a priority for humanity. Demand a full investigation into the sexual violence committed by Hamas terrorists. Never again should the world enable atrocities with silence. It is time to use your voice.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

New data from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) reveal a dramatic spike in reported incidents of both antisemitism and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias.                 The ADL said it recorded 2,031 antisemitic incidents in the two months after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, including reports of physical assault, vandalism and “anti-Israel rallies that included classically antisemitic, anti-Zionist and/or terror-supportive rhetoric.”                 The organization said it received reports of 465 antisemitic incidents during the same two-month period in 2022.                 The new data, released Monday, reflects a more than 330% increase in reported incidents of antisemitism from the 2022 timeframe, the ADL said.                 “This is historic but can be directly linked back to the Israel-Hamas war as a majority of the incidents referenced the conflict in one form or another,” said Jake Hyman, a spokesperson for the ADL.                 CAIR said it has tracked a similarly troubling rise in requests for help and reports of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias. After recording an “unprecedented” spike in bias incidents during the first month of the war, the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group said 2,171 requests for help and reports of bias have been made to its national headquarters and chapters across the country since October 7.                 Those reports include incidents of hate crimes and hate speech, as well as workplace discrimination and incidents described as “violations of an individual’s right to free speech and expression,” the group said.                 In a statement shared with CNN Thursday, Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director at CAIR, said the surge in anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias has been “staggering.”                 “From Burlington to Chicago and elsewhere, innocent Americans are suffering the consequences of this wave of bigotry,” Saylor said. “Until our nation stops the violence overseas and rejects bigotry here at home, we fear that both Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism will continue to spin out of control.”                 Attorney General Merrick Garland will instruct law enforcement officials across the country to “remain vigilant in the face of risks of terrorism and hate-fueled violence” at this week’s National Violent Crime Reduction Summit in Indianapolis.                 Garland, who will address the summit Monday, plans to discuss how the Department of Justice is “closely monitoring” the impact of the Israel-Hamas war, and whether the conflict in the Middle East is inspiring extremists both at home and abroad, according to a copy of his prepared remarks.                 He will also note the spike in hate-fueled violence “comes at a time when law enforcement agencies and communities across the country have already been facing significant challenges regarding violent crime.”                 The increase in reported hate and bias motivated incidents has fostered a climate of fear for many Jewish, Muslim and Arab people living in America.                 Though the war is thousands of miles away, Jews across the country told CNN they are changing the way they celebrate Hanukkah this year. Some have decided to break with yearslong traditions and removed the menorah from their windows. Others have grown more defiant and have chosen to boldly declare their Jewish identity despite the rise in antisemitism.                 After three Palestinian college students were shot in Vermont last month, their relatives told CNN they thought the young men would be safer in the United States than in Israeli-occupied Ramallah, where they grew up as childhood friends.                 Now, loved ones are left wondering if one 20-year-old will ever be able to walk again and if the shooting will be investigated as a hate crime.                 As the Israel-Hamas war continues to escalate, extremism experts caution more needs to be done to confront and combat the surge in bigotry in the US.                 “We have seen in the past that when conflict erupts in the Middle East, incidents of bias-motivated hate, whether it be antisemitic incidents or anti-Muslim hate crimes, tend to surge here in the U.S.,” Hyman said. “It is a disturbing reminder that a war half-a-world away has a global impact.”     CNN’s Nicole Chavez, Alisha Ebrahimji, Rikki Klaus and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

FBI data released in October shows hate crimes in the US are the highest since ...","Dec 11, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"US-based advocacy groups are reporting a sustained spike in hate incidents against Jewish and Muslim individuals since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas. The Anti-Defamation League found that in the eight weeks since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, antisemitic incidents in the US increased 337%, according to data shared with CNN.                 The ADL cited 2,031 antisemitic incidents between October 7 and December 7, 1,411 of which were linked to the fighting in Israel and Gaza and 400 of which occurred on college and university campuses. By comparison, there were 465 incidents over the same time frame in 2022.                 The Council on American-Islamic Relations also reported an increase in Islamophobic incidents. Between October 7 and December 2, CAIR recorded a 2,171 reports of bias or requests for help — 172% more than the 2022 two-month average.                 Jews, Palestinians and Muslims in the US told CNN they’re experiencing a growing fear about bigotry and hatred in the wake of the Hamas attack.                 But the recent uptick from the war is part of a years-long rise in hate crimes in the US, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. FBI data released in October shows hate crimes in the US are the highest since collection began in 1991.                 The FBI collects and publishes hate crime data but reporting is voluntary and only about 80% of agencies submit data. Compliance changes from year to year. The data is also an undercount: fewer than half of hate crime victims report to police, according to the FBI’s National Crime Victimization Survey.                 FBI records show a rise in anti-Muslim incidents starting in 2015, with more bias-driven assaults against Muslims in 2016 than in 2001.                 Antisemitic crimes were on the rise long before Oct. 7. Between 2021 and 2022, the number of antisemitic hate crimes increased by 36% to a total of 1,124 – the highest ever recorded by the FBI.                 The ADL’s data, which captures bias incidents outside crimes, matches the pattern in the FBI numbers.                 CAIR Research Director Corey Saylor said the organization has been flooded with reports since October 7.                 “We are responding to incidents around the clock,” Saylor said. “The last time we saw something like this was in December 2015, with Trump’s Muslim ban [proposal].”                 As a candidate in late 2015, former President Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the US. Anti-Muslim events sparked in tandem with his statements on the campaign trail, CAIR said.                 Trump enacted his ban in January 2017, initially against a handful of Muslim countries, and expanded it to include some African countries. President Joe Biden reversed the ban in early 2021, but Trump (currently the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination) recently said he would reinstate and expand the restrictions, pointing to Hamas’ attack on Israel as vindication of his initial policy.                 CAIR’s record of anti-Muslim bias incidents trends differently than the FBI’s hate crime data, showing a consistent increase in reports until 2022, when reports dropped by 23%. In its annual report on the data, CAIR attributed the change to decreased volatility in domestic politics and increased federal targeting of white supremacist groups in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The comments came from Council on American-Islamic Relations Director Nihad Awad at a conference two weeks ago, when – according to a video posted on X, by DC-based Middle East Media Research Institute – he said, “I was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing down the shackles of their own land and walk free into their land, which they were not allowed to walk in.”                 “We condemn these shocking, Antisemitic statements in the strongest terms,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement shared with CNN.                 Bates echoed President Joe Biden in calling the October 7 attacks “abhorrent” and “unadulterated evil,” noting that October 7 “was the deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust.”                 “The atrocities of that day shock the conscience, which is why we can never forget the pain Hamas has caused for so many innocent people,” Bates said in a statement responding to Awad’s remarks.                 In a statement Thursday, Awad said that he condemned violence against all civilians and all forms of bigotry and claimed his comments were taken out of context.                 “What I actually said while discussing international law: Ukrainians, Palestinians and other occupied people have the right to defend themselves and escape occupation by just and legal means, but targeting civilians is never an acceptable means of doing so, which is why I have again and again condemned the violence against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7th,” he said.                 The White House has spoken forcefully against antisemitism and Islamophobia in the months since the October 7 attacks.                 “We can’t stand by and stand silent where this happens. We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. We must, also without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia,” Biden said in an Oval Office address in late October.              The Anti-Defamation League, which tracks antisemitic incidents, reported a “significant spike” in those incidents in the weeks after October 7, per preliminary data. And CAIR has reported a “clear increase in reports brought to a national level” in incidents of bias against Muslims in America.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             After police say he repeatedly taunted an Arab immigrant food cart worker in his Manhattan neighborhood, former Obama-era National Security Council official Stuart Seldowitz was arrested last week by the New York Police Department. He now faces hate crime and aggravated harassment charges.                 The videos of Seldowitz’s rants — which went viral — were despicable. The former government official made vile anti-Muslim comments while jeering at the Egyptian food cart worker about the Israel-Hamas war with remarks such as, “If we killed 4,000 Palestinian children, you know what? It wasn’t enough!”                 Seldowitz, who has pleaded not guilty, told a local New York paper that he regretted the incident, saying, “in the heat of the moment, I said things that probably I shouldn’t have said.” But the “heat of the moment” defense rings hollow given Seldowitz allegedly returned to the food cart several times over a two-week period to spew hate.                 Tragically, these types of disturbing incidents have skyrocketed since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 388% increase in anti-Jewish incidents in the weeks after the war began compared to the same period last year.                 Jewish Americans have seen their places of worship defaced alongside an alarming number of threats against and attacks on Jewish students on college campus. One deeply concerning incident took place at Cornell University when messages vowing to “shoot up” a Jewish dining hall and stab Jews on the campus were posted online. A student was arrested and accused of being behind the threats and has not entered a plea in his first court appearance.                 Just as concerning, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has documented an “appalling” rise in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the month following October 7. Overall, CAIR fielded a 216% increase in requests for help and reported bias incidents as compared to 2022.     Opinion: I’m a Jewish Columbia professor. I wouldn’t allow my children to go here now             Alarmingly, it appears one such horrific incident may have occurred on Saturday in Burlington, Vermont, when three Palestinian students were shot. Two are US citizens and the third is a legal resident. And two of them were wearing the traditional Arab scarf known as a keffiyeh, according to local police. The Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee noted in a press release that they were also speaking Arabic.                 Thankfully, the three students survived the shooting, but two of them were admitted to the intensive care unit and one “has sustained very critical and serious injuries,” according to the ADC. The story is still developing, and police say they are currently looking into the white male shooter’s motive.                 Tragically, however, 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume didn’t survive his stabbing by a man who allegedly targeted the boy for his Muslim faith. He was charged with murder and two counts of a hate crime, among other charges, and he has pleaded not guilty.                 The question is: What can each of us do to counter the hate and make it clear that we won’t allow bigotry to become normalized against any community? One of the best responses is what we saw in New York City after Seldowitz’s hate-filled rants got widespread attention: Elected officials and neighbors came together to stand with the 24-year-old Egyptian food cart worker, Mohamed Hussein, who was subjected to the rants.     Opinion: Being a Muslim American right now is like living on borrowed time             Even before Seldowitiz was charged, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said on social media: “This Islamophobic bigotry is absolutely reprehensible. No one in this city should be subjected to this venom.”                 But it was the response of people in the neighborhood — which deserves far more media attention — that was truly moving. As CBS New York reported, “what happened at the food cart has seemingly only brought people together.” One of the food cart workers, Bahaa Hassan, told CBS: “We have mostly Jewish customer in this building. [Two customers] made cake for us last night.”                 It wasn’t long before people from the neighborhood set up a table next to the food cart in an effort to encourage people to sit, eat and talk together. As Upper East Side resident Stephanie Merabet told CBS about the workers, “They’re really wonderful people and they care about the community that they’re in, and they certainly don’t deserve this.”                 These actions send a powerful message that we will not allow hate to go unchallenged. In this vein, my longtime friend Max Brooks — author of “World War Z,” “The Zombie Survival Guide” and more – asked me to join him in making a short video to counter hate against Jews, Arabs and Muslims. Unbeknownst to us at the time, we filmed this video last weekend in the very neighborhood where Seldowitz had been taunting the Arab food cart worker.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             Max and I have often been told that we look similar. There is good reason for that. We are both half-Italian and half-Semitic. In Max’s case, his Semitic half is Jewish — from his father, Mel Brooks — while my Semitic heritage comes from my late Palestinian father, Abdul. (And yes, Arabs and Jews are both Semites!)                 Each of us can — and must — play a role in countering hate. In a nation as populous as the United States, there will always be some amount of bigotry. It’s how we respond to the hate that matters.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Stuart Seldowitz, 64, pleaded not guilty Thursday to two counts of fourth-degree hate crime/stalking and one count of second-degree aggravated harassment, court records show.                 Seldowitz was released without bail, according to court records. CNN has reached out to his attorney, Scott Laurence Bookstein, for comment.                 Before his arrest was announced, Seldowitz confirmed to CNN in an email it is him in the videos, which were recorded by a vendor from inside a food cart on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and appear to be from different days.                 In the videos posted online this month, Seldowitz mocks Islam, taunts the man about his citizenship status, accuses him of supporting Hamas and references the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.                 “You support killing little children,” Seldowitz says to the vendor in one video. The vendor retorts, “You kill children, not me.”                 Seldowitz replies, “If we killed 4,000 Palestinian children, you know what? It wasn’t enough!”                 The videos come as the US is experiencing an “unprecedented” increase in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, according to the Council on American-Islamic relations.                 At the same time, the reports of antisemitic incidents across the country have also spiked, with FBI Director Christopher Wray saying last month the threat was reaching “historic levels” and the Anti-Defamation League reporting a 388% increase in reported incidents in the weeks following October 7, compared to the same period last year.                 Tensions over the ongoing war in Gaza have also been high in New York City in recent weeks as pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been taking place.                 In one of the videos posted online, Seldowitz tells the vendor, “We’re going to put big signs here saying this guy believes in Hamas.”                 In another video, Seldowitz asks the man whether he’s familiar with Egypt’s General Intelligence Service, better known as the Mukhabarat.                 “Mukhabarat in Egypt will get your parents,” Seldowitz says to the vendor. “Does your father like his fingernails? They’ll take them out one by one.”                 The former government official then holds up his phone, says, “Smile for me,” and laughs.                 Seldowitz also makes derogatory comments about the Prophet Mohammed, ridiculing Islam, which he appears to believe is the vendor’s religion.                 When asked via email for additional comment on the videos, Seldowitz said, “Happy to talk (Wednesday). What was absent from the video is what (the vendor) said before the video.”     ‘Every move I make, I second guess’: These Muslim and Arab Americans say the surge in hate has made them more vigilant             Seldowitz, 64, told the Daily Beast while he started up the conversation with the food vendor about current affairs, the video clips only show one side of the story. He told the outlet the vendor instigated the interaction by allegedly expressing his support for Hamas.                 The former official also told City & State, “I regret the whole thing happened and I’m sorry.” He added, “But you know, in the heat of the moment, I said things that probably I shouldn’t have said.”                 Seldowitz served as acting director for the National Security Council South Asia Directorate in the early 2000s, according to a since-removed profile page on lobbying group Gotham Government Relations’ website. According to his LinkedIn profile, Seldowitz served in the position from February 2009 to January 2011 during former President Barack Obama’s administration.                 “Gotham Government Relations has ended all affiliation with Stuart Seldowitz, an individual who hasn’t contributed to our work in years,” a statement on the New York City-based group’s website reads. “The video of his actions is vile, racist, and beneath the dignity of the standards we practice at our firm.”                 The managing director of an advocacy group representing street vendors across New York City told CNN on Tuesday the man who took the videos told him Seldowitz had been tormenting his food cart since November 8.                 Mohamed Attia, of the Street Vendor Project, said the vendor told him he did not instigate the conversation with Seldowitz.                 Attia said the Egyptian-born vendor, identified only by his first name, Mohamed, doesn’t speak English well and for that reason doesn’t engage in many conversations with his customers, let alone complicated and nuanced conversations about war.                 “Mohamed told me he doesn’t know how to respond to or know what to say to the guy and kept playing it safe by asking the guy to go away,” Attia told CNN.                 The advocacy group is “appalled by the racist Islamophobia” seen in the videos, they said in a statement, adding the vendors at the center of this incident “feared speaking out would put them at risk of displacement.”                 “No one should have to choose between harassment or displacement,” the statement posted on social media reads.                 New York City Council member Julie Menin reached out to the organization and reported the incidents to police, Attia said.                 “This is vile hate speech and harassment and truly abhorrent,” Menin tweeted Tuesday. “There is no place for hate in our community and city.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Nicole was walking through an affluent part of Alexandria, Virginia, with a friend last month, when a man approached her and began screaming.                 He railed about the hijab she wore, saying she looked Muslim, and made comments about Hamas raping Israeli women, she said. Her friend corroborated the account.                 It was just days after the start of the Israel-Hamas war and the encounter left Nicole feeling rattled, worried and frightened. So much so, that she asked CNN to use only her first name, out of fear for her family’s safety.                 “I haven’t stopped wearing hijab. I didn’t after 9/11 either,” she told CNN. “If I have one more person scream at me in public and certainly if someone were to threaten me, I think all bets are off.”                 Nicole, who is in her 40s, said she’s been wearing a hijab for more than half of her life. And while she’s grown used to stares and occasional comments about her headscarf, Nicole said she fears the growing anti-Muslim sentiment in the US could escalate into violence.                 The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said the US is experiencing an “unprecedented” increase in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the weeks since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.                 A week after the Hamas attack, a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy was stabbed to death outside of Chicago. His family’s landlord was charged in what police are calling a hate crime. He’s pleaded not guilty to charges including murder.                 A Muslim postal worker was attacked while wearing a hijab, and many Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian Americans leaders have told CNN they are experiencing post-9/11 levels Islamophobia – or worse. They’ve called on the Biden administration to do more to combat anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias.                 CNN recently asked Arabs, Muslims and Jews in America how they are facing the new reality of hate-motivated attacks against their communities. Nearly 800 people responded from across the country.                 Some, citing safety concerns, are changing how they go about their daily lives. Others have become defiant and more vocal about their identity. These are their stories.                 Although Abdallah Jwayyed has been a registered gun owner for years, he said his gun remained locked away in a safe – until now.                 As reports of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab attacks rose across the country, Jwayyed said he began carrying his concealed weapon when he goes out around his Cleveland, Ohio, home and when he’s shopping with his wife.                 He’s also removed the Palestinian flag hanging from his rear-view mirror and peeled the Allah bumper stickers off his car. He doesn’t want anyone to slash his tires or break his windows, he said.           CAIR received 1,283 requests for help and reports of bias in the month after Hamas attacked Israel. This marks a 216% percent increase in requests for help and reports of bias compared to the previous year, CAIR said.                 The Palestinian American is proud of his heritage, but he said he is doing everything he can to protect his wife and three children.                 “We’re tired of having to hide the fact that we’re Muslim or to hide the fact that we’re Palestinian,” Jwayyed said. “We have to hide who we are to live safely in America.”                 As a father, Jwayyed said he was crushed by the news that a 6-year-old boy was stabbed to death near Chicago. Officials have said Wadea Al-Fayoume was killed because he was Muslim.                 “I have a 7-year-old son, I have a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old daughter. Of course, that affects me,” Jwayyed said. “As a parent, it scares me.”                 Since the war, the 34-year-old said he has stopped taking his children on weekly excursions to the movies and local parks. Now, Jwayyed said they only go to school or to a relative’s house.                 “Baba, why don’t you take us out this week?” he said his children have asked.                 “I don’t want to tell them, ‘I fear for your life. It’s dangerous outside,’” Jwayyed said. “They don’t need to know that.”                 Jwayyed lives in the Little Arabia neighborhood, which is full of Middle Eastern stores and restaurants, but he said he is no longer shopping at stores that carry Israeli products, like his wife’s favorite brand of chips. Instead, he said, the family agreed to stop buying the snacks after the war started and now they only shop at an Arab grocery store.                 “Anything Israeli made, I will boycott it,” Jwayyed said. “And not just any Israeli company, any company that’s sympathizing with Israel will not get my money.”                 Since October 7, Mona said daily activities she used to enjoy have become anxiety-inducing. She’s now limiting her trips to the grocery store, taking her kids to the park and driving alone out of fear of being targeted for being a Muslim woman who wears a hijab and dresses modestly.                 “As a visibly Muslim woman, I’m fearful that I will be targeted,” she said. “Every move I make, I second guess it.”                 Mona, who is in her 30s, asked CNN not to use her last name out of fear for her family’s safety.                 She said she traces her fear and anxiety to the outset of the war and the spike in hate crimes against the Muslim community. As a health care worker near Houston, Texas, she said she was especially heartbroken over the October 28 fatal stabbing of Houston-area Muslim pediatrician Dr. Talat Jehan Khan.                 While local police have said they have not yet found evidence linking Khan’s death to a hate crime, Mona said the attack on Khan has left her shaken.                 “That also makes you think, ‘What, am I going to be next?’”                 She is avoiding social gatherings and meeting in public with her friends who are also visibly Muslim, so they are “not a target collectively.” She’s also not publicly showing empathy and solidarity toward Gaza, out of concern, she said, of being targeted or attacked.                 Instead, Mona now wears a necklace in the shape of the Palestinian territory underneath her clothing – close to her heart – in quiet solidarity.                 Yasmeen Abou-Sayed said she refuses to change the way she lives.                 Instead, since the war began, she said she’s become more civically engaged and has been calling out anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiment when she sees it.                 When her children’s school district posted a statement condemning antisemitism but neglected to mention Islamophobia, the 41-year-old from suburban Washington, D.C., and other parents reached out to the superintendent and the board of education.                 She asked us not to name the school district out of fear for the safety of her children, who have a different last name.                 “Being an afterthought … we had to, as parents, mobilize, reach out to the superintendent and the board of education and point out that their statement completely excluded the experiences of our Muslim and Arab students in the schools,” Abou-Sayed said.                 The next day, the superintendent posted an updated statement acknowledging that Islamophobia should also have been included, according to two statements reviewed by CNN.                 “I will always advocate for myself. I will always advocate for my kids,” Abou-Sayed said. “But it’s just kind of tiring that you always have to take those extra steps to be seen.”                 While anti-Muslim sentiment is nothing new in America, Abou-Sayed said her perspective has shifted since the war began. She said she will now talk to her sons about how some people might view them as they become Muslim men.                 “I never thought about preparing them a little bit more for how the world is going to treat them until now,” she said.                 “I do wear hijab,” she said. “I won’t change the way I live my life because the second you compromise your own values and principles, what are you living for?”                 Abou-Sayed said she remains proud and unwavering about her identity.                 “I will continue in my day-to-day activities, taking my kids to soccer and their clubs at school and doing the things that we do,” Abou-Sayed said. “We’re not going to change our lives because of this, but I will be more vigilant.”     This story has been updated with additional details.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/15/media/elon-musk-antisemitism-white-people/index.html,Elon Musk agrees with antisemitic X post that claims Jews ‘push hatred’ against White people,"Agreeing with an antisemitic post on his social media platform X, Elon Musk concurred that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.”","Nov 17, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,David Goldman,International,"Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index              Latest Market News              Hot Stocks              Agreeing with an antisemitic post on his social media platform X, Elon Musk endorsed the claim that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.”                 An X post Wednesday afternoon said: “Jewish communties (sic) have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.” The post also referenced “hordes of minorities” flooding Western countries, a popular antisemitic conspiracy theory.                 In response, Musk said: “You have said the actual truth.”                 The antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews want to bring undocumented minority populations into Western countries to reduce White majorities in those nations has been espoused by online hate groups and echoed by Robert Bowers, the convicted killer of 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. It was the deadliest attack against Jews in American history.                 Musk, in subsequent posts, said he does not believe hatred of White people extends “to all Jewish communities.” But he said the Anti-Defamation League “unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel. This is because they cannot, by their own tenets, criticize the minority groups who are their primary threat.”                 It’s unclear what Musk was referring to. Antisemitic incidents in the United States reached a record high in 2022, according to the ADL. Although the ADL said the increase in antisemitism isn’t because of a single group, the organization noted that antisemitic activity coordinated by White supremacist groups doubled last year, according to a March audit.                 Yet Musk suggested that the ADL promotes racism against White people.                 “I am deeply offended by ADL’s messaging and any other groups who push de facto anti-white racism or anti-Asian racism or racism of any kind,” he said. “I’m sick of it. Stop now,” Musk said of the ADL.                 X did not respond to requests for comment.                 In a post on X Thursday, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt accused Musk of pushing antisemitism.                 “At a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one’s influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories,” he wrote.”                 The ADL has been critical of X, particularly since Musk took control of the platform over a year ago. The ADL, the Center for Countering Digital Hate and similar organizations have reported surging hate speech on X over the past year – findings that Musk has criticized or denied.                 Musk in September threatened to sue the ADL for defamation, claiming that the organization’s reports have hurt advertising sales on X. In a statement last month, the ADL said: “Any allegation that ADL has somehow orchestrated a boycott of X or caused billions of dollars of losses to the company or is ‘pulling the strings’ for other advertisers is false.”                 Greenblatt said Musk’s statements about the group have amplified a campaign of antisemitic hate against the organization.                 In early October, after pausing its advertising campaign on X, the ADL said it would resume its ads on the platform “to bring our important message on fighting hate to X and its users.”                 The White House on Friday fired back at Musk’s post.                 “It is unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of Antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN. “We condemn this abhorrent promotion of Antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms, which runs against our core values as Americans.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/business/islamophobia-antisemitism-law-firms/index.html,Law firms accused of fueling Islamophobia and chilling free speech,A coalition of Muslim bar associations is accusing leading law firms of contributing to Islamophobia and a climate of fear in the legal community.,"Nov 15, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Matt Egan,International,"Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index              Latest Market News              Hot Stocks               A coalition of Muslim bar associations is accusing leading law firms of contributing to Islamophobia and a climate of fear in the legal community.                 In a letter to more than 100 of America’s top law firms, 13 national and regional bar associations called for the law firms to address Islamophobia and anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian hate.                 “Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and other legal professionals, including many attorneys of color and Jewish attorneys, are terrified to openly express sympathy for the plight of Palestinians for fear of retribution,” the letter said. “Many legal professionals of Palestinian or Arab heritage, or who identify as Muslim are even afraid to reveal their heritage or religious affiliation to their colleagues.”                 The members of the Muslim bar associations said they were “dismayed” that there was only a “brief reference” to Islamophobia in the recent letter that leading law firms sent warning elite universities to crack down on antisemitism on campus or else the schools and their students would face consequences. That November 1 letter said there is “no room for antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism or any other form of violence, hatred or bigotry on your campuses, in our workplaces or our communities.”                 The firms said they were concerned about: reports of antisemitism on campuses, “including rallies calling for the death of Jews and the elimination of the State of Israel.”                 The competing letters from law firms and Muslim bar associations underscores the complex situation facing employers as tensions and emotions remain high following last month’s Hamas terror attack on Israel and as the Hamas-Israel war continues.                 The new letter, sent Monday, went out to leading law firms including Davis Polk; Dechert; Kirkland & Ellis; Paul, Weiss; and Sullivan & Cromwell. Dechert declined CNN’s request for a comment.                 It notes that while some law firms issued statements of support for Israel after the October 7th attacks, in the weeks since some firms “refused to even acknowledge the killing of thousands of innocent Palestinians” even though employees have loved ones killed in Gaza.                 The letter, signed by the American Muslim Bar Association, the National Association of Muslim Lawyers and other groups, added that some law firms raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of Israel but did not raise money for humanitarian assistance for innocent Palestinians.                 The Muslim bar associations took issue with the November 1 letter to law school deans focusing primarily on antisemitism, arguing that contributes to an “environment of chilling speech advocating for Palestinian human rights.”                 “Taken together, the message being sent is that Israeli and Jewish lives matter,” the letter said, “but Palestinian, Arab and Muslim lives do not.”                 The Muslim bar associations called for law firms to take a series of steps, including issuing a new letter to law school deans addressing Islamophobia, acknowledging the “equal humanity” of Palestinians and Israelis, “equally condemn the killing of all civilians,” launch educational programs on Islamophobia and engage in pro bono opportunities aimed at fighting Islamophobia.                 The November 1 letter was spearheaded by Joe Shenker, senior chair of Sullivan & Cromwell.                 A representative for the New York-based law firm did not respond to a request for comment.                 “Everyone at our law firms is entitled to be treated with respect and be free of any conduct that targets their identity and is offensive, hostile, intimidating or inconsistent with their personal dignity and rights,” the letter said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/opinions/trump-ridiculous-terrorism-claim-bergen/index.html,Opinion: Trump’s ridiculous terrorism claim,Peter Bergen writes that Trump can’t simply write off any terrorism that was committed by far right-wing groups – including the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.,"Nov 14, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Peter Bergen,International,"Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America, a professor of practice at Arizona State University, and the host of the Audible podcast “In the Room” also on Apple and Spotify. He is the author of several books about terrorism, including most recently, “The Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World.”               On the campaign trail on Saturday, Donald Trump asserted that there was no terrorism in the US when he was the president, a claim that is false in myriad ways.                 It’s not the first time he has made the claim, which is also linked to Trump’s plans, should he become president again, to bring back a “Muslim ban” that blocked or made it very difficult to travel to the US from several Muslim-majority countries.                 Despite Trump’s much-vaunted travel ban, there was plenty of terrorism on his watch as the 45th president of the United States.     Opinion: Trump’s mental gaffes can’t be ignored             On October 31, 2017, Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek resident of the US who was inspired by ISIS, plowed a truck into a group of pedestrians in Manhattan, killing eight and wounding 11.                 Two years later, a member of the Saudi military shot and killed three American sailors and wounded eight others at the US Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida.                 During Trump’s presidency, there were also multiple lethal attacks by far-right terrorists, most notably on August 3, 2019, when a white nationalist went on a shooting rampage at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killing 23 people who he believed were Hispanic immigrants, according to the US Department of Justice.                 Also, the most lethal antisemitic attack ever in the United States took place on October 27, 2018, when a terrorist killed eleven people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.                 It seems, at least in Trump’s mind, that lethal acts of terrorism carried out by far-right terrorists don’t count as terrorism.                 Trump, of course, also helped to instigate one of the most spectacular acts of domestic terrorism in American history when he egged on a mob of thousands of his supporters to march on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, which triggered a riot that injured 114 Capitol Police officers, according to a bipartisan US Senate investigation. The riot also led to the deaths of five people.             As for Trump’s remedy to the terrorism problem, his plans to resurrect his so-called Muslim ban go beyond a simple repeat, as he said during a campaign stop in Iowa in July: “When I return to the office, the travel ban is coming back even bigger than before and much stronger than before. We don’t want people blowing up our shopping centers.”     Opinion: Republicans only care about the debt when a Democrat is president             When Trump was in office, the travel ban faced various legal challenges but was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court and included visitors to the US from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen as well as North Korea and Venezuela.                 The ban, of course, did nothing to impede the Uzbek terrorist who killed eight people in Manhattan or the Saudi terrorist who killed three sailors in Pensacola. Nor did it do anything to stop the domestic terrorists that are already here in the US.                 Terrorism did not disappear with Trump, and his proposed “solution,” were he to become president again – amping up the Muslim travel ban – likely won’t accomplish much of anything.                 If he were really serious about trying to reduce the number of victims of terrorism in the US, an excellent place to start would be restricting the ability to purchase the kinds of semi-automatic rifles that were used in the atrocities at the Walmart in El Paso, and the synagogue in Pittsburgh.                 The likelihood that Trump would do much of anything on gun control is, of course, remote. In April, speaking at the National Rifle Association annual meeting, Trump boasted, “I was proud to be the most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment president you’ve ever had in the White House,” adding, “This is not a gun problem, this is a mental health problem, this is a social problem, this is a cultural problem, this is a spiritual problem.”                 As for Trump having any kind of second thoughts about the mayhem he helped unleash during the January 6 riot, forget it. When he was asked at a CNN town hall last year, if he would pardon the rioters who were convicted of federal offenses, he said he was “inclined to pardon many of them.”                 At the same CNN town hall, Trump referred to January 6 as a “beautiful day.” Trump has made a lot of bizarro claims over the years, but this must surely rank among his wackiest.  My wife and I live in Washington, DC, and we were so unnerved by the violence unfolding at the Capitol that we picked up our kids early from school. This was not a beautiful day, but one of the grimmest the Republic has seen in a long time.             As Trump spends more time on the campaign trail, we will surely be seeing more factually challenged statements of this type.                 Fact-checking those statements will likely have zero impact on the MAGA faithful, but it may provide some small solace for those who labor in the fact-based world.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group said it has received 1,283 requests for help and reports of bias in the month since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The organization said in 2022 it received an average of 406 complaints in a 29-day period.                 The new data, CAIR said, reflects a 216% increase in requests for help and reported bias incidents compared to the previous year.                 Corey Saylor, director of research and advocacy at CAIR, said in a statement shared with CNN that the data represents the largest wave of Islamophobic and anti-Arab bias the organization has recorded since then-candidate Donald Trump called for a Muslim Ban in 2015.     American Arabs, Muslims and Jews: How has the Israel-Hamas war changed you?             “The Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian rhetoric that have been used to both justify violence against Palestinians in Gaza and silence supporters of Palestinian human rights here in America has contributed to this unprecedented surge in bigotry,” Saylor said in the statement.                 Throughout the year, CAIR records and monitors incidents of reported anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias from local chapters across the country.                 The new data reflects a sharp pivot from CAIR’s cautiously optimistic outlook earlier this year, when the organization published a report noting 2022 was the first time the US charted a decrease in anti-Muslim bias incidents since they began tracking such reports in the 1990s.                 “One year of declining cases is not a problem solved; it’s a glimmer of hope,” the organization said in the April report. “Securing future declines has never been more urgent.”                 But now, Saylor said, the violence in Israel and Gaza is contributing to an “unprecedented surge in bigotry” in the US. The organization again called on President Joe Biden to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.                 Saylor also urged Biden to do more to address anti-Muslim hate, noting that President George W. Bush visited a mosque in the days after 9/11 to address the rise in Islamophobia.                 All Americans including “political leaders, corporations, media outlets, civic organizations” have a role to play in combatting the increase in anti-Muslim rhetoric, Saylor said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

He is unequivocal: There is no place for hate in America against anyone. Period,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in statement.                 The strategy, a joint effort led by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Security Council, aims to create a comprehensive and detailed plan to protect Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim “because of their race, national origin, ancestry, or any other reason, from discrimination, hate, bigotry, and violence,” said a White House official. The White House will be partnering with local communities on coming up with the strategy.                 “For too long, Muslims in America, and those perceived to be Muslim, such as Arabs and Sikhs, have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks and other discriminatory incidents,” Jean-Pierre said. “Moving forward, the President, Vice President, and our entire Administration will continue working to ensure every American has the freedom to live their lives in safety and without fear for how they pray, what they believe, and who they are.”     Democrats’ big tent includes most Jewish and Muslim Americans             The initiative comes as Israel’s war with Hamas – which has seen a rising number of civilian deaths in Gaza –- has increased fears of Islamophobia in the United States, and some of the nation’s largest Muslim American groups have denounced Biden’s approach to the conflict.                 The president on Wednesday traveled to Minnesota – which has a sizable and growing Muslim population – and promised to continue to press Israel to adhere to international laws protecting civilians in conflict and to push for increased aid to Gaza. But Biden’s standing has taken a deep hit among Muslim Americans in recent weeks with polls having shown a drop-off in support as anger swells over his handling of the Mideast crisis.                 Last week, a small group of Muslim American leaders had a private meeting with the president and called on Biden to show more empathy toward Palestinian lives after he cast doubt on civilian death figures in Gaza, two attendees told CNN.                 Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a key Muslim American ally of Biden who attended the meeting, reiterated the call Wednesday after hearing the president speak, telling CNN that forceful remarks from Biden on protecting civilians could “reduce the likelihood” of Israeli strikes like the one that destroyed part of the Jabalya refugee camp.                 The president expressed support for a humanitarian pause to allow for the release of hostages in Gaza Wednesday evening, in response to a protester calling for a ceasefire during a closed-door fundraiser.                 “I understand the emotion,” Biden said, while still stopping short of endorsing a ceasefire. “This is incredibly complicated for the Israelis. It’s incredibly complicated for the Muslim world as well.”                 New graf: Some groups, many of whom led door-to-door voting campaigns for Biden in 2020, have warned that the president’s approach could become a political liability as he seeks reelection. Earlier Wednesday, local Muslim leaders announced an effort to get Muslim American voters to withhold their support for Biden’s 2024 bid after he failed to endorse a ceasefire.     CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that local Muslim leaders are working in their personal capacity to withhold support from the president’s reelection bid.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York described the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a notably conservative, pro-Israel group, as “an extremist organization that destabilizes US democracy” on Tuesday after it criticized a Republican who voted with nine Democrats against a recent House resolution supporting Israel.     Democratic divisions over Israel spill into public view as conflict escalates             Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan – the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress and who, like Ocasio-Cortez, is a member of the so-called “Squad” of young, progressive lawmakers of color – issued a warning to Biden last month at a rally where she called for a ceasefire in Gaza.                 “President Biden, not all of America is with you on this one, and you need to wake up and understand that,” she said, before using the term “genocide” to describe civilian casualties caused by Israel’s military strikes.                 International law defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” But the term has an important historical meaning in the context of the Holocaust, which targeted Jews and other groups and makes it controversial to use with regard to Israel.                 Tlaib joined 15 other Democrats and one Republican in either opposing or voting “present” on the resolution expressing support for Israel, arguing it “rightly mourns the thousands of Israeli civilians killed and wounded in the horrific attacks but explicitly does not mourn the thousands of Palestinian civilians.”                 CNN’s MJ Lee and Kevin Liptak report Wednesday that Biden’s White House is agonizing over the civilian casualties and how to appropriately pressure Israel.     They write: The wide-scale casualties in Gaza are weighing heavily on senior US officials, who are ratcheting up the pressure – both in private and in public – on the Israelis to contain civilian deaths. That pressure has originated from the president on down: Concerns about the safety of Palestinian civilians was front and center yet again when Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone on Sunday.             Tlaib, meanwhile, faced possible censure by the House of Representatives Wednesday evening. A politically motivated resolution offered by Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was blocked, however, and a resolution put forward by a Democrat to censure Greene in retaliation was not scheduled Wednesday. Greene has herself repeatedly been accused of antisemitism.                 It’s hard to find good estimates about the exact number of Jewish and Muslim Americans. PRRI, an independent research organization, conducted what it called a Census of American Religion in 2020 and estimated that about 1% of Americans identify as Jewish and 1% identify as Muslim.                 Both populations tend to be more supportive of Democrats, who have prioritized appealing to non-Christian and non-White minorities.                 PRRI modeled maps with population estimates for each religion. While Jewish Americans are focused in particular areas, including Florida, the Northeast and the West Coast, Muslim Americans are more spread around the country, including in key swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, and in other states that could be competitive like Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, Minnesota and Florida.                 Those are important details headed into what will be a hotly contested presidential election that could again be decided by small margins in a few states.                 It’s hard to believe a shift could happen among Muslim voters toward Republicans. The GOP’s current front-runner, former President Donald Trump, after all, pushed hard for a ban on all Muslims entering the US during his first run for the White House. And Republicans for now appear to be more united behind Israel than Democrats. But a drop in voter turnout could have consequences.                 All three Muslim members of Congress are Democrats, and they all opposed the resolution supporting Israel. In addition to Tlaib, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota has been the subject of controversy with regard to her comments about Israel.                 Rep. Andre Carson, the Indiana Democrat, became angry in a recent interview with CNN’s Manu Raju, calling a Jewish colleague, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, a “punk” for his criticism of his peers who voted against the House resolution supporting Israel. Gottheimer said those who opposed the resolution were “despicable” and said they don’t speak for the party.                 Twenty-four members of the House identify as Jewish, according to the Congressional Research Service and all but two of them are Democrats, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.                 Simply having ties to a religion and a place is not necessarily predictive of a policy position, however. Back in 2016, as they fought for the Democratic presidential nomination, Clinton tangled with Bernie Sanders – the independent senator from Vermont who spent time on a kibbutz in his early years – over how to both support Israel and protect the human rights of Palestinians.                 The arguments they made at a debate in New York hosted by CNN resonate today. Clinton refused to admit that Israel’s reaction to terror attacks was disproportionate to the attacks, as Sanders said.                 “As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run – and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region, which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity,” Sanders said back then.                 That aligns with his current position, which is that Israel has a right to defend itself after horrific terror attacks, but there should also be a humanitarian pause of Israeli attacks on Gaza.

Sign up here.             Through the narrow streets of the Jabal Al-Hussein refugee camp in the Jordanian capital Amman, the mood is clear.                     “Palestine! No America, No America… Palestine,” a local fruit seller shouts amid the market crowds.                     Established more than seventy years ago by the United Nations, the community is now home to more than 30,000 Palestinian refugees, descendants of some of the more than 700,000 who were expelled or fled their homes in what is now Israel following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Israelis call it the War of Independence. To Arabs, that event is known as the Nakba, or catastrophe.                Families in this camp, now a built-up urban community, know exile all too well, denied the right to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. According to the United Nations, there are now some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of that 1948 generation of exiles.                  These refugees say it is a life sentence of separation from family, friends, and their homeland. And for those with loved ones still in Gaza, they say it is a sentence to the cruelest form of anguish.         UN says fuel shortages will halt Gaza aid operations by the end of Wednesday             Israel launched a massive air offensive on the enclave that is home to more than two million Palestinians after Hamas militants from Gaza killed 1,400 people in a brazen attack inside Israel on October 7, and kidnapped more than 200.                    Camp resident Abdel-Munim Dababsheh, 49, says his family moved to Jordan after the 1967 war, when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza from Egypt. He says he left behind most of his family.                     He has lost several family members in successive Israeli wars in Gaza, he says. His mother was killed in 2009 and his sister in 2012, and his aunt and oldest daughter died in the latest round of Israeli airstrikes. “At any given moment, I could get a phone call telling me that my sister and her children have also been killed.        At least 2,789 Palestinian civilians were killed in Gaza in the past 15 years, according to the United Nations, often in operations Israel says were launched to target Hamas and other militant groups.                   The overall death toll in Gaza from the current conflict is now at more than 5,000, according to Palestinian health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave, just over two weeks since Israel launched its relentless air campaign.                     Despite the rising civilian death toll and the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation, Israel has vowed to intensify its aerial bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, and expand it to a multi-pronged operation in the coming days, as it says it seeks to wipe out Hamas, which has been designated by Israel, the European Union and the US as a terrorist organization.                    And with Israel’s thousands of punishing strikes, the fear of history repeating itself – of another Nakba – is being felt across the region.                    While Israel has not said it aims to evict Gazans to Egypt or elsewhere, fears of such prospects arose after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) asked Gazans to evacuate the strip’s north and move southwards, as their military operation continued, as well as after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was in talks with Egypt and Israel to establish a humanitarian corridor in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula for Americans and other civilians fleeing Gaza.                    On Sunday, Blinken said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Israel has “absolutely no intent” to run Gaza.                    But the prospect of hundreds of thousands more Palestinians being forcibly displaced to neighboring countries, or even further afield, is being condemned across the Arab world.                  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said last week that a transfer of Palestinians from Gaza would likely be followed by a similar “expulsion of Palestinians from the West Bank to Jordan.” Jordan’s foreign minister later said such a move would be considered a declaration of “war.”                   Commentators on Arab media outlets have warned that Israel may be planning to de-populate the Gaza Strip of Palestinians and even re-occupy it.                    But some Palestinians would rather die than be made refugees once again.                    “Of course, no one wants to go to Egypt. It’s impossible. My relatives refuse it, I refuse it. This is displacement. Gaza is their home. They will stay there even if it means being wiped out by an airstrike,” Dababsheh says of his relatives.                     Palestinians, he says, won’t accept being displaced this time. “The new generation will not allow it,” he says. “They put their foot down.”                     Of Gaza’s more than 2 million people, 1.7 million are refugees, according to UNRWA.                      “The Israelis were always adamant about no return of refugees, and that’s why the Palestinians cling to… the right of return,” Jordanian Senator Mustafa Hamarneh says, adding that 75 years later, the Arab world has still not recovered from the loss of the Palestinian homeland.                    “I don’t think the West realizes the depth of the collective shame we feel as a result of 1948 and the sense of injustice that has been inflicted upon us that we need to correct this. There is a very deep sense of shame, that what happened to us in 1948 shouldn’t have happened,” Hamarneh says. “Any new mass eviction of Palestinian refugees, for us, is a repeat of 1948.”                     Israeli officials have said they have “no interest” in reoccupying Gaza. Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops from the territory and pulled out Jewish settlers in 2005.                   The struggle of the Palestinians is felt especially keenly in Jordan, where more than half of the population is either Palestinian or of Palestinian descent – including more than two million Palestinian refugees.        Biden snubbed by Middle East allies as Arab world seethes over Gaza hospital blast              But that passion for the Palestinian cause resonates across the Arab world that is home to more than 450 million people.                     In a fiery exchange with CNN’s Clarissa Ward at the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza that went viral on social media last week, an Egyptian activist shouted that despite attempts to “divide” Arabs, “we stand with the Palestinians, and we stand with Arabs.”                    The activist, Rahma Zein, was one of many Arabs around the region impassioned by the war, bloody images from which have made their way to almost every Arab news channel and social media platform.                    For more than two weeks now, protests in solidarity with the Palestinians have erupted in countries including Lebanon, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Iran. Hundreds of thousands have also taken to the streets of several European capitals and US cities, all calling for an end to Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza strip, and to the 17-year blockade of the territory.                     Young people from across the Arab world have chanted the very same rallying cries their parents and grandparents chanted before them. This is a multi-generational cause which, more than 75 years since the dispossession of the Palestinians, has not diminished in salience in the region.                    “For much of the Arab world, the question of Palestine represents the last colonized Arab people trying to gain their freedom,” said H.A. Hellyer, an international security studies expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute in London.                     While Arab states have tended to focus on problems closer to home in recent years, the latest war “has driven the Palestine question back onto the agenda,” he said.                     For many protesters, the demonstrations are not an expression of support for Hamas, nor an expression of indifference to the killing of Israeli civilians. Many protesters say they believe this crisis began long before the October 7 attacks, citing what they say is decades-long Israeli oppression of the Palestinians.                    In the Iraqi capital Baghdad, which saw hundreds of protesters take to the streets over the weekend, 45-year-old Ahmed El-Saied said that in recent years Western governments compelled Arab states and their populations to forget the Palestinian issue, especially as Arabs grappled with “internal and sectarian conflicts.”                    In Egypt, where mass protests were allowed Friday for the first time in a decade, Alya, who took part in the protest, said that the recent wave of Arab normalization deals with Israel brought on a sense of “defeatism.”                     “What we saw after October 7, however, was a shocking reminder to ourselves and the world that actually, this entire situation hasn’t been normalized,” said Alya, who only gave her first name due to fear of reprisal from the authorities.                      Analysts say Arab fears of another displacement of Palestinians are particularly heightened due to inflammatory rhetoric that has come from some members of Israel’s right-wing government in the past.                    Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich in 2017, as a member of parliament, wrote in an essay that emigration of Palestinians should be encouraged and incentivized, adding that the notion that emigration is cruel is “absurd.” The process, he argued, should not be “a cruel expulsion” but be done in a manner that is “planned, willing, and based on a desire for a better life.”                     More recently, he caused an outcry in March after calling for the Palestinian village of Huwara to be “erased” following the murder of two Israeli settlers in the town in a Palestinian attack, which led to revenge rampages by Israeli settlers that one of Israel’s top military generals later called a “pogrom.”               Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was convicted of anti-Arab racism by an Israeli court decades before joining the government and was once a follower of Meir Kahane, a Jewish fanatic who openly called for the expulsion of Palestinians. Ben Gvir’s wife, Ayala Nimrodi, has been cited as saying she wishes to “get rid of” the Palestinians.    Queen Rania of Jordan accuses West of 'glaring double standard' as the death toll rises in besieged Gaza             When asked about the rhetoric of his right-wing coalition partners, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it is his hands that are “on the wheel.”                   Hellyer said that this kind of rhetoric has given Arabs good reason to fear that the expulsion of Palestinians may indeed be on the table.                     “I don’t think it’s unusual (that) many in the Arab world would take them seriously at their word, especially considering the reality that in every previous situation where Palestinians left Palestinian territory, they were never allowed to go back,” Hellyer said.                    Hanya Sabawi, a Palestinian who left Gaza as an infant but whose family remain in the enclave, told CNN she doesn’t know whether her family will have homes to go back to.                     “And the biggest fear of course, is that they’re going to be evacuated and turned into refugees. This is what everyone is now openly talking about, as if they didn’t matter,” she said. “They don’t want to move. They would rather die in Gaza than move.”         CNN’s Claudia Otto and Aqeel Najim contributed to this report.

Israel’s war on Hamas followed the militant group’s surprise attack on Israel on October 7, when terrorists brutally killed 1,400 people in Israel, including civilians and military personnel, and abducted over 200 others, according to the Israel Defense Forces.                  What’s happening in the Middle East has had a ripple effect on major cities like New York: Advocates and community leaders say there have been a slew of hate-inspired incidents targeting Jews, Palestinians, Muslims and other groups in the wake of the initial attacks. In one case, a victim was allegedly targeted just because they were perceived to be a member of one of these groups.      Opinion: Being a Muslim American right now is like living on borrowed time             New York City is home to the largest Jewish population outside of Israel and has one of the country’s largest Muslim populations. In 2001, following the 9/11 terror attacks, anti-Muslim motivated crimes became the second highest reported among religious-bias incidents, according to FBI data. Anti-Jewish religion incidents were the highest.      'Anxiety and fear are high:' US Palestinians, Muslims fear a return to post-9/11 Islamophobia A recent joint bulletin from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center noted “the FBI has seen an increase in reports of threats against faith communities, particularly Jewish and Muslim communities.”                  The Anti-Defamation League recorded more than 1,200 antisemitic incidents in the US through May 2023 – after reaching a record high in 2022 – and said it’s already seeing an uptick in antisemitic images and rhetoric in the wake of Hamas’ attack in Israel.                   Nationally, the ADL has seen a 54% increase over the same time last year, according to Scott Richman, the ADL’s regional director for New York and New Jersey. From October 7 to October 19, there have been 168 antisemitic incidents across the country, he said.                  On October 11 in Brooklyn’s Bay Ridge neighborhood, which is home to a large Palestinian community, a group of men – some of whom were waving an Israeli flag – attacked three men on the street after asking them if they were Palestinian, yelling, “F**k Palestine, F**k Islam,” according to a criminal complaint.                  One of the victims required medical attention after the attack, the complaint said. Two of the attackers have been charged with assault and menacing as a hate crime; four others remain at large, according to the complaint.                  That same day, a 19-year-old attacked a 24-year-old Columbia University student who was putting up posters with information about Israeli casualties, according to the criminal complaint and local news reporting. The 19-year-old ripped down the posters and shouted profanities at the victim before she struck them with a broomstick. She was charged with assault as a hate crime, and other charges, the complaint states.                  On October 14, a 29-year-old woman was punched in the face in the Grand Central subway station in Midtown Manhattan. The victim asked her attacker why he hit her, and he responded, because “you (are) Jewish,” according to police. A 28-year-old man was arrested this week and charged with a hate crime and aggravated assault.      FBI sees increase in reported threats in wake of attacks in Israel             Outside of New York, near Chicago, a 6-year-old boy was stabbed to death and his mother brutally injured in Plainfield Township, Illinois, after being “targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,” the sheriff’s office said. The 71-year-old suspect, who was their landlord, has been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other charges.                  But while the numbers of reported incidents tick up, advocates say there are scores of others that never reach law enforcement.                  “Who are you going to tell when somebody comes up to you and screams, ‘Free Palestine,’ at you?” said Richman, of the ADL. “Or there’s a swastika that’s been painted at your school? All kinds of incidents have been reported to us.”                  Richman said his office is struggling to keep up with the “huge” uptick.                   And he says he believes the number of incidents, both locally and nationally, will increase if Israeli ground troops enter Gaza.      Debate over the Israel-Gaza war has raised tensions -- and the stakes -- on college campuses             “We know from experience that when there is a flare up in the Israel-Palestine, Israel-Hamas conflict, we see Jews are targeted in this country, in other countries, essentially being blamed for the actions of the Israeli government or the Israeli military,” Richman said. “Nobody knows where anybody stands but people make assumptions because they are Jewish and then want to take out their anger on the Jewish community.”                  Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Chicago office, said his office typically sees four to six complaints a week from people who say they’ve been victimized or bullied. Since the start of the war just over two weeks ago, they have received 86 complaints.                  “My phone has been ringing off the hook,” said Rehab, who added he believes the current situation is much worse now than it was after 9/11. Not only are people scared, Rehab says, but now, no one seems to want to hear from Muslim Americans.      Gazans forced to drink dirty, salty water as the fuel needed to run water systems runs out             “Palestinians are essentially dehumanized and there has been a conclusion that they deserve what’s coming to them because of what’s happened in Israel,” said Rehab. “There isn’t much appetite for the nuance that’s needed to have the discussion of the value of human life and of a civilian life.”                  Rehab – who worked at a large accounting firm in Chicago when 9/11 happened and remembers his family and friends becoming victims of hate crimes in the aftermath of the attacks – said bias incident victims often don’t report the crime because of a combination of reasons, including a sense of futility.                  “There’s a lot of ‘toughen up,’ especially in our culture,” Rehab said. “There’s also a sense of, ‘I don’t want to appear weak’ or a sense of hopelessness that nothing will be done or can be done about it. Or there’s a sense of bureaucracy. ‘We’ve done this before,’ and it just fizzles into bureaucracy.”                  The rising tensions of recent weeks have reminded other groups, too, of the atmosphere that followed 9/11.                  Last week, a 19-year-old Sikh man who was wearing a mask attached to his turban was riding a bus when an assailant shouted, “We don’t wear that in this country and take that mask off,” according to New York police. The assailant then punched the teen several times and even tried to remove his turban, police said.                  “He just feels very unsafe. He’s constantly looking behind his back,” said Japneet Singh, a community activist who spoke with the victim. The teen had arrived in the US 10 months ago in search of what he called the American dream, Singh said. Now, he’s “just, overall, disappointed.”                  Sikh men grow long beards and wear turbans as a commitment to their faith, and many Americans mistake them for Muslims. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the Sikh Coalition advocacy group documented more than 300 cases of violence and discrimination.                  Singh has had his own experiences with discrimination. A week ago, he was leaving Gracie Mansion after a meeting with Mayor Eric Adams when a group of teens saw him wearing his turban and shouted, “Hamas.”                  “My biggest concern was the hate part of it and how it was going to impact us here at home. Literally within a week – less than a week – we started seeing all the chaos,” Singh said. “It’s been a repeat of post 9/11, the sentiments of Islamophobia and rhetoric.”                  There have been 51 hate crime incidents in New York since October 9, NYPD officials said at a Tuesday news conference. Most occurred during chance encounters, according to Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny, who added that hate crime numbers for the year had been down 22%, but after the war, are only down 13%.                  “Hate crime is still down but since the incident in Gaza, there has been an uptick,” Kenny said.      When asked Monday about concerns about a potential rise in antisemitism due to the current conflict, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN, “We have not seen any credible threats.”                  “But, look, Muslim and those perceived to be Muslim have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks,” Jean-Pierre continued. “And certainly, President Biden understands that many of our Muslim, Arab Americans and Palestinian American loved ones and neighbors are worried about the hate being directed at their communities.”        CNN’s Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.              “This is worse than after the Muslim Ban, than after 9/11,” uttered Abed Ayoub, a lawyer and childhood friend, four blocks away from the White House and two decades apart from the day that changed everything.                 In between the prevailing custom of doom-scrolling and delivering bad news, Abed looked up with a stare that said everything. I knew that look well.                 Like him, I’m an Arab, Muslim and American — an amalgam of identities that conjures up “pariah” in the world we live in. But now, it means something different. At this moment, when the horror of mass death unfolds in Gaza and on screens we hold in our palms, our identity spells absurdity.                 We see ourselves in the people of Gaza. The accosted people there share our names, our faith, our culture and our customs. We have friends in that 140-square-mile open-air prison turned into hell on earth, including journalists who were sheltering at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital at the time of the deadly blast on Wednesday.                 But what we continue to see on our screens is still half a world away. On the other side of our terrestrial reality and this virtual insanity.                 Until this past week.                 “A Palestinian boy was killed in Illinois,” shared Abed. This sequence of foreign-to-domestic murder was a familiar one. Being American, like 6-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume was, does not protect us from the stigma of being Palestinian or Arab, Muslim and from the “Middle East.” Rather, these latter identities keep the security blanket of Americanness away from us, rendering us foreign and, during times of crisis, “terrorists.”     Palestinian-American boy fatally stabbed near Chicago had celebrated his 6th birthday just 8 days earlier             Wadea was stabbed 26 times last Saturday with a military-style knife by his family’s landlord, a 71-year-old man who’s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes. The attacker also stabbed Wadea’s mother more than a dozen times. She lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?                 What does it mean for a mother who escaped war for the safety of an American suburb? What does it mean for Abed and I: an executive director of a civil rights organization and a law professor, standing at the crosshairs of American power and an Arab identity conflated with terrorism? What does “living” mean for millions of Arabs and Muslimswho call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?                 It feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.                 Calling it “Islamophobia” would be a severe understatement. This existential ballad of being Arab or Muslim in America is far more onerous, far more absurd. It feels like an existence that has no exit. A play where our daily routine is waking up to the news of war, the stark images and videos of slain children, rolling timelines of shattered villages and the roaring demands “to condemn Hamas.” While this plot sounds a lot like novels from Jean Paul Sartre or Albert Camus, this is not fiction.                 This is our absurd reality.                 An absurd reality where we, in America, can only post on virtual timelines where the footsteps of suspicion stomp out our voices and censor our speech.                 Our names and nationalities, faces and faith brand us with the stain of collective guilt for crimes that we did not commit. Moments like this — like the aftermath of 9/11 or the reckoning after former President Donald Trump’s Muslim Ban in 2017 — moved many to conceal their ethnicity or cover their faith, particularly women who removed their hijabs or young children who hid behind aliases. Hate crimes statistics skyrocketed after 9/11, and reached near proportions in the wake of the Muslim Ban. Wadea’s death foreshadows that these figures may spike again, and descend on the heads of Arab and Muslim Americans shadowed by suspicion.     Opinion: Many Palestinians in Gaza hate Hamas. My father certainly did             But we cannot shed our bodies. These are the corporal vehicles that connect us to the victims cast as villains in Gaza. And the symbols that tie us to distant places where “wars on terror” were wrought yesterday and are certain to wreck more lives tomorrow.                 “Muslims are only newsworthy when villains, never victims.” I wrote those words, for the first time, as a law student weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks. I was much younger then, unprepared for what the world would come to be.                 But I knew then that it would never be the same.                 I typed those very eight words 20 years later in my book, “The New Crusades: Islamophobia and the Global War on Muslims.” In between the wide-eyed optimism of a young law student and the sobered worldview of an aging law professor, 9/11 and today’s war serve as bookends for morbid middle passages for Muslims in America and around the globe – as evidenced by the genocidal campaigns in China, persecution in India, hijab and abaya bans in France, and far more. The law and language of Islamophobia have been exported transnationally by an American “war on terror” that was first enforced on the home front, upon the heads of Arabs and Muslims like me whose citizenship was cast aside.                 Being American was no protection. Not then and definitely not now.                 The barrage of cold stares and commands to condemn terrorism, assignment of collective guilt and characterization of our dead children as “collateral damage,” not only strips us from the substance of citizenship, it renders us inhuman. “People don’t have ideas,” wrote Carl Jung, “Ideas have people.”                 And the idea that conflates our skin with terrorism not only grips the imagination of people, but sinks into the very marrow of American gates of power. We must exist, whatever that even means anymore, within the very lines that divide our identities and sever us from normalcy.                 While I am in Washington and not Chicago, I can feel every one of those 26 stabs that plunged into little Wadea’s body. While across American cities large and small, we see ourselves in the grieving parents forced to bury their dead children in Gaza.                 This is what it means to be us.                 Perhaps it is time that this country begins to see us.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Their description of the situation is grim. He said they’ve told him they have no food, electricity, water or fuel.                   “When I spoke to them … they were basically saying, ‘We think this is it, we will not survive this one,’” he said. “You can only imagine what that feels like for Palestinian Americans who are getting these stories from their families right now.”                  Herzallah said his concerns for his family thousands of miles away have also been compounded by a growing fear for the safety of his wife and children here in the US, as reports of attacks against people perceived to be Muslim or Palestinian surface across the country.                  On Monday, family and faith leaders held a funeral for Wadea Al Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy who was stabbed to death in his Chicago-area apartment Saturday in what the police say is an Islamophobic hate crime. Outside of Al Fayoume’s funeral at the Mosque Foundation in Bridgeview, Illinois, grief was tinged with anger.      Palestinian-American boy fatally stabbed near Chicago had celebrated his 6th birthday just 8 days earlier             Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations Chicago chapter, said he views the attack against Al Fayoume and his mother, who is still hospitalized in serious condition, as an attack on all Muslims.                   “It is our worst nightmare come true. It is something we tried to warn against, creating an atmosphere of dehumanization that puts our community at risk, creates sitting ducks,” he said.                  “When this individual said, ‘You Muslims must die,’ this was a message not to the boy and the mother. This was to all of us. We were all stabbed that day.”                 Leaders from Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian American groups told CNN in the days since Hamas’ surprise attack they’ve seen an increase in attacks reported against their communities, including vandalism, bullying at school and in the workplace, and threatening phone calls.                   Linda Sarsour, a civil rights activist who is Palestinian-American, told CNN she has family in the West Bank, but she is even more worried about her community’s safety in the US.                 “One of the things that’s always the saddest for me is when people start giving each other advice about not going out alone,” Sarsour said, adding people in her community are telling each other to be on alert and aware of their surroundings.                   “People are mourning, people are scared … We are experiencing a lot of anguish, a lot of fear, and a lack of safety.”      Diplomatic aid efforts ramp up for 'strangled' Gaza as regional conflict fears grow             In New York City, police have asked for the public’s assistance in locating a suspect who punched a 19-year-old bus passenger who was wearing a turban and a mask. The NYPD said it is investigating the assault as a possible hate crime after witnesses said the man attempted to remove the passenger’s turban.                   And in Dearborn, Michigan – a city whose population is estimated to be about 42% Arab, according to the US Census Bureau –  police arrested a man after he made online threats of violence against Palestinian American residents.                   “Palestinian Americans and Muslim Americans feel like they are experiencing the level of hate and Islamophobia that existed after 9/11 and during the Iraq war – some say it’s even worse,” Aber Kawas, a member of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, told CNN.                 Abed Ayoub, director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said the perspectives of Palestinian and Muslim communities in places like the United States have been largely absent from the coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict and that has allowed a growing atmosphere of bigotry and Islamophobia to go unchecked.                   “There is no recognition of our existence. That’s what is allowing this to bubble,” he said. “And that’s what allowed a 6-year-old Palestinian boy to get stabbed to death in his own home.”                  Ayoub said Arab and Palestinian communities are diverse and nuanced. But, he said, giving platforms to narratives that insinuate anyone who supports Palestine also supports Hamas and the violent attacks on Israel is problematic.                    “Labeling everyone as Hamas just to justify the attacks is dangerous and we’re seeing that play out,” he said of the bombings in Gaza.                   Last weekend, as Israel continued to bombard Gaza in response to the October 7 Hamas attack, activists staged pro-Palestine rallies in New York City’s Times Square and in cities across the country.                   Many Muslim or Arab leaders say they feel compelled to speak out against the climate of Islamophobia to stem further violence.                 “The CAIR NJ office has not received this many calls for help since the Muslim ban in 2017,”  Selaedin Maksut, executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations of New Jersey, said at a news conference Monday. “Anxiety and fear are high.”                   Sarsour said a unified message from US officials would help address Islamophobia at home.                  “You need leadership from both parties to get up and say it is not acceptable for us here in the United States to be engaging or allowing for any type of anti-Muslim, anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab sentiment,” Sarsour. “We stand united.”        CNN’s Celina Tebor, Chris Boyette, Keith Allen, Holmes Lybrand, Whitney Wild, Bill Kirkos & Carmaine Means contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.             “We live in the first period in history in which there is such full awareness of cruelty and killing as they happen,” wrote British philosopher Jonathan Glover in 1999, at the end of a decade that saw genocidal killing in Rwanda and Bosnia and of a century that saw at least 187 million people die in war.                 How we respond to barbarity is crucial, he wrote in his book, “Humanity: A Moral History of the Twentieth Century.”                 “We can start to establish a tradition that, with our knowledge of the atrocities, we find them intolerable and will do what we can to eradicate them. Or we can help to continue a tradition which accepts them fatalistically.”                 Such questions came into sharp relief again after the brutality of the Hamas attack on Israel last weekend was revealed. The war plays out on everyone’s screens, forcing people to confront cruelty and killing and to fear what comes next.                 As Frida Ghitis wrote, Hamas “launched thousands of rockets as its operatives infiltrated Israeli territory using motorcycles, trucks, paragliders, and speedboats.”                 “Inside Israel, they went after soldiers and civilians, even posting videos on social media, as the world saw evidence of how they targeted, hunted down, and brutalized Israelis of all ages. Many were kidnapped and taken to Gaza and dragged through the streets.”                 Ghitis added, “There’s much that Israel has done wrong. But nothing justifies what Hamas has just perpetrated. As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, what Hamas has done is clearly an act of terrorism, no matter what your definition.”     Amy Klein, a writer based in New York whose husband has family in Israel and served in its army, began receiving messages asking, “Is your family okay?”                 “They were safe, but they were not all right…”                 “With over 1,000 Israelis dead and counting, thousands injured and as many as 150 Israelis feared kidnapped – graphic videos showing scores of twentysomethings being shot point blank at a desert rave, women stripped and bloodied, the elderly, children and babies snatched and tormented, people screaming for their lives on terrorists’ motorcycles, piles of bodies found at kibbutzim – no one in Israel is all right.”     “And most Jews in America are not all right either.”             “We were dancing,” recalled Gal Katz, “the sun was just coming up.” The 22-year-old was at a music festival when he saw signs of Israel’s Iron Dome system intercepting missiles from Gaza. “At first I was like, ‘Oh, it’s missiles.’ In Israel, this is nothing special. I figured if it was something serious, [music festival security] would end the party and tell us what to do.” Then a friend posted a video on WhatsApp showing a white pickup truck carrying at least six gunmen dressed in black. “It’s a truck full of terrorists in Israel, in the middle of a city nearby.”                 “I understood that what we’re dealing with is something that’s never been here before. I took a look at that video and it was like ‘Call of Duty.’”                 Katz and a friend ran to a nearby orange grove, where they hid quietly for about six hours out of sight of the attackers until they were rescued by soldiers. Other friends sought safety in shelters but were discovered by Hamas.                 “We came together to the party. And they didn’t make it. They didn’t return home.”                 “They took 1,200 lives and maybe 200 kidnapped, and people are still missing and wounded.     “It’s the most Jews that have been killed since the Holocaust. How can you accept that?”             The attack came a day after residents of the Be’eri kibbutz celebrated the 77th anniversary of its founding. Yulie Ben Ami, 27, grew up in the kibbutz, in southern Israel, with her parents and two siblings.                 “At 9:30, my mom sent me a message that the terrorists were trying to get into the house and they tried to break the door — that they were shooting into the safe place,” Ben Ami told CNN Opinion’s Stephanie Griffith. “She wrote that she’s scared and doesn’t know what to do. And I think like 10 or 15 minutes later, my mother and my father sent us a message that they [the attackers] are in the house and are breaking everything. At 10:06, my father sent us a message: ‘They are in the safe room. They caught us.’”                 “A half hour later, we saw a picture on Telegram of my father with two men who were taking him someplace — we don’t know where.”                 “We don’t know what happened to my mom, she wasn’t in that picture.”                 “I think the world needs to understand what the gunmen did to children and mothers and grandmothers and grandfathers…” More than 120 people were killed by the terrorists at the kibbutz.                 Israelis were stunned by the scale and ferocity of last weekend’s assaults. “This attack is being compared to the 1973 Yom Kippur War when Arab armies surprised Israel almost 50 years ago to the day,” wrote Janine Zacharia, a journalist who covered Israel for two decades. “But this is more traumatic. Not only because of the sheer number of murdered young civilians — in addition to young soldiers. But because of the way the horror is unfolding live on television, radio and social media and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government — that millions of Israelis have been protesting for months over right-wing attempts to weaken the judiciary — seems completely absent and incompetent.”     S. Ilan Troen is named “for a grandmother who was murdered in her village, Derazhne, near Rovno (now Rivne) in what was once Poland and is now Ukraine. Her death in the spring of 1919 came during a stretch of time when 150,000 Jews were murdered. Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura’s banditim, or criminal bandits, intoxicated with nationalist-religious fervor, attacked a small, peaceful, agricultural village, where they murdered and violated Jews.”                 It was a pogrom, wrote Troen, who is an emeritus professor of history at Ben-Gurion University in Israel and of Israel studies at Brandeis University in the US. Last week, his own family once again came face to face with the reality of that kind of murder.                 The word pogrom, taken from the Russian language, Troen noted, “is an official act by a government or similar polity, not the mere sick initiative of a single antisemite engaged in a limited one-off event. The historical progression of pogroms is clear: Eastern European antisemitism to Nazi racism that extended across most Europe to the current Hamas brutality against Jewish civilians wherever they find them.”                 “My mother witnessed her mother’s brutal end but somehow survived. The scar remained throughout her life, though, and affected how she so determinedly cared for and protected her own children.”                 “It is now my daughter, Deborah Mathias, who was so brutally murdered, together with her husband, Shlomi Mathias, in a kibbutz on the Gaza border, where they were committed to mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence. They were shot in the presence of their son, whose life was saved by my daughter using her body to shield him as she fell. He is recovering from a bullet that passed through her into his abdomen. He is mending, but that experience will remain and will be passed on.”                 “’Never again!’ It was never supposed to have happened. But it has, and is. We are witnessing in real time a pogrom. We thought that the most extensive pogrom — the Holocaust — would mark the end of the terrible record of violence against Jews, just because they are Jews. Not so.”                 Israel struck back with air attacks against targets in the Gaza Strip, home to more than 2 million people and ruled by Hamas. “In Gaza, we have all been glued to the news for the last five days, watching in disbelief as strikes and counterstrikes have been exchanged and the death counts on both sides of the border mount,” wrote Omar Ghraieb. “While every round of violence starts differently, they all end the same way here: with Palestinians paying a heavy price. We live in perpetual anticipation of a tragic ending.”                 “Our electricity falters, our water is scarce, and the air outside my home fills with thick smoke and acrid gunpowder. My throat and eyes burn. It’s too dangerous to venture out for bread, yet my thoughts drift to the guilty pleasure of an iced salted caramel macchiato that might bring inner peace, or at least some temporary distraction. What more can one expect from a Gaza millennial living in the impoverished coastal enclave that some call the world’s largest open-air prison, under a suffocating blockade for more than 15 years?”                 The threat Hamas posed to Israel was well known, wrote Carrie Cordero. “Hamas’ mission is, by definition, to end Israel, not to seek to establish a self-governed Palestinian state that peacefully coexists alongside the Jewish state. Like Americans before 9/11, Israelis should have been better protected by their government. Their confidence in their elected leaders, intelligence and security services has likely been deeply shaken.”                 Cordero called for Congress to elect a new speaker immediately and to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which would allow continued intelligence collection on national security threats, including the actions of terrorist groups.                 It’s too soon to tell if the Hamas attack will end discussions between Saudi Arabia, Israel and the US on a deal to normalize relations. “An Israeli normalization deal with Saudi Arabia — the location of the two holiest sites in Islam — would be hugely symbolic and have real security benefits for Israel,” wrote Peter Bergen. “After all, almost exactly half a century ago, during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, two Arab states, Egypt and Syria, attacked Israel. Also, both Israel and Saudi Arabia have a strong common interest today, both seeing Iran as their most dangerous enemy.”     Jason Greenblatt, who served as Middle East envoy in the Trump administration, said last weekend’s events made clear one obstacle to a two-state solution. “Israel cannot achieve peace with Palestinians when a segment of the Palestinian population still intends to destroy it. Israel cannot make peace when the leaders of the Palestinians include Hamas. Or when a member of Fatah, Hamas’ political opponent and the party that runs the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, expresses not sorrow over the loss of innocent life, but celebrates a ‘morning of victory, joy, and pride’ and urges all Palestinians to participate in the terror against Israel.”                 The echoes of the Hamas assault could be heard on some of America’s college campuses, where pro-Palestinian student groups rallied. At Harvard University, wrote Rachel Fish, “a group of 30 student associations issued a public statement over the weekend to say they ‘hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,’” a statement some student groups later backed away from.                 “When the administration finally weighed in, the first take was a milquetoast, word-salad statement signed by 18 administrators,” observed Fish, who is special advisor to the president for the Antisemitism Initiative at Brandeis University in Higher Education and K-12 Leadership. As controversy grew, Harvard’s president issued a statement Tuesday condemning “the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas.’”                 Fish argued, “This is a time for presidents, trustees, deans, provosts and donors to articulate that there are no mental hurdles that should ever be jumped to rationalize the destruction and inhumanity perpetrated by Hamas.”                 For more:     Kara Alaimo: Schools are right to warn parents about what their kids are seeing now Peter Bergen: The 9/11 attack wasn’t an intelligence failure. The Hamas attack may be             After ousting House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republicans have yet to round up enough votes to elect a replacement. In the meantime, the House cannot carry out its legislative duties, including responding to the Middle East crisis. Although House Republicans privately voted to pick Rep. Steve Scalise as their leader, he dropped out Thursday after he was not able to line up the 217 GOP votes needed to win that post in a full House vote. Rep. Jim Jordan won an intra-party vote Friday, but he too may struggle to line up the required number of votes on the House floor, Julian Zelizer noted.                 “The election of Jordan, who former Speaker John Boehner called a ‘legislative terrorist,’ would put one of the most radical members of the party in charge, someone who would have little problem sending the government into a shutdown,” observed Zelizer.                 Animating McCarthy’s foes was a belief that he wasn’t serious enough about cutting spending, wrote W. James Antle III.                 “Republicans have campaigned for decades on the idea that the country’s current fiscal trajectory is unsustainable, most recently making the argument that elevated federal spending levels had proved inflationary.”                 “Where the eight Republicans who seized McCarthy’s gavel get into trouble is that it is impossible to alter that fiscal trajectory while controlling by the narrowest of margins one half of the legislative branch. They simply don’t have the votes to pass the kind of sweeping spending cuts they would like, and their attempts to govern as a minority within a small majority make it difficult to govern at all.”                 For more:     John Avlon: The solution to the House speaker crisis             As the Federal Reserve has steadily raised interest rates over the past two years, the rise in the average mortgage rate (to more than 7%) and its impact on homebuyers has gotten lots of attention. Less talked about is an even more devastating increase that hits the many Americans who have credit card debt.                 “The average credit card interest rate in America is a shocking, all-time record of 24.45%,” noted Sallie Krawcheck and Victoria Sado. “By comparison, in 2018, the average credit card interest rate was 14.22%. Pair that with data that shows those hikes overlapped with consumers’ increases in spending outpacing their increases in income … and ouch.”                 “The gender debt gap means women especially feel this. And because of the gender pay gap, women are less likely than men to pay bills on time and in full.” Krawcheck and Sado outlined six ways to help cope with the rising cost of debt.                 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Monday that he’ll drop out of the Democratic presidential primary and run for the White House as an independent. His third-party bid could take votes from both President Joe Biden and his Republican challenger, wrote Peter Bergen.                 “Kennedy holds a mix of Republican and Democratic policy views which could make him attractive to the large numbers of American voters who are unhappy about a Biden-Trump rematch,” Bergen observed.                 “On the Ukraine war, pandemic measures, US border policies, and the Second Amendment, RFK Jr. could easily be mistaken for a Republican, while on abortion, affirmative action and climate change, he sounds very much like a Democrat. All of this makes Kennedy a wild card who may scramble the presidential election and damage both Biden and Trump in unexpected ways.”     Jill Filipovic: Why Gavin Newsom’s vetoes are so disappointing Sarah Gundle: Bob Saget’s widow isn’t alone in grappling with what happens when dating and grieving collide Sara Stewart: Why I can’t stop thinking about Julia Ormond’s story Keldy Ortiz: Retailers are closing stores. There are better ways to deal with shoplifting Dr. Lara Freidenfelds: The truth behind menopause test kits AND…             Simone Biles is “the most decorated gymnast” ever, Amy Bass wrote. Her record defies “common sense: 37 total world and Olympic medals, including five in Antwerp, where she clinched her sixth all-around title 10 years after she won her first. Her road back to the sport she not only dominates, but defines, challenges anyone who fails to understand that athletes must care for their mental, not just physical, health.”             “In Tokyo, just over two years ago,” Bass noted, “Biles shocked the sports world when she announced that she was sitting down, letting her teammates continue the Olympic quest without her because she had the ‘twisties,’ a word used to describe what happens when a gymnast’s mind and body are out of sync … She was not OK, and she was brave enough to say it out loud.”                 By the time the world championship competition ended last weekend in Antwerp, Belgium, Biles had walked away with four golds and a silver. “Her glorious return to the world stage, and the records she owns because of it, demonstrate the beauty of sport when it is not a zero-sum game based solely on winning.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             Sixteen-year-old Ali vividly remembers the last time he saw his mother at home. She made him and his twin sister, Kiana, eggs for breakfast, told them to study hard, said goodbye and sent them to school. When they returned, she was gone. They were eight.                 Their mother is Narges Mohammadi, a woman whose name has become synonymous with the fight for human rights in Iran – a battle that has cost this activist almost everything.                 On Friday, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for “her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced in Oslo.                  Mohammadi has been a prisoner for most of the past two decades. She has been sentenced repeatedly for being the voice of the voiceless, for her unrelenting campaign against the death penalty and solitary confinement – which she has had to endure for weeks at a time.     In letter from prison, Narges Mohammadi outlines her fight for women             She is currently serving a sentence of 10 years and 9 months, accused of actions against national security and propaganda against the state. She was also sentenced to 154 lashes, a punishment rights groups believe has not so far been inflicted, and travel and other bans.                  But not even the darkest cells of the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran have crushed her powerful voice.                  In an audio recording from inside Evin, shared with CNN before the Nobel Peace Prize was announced, Mohammadi is heard leading the chants of “woman, life, freedom”- the slogan of the uprising sparked last year by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Jhina Amini in the custody of the country’s morality police. She was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.      Iranian activists accuse morality police of assault after teenage girl hospitalized             The recording is interrupted by a brief automated message – “This is a phone call from Evin Prison” – as the women are heard singing a Farsi rendition of “Bella Ciao,” the 19th-century Italian folk song that became a resistance anthem against Fascists and has been adopted by Iran’s freedom movement.                    “This period was and still is the era of greatest protest in this prison,” Mohammadi told CNN earlier in written responses to questions submitted through intermediaries.                  Outside the prison walls, a brutal crackdown on protest by Iranian authorities largely quelled the movement sparked by Amini’s death and the morality police resumed their headscarf patrols in July. Iranian activists this week accused them of assaulting a teenage girl for not wearing a headscarf in a Tehran metro station, leading to her hospitalization with serious injuries. Iranian authorities said low blood pressure was the cause.                  Mohammadi, in comments received Thursday by CNN, said the government’s behavior had once again “raised our concerns” and was “indicative of its concerted efforts to prevent the truth from coming to light regarding Armita Geravand.”                 Mohammadi knows all too well the price of speaking publicly. In August she was sentenced to an additional year in jail for her continued activism inside prison after she gave a media interview and a statement about sexual assaults in jail.                 She was already serving time for publishing a book last year about Iran’s brutal prison methods, titled “White Torture: Interviews with Iranian Women Prisoners,” as well as a documentary film telling the stories of prisoners held in solitary confinement – a punishment Mohammadi herself has endured.     Iranian women face 10 years in jail for inappropriate dress after 'hijab bill' approved             But she remains undeterred. Mohammadi recently sent CNN a lengthy letter railing against four decades of the Islamic Republic’s mandatory hijab and calling out what she says is the hypocrisy of a religious state using sexual violence against female detainees.                  When it came to power four decades ago, she writes, the religious regime used the compulsory hijab to “showcase the image of domination, subjugation and control over women” as a means to control society.                  “They couldn’t put an abaya and turban on half of the population, i.e., men in society,” her letter reads. “However, they easily adorned half of Iran’s population with ‘mandatory hijab,’ veil, chador, manteau, and dark-coloured trousers to present the odious face of the despotic religious system to the world.”                  “Imagine Iranian women who, for 44 years, have been forced to wear a head covering, long coats, and dark-colored pants in the summer heat, and in some places, black chadors.                  “Worse than that, they have been under psychological pressure to strictly adhere to compulsory hijab, all to preserve the image of religious Islamic men and ensure the security and purity of women. Now, those same women are experiencing sexual assault and harassment against themselves.”                 In her letter and responses to CNN, Mohammadi details incidents of sexual violence against her and other female detainees at different facilities dating back to 1999.                 Political prisoners and women held on criminal charges were assaulted by security forces, prison authorities and medical personnel, she says.                  According to Mohammadi, sexual violence against women detainees has “significantly increased” since the protests that swept Iran last year, leading her to describe the abuse as now “systematic.”                 “The victims had told their stories in the meetings they had with the officials who came to Qarchak prison for inspection,” Mohammadi writes. “In prison, I have heard the narratives of three protesting women who were sexually assaulted. One of them was a well-known activist of the student movement who, upon entering the prison, filed a complaint with the authorities and announced that after being arrested on the street, her one hand and one leg was cuffed and tied to the two rings on the top of the car door. And in that position, she was sexually assaulted.”                  Mohammadi says she and another prisoner visited the prison’s “quarantine” area under the pretext of taking food to another inmate and that they saw the young woman there with bruises on her stomach, arms, legs and thighs.                 The Iranian government has denied the widespread allegations of sexual assaults against detainees, including in an in-depth CNN investigation last year, calling them “false” and “baseless.” She lost her eye protesting in Iran. She says she has no regrets             For years, Mohammadi has been vocal about sexual violence against prisoners, breaking taboos in her conservative country. In 2021, she hosted a discussion via the Clubhouse social media app where women, including Mohammadi, shared their stories of assaults by government “agents” from the 1980s to 2021. She was penalized for this, according to Mohammadi and rights groups.                 “Women who experience sexual harassment become filled with anger, fear, and insecurity, but when their womanhood is hidden and suppressed by ideological and religious claims, they will not only be angry and terrified, but they will also feel deceived and manipulated by the government, which is even more distressing,” she writes. Such sexual abuse “leaves such deep scars on their souls and minds that it is difficult to recover from, and perhaps they may never fully recover,” she added.                 For refusing to be silenced behind bars, Mohammadi has been banned from speaking directly with her husband and children for the past 18 months.                 “When your wife and the closest person to you is in prison, every single day you wake up worried that you might hear bad news,” her husband, Taghi Rahmani, told CNN in a recent interview in France, where he has lived in exile with their children since shortly after Mohammadi was imprisoned in 2015.                 Rahmani and human rights groups have raised concerns about Mohammadi’s health and access to medical care after she suffered a heart attack and underwent surgery last year.                  He proudly shows off prestigious international awards he has received on her behalf. She has an “endless energy for freedom and human rights,” he said.                  Rahmani, who was himself held as a political prisoner for a total of 14 years, met Mohammadi when she attended his underground contemporary history classes in 1995, he says.                 For the past eight years, he has had to act as father and mother to their now teenage twins.                  “Kiana always used to say when mom is here, dad is not. It’s not good,” he said. “But when someone chooses a path, they must endure all the hardships.”                  Ali, like his father, is resolute, saying his mother must keep going “for Iran, for our future.”                  “I am really proud of my mom,” Ali told CNN. “She was not always with us, but whenever she was, she took good care of us… she was a good mom and still is… I have accepted this kind of life now. Any suffering that I have to endure does not matter.”                  He said he was so eager to find out whether his mother had won that he kept scrolling on his phone in class without his teacher noticing.                 “Precisely at 11 a.m. my heart stops because I see that my mother won,” he said. “I exploded with joy.”                 Kiana, who preferred to not speak with CNN, wants her mother by her side. Her father says Kiana believes that if you bring a child into this world, you must take responsibility and raise that child.                 The pain of separation from her family is one Mohammadi lives with every single day. It is the cost of a sacrifice she has chosen to make, for the dream of a future freedom that has defined her life.                  “The moment I said goodbye to Ali and Kiana was not unlike the time I almost died in the tree-lined yard of Evin,” she writes to CNN, not specifying when that event was. “I picked the dandelions of Evin’s yard. I stood barefoot on the hot asphalt on July 14,” she said, referring to the day – only weeks after that final breakfast – on which she said goodbye to her children in prison before they left for exile in France. “My feet were burning but my heart was on fire. I sent the dandelions to the sky and my children’s hands, feet and childish faces passed my eyes and tears fell like spring rain.                  “If I look at the prison from the window of my heart, I was more of a stranger to my daughter and son than any stranger and I missed out on the best years of my life and what went will never come back. But I am sure that the world without freedom, equality and peace is not worth living or even watching.                  “I have chosen to not see my children or even hear their voices and be the voice of oppressed people, women and children, of my land,” she says.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

Mohammadi and her family believe she will be further penalized for speaking out once again through CNN, but that did not and will not stop her, they say. She was on Friday awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for “her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.” In the letter to CNN, sent before the prize was awarded, Narges railed against the compulsory hijab Iranian women have been forced to wear by the Islamic Republic for more than four decades. She also spoke very openly about sexual abuse inside jails. The Iranian government has denied the widespread allegations of sexual assaults against detainees, including in an in-depth CNN investigation last year, calling them “false” and “baseless.” Here are excerpts of her letter, which has been edited for length:             My letter may be long and disturbing in its subject matter, and some may perceive it as a “challenge” and “feminist protest” with a radical orientation. However, it is an attempt, in accordance with human rights, ethics, and of course, feminism, to protest against the continuation of “violence and sexual harassment of women” by a government that, under the guise of religion, has taken away “femininity” from us as a means to advance its illegitimate power and ambitions. My protest is based on human rights and feminist concerns, but it carries deeper and more profound implications. I cannot simply confine myself to condemning gross violations of human rights and women’s rights. I also intend to address the destructive falsehood and deceit of the government. A government that, with an ideological approach and misuse of spiritual and salvation elements among the people, attempts to control every aspect of individual and social life, under the pretext of family, security, and protection of the “woman,” leaving no aspect of “life” and “feminine identity” outside its oppressive grasp…                  I want to emphasize that this letter is not written by a free feminist in a developed democratic society, benefiting from civil protest methods and human rights, but rather by an imprisoned woman who, like millions of Iranian women, has been living under the “authority” and “oppression” of a military system with ideological, patriarchal, and tyrannical foundations since the age of 6, deprived of life, youth, “femininity,” and “motherhood”…                 During the establishment and acquisition of power by the religious regime, there were no better pawns than “women” in the game of religious authorities to adorn the political chessboard with their masculine domination…. . They couldn’t put an abaya and turban on half of the population, i.e., men in society. However, they easily adorned half of Iran’s population with “mandatory hijab,” veil, chador, manteau, and dark-colored trousers to present the odious face of the despotic religious system to the world. In this way, “mandatory hijab” became the showcase of Islamic society and, from the government’s perspective, one of the distinguishing elements and foundations setting apart Islamic society from Western societies…                 “Mandatory hijab” showcases the image of domination, subjugation, and control over women, which, when extended, makes the control over the entire society smooth and achievable…                 Hijab was not optional; it was imposed by the government, not based on beliefs and convictions, but to “submit” citizens to government dictates; it was imposed by the government, not based on beliefs and convictions, but to “submit” citizens to government dictates. In clearer terms, compliance with mandatory hijab was a way of training submission and surrendering to oppression in society, not through bullets and executions, but through placing a whip on women’s heads and making it normalized…                  The justification for all these violent and inhumane confrontations was summarized as preserving the dignity, chastity, and security of women and the well being of Islamic society. Imagine Iranian women who, for 44 years, have been forced to wear a head covering, long coats, and dark-colored pants in the summer heat, and in some places, black chadors. Worse than that, they have been under psychological pressure to strictly adhere to compulsory hijab, all to preserve the image of religious Islamic men and ensure the security and purity of women. Now, those same women are experiencing “sexual assault and harassment” against themselves…                 Women who experience sexual harassment become filled with anger, fear, and insecurity, but when their womanhood is hidden and suppressed by ideological and religious claims, and at the same time, they are violated in another “situation” (due to protest), they will not only be angry and terrified, but they will also feel deceived and manipulated by the government, which is even more distressing. I have no intention of making any comparisons between women subjected to assault in any “situation” because what women experience in “sexual assault and harassment” leaves such deep scars on their souls and minds that it is difficult to recover from, and perhaps they may never fully recover…                 The fear, anxiety, and sense of insecurity resulting from the attack by security forces, arrest, and transfer to unknown locations and solitary cells can inflict devastating blows to the individual’s soul and psyche. Experiencing “sexual assault and harassment” in such a “situation” in detention centers, during interrogations, threats, uncertainty, or inside detention vehicles, under the blows and kicks of officers, can be destructive and come with irreparable harm. The governmental male assailants assaulting detained protesting women in detention centers convey the message that nothing, not even what we claimed to be religion, humanity, and spirituality over the past 44 years, can stop us from suppressing and confronting you. Anyone who has experienced confinement in solitary cells and detention centers can comprehend the harsh message of “assault”: that is, we recognize no boundaries in suppressing and dealing with you, and even God does not exist…                 The “compulsory hijab” was a deceitful scheme against women and a tool of pressure to strengthen the power of the religious government. The “assault” on protesting women by government agents reveals the deceitful, deceptive, and manipulative nature of the government to the people of Iran and the world. Therefore, as a woman prisoner, I confidently declare that we have the power in our protest against the “assault” of government agents on protesting women. We draw this power from the “position” of Iranian women during 44 years of tyranny and coercion by the government in all aspects of our lives and from our struggle and resistance for freedom and rights…                 This text is not intended as an elegy for Iranian women. It is a testament to the fact that the tyranny and oppression of the government have inflicted incurable wounds on our lives, spirits, and minds. Women were the first, greatest, and most oppressed victims of religious despotism, but they were also the most steadfast, indomitable, and influential social force, and in recent protest and revolutionary movements, they have been at the forefront as the most advanced and radical forces.                  Iranian women do not derive their credibility and legitimacy of struggle from the intensity of the oppression and discrimination they have endured, but rather from their continuous and courageous resistance and struggle for democracy, life, freedom, equality, human rights, and peace. Their position will be established in the future of our country, and they will determine their rights.                  We, women, believe that fear, terror, and storms can never shake and tremble the mountains.     Narges Mohammadi, Evin Prison, July 2023 © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/04/middleeast/iran-activists-morality-police-girl-hospitalized-intl/index.html,Iranian activists accuse morality police of assault after teenage girl hospitalized,"Activists have accused Iran’s morality police of assaulting a teenage girl for not wearing a headscarf in a Tehran metro station, leading to her hospitalization with serious injuries.","Oct 5, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Mostafa Salem,International,"Activists have accused Iran’s morality police of assaulting a teenage girl for not wearing a headscarf in a Tehran metro station, leading to her hospitalization with serious injuries.                  A Norway-based group focused on Kurdish rights, the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, said Wednesday that 16-year-old Armita Geravand was “assaulted” by morality police and has been in a coma since Sunday. Another opposition network, IranWire, said it had obtained information that Geravand was admitted to the hospital with “head trauma.”                  “Prior to her arrival at the Shohada metro station, female morality police officers approached her and requested that she adjust her hijab. This request resulted in an altercation with the morality police officers physically assaulting Geravand. She was pushed, leading to her collapse,” Hengaw staffer Awyer Shekhi told CNN.                  “Following this confrontation, she managed to enter the metro, but collapsed later on,” Shekhi added.                  CNN could not verify the information published by Hengaw and Iranwire, who have in the past covered Iranian protests extensively.                  Iranian authorities have denied the allegations, saying she was hospitalized due an injury caused by low blood pressure. Geravand’s friends and family echoed those denials in interviews with state media.                  The allegations come just weeks after the one-year death anniversary of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old woman who died in the custody of the morality police after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly. That event sparked some of the biggest protests the country has witnessed in decades, prompting the regime to double down on policing activism and further tighten hijab laws.      Iranian women face 10 years in jail for inappropriate dress after 'hijab bill' approved             In security camera footage posted on the website of state-run IRNA news agency, a group of girls are seen entering the train. CNN cannot identify which girl in the video was Geravand.                  Some of the girls appeared to not be wearing headscarves.                   Moments later, the video goes on to show a group of girls carrying the teenager out of the train, placing her on the platform as the train leaves the station.                  No altercation can be seen on the edited video posted on state media. CNN has been unable to confirm its authenticity.                  The chief of Tehran Metro said there was no physical or verbal interaction between Geravand and members of his staff.                   “According to our investigation, after reviewing the CCTV footage from the moment she entered the station and got on the train, there was no verbal or physical altercation between the passengers with them or our staff. There was nothing recorded on the videos,” Tehran Metro Managing Director Masoud Dorosti told state media.                  The teenager is currently being treated at a hospital in Tehran, Fars News Agency reported. IranWire reported that she is being treated at Fajr Air Force Hospital, in a separate statement it published on Wednesday.                  A journalist from Iranian pro-reform outlet Shargh Daily had gone to Fajr Air Force Hospital to report on Geravand’s condition when she was arrested on Tuesday, according to a post Shargh Daily on X. The reporter, Maryam Lotfi, has since been released, the outlet reported.                  Geravand’s mother and father told state media in an interview that their daughter seemed to hit her head after fainting from low blood pressure while she was on her way to school. The parents said there were no signs from the videos they saw that Geravand was assaulted.                  “I think they said she had low blood pressure… drop in blood pressure or fallen on the floor… her head hit the edge of the metro and then (her friends) took her off (the train),” her mother Shahin Ahmadi said.                  “We checked the cameras. She went there… I am not sure… one of the girls was in front and one was behind her. She got on the train and fell down… I don’t know… what happened… whether she was unconscious… she fainted…. they pulled her out and called the emergency care. She was then taken to the hospital,” said her father, Ahmad Garavand.      One year since Mahsa Amini's death, a protester shot in the eye during Iran's crackdown continues her struggle from exile             It is unclear if Geravand’s family and friends were coerced into speaking to state media. In the past, UN human rights officials and rights groups have accused Iranian authorities of pressuring families of protesters killed to make statements supportive of the government narrative.                  The Hengaw rights group said Ahmadi, Geravand’s mother, was arrested on Wednesday and “transferred to an unknown location” – a claim denied by Iranian security sources to the state-affiliated Tasnim news agency on Thursday.                  Geravand’s friends also dismissed the allegations in an interview aired Wednesday on state-run IRNA.                      Fatemah, one friend who claimed to be present on the day of the incident, said in an on-camera interview that the teenager “suddenly fell backwards and her head hit the ground.”                   Mahla, another friend who said she was present, told the news outlet in an on-camera interview that everything happened very quickly once they entered the train.                   “The claims that we have been warned about hijab and that someone has pushed Armita is a lie and absolutely untrue,” Mahla said.                    CNN has been unable to reach the friends for comment and was not able to verify the last names of the two friends.                    Some have however alleged that Geravand’s friends and family are under pressure to push forward the state’s narrative on the events.                  The Coordinating Council of the Iranian Teachers Associations said in a statement on Telegram that Geravand’s friends “are under intense pressure to avoid sharing information about her condition on the day of the incident.”                    “They were also to speak to the state-run new agencies, in front of cameras, and deny any incidents to Armita Garavand,” the Council said citing “reliable sources.”                    It added that a security unit from the Ministry of Education warned teachers and students at the teenager’s school against speaking about the incident.                     CNN’s calls to the Iranian government have not been returned.                       The United States’ Special Envoy to Iran, Abram Paley, posted on X on Wednesday that he was “shocked and concerned about reports that Iran’s so-called morality police have assaulted 16-year-old Armita Geravand. We are following news of her condition. We continue to stand with the brave people of Iran and work with the world to hold the regime accountable for its abuses.”                    German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called Geravand’s situation “unbearable.”                  More than 300 people were killed in months-long protests after Mahsa Amini’s death last year, including more than 40 children, the UN said in November. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) in January placed the number of dead at more than 500, including 70 children. Thousands were arrested across the country, the UN said in a report in June, citing research released last year by their Human Rights Committee.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Lina Lutfiawati, known as Lina Mukherjee on social media, was tried on Tuesday in the Palembang district court on Sumatra island.                 The 33-year-old was found guilty of “spreading information aimed at inciting hatred against religious individuals and specific groups,” court documents read.                  In addition to her two-year prison sentence, the court fined her $16,245 (250,000,000 Indonesian rupiah), a small fortune in a country where the annual per capita wage is around $4,300. Her jail term could be extended by three months if she does not pay the fine, the court added.                  Speaking to reporters outside court on Tuesday after the trial, Mukherjee expressed shock at the sentence.                  “I know I was wrong but I really did not expect this punishment,” she said, in comments carried by CNN affiliate, CNN Indonesia. It is possible that she will file an appeal, CNN Indonesia added.                  Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim nation, where 231 million people, at least 93% of its adult population, identify as Muslim.                  Religious conservatism has been on the rise in the country in recent years and rights groups have warned that blasphemy laws are being “increasingly weaponized” against religious minorities and those deemed to have insulted Islam.     Cleric arrested for blasphemy after allowing women to preach in world's largest Muslim-majority country             Pork is forbidden in Islam and eating it remains taboo among most Indonesian Muslims. But the meat is commonly consumed by millions of non-Muslims, including the country’s ethnic Chinese population as well those living on the Hindu-majority island of Bali.                 Mukherjee, who identifies as Muslim, commands a combined social media following of more than 2 million.                 Known for her lifestyle and food videos showing her sampling various dishes, she received backlash over a video she shared on TikTok in March, which showed her sitting at a dining table and reciting the Islamic phrase “Bismillah” (In the name of Allah) before consuming crispy pork skin.                  Bismillah is one of the most important and common holy phrases in Islam. It is the first phrase in the Quran and is often uttered by Muslims before eating. It is also frequently used as a generic declaration.                  The video, which Mukherjee said had been filmed when she was traveling in Bali, featured her trying babi guling, a popular street food of rice and chunks of spit-roasted pork and crackling served with vegetables.                  She speaks into the camera and grimaces as she tries a piece of pork crackling.                  The video drew millions of views but was condemned by religious groups, including the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country’s top Muslim clerical body, which issued a ruling calling it “blasphemous.”                 It also prompted a public complaint which sparked police investigations, which led to Mukherjee being prosecuted.      Sex outside marriage ban tests Indonesia's relationship with democracy Photos and videos taken of Mukherjee throughout the trial and carried by CNN Indonesia often showed her in tears and accompanied by a heavy security presence.                   “She’s done nothing wrong but it says a lot about (the state of) Indonesia… how a self-proclaimed moderate Muslim country is becoming a radicalized Muslim nation,” Human Rights Watch’s Indonesia researcher Andreas Harsono told CNN.                  “The blasphemy chapter in the criminal code has been increased from one to six articles – a serious setback to protecting freedom of religion and belief in Indonesia,” he added. “It bucks a global trend to either not enforce blasphemy laws or to scrap them altogether.”                  One of Indonesia’s most high-profile blasphemy cases was that of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Indonesian politician widely known as Ahok who served as Jakarta’s first non-Muslim governor in 50 years.                 He went on trial for blasphemy in 2017 after angering hard-line Muslims by referencing a verse from the Quran while campaigning for re-election in 2016 and was jailed for two years despite making a public apology.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/12/opinions/iran-women-mahsa-amini-anniversary-afkhami/index.html,Opinion: Iranian women know which battles to fight. They’ve been doing it for decades,"The courageous women who were on the streets after the September 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in Iranian morality police custody have made a lasting difference, writes Mahnaz Afkhami.","Sep 12, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Mahnaz Afkhami,International,"Editor’s note: Mahnaz Afkhami was the minister of women’s affairs in Iran’s government before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. She is founder and president of Women’s Learning Partnership and executive director of the Foundation for Iranian Studies. Her most recent book is “The Other Side of Silence: A Memoir of Exile, Iran, and the Global Women’s Movement,” published by the University of North Carolina Press. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.             On September 16, 2022, Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish Iranian woman, died while she was in the custody of Iran’s morality police for the “crime” of inadequate veiling. This event spearheaded an uprising that soon captured global attention and gained support, from grassroots activists to world leaders.                 As we have come to expect, the Iranian regime reacted to the uprising with horrific brutality. But in the end, the courageous women who were on the streets shouting one of the most profound yet easily accepted slogans — “Woman, Life, Freedom” — have made a lasting difference. These three words were repeated in demonstrations by women and men around the world and appeared in different languages on buildings, billboards and flags across the globe.                 People ask whether this will be just another event suppressed by the violent response of the Islamic Republic. I do not believe it will be. A few days ago, I spoke with a woman activist in Tehran who pointed out, “The women have won. The city looks different. Women walk around as they wish — without veils — and sit in conversation with their male friends and family in coffee shops.”                 While the government is still intent on cracking down on women for improperly following the dress code, the social norms in Iran are shifting.                 On the anniversary of Amini’s death, it would be helpful to look at the evolution of the role of women in the Islamic Republic and to follow the ongoing process of their courageous struggle for their autonomy and rights.                 Iranian women were drawn into the Islamic Revolution of 1979 by the false promises of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who said, “In Islamic society women will be free to choose their own destiny and own activity.” He also claimed that he would go to his home in Qom, the city of clerics, and would have nothing to do with government. That turned out to be a lie — and shortly after he returned to Iran that February, he declared compulsory veiling, even before a government was established or there was a constitution.                 On March 8, 1979, International Women’s Day, tens of thousands of women demonstrated against his decree and were attacked by pro-revolution forces.                 Since then, Iranian women have used every opportunity to pressure the Islamic government for their rights. But they have lost the battle where the law is concerned, and Iran has gone from being at the forefront of women’s rights in the Middle East in 1978 to being ranked one of the worst countries in the world when it comes to gender equality.     Opinion: Iran's most powerful weapon isn't working             But women’s activists learned important lessons from decades of consciousness-raising and mobilization, drawing on each uprising and movement since the 1979 revolution.                 One of the most successful movements was in 2006, with the One Million Signatures Campaign for Reform of Discriminatory Family Laws. In that campaign, women organized in communities and went door to door in neighborhoods, talking to men and women, explaining the changes they were seeking, and asking for signatures. They worked with conservative religious women in areas where they were in agreement, such as equal rights and education and jobs. Around 30% of the signatures they gathered were from men.               For a time during Mohammad Khatami’s presidency from 1997 to 2005, some women activists argued that it might be possible to reform the system, given Khatami’s promises of a more tolerant society and comments about how women should not be regarded as “second-class citizens.” But his presidency did not lead to substantial legal changes, and by the time Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in office, the notion of reform lost credibility.     Opinion: The relentless bravery of Iranian protesters is a moral test for the Western world             As a response to what was widely considered a fraudulent election in 2009, the Green Movement was born two years before the Arab Spring. Protesters who were a part of the Green Movement eventually built on the alleged election fraud to make greater demands for the democratic rights originally sought in the 1979 revolution. Both men and women demonstrated in the hundreds of thousands and shouted, “Where is my vote?”                 Since that time, the expansion of technology and the presence of a connected, well-educated diaspora with women leaders in science, technology, the arts and politics have been important factors in encouraging and supporting those who remain inside.                 Iranian women have been deprived of the rights that they know and for which they have worked. But they have fought a medieval government and won a great deal. The Woman, Life, Freedom movement has succeeded in transporting and amplifying their voices and their activism across the world. This may be the first women-led counterrevolution in history — and it’s one in which men and women have participated together. It also offers an example of how women can work with each other and with men to engage in dialogue, provide support and respect differences of opinion.                 In every area of endeavor that does not need government engagement, the women of Iran have succeeded. They own businesses, teach, connect with each other and with their supporters outside the country, and are unafraid. They have forced the government to back down.                 They want a government that is worthy of their courage and wisdom. But they are realistic enough to know that while governments around the world continue to engage with the Islamic Republic and do not oppose it, unarmed civilians will not be the force that unseats the government. They have won the battles they chose and could win. The battle for the government they wish will require other means.                 They are mobilizing men and women, learning the basics of democratic governance, and preparing civil society for democracy — and when they finally receive serious, consistent support, they will be ready.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The video of the incident, which took place in the Muzaffarnagar district in northern Uttar Pradesh state, shows the boy fearfully standing in front of his classmates as the teacher calls on students to hit him.                  The boy cries as his classmates take turns to slap him, while the teacher is heard telling the students to do it “properly.” A man can be heard laughing as the boy wails while the slapping continues.                  Muzaffarnagar’s superintendent of police, Satyanarayan Prajapat, on Friday said the teacher told students to hit the boy “for not remembering his times tables.”                  The teacher also referenced the boy’s religion, according to Prajapat.                  “The female teacher declared: ‘When the mothers of Mohammedan (one who follows Islam) students don’t pay attention to their children’s studies, their performance is ruined,” he said.                 Police in the district have registered a case against the teacher and an investigation is underway. The teacher has not been formally charged. District officials have also ordered the school to shut, according to CNN affiliate CNN News-18.                  CNN has reached out to Uttar Pradesh police officials for more details.                  The boy’s father told CNN that his son felt “restless and scared” after the incident on Thursday. He said that, while the boy is doing much better now, he “was unable to sleep earlier and was left in shock” afterward.                   He told CNN that his son has since been admitted to another school and attended his first day on Monday, after Neha Public School – where the incident took place – was ordered to shut down.                  The incident has caused widespread anger and upset in India, the world’s largest democracy of 1.4 billion, where the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Hindu nationalist policies have deepened the country’s communal tensions and created what rights groups and government critics say is an atmosphere of fear and alienation among minority groups.                  Prominent opposition politician Rahul Gandhi accused the teacher of “sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children.” Writing on Twitter, now known as X, he said: “Turning a holy place like school into a market place of hatred – there is nothing worse than this that a teacher can do for the country.”                  Gandhi also blamed the BJP for stoking religious intolerance.                 “This is the same kerosene spread by the BJP which has set every corner of India on fire,” Gandhi wrote. “Children are the future of India - do not hate them, we all have to teach love together.”                 While the BJP has not responded to Gandhi’s comments, it has long maintained it does not discriminate against minorities and “treats all its citizens with equality.” During a trip to the United States in June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told reporters there was “absolutely no space” for discrimination in India.                 Indian law does not have a statutory definition of corporal punishment targeting children, however physical punishment and mental harassment are prohibited under the country’s Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act.                  According to CNN News-18, the teacher claimed the 7-year-old’s father had asked her to punish the child, adding that she was unable to do so because she is disabled and had therefore told the other students to discipline him.                  “His father brought the child in and said to straighten him out. Now because I can’t get up, I thought I’d get one or two children to hit him,” she said.                 The incident comes at a time of heightened communal tensions in the country as the BJP’s popular but divisive policies gain momentum in India.                  A study by economist Deepankar Basu noted a 786% increase in hate crimes against all minorities between 2014 and 2018, following the BJP’s election victory.                 Uttar Pradesh, where the incident took place, is India’s largest state of about 200 million. It boasts a religiously diverse population, where about 20% of its residents are Muslim.                  However, it remains among one of the most polarized of states in India.                  Its chief minister, the Hindu-monk-turned BJP politician Yogi Adityanath, has been criticized for his anti-Muslim rhetoric and Hindu-first policies, and the state has passed legislation critics say is rooted in “Hindutva” – the ideological bedrock of Hindu nationalism.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             Iran is moving to head off a possible repeat of unrest ahead of the first anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini, arresting women’s rights activists and family members of people killed during last year’s nationwide protests, local and international human rights groups said Wednesday.                   Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman, died last September after being detained by the regime’s infamous morality police and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.                  Protests sparked by Amini’s death, the largest Iran has witnessed in years, were met with a brutal crackdown by Iran’s security forces.                   More than 300 people were killed in the protests, including more than 40 children, the UN said in November last year. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) in January placed the number at more than 500, including 70 children.        Iran proposes long jail terms, AI surveillance and crackdown on influencers in harsh new hijab law              Thousands were arrested during months of protests across the country, the UN said in a report in June, citing research released last year by their Human Rights Committee.                  Iran executed seven protesters for their involvement in the unrest, according to the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.                   A group of volunteer lawyers who defend rights activists alleged in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that Iran arrested the father of one of the executed protesters and the family’s legal counsel on Tuesday.                  CNN has reached out to the Iranian Foreign Ministry for comment.                   In a separate case, Shermin Habibi, the wife of Fereydoon Mahmoodi, a protester killed by security forces during the demonstrations, was arrested and transported to an undisclosed location on Tuesday, according to a report from HRANA.                   Across 10 provinces, families of 33 people killed during the protests have been subjected to “human rights violations” in recent months, and the families of two people executed in connection with the protests were harassed and intimidated, Amnesty International said in a report this week.                  Meanwhile, Bidarzani, an independent women’s rights group, alleges in social media posts that 11 women’s rights activists and one man were arrested in Gilan province over the last week.                   State-affiliated media said 12 people were arrested for “preparing unrest and insecurity” in the province, which is northwest of Tehran on the Caspian Sea. Prosecutors in Gilan refused to provide details on which security entity was behind the arrests, according to Bidarzani.                  “Iranian authorities are using their go-to playbook of putting maximum pressure on peaceful dissidents ahead of the anniversary of Mahsa Amini’s death,” a senior Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch, Tara Sepehri Far said in a press release.      Iran's morality police resume headscarf patrols, state media says              “The arbitrary arrests of a dozen activists are aimed at suppressing popular discontent with ongoing impunity and rights violations.”                 It is unclear if more protests are planned to coincide with the anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested by Iran’s morality police for not wearing her hijab correctly.                  Ten months after her death, Iran’s morality police resumed headscarf patrols and now Iranian authorities are considering a draconian new bill on hijab-wearing that experts say would enshrine unprecedentedly harsh punitive measures into law.                  The 70-article draft law sets out a range of proposals, including much longer prison terms for women who refuse to wear the veil, stiff new penalties for celebrities and businesses who flout the rules, and the use of artificial intelligence to identify women in breach of the dress code.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The National Commission for Human Rights said the number of churches burnt “has risen to eight,” in an update on Wednesday, calling the situation “sad and shameful.”                 According to a police report obtained by CNN, two Christian men were charged by local police in the town of Jaranwala on the grounds of “desecrating the holy Quran and abusing the Prophet Mohammed.” The report stated that the men had been booked under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.                 Pakistani Christian communities are regularly targeted with the country’s strict blasphemy laws, which activists say have historically been manipulated to persecute minorities and isolate them from public life.                  Yasir Talib, who works for the Centre for Social Justice and who was in the town at the time of the incident, said a crowd vandalized and set on fire the home of one Christian man accused of making blasphemous comments against Islam.                 Multiple churches including the town’s Catholic Church, the Salvation Army Church and the Pentecostal Church, as well as the local Christian colony, were also vandalized and set on fire, Talib told CNN.                 In a statement Wednesday, the assistant commissioner for Faisalabad, where the town is located, called for the deployment of armed forces to support enforcing law and order, describing the situation as “sensitive and vulnerable.”                 Pakistan’s caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar condemned the violence, writing in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “stern action would be taken against those who violate law and target minorities.”                 President Bishop for the Church of Pakistan Azad Marshall said the country’s “Bishops, Priests and lay people are deeply pained and distressed” by the incident.                 “Bibles have been desecrated and Christians have been tortured and harassed having been falsely accused,” Marshall said on X, calling for “justice and action” by law enforcement and the legal system.                 The National Commission for Human Rights, a government body in Pakistan, called the violence “sad and shameful.”                   Riina Kionka, the EU ambassador to Pakistan, said the reports were “disturbing.”                 “The degree to which a society’s minorities feel safe, in Pakistan, in the European Union, around the world, is a measure of respect for the rule of law, for tolerance of diversity, a core EU value,” she posted on X on Wednesday.                 Pakistan is among the countries where blasphemy is a crime punishable by the death sentence.                 In 2013, more than 100 homes of Christians were set ablaze by outraged Muslims in Lahore’s Badami Bagh community, after police arrested a 20-year-old man accused of speaking against the Prophet Mohammed.                  Three years earlier, a mother of five from Punjab was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to hang, after she was accused of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed.                  Asia Bibi was freed from death row in 2018, after she won her appeal against the conviction and death sentence.

Unlike other Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia, its prayer sessions do not follow gender segregation, angering some religious groups.                  “Investigators took legal action,” Djuhandhani said on Tuesday. “(Panji will be) detained in the Criminal Investigation Agency’s detention facility for 20 days,” he added.                 Police did not specify what Panji had said or done that constituted blasphemy but said they were acting on public complaints.                 In June, Indonesia’s Islamic Clerical Council said it was investigating Al-Zaytun for “misguided religious practices,” according to CNN affiliate CNN Indonesia. If found guilty of blasphemy and hate speech, Panji faces a maximum 10 years in prison.                 Panji’s lawyer Hendra Effendy called for calm from his supporters.                  “He is after all, a public figure with millions of supporters… With all this happening, we don’t know what could happen,” he told CNN Indonesia.                  One of Panji’s supporters, who did not wish to be named for fear of reprisals, told CNN his arrest was “unjust” and reflective of the country’s turn towards the religious right.                  “So he went against (the curve) – does he deserve to be punished for his compassion,” the supporter asked.                  Most mainstream schools of Islam around the world segregate men and women during prayers and do not permit women to lead mixed gendered prayers or deliver sermons.                  Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, with 231 million Muslims.                  Although it has an overwhelming Muslim majority, it is constitutionally secular and officially recognizes six religions – Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism.                  Historically the country has practiced a tolerant and pluralist form of Islam. However, it has seen a rise in religious conservatism in recent years.                 Strict Islamic laws are also enforced in some parts of the country, including the semi-autonomous Aceh province, where alcohol and gambling are banned and public floggings take place for a range of offenses including homosexuality and adultery.                 Panji was “supportive” of Muslim women becoming imams and leading others in prayer, something which “isn’t normal in Indonesian society,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.                  “He has been promoting gender equality within Islam and this has angered the conservatives. There is nothing wrong with him (a Muslim cleric) promoting women’s rights – something is terribly wrong with blasphemy laws,” he added.      Sex outside marriage ban tests Indonesia's relationship with democracy             Rights groups say that religious freedom and tolerance are “under threat” in Indonesia and blasphemy laws were being “increasingly weaponized” against religious minorities and people deemed to have criticized Islam.                 One of the highest profile blasphemy cases was that of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Indonesian widely known as Ahok and Jakarta’s first non-Muslim governor in 50 years.                 He went on trial for blasphemy in 2017 after angering hard-line Muslims by referencing a verse from the Quran while campaigning for re-election in 2016.                  Despite making a public apology, he was jailed for two years – a verdict met with scrutiny and condemnation by many Indonesians and observers in the international community. The case was widely seen as a test of religious tolerance and free speech in Indonesia.                  “Blasphemy cases have been increasing drastically over the years,” Andreas of Human Rights Watch said. “Officials in Indonesia are using these laws more frequently against religious minorities in the name of ‘religious harmony’ and it’s (grown) more and more toxic.”                  “It is becoming an increasingly Islamized state and there will be many more consequences… for people whose views are considered to be against the Islamic establishment,” he said, referencing controversial amendments to its criminal code set to be passed by 2025.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             Just weeks ahead of the one-year anniversary of the mass protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, Iranian authorities are considering a draconian new bill on hijab-wearing that experts say would enshrine unprecedentedly harsh punitive measures into law.                   The 70-article draft law sets out a range of proposals, including much longer prison terms for women who refuse to wear the veil, stiff new penalties for celebrities and businesses who flout the rules, and the use of artificial intelligence to identify women in breach of the dress code.                    Experts said the bill, which has not yet been passed, was a warning to Iranians that the regime would not back down from its stance on the hijab despite the mass demonstrations that rocked the country last year.                   The bill was submitted by the judiciary to the government for consideration earlier this year, then forwarded to the parliament and subsequently approved by the Legal and Judicial Commission. It is set to be submitted to the Board of Governors this Sunday before it is introduced on the floor of parliament, state-aligned news agency Mehr reported Tuesday.    Iran bans film festival over poster of actress without hijab             Iran’s parliament would work on finalizing the text and voting on the bill “in the next two months,” Mehr said. It is “a clear response to the protests from September of last fall,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think-tank in London, told CNN, adding that the establishment was attempting to “reassert authority over veiling and the requirements expected of women.”                  Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman, died last September after being detained by the regime’s infamous morality police and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.                   While not officially disbanded, the morality police had largely pulled back following last year’s protests, which have gradually waned. But earlier this month, police spokesman General Saeed Montazerolmahdi said the morality police would resume notifying and then detaining women who are caught without the Islamic headscarf in public.                  The hijab has long been a point of contention in Iran. It was barred in 1936 during leader Reza Shah’s emancipation of women, until his successor lifted the ban in 1941. In 1983 the hijab became mandatory after the last shah was overthrown in the Islamic Revolution of 1979.                   Iran has traditionally considered Article 368 of its Islamic penal code as the hijab law, which states that those in breach of the dress code face between 10 days to two months in prison, or a fine between 50,000 to 500,000 Iranian rials, what is today between $1.18 to $11.82.                  The new bill would reclassify failure to wear the hijab as a more severe offense, punishable by a five-to-ten-year prison sentence as well as a higher fine of up to 360 million Iranian rials ($8,508).                   That fine is far beyond what the average Iranian could pay, as millions are below the poverty line, Hossein Raeesi, an Iranian human rights lawyer and adjunct professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, told CNN.                  Another section states that in order to enforce the new law, Iranian police must “create and strengthen AI systems to identify perpetrators of illegal behavior using tools such as fixed and mobile cameras.” Earlier this year, state media reported that cameras would be installed in public places to identify women who violate the country’s hijab law.      Iran's morality police resume headscarf patrols, state media says              Under the new law, business owners who do not enforce the hijab requirement will face steeper fines, potentially amounting to three months’ of their business profit, and face bans on leaving the country or participating in public or cyberactivity for up to two years.                     The bill also targets celebrities, who may face a fine of up to a tenth of their wealth, exclusion from employment or professional activities for a specified period of time, as well as a ban on international travel and social media activities.                  The draft law would also mandate broader gender segregation in universities – common hotbeds of civilian protests – and other public spaces.                   Article 49 of the bill defines the lack of hijab for women as “clothes that show a part of the body below the neck or above the ankles or above the forearms.” Clothes that are “revealing or tight” also violate the law.                   Some of the measures in the draft law have already been “unlawfully” exercised by the Iranian security forces, Raeesi said, including the recent closure of an insurance company in Tehran after some photos of female employees without the hijab circulated on social media. With this bill, the government would “legalize illegal behavior” by those forces, Raeesi said.      Iran installs cameras to identify women breaking dress code             Experts believe the legislation, or parts of it, is likely to pass in some form – most members of parliament are regime-aligned and unlikely to block it – though Raeesi said it was possible that the government could pull the bill if it is able to control any potential unrest around the Mahsa Amini anniversary. If the bill is passed by parliament, it must also be approved by the regime’s Guardian Council, Raeesi told CNN.                  A 12-member council with considerable power in Iran, the Guardian Council is charged with making sure that legislation passed falls in line with the values of Islam and the Iranian constitution. Any bill passed by the parliament must be reviewed and approved by the council to become law.                  In the meantime, experts said the bill sent a clear message to Iranians.                  “The system is trying to make clear that leniency won’t be tolerated, and that there is a clear, graduated system of punishment for individuals that are going to flout the dress law in the country,” Vakil said.

Sweden sparked an international spat after allowing a protester to burn a copy of the Quran outside a mosque in Stockholm in June, which coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, one of the most significant events in the Islamic calendar – an incident that angered Turkey and jeopardized Sweden’s bid to join NATO.                 Several Qurans have also been burned outside foreign embassies in the Danish capital Copenhagen over recent weeks.                 While some of the protests have been staged by individuals, a number have been carried out by far-right groups that are growing in influence in the two countries.                 The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which comprises 57 Muslim states, held an emergency meeting on Monday, where it “condemned” Sweden and Denmark for allowing the protests to continue “under the garb of freedom of expression.”                 The right to freedom of expression has been enshrined in the Swedish and Danish constitutions for centuries. But both countries signaled Sunday that they are exploring legal ways to prevent such protests, amid security and geopolitical concerns.                 Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said he was in “close dialogue” with his Danish counterpart over the weekend and that the two nations “share the same analysis: The situation is dangerous and measures are needed to strengthen our resilience.”                 As a result of the protests, the Danish government said that Denmark “is being viewed as a country that facilitates insult and denigration of the cultures, religions, and traditions of other countries.” In recent weeks, 15 governments have issued condemnations of Denmark.                 Sweden was also condemned after allowing Salwan Momika, an Iraqi Christian immigrant, to burn a copy of the Quran in Stockholm. Momika has staged several such protests in recent months.                 The day after that protest, demonstrators broke into the Swedish embassy in Baghdad, demanding the expulsion of the Swedish ambassador to Iraq. Demonstrators had previously clashed with security forces outside the embassy in January for a separate incident of Quran burning in Stockholm.                 Sweden and Denmark are among the most liberal, secular countries in the world. Freedom of speech is enshrined in their constitutions and neither nation has blasphemy laws, meaning it is not illegal to insult religion or desecrate religious texts like the Quran.                  “Sweden’s protection, under the Swedish constitution, for freedom of expression, is the strongest protection in the world – even more so than the first amendment in the United States,” Marten Schutlz, a law professor at Stockholm University, told CNN. “Freedom of speech is almost always the first priority in all conflicts of interests or values.”                 In order for a protest to go ahead, Swedes must apply for a permit from the police under the Public Order Act. The police can only refuse a permit on safety grounds.                 When the Swedish police authority attempted to prevent Momika from staging his protest by denying him a permit in February, its decision was overturned by Sweden’s Court of Appeal.                 “The police are by law only allowed to say no in case of them not being able to guarantee safety at the demonstration itself. They can’t take into account the wider political perspective,” Sofie Blomback, a political scientist at Mid Sweden University, told CNN.                 While freedom of speech has long been a constitutional right in Sweden and Denmark, the scrapping of blasphemy laws was a more recent development. Sweden abolished them in the 1970s, while Denmark ditched such laws in 2017, after they had been on the statute books since the 17th century.                 “Religion should not dictate what is allowed and what is forbidden to say publicly. It gives religion a totally unfair priority in society,” said Bruno Jerup, a member of Denmark’s Parliament, at the time.                  Under existing laws, neither government is able to legally ban the protests. Instead, both are simply trying to discourage them. Blomback described the Swedish government’s stance on the issue as “it’s legal, but we don’t like it.”                 In a statement, the Danish government said it “has clearly distanced itself from and condemned the burnings of the holy Quran. The burnings are deeply offensive and reckless acts committed by few individuals. These few individuals do not represent the values the Danish society is built on.”                 But, over the weekend, both countries signaled that they are exploring legal mechanisms to limit the demonstrations.                 “We will find a legal tool that allows us to prevent the Koran burnings in front of foreign embassies,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said.                 Sweden’s Kristersson also announced that his government has “already started analyzing the legal situation – including the Public Order Act – with the purpose of exploring the scope for measures that would strengthen our national security.”                 Both countries have faced crises surrounding freedom of speech before. In 2005, the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten published caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed wearing a turban made out of a bomb, sparking a wave of violence. Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was also the object of an attempted attack after publishing similar cartoons of Mohammed in 2007.                 But neither country tightened their free speech laws in response to these attacks.                 The diplomatic row comes at a precarious moment – for Sweden especially.                 “We are currently in the most serious security situation since the Second World War, and as for Sweden, we are aware that states and state-like actors are actively exploiting the situation,” Kristersson said in a statement posted Sunday.                 Sweden formally applied for NATO membership last year, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, its accession to the bloc was for months obstructed by Turkey, which objected to, among other things, what it alleged to be Sweden’s complicity in Quran-burning protests.                 Turkey finally gave the green-light to Sweden’s bid on the eve of NATO’s summit in Vilnius in June, although Stockholm cannot formally join the alliance before its membership is ratified by a vote in the Turkish parliament due to be held this fall.     Turkey has agreed to back Sweden's NATO bid, alliance chief says             Carl-Oskar Bohlin, Sweden’s Civil Defense Minister, claimed in a statement last week that Russian-affiliated actors were attempting to capitalize on the situation.                 “Sweden is right now the target of influence campaigns, supported by states and state-like actors, whose purpose is to harm Sweden and Swedish interests,” said Bohlin. “These events are then retold in an inaccurate way, sometimes with direct calls to hurt our country.”                 Bohlin also claimed that “Russia-backed actors are amplifying incorrect statements such as that the Swedish state is behind the desecration of holy scriptures.”                 “It’s a very sensitive time for Sweden because we are trying to become members of NATO, so this has really had an effect on these negotiations,” Schulz told CNN.

The comments, made by prime time host Greg Gutfeld, came during a discussion Monday on “The Five” about Florida’s new Black history standards that requires instruction for students include “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.”                 Jessica Tarlov, a liberal-leaning co-host on “The Five,” expressed disapproval of the new history standards and questioned whether arguments used to defend them would ever be made in regard to the Holocaust.                   “I’m not Black, but I’m Jewish,” Tarlov said. “Would someone say about the Holocaust, for instance, that there were some benefits for Jews? That while they were hanging out in concentration camps, they learned a strong work ethic? That maybe you learned a new skill.”                 Gutfeld replied, asking if Tarlov had read the “Man’s Search for Meaning,” a bestselling book written by psychiatrist Viktor Frankl who was imprisoned during the Holocaust and described the atrocities committed in concentration camps. In his book, Frankl detailed how people can cope with suffering and find meaning in the most horrific of circumstances.                 “Frankl talks about how you had to survive in a concentration camp by having skills. You had to be useful,” Gutfeld told Tarlov. “Utility! Utility kept you alive!”                 Gutfeld’s assertion immediately ignited criticism, including from the Auschwitz Memorial, which said in a statement, “Being skilled or useful did not spare [Jewish people] from the horrors of the gas chambers.”     While it is true that some Jews may have used their skills or usefulness to increase their chances of survival during the Holocaust, it is essential to contextualize this statement properly and understand that it does not represent the complex history of the genocide perpetrated… https://t.co/F8VfwRuFEI             On Tuesday, the White House weighed in, blasting the right-wing channel over its silence on Gutfeld’s comments.                 “What Fox News allowed to be said on their air yesterday — and has so far failed to condemn — is an obscenity,” Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement to CNN.                  “In defending a horrid, dangerous, extreme lie that insults the memory of the millions of Americans who suffered from the evil of enslavement, a Fox News host told another horrid, dangerous and extreme lie that insults the memory of the millions of people who suffered from the evils of the Holocaust,” Bates continued.                  “Let’s get something straight that the American people understand full well and that is not complicated: there was nothing good about slavery; there was nothing good about the Holocaust. Full stop,” Bates added. “Americans deserve to be brought together, not torn apart with poison. And they deserve the truth and the freedom to learn, not book bans and lies.”                 A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.                 Fox News has faced criticism in recent years for giving air to extreme rhetoric. The Anti-Defamation League has repeatedly — and sharply — criticized the network for mainstreaming “fringe” rhetoric. During the presidency of Donald Trump, the network trafficked in right-wing propaganda and conspiracy theories — including giving air to dangerous lies about the legitimacy of the 2020 election.                 Fox News debuted its revamped prime time lineup just last week, after inexplicably firing Tucker Carlson earlier this year.

Videos posted on social media showed a large number of protesters inside the Swedish embassy’s perimeter as well as black smoke and fire coming from the building.                 Security forces armed with electric batons chased protestors and used water cannons to disperse them and put out the fire, a security source told CNN.                 Eyewitnesses told CNN that the protesters withdrew from the perimeter of the Swedish Embassy after setting part of it on fire “after delivering their message of protest against the act of burning the Holy Book of God.”                 Several journalists covering the protests were detained by security forces, and at least one was beaten, according to multiple organizations.                 “Journalists should be free to report the news without fear of harassment or harm, wherever they are,” Reuters Iraq Bureau Chief Timour Azhari tweeted Thursday. Two detained Reuters journalists were released after several hours, the agency said.                 Ziyad Al-Ajili, the head of the Iraq-based Journalistic Freedoms Observatory (JFO) told CNN that three photojournalists working with international news agencies were arrested and another was beaten by security forces and his camera destroyed.                 CNN has reached out to the Iraqi government for comment.                 The planned protest in Sweden took place later on Thursday outside the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm. It was organized by Salwan Momika, an Iraqi national in Sweden who burned a copy of the Quran outside a mosque in Stockholm last month during the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, in a solo that sparked outrage in Iraq and around the world.                  Ultimately no Qurans were burned during Thursday’s protest, according to videos seen by CNN, but footage showed two protesters kicking and partially destroying a Quran, and Momika stepping on a Quran and polishing his shoes with a picture of the Iraqi flag.                  A Stockholm police spokesperson said there were two people in attendance with a permit for the protest and estimated that another 150 people were present, most of them reporters.                  The Swedish police have stressed that they only grant permits for people to hold public gatherings and not for the activities conducted during them, AFP reported.                 Swedish and Iraqi authorities exchanged heated words over the protests, as Baghdad threatened to sever diplomatic ties with Stockholm over Quran-burning demonstrations sanctioned by the state.                 “Granting permission under the pretext of freedom of expression is viewed as provocative and contrary to international covenants and norms, which emphasize respect for religions and beliefs,” the Iraqi prime minister’s office said.                 Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia also publicly condemned the holy book’s desecration in Sweden, with authorities in Tehran and Riyadh summoning Swedish diplomats to express their anger.                  Prominent Iraqi Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr, whose supporters were behind the protests at the Swedish embassy, said that “Sweden’s hostility towards Islam and the holy books by giving permission to burn the Iraqi flag means Sweden doesn’t believe in Iraq.                 “It’s on the government to not just express condemnation and denunciation as that shows weakness and complacency,” Sadr said.     Protesters break into Swedish embassy in Baghdad after Stockholm Quran burning             However, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry also condemned the attack on the Swedish embassy, calling it part of a concerning pattern of assaults on diplomatic missions.                 The Iraqi government held an emergency meeting on Thursday to turn in the arrested individuals arrested in Baghdad to the judiciary, adding that “negligent security officials will be investigated and face appropriate legal measures.”                 Swedish authorities too condemned the demonstrations in Baghdad, calling the actions of protesters “completely unacceptable.” Iraq’s charge d’affaires in Stockholm has been summoned, Sweden’s Foreign Minister Tobias Billström said on Thursday.                 Sweden’s embassy staff in Baghdad are all safe amid protests outside of the building, the foreign ministry’s press office told CNN via email.                 “We condemn all attacks on diplomats and staff from international organizations. Attacks on embassies and diplomats constitute a serious violation of the Vienna Convention. Iraqi authorities have the responsibility to protect diplomatic missions and diplomatic staff,” it said.                 Iraq later recalled its chargé d’affaires from the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm, and asked the Swedish ambassador in Baghdad to leave the country, an Iraqi government spokesperson said Thursday.                 Iraq also suspended Swedish telecom giant Ericsson’s license in the country in response to the demonstration in Stockholm.                 Ericsson told CNN in a statement on Thursday that the incidents in Stockholm “involving the burning of the Holy Quran is deeply offensive to the religious beliefs and values cherished by Muslims around the world.                  “This act does not reflect Ericsson’s core value of respect.”                 The European Union echoed Sweden’s condemnation of the attack in Iraq overnight, saying it hoped for a “swift return to normality” in the relations between both countries.                 The diplomatic fallout saw the United States “strongly” condemn the attack on Thursday. The US emphasized that freedom of peaceful assembly is vital to democracy, but this violent act was unlawful and unacceptable, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement.                  “Foreign missions should not be targets of violence. We call on the Government of Iraq to honor its international obligations to protect all diplomatic missions in Iraq against any intrusion or damage, as required by international law,” Miller said.                 Miguel Moratinos, the high representative of the United Nation’s Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), said the the desecration of sacred religious books is not freedom of expression but rather an expression of contempt and religious hatred.                  “The High Representative also condemns the acts of violence and the storming of the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad today,” the statement read.                  “He re-iterates that the desecration of sacred religious books and religious sites is a disrespectful and provocative act. Such acts often lead to agitation and incitement to violence. At the same time, he stresses that violence is never an appropriate response to provocation,” the statement added.

Saeid Montazeralmahdi, spokesman for Iran’s enforcement body, Faraja, said police will restart vehicle and foot patrols across the country from Sunday, the state-run Fars news agency reported.                   Officers will first warn women who are not complying, while those who “insist on breaking the norms,” may face legal action, he said.                 The morality police were cast into the international spotlight in September last year, when 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died three days after being arrested by the force for wearing her hijab, or headscarf, incorrectly and taken to a “re-education” center.                  Her death sparked nationwide protests that rocked the country, posing one of the biggest domestic threats to Iran’s ruling clerical regime in more than a decade.                  Authorities responded violently to suppress the months-long movement, during which witnesses said the morality police had virtually disappeared from the streets of Tehran.                 Iran executed at least 582 people last year, a 75% increase on 2021, according to human rights groups who say the rise reflects an effort by Tehran to instill fear among anti-regime protesters.                  The morality police have access to power, arms and detention centers and control over “re-education centers,” Human Rights Watch told CNN last year. The group is sanctioned by the United States and the European Union.                 The centers act like detention facilities, where women – and sometimes men – are taken into custody for failing to comply with the state’s rules on modesty.                  Inside the facilities, detainees are given classes about Islam and the importance of the hijab, and are forced to sign a pledge to abide by the state’s clothing regulations before they are released.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Ahead of the 78th anniversary of the first of the Nazi camps to be freed by the Allies, he discusses the power of ...","Jul 4, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"Editor’s Note: Sheikh Mohammed Al-Issa is the Secretary General of the Muslim World League. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN opinion here.             In January 2020, I led a delegation of more than 60 prominent Arab Muslims, including 25 religious leaders, on what our Jewish hosts called a “groundbreaking” visit to the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camps.                 Ours was the most senior Islamic delegation to visit the site during its sorrowful history.                 Passing through the infamous gates was a visceral, emotionally-arresting experience that managed to both transport me back in time and sharpen my mind on the future. For it was here that 1.1 million people, the vast majority of them Jews, were murdered during the Holocaust. And it was here that I reaffirmed my commitment to fight intolerance and hate in all its forms.                 This visit was our moral obligation and an overdue sign of solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters, with whom we must tackle the many injustices and enmities there are in the world.                 Indeed, all the world’s major faiths — Christian, Judaic, Hindu, Buddhist and Hindu — have at their core a commitment to peace and justice that starts with recognition of the struggles of our fellow travelers.                 Now, on the cusp of the 78-year anniversary of the liberation of Majdanek (22-23 July, 1944), which was the first of the Nazi camps to be freed by the Allies, we must ask ourselves: does the truth of the Holocaust continue to set hearts and minds, once blinded by ignorance, fear and prejudice, free?                 The honest answer is that while Muslim understanding of the Holocaust is important to bringing lasting peace to the Holy Lands, Holocaust ignorance and denial remains a worrisome trend that only worsens with the passage of time.     A pig farm that stood on the site of a Nazi-era ‘Roma camp’ is finally demolished             Trivializing the Holocaust, we know too well, opens pathways to denial and to antisemitism, which still persists in the world, for sure. But it is a cross-cultural, cross-ethnic, cross-national, cross-religion phenomena.     One poll, conducted earlier this year by the American Jewish Committee, found that only 53% of Americans over the age of 18 answered correctly that approximately six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, while 20% explicitly said they were not sure. In the poll, 2% said that less than one million were killed, 13% chose approximately three million, and 11% said more than 12 million.                 The truth can set us free. And the truth of the Holocaust must continue to open our eyes to the horrors humankind is capable of inflicting — and help guide us to the truth of our common humanity and our shared destiny.                 But we must live, practice, and teach this truth every day, to keep the shadow of lies and ignorance from again overtaking our world.                 We can do this primarily through education and interfaith dialogue. There are ever more interfaith clubs and organizations sprouting across communities and college campuses, including the new Interfaith Research Lab at Columbia University, which I helped inaugurate with Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Rabbi Arthur Schneier.                 We can also work to build bridges of peace between the diverse peoples of the world, and be a force for a new, faith-driven diplomacy that compliments the traditional efforts of governments to achieve peace.                 This idea is already bearing fruit. Last year, The Muslim World League, together with Christian, Jewish, Shinto and other partners, took part in the G20 Summit of Nations in Bali, Indonesia as the “R20” (the Religion 20), an engagement group aiming to leverage the power of world religions to tackle pressing global challenges.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             And just last month, we hosted a high-level interfaith summit of religious leaders and diplomats at United Nations Headquarters in New York, aimed at soothing over growing tensions between east and west.                 These are not naïve exercises. Two historical facts are worth remembering. First, it was the Soviet Red Army – which was then allied with America and the West – that liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, as well as Majdanek, in the 1940s.                 Second, while the overwhelming number of victims of Nazi barbarity were Jews, among the murdered at Auschwitz were dozens of Muslims. The lessons here are clear. The clash of peoples is not inevitable. Good can defeat evil. And hate is an all-consuming pyre.                 We all rise or fall together. And as we remember the liberation of Majdanek, that is the truth that shall set us free.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The protests in the Iraqi capital were ordered by the powerful Iraqi Shia cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr, who also called for the expulsion of the Swedish ambassador in Baghdad.                 Videos circulating on social media showed some protesters climbing over a barricaded wall outside the  embassy. It is unclear how far into the building they got, before withdrawing.                 Sweden said its staff were safe. “We are well informed about the situation. Our Embassy staff are in safety and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is in regular contact with them,” the Swedish foreign ministry’s press office told CNN in an email.                  An Iraqi security source confirmed to CNN that the incident was over. The AFP news agency reported that the protestors were inside the compound for about 15 minutes.                 The protests in Baghdad came after an incident in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, on Wednesday, when a man burned a copy of Islam’s holy book outside a mosque. Images of the event showed he was the only person apart from his translator at the demonstration, which coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, one of the most significant in the Islamic calendar.                 Al Sadr demanded authorities withdraw the Iraqi nationality of Salwan Momika – the organizer of the one-man Quran protest in Stockholm – who immigrated to left Iraq for Sweden five years ago.                 “If freedom of speech is guaranteed to Iraq and the world, then the believers have to express their views on the burning of the holy books… through massive angry protests against the Swedish embassy in Iraq,” Al Sadr said.                 Muslim countries and Islamic organizations had condemned the burning of the Quran in Stockholm. Iran called the act “provocative” and Kuwait said it’s a “dangerous provocatory step”.                 The Organization of Islamic Cooperation [OIC], the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council all separately expressed strong condemnation to the event.                 On Wednesday, Morocco recalled its ambassador to Sweden and both Iraq and Saudi Arabia strongly condemned the act. On Thursday, the United Arab Emirates summoned Sweden’s ambassador to Abu Dhabi to protest the Quran burning incident, the UAE’s state news agency WAM said.                  In January early this year Iraqi protesters clashed with security forces outside the Swedish embassy for a separate incident of Quran burning in Stockholm.

A single person took part in the planned Quran burning in the Swedish capital and images of the event show he was the only person apart from his translator at the demonstration, which coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, one of the most significant in the Islamic calendar.                 The decision to permit the protest was made in accordance with the right of freedom of speech, Swedish police said, adding that the demonstration does not pose an immediate security risk.                 But allowing such an inflammatory protest stirred a backlash in Turkey, a NATO member state that has obstructed Sweden’s accession bid. Sweden and neighboring Finland both formally applied to join the bloc after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.”                 Turkey’s foreign minister condemned the protest on Wednesday, calling it a “heinous act.”                 “It is unacceptable to allow these anti-Islamic actions under the pretext of freedom of expression. To turn a blind eye to such heinous acts is to be complicit in them,” Hakan Fidan said in a statement.                  The Turkish government’s Director of Communicaitons Fahrettin Altun added in a tweet: “We are sick and tired of enabling of Islamophobia and continued instances of hatred for our religion on the part of European authorities especially in Sweden.”                 “Those who seek to become our allies in NATO, cannot tolerate or enable destructive behaviors of Islamophobic and xenophobic terrorists,” he said.                 NATO officials are hoping to avoid the embarrassment of seeing the alliance miss its own stated aim of admitting Sweden to the alliance by July 11 – the date of its next official summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Officials fear that missing this deadline will send a humiliating and potentially dangerous message to the alliance’s adversaries.                 Turkey – a strategically important NATO member due to its geographical location in both the Middle East and Europe, and the alliance’s second-largest military power – has proven the greatest obstacle to Sweden’s NATO accession bid.                 Earlier this year, Turkish-Swedish relations suffered a major blow following a rally outside Stockholm’s Turkish Embassy during which an anti-immigration politician set a copy of the Quran alight.                 The incident sparked anger in the Turkish capital, Ankara, where protesters took to the streets and burned the Swedish flag outside the Swedish embassy in response.                 At the time, the then Turkish foreign minister reportedly blamed the Swedish government, saying it had “taken part in this crime by allowing this vile act” to go ahead, according to state news agency Anadolu.                 An Eastern European diplomat told CNN that as well as “emboldening the enemies” of NATO, any delay to Sweden’s accession risks “giving the sense of Erdogan’s power over the alliance.” The diplomat added that “Erdogan will use the moment to squeeze every drop from this situation and will throw the ball to Sweden – making them hostage of their (own) anti-terrorist laws.”                 Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said that Sweden has fulfilled the necessary requirements set out by Turkey in order to join NATO, including introducing a new terrorism law.                 “New legislation has recently entered into force in Sweden that makes it illegal to participate in a terrorist organization in any way that promotes, strengthens or supports it. We are thereby delivering on the last parts of our agreement,” Billstrom said.                 But the decision to permit a Quran-burning protest may further damage Sweden’s relations with Turkey and dent the country’s hopes to join NATO.                 Speaking to CNN on the phone earlier on Wednesday, the protester Salwan Momika said he came to Sweden five years ago from Iraq and has Swedish citizenship. He told CNN he identifies as an atheist.                 He said he was doing this demonstration after three months of legal battles in court.                 “This book should be banned in the world because of the danger it causes to democracy, ethics, human values, human rights, and women’s rights. It just doesn’t work in this time and age,” he said.                 A police permit obtained by CNN states that the “security risks and consequences connected to a Quran burning are not of such a nature that, according to current law, they can be the basis for a decision to reject an application for a general meeting.”                 The permit for the demonstration says that Quran burnings “mean an increased risk of a terrorist attack” and “can also have foreign policy consequences.”                   However, it added that for “security problems to be the basis for a decision to refuse a general assembly, these must have a clear connection to the planned gathering or its immediate surroundings.”                   Authorities granted permission for the gathering according to certain conditions, including a fire ban in place in Stockholm since June 12, which “applies until further notice.”                 Speaking to CNN on the phone, Stockholm police spokesperson Helena Bostrom Thomas said that police had informed the applicant to find out about those restrictions but added that “freedom of speech weighs heavier than if he acts against the restrictions of the fire ban.”       CNN’s Luke McGee, Alex Hardie, Duarte Mendonca and Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou contributed reporting. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Two hours drive from Kenya’s coastal tourist town of Malindi, forensic teams turn off the tarred road into a thicket of thorn bush, entering a crime scene that came to light in mid-March.                  CNN has traveled here as investigators uncover what could become one of the worst mass suicides in recent memory.                    Detectives say that the cult community was split into eight separate settlements with biblical names such as Galilee and Bethlehem. In site after site, shallow graves disturb the dirt. Many of the graves were unmarked.                 Already, more than 300 sets of bodies have been recovered. But Kenyan interior ministry officials say that scores of mass graves remain.                 The cult was preparing for the end of the world under the instruction of their its powerful pastor, say investigators.                 Followers believed that starvation was their ticket to their salvation                 The revelation of mass graves has dominated headlines and shaken the collective psyche in a country where faith and religion are central.                  Many find it difficult to comprehend the dark path that Pastor Paul Nthenge Mackenzie allegedly took his followers along.                 But the trajectory it is all too familiar for cult specialists and psychologists. They contend that the “Shakahola Massacre,” as it has been dubbed, bears all the hallmarks of destructive cults past and present.                 “The pastor called me. He called me and said, ‘my daughter, you are being left behind. When the ark is closed, you will be too late,’” says Agnes, as her children play on a reed mat in her yard in Malindi.                  Like many former cult members, she was unwilling to share her full name.                  Agnes, now 26, joined Mackenzie’s church when she was still in high school along with other members of her family.                 In Kenya, there is an old joke that if you lose your job, start a church or a charity. And sometime in the early 2000s, Mackenzie abandoned his job as a taxi driver and launched the Good News International Ministry.                  Mackenzie became known for his fiery sermons. He drew a significant following, says an assistant pastor who worked with him for years until they had a falling out.                  He did not wish to be named as he said he is a witness in the investigation.                  “In the beginning, the church was good, there were no issues. The sermons were normal, but from 2010 his ‘end time’ messages began. It happened step by step,” he says.                 The assistant pastor says Mackenzie told his followers to pull their children out of school, discard their national IDs, avoid hospitals, and start preparing for the end of the world. Investigators say they have corroborated those details.                  He drew in flight attendants and social workers; paramilitary police and professionals from all across Kenya.                  At a recent hearing Mackenzie denied all knowledge of the horrors that witnesses, inspectors, and survivors believe happened in the Shakahola forest.                  “I can tell nothing about that. Because I have been in custody for two months. So, I don’t know what is going outside there. Have you been there?” he asked CNN.                  When asked about the accusations that followers of his group had starved their children following his instructions, Mackenzie said he had “never seen anybody starving.”                 The pastor and his closest followers have been in custody since the mass graves were discovered, although they are yet to be charged as prosecutors continue to ask the court to extend the custody period to allow further investigation.                 To understand the Shakahola cult, the focus must be on Mackenzie, says Rick Ross, a leading American cult expert who has studied destructive cults for decades.                  “It’s not the group; it’s the leader. The more power they have, the more it becomes intoxicating,” he says.                  Ross says that from Charles Manson and David Koresh to Ugandan cult leader Joseph Kibwetere, the desire is to control.                 “My feeling is Mackenzie was the same. He was a man that no matter how much control and power he had over his followers, it was never enough,” says Ross.     'Is my mum dead or not?': Son fears mother may be among Kenya starvation cult victims             Mackenzie exerted that control using his pulpit – and his charismatic oratory both in his church in Malindi and online.                 “Look what will befall all nations of this world. Anger, frustration, and many things, and many disasters will make human beings cry without help. That is what will cover the world,” he prophesied to his followers in early 2020 in a nearly three-hours harangue.                 Mackenzie’s prophecies had an impact. He persuaded Agnes and many like her to leave school.                  Agnes says she shaved her head and entered a church-arranged marriage.              “Some of his preaching turned into reality. He said that diseases would come and then the Coronavirus came,” she says.                  Last year, she moved her whole family to the forest.                  While cult leaders are central to their cults, they still need to amass a following.                  Dr. Geoffrey Wango, a professor of psychology at Nairobi University, says that, paradoxically, destructive cults give people hope.                  “The psychology of it is simple. The cult leader offers hope and promise and seeks easy targets,” he says.                  In the case of Mackenzie, he says, the hope is one of salvation and to turn your back on the stresses of daily survival.                  While the draw of cults is universal, Wango believes that you can’t separate the central position of religion in Kenya.                 Religion permeates right through the highest echelons of government. Kenya’s President Ruto became the country’s first evangelical president last year and built a place of worship in the presidential compound.     Religious leader linked to Kenya starvation cult says court hearing is a 'matter of intimidation'             Ruto condemned the grim discovery at Shakahola in the strongest terms, saying “we must as a nation continue to be on the lookout for those who abuse even the religious sector,” adding that Mackenzie belongs in jail.                 Poverty is also a significant factor in driving people to more extreme preachers, Wango said.                  “People are looking for a way out of their poverty, a way out of their desperation. And here is a religion that offers them a way out,” he says.                  Of course, there are extensive examples of the wealthy joining cults. The recent Nxivm cult in the US drew in the rich and powerful.                 But Ross, who helped expose Nxivm, says cults exploit individual vulnerabilities.                 “It could be anyone, but if someone is going through a difficult time in their life, or you lose your job, or do badly in school, or struggling financially, you are feeling unfulfilled, then a group like this comes along and it can be very alluring,” he says.                  Once inside a cult, both agree that isolation – physical and mental – is a critical factor that helps drive the horrors of doomsday cults.                 By 2018, Kenyan authorities started cracking down on Mackenzie. They arrested and detained him for his anti-government stance – but never prosecuted him.                  “That is when he said that God had told him to close his church and that he was no longer a pastor,” says his former assistant pastor.                 Mackenzie would soon start his forest scheme. Agnes says he charged them around $80 for a patch of land.                   “There were more than a thousand people living in the forest,” she says.                  The assistant pastor believes it was around 300 families.                 Many people had no idea where their loved ones had disappeared to.                   When Francis Wanje got wind earlier this year that his daughter and her family were inside the Shakahola forest with other cult members, his first reaction was that it had to be wrong.                 “I could not even believe it. I was told something bad was happening in the forest. But I couldn’t understand how she could be there,” he says.                 Wanje’s daughter and son-in-law both had decent jobs.                  He knew that they were attending Mackenzie’s church. But when they moved to the forest, they told him they were relocating to a different part of Kenya.                 “The social isolation is critical and has striking similarities with other destructive cults,” says Ross.                  It’s in the forest that investigators say Mackenzie’s cult took on its final form.                  In a court affidavit obtained by CNN, inspectors wrote that Mackenzie told his followers sometime early this year that the end of the world was imminent and that they should start fasting.                 “He stated that fasting would start with the children until the last child died then followed by the youth, then women and lastly men and that he would be the last to die and ascend to heaven,” the affidavit reads.                 Kenya’s state pathologist says many of the remains found show signs of extreme starvation, some were smothered, and a few showed blunt force trauma. There were scores of children amongst the dead.                 After Wanje received his disturbing call he organized a private rescue mission to the forest where he says they found his oldest grandchild.                 He was deeply malnourished – his two siblings were already dead.                  Wanje says they were suffocated by their parents.                 “It’s so painful, I could not even explain it because it’s something that I didn’t even think of in my life,” he says.                 “And I wonder how my child, my daughter, could change to be such an animal to kill her own children just because she wanted to go see Jesus.”                 Village elders in a nearby forest say they notified the authorities that starving children were escaping the forest from as early as late last year.                  The president and other senior leaders have apologized to Kenyans for the slow response and made promises to regulate religious sects.                 “Without a doubt, I can say definitively, had the police responded sooner, then lives would have been saved. I feel as a country we have failed these Kenyans,” says Khalid Hussein, the director of Haki Africa, a group that helped expose the cult.                 Agnes says that as time went on, the life in the cult became more extreme.                 “Each month there were meetings where he told us what Jesus had said. It was heartbreaking,” she says.                   Agnes says she escaped the forest in September last year when she was told she couldn’t get help from another woman to deliver her third child. Mackenzie’s spell was broken.                 But the aftershocks of the Shakahola massacre could be long-lasting. Police pulled scores of followers from the forest – many of whom didn’t want to be rescued.                 Even those who were dying.                   “When they got to the hospital some gave false names and others refused to be treated, they didn’t want to be helped, they didn’t want to miss out,” says Dr. David Man’ong’o, medical superintendent of the Malindi subcounty hospital.      Psychiatrists to assess starvation cult survivors as they continue to refuse food             Eventually, they had to hand them back to police.                 The rescued followers, many of them either witnesses or still under suspicion, are being kept in a nearby rescue center where therapists are trying to break their emotional and psychological ties to Mackenzie.                 Last week, the Director of Public Prosecutions said that 65 people rescued from the forest were charged with attempted suicide for refusing to eat.                 Rick Ross says it could be a months-long process to “deprogram” cult members.                   For loved ones of those who survived, it will also be a painful road. Wanje says he will get his grandson back in a few weeks.                 “He went through hell. He went through hell. When he was rescued, he told them that if you had come maybe a bit later, he would have already gone to see Jesus because his grave was already there,” he says.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Half of people globally still believe men make better political leaders than women; more than 40% believe men make better business executives than women; and 25% believe it is justified for a man to beat his wife, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report released Monday found, reflecting the latest data from the World Values Survey.                 Biased gender social norms are a major barrier to achieving gender equality, the report’s authors warn, adding that the undervaluation of women’s capabilities and rights in society constrains women’s choices and opportunities.     Why have women been so disproportionately affected by Covid-19? Experts explain              These biases were shown across regions, income, level of development and cultures, the report’s authors added, noting that UNDP’s composite measure of gender inequality in empowerment, known as the global Gender Inequality Index (GII), has remained stagnant since 2019.                 This means that the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030, the report, which reflects views from 80 countries and territories and covers 85% of the global population, notes.                  These biases manifest in numerous ways, such as in an underrepresentation of women in leadership. In the labor market, women occupy less than a third of managerial positions, while the picture remains grim at the highest level of leadership: The share of women as heads of state or heads of government has remained around 10% since 1995, the report finds.                   This gap does not reflect education levels. In the 59 countries where women are now more highly educated than men, the average gender income gap remains 39% in favor of men.                 A global backlash against women’s rights and the far-reaching consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic have worsened the issue, the report notes.                 “Social norms that impair women’s rights are also detrimental to society more broadly, dampening the expansion of human development. In fact, lack of progress on gender social norms is unfolding against a human development crisis: the global Human Development Index (HDI) declined in 2020 for the first time on record—and again the following year,” Pedro Conceição, head of UNDP’s Human Development Report Office, said in a statement.                  “Everyone stands to gain from ensuring freedom and agency for women,” he added.     Gender equality will take 300 years to achieve, UN chief warns             However, change is possible. The report’s authors give examples of parental leave policies altering perceptions around caring responsibilities, and labor market reforms leading to a change in beliefs around women in the workplace.                  Governments have a crucial role in shifting gender social norms, the authors note.                  “An important place to start is recognizing the economic value of unpaid care work. This can be a very effective way of challenging gender norms around how care work is viewed,” said Raquel Lagunas, director of UNDP’s Gender Team.                  “In countries with the highest levels of gender biases against women, it is estimated that women spend over six times as much time as men on unpaid care work,” Lagunas added.                 Progress toward gender equality is “vanishing before our eyes,” United Nations Secretary General António Guterres warned in March, adding that gender equality is “300 years away,” according to the latest estimates from UN Women, the UN organization dedicated to gender equality and women’s empowerment.                 Guterres cited high rates of maternal mortality, girls being forced into early marriage, and girls being kidnapped and assaulted for attending school as evidence that hope of achieving gender equality “is growing more distant.”                 “Women’s rights are being abused, threatened, and violated around the world,” Guterres said, naming a few countries in particular, including Afghanistan, where he said “women and girls have been erased from public life.”                 Guterres also said that “in many places, women’s sexual and reproductive rights are being rolled back,” though he didn’t specify where.                 Last June, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving the right to abortion up to individual states. The year before, a ban on abortions due to fetal defects took effect in Poland – effectively ending almost all abortions in the country.                 To achieve gender equality, Guterres called for “collective” and “urgent” action, from increasing education, income and employment for women and girls, especially in developing nations in the Global South, to promoting the participation of women and girls in science and technology.                 “Centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and harmful stereotypes have created a huge gender gap in science and technology,” Guterres said. “Let’s be clear: global frameworks are not working for the world’s women and girls. They need to change.”       CNN’s Tara Subramaniam contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The apparent alteration of a mosque belonging to the Hui ethnic group in Najiaying village, Yunnan province comes amid a sweeping campaign unleashed by China’s leader Xi Jinping to “sinicize” religion.                  The policy aims to purge religious faiths of foreign influence and align them more closely with traditional Chinese culture – and the authoritarian rule of the officially atheist Communist Party.                 In recent years, authorities have removed overtly Islamic architecture – destroying domes and tearing down minarets – from more than a thousand Hui mosques across the country, Hui activists say, with the Najiaying mosque being one of the last holdouts.                 Now, the “sinicization” campaign appears to be finally coming for Najiaying – a historic home to the Hui and an important hub for Islamic culture in Yunnan, an ethnically diverse province on China’s borders with Southeast Asia.                  But the push has faced a fierce backlash from local residents.     Videos posted on social media and geolocated by CNN show residents clashing with lines of police officers in riot gear, who blocked off the entrance to the mosque and pushed back the crowd with shields and batons.                 Residents shouted back in anger, with some hurling water bottles and bricks at the police, the videos show.                  “This is our last bit of dignity,” a local witness told CNN. “It’s like coming to our house to demolish our home. We can’t allow that to happen.”                 The source, who declined to be named over fears for personal safety, said thousands of Hui residents – including men and women, elderly and children – had gathered around the mosque on Saturday, under the close watch of more than 1,000 police officers deployed nearby.                 “After arriving at the mosque, we realized that they had driven the cranes into the compound and were ready for the forced demolition,” the source said, adding that scaffolding had already been erected around the mosque.                   Tensions escalated around 1 p.m., with worshipers demanding to enter the mosque for noon prayers, the source said. They said they saw police officers hitting the crowd with batons, which prompted some residents to clash with police.                 Dozens of protesters were arrested by police at the scene, the source said. Ma Ju, a prominent Hui activist who now lives in the United States and has kept close contact with Najiaying residents, said about 30 people were arrested.                 CNN cannot independently verify the claims and has reached out to the local police and government for comment. CNN has also reached out to the Yunnan provincial government and its bureau for religious affairs for comment.                 The hours-long standoff on Saturday yielded a temporary win for the protesters, who streamed into the mosque as the police retreated, according to the witness and online videos.                 Throughout Saturday night and Sunday, residents took turns to guard the mosque, fearing that authorities would return to demolish its large centerpiece green dome and four minarets, the source said.                  But repercussions quickly followed, according to those CNN spoke with.                 By Sunday afternoon, word started to spread that authorities were arresting more people, according to the source.                 On Sunday evening, law enforcement authorities in Nagu township, where Najiaying is located, issued a stern but vague statement. Without mentioning the protest or the mosque, it said police were investigating an incident that took place on Saturday, which “seriously disrupted social order” and caused “vile social impact.”                 The authorities also called on the “organizers and participants” of the incident to turn themselves in before June 6 to receive leniency, and encouraged the public to report on each other.                 By Monday, Najiaying was shrouded in a blanket of fear, the source said.                 The internet has been cut off in many neighborhoods. Drones buzzed overhead and surveilled the village. Public loudspeakers blasted the authorities’ message on repeat, urging protesters to turn themselves in, according to the source and Ma, the US-based activist.                 “It feels like our nightmare is only starting now,” the source told CNN. “Everyone is in fear…We don’t know what’s going to happen next.”                 Other local residents appeared fearful to speak out.                  One shop owner reached by CNN on the phone said: “You journalists should come here to report on what’s happening to us.” When asked by CNN to explain what happened, he replied he “didn’t know” and hung up.                 This is not the first time that Hui Muslims have engaged in a tense standoff with authorities to protect a mosque.                 In 2018, thousands of Hui residents in Ningxia, in the country’s northwest, staged a sit-in protest for three days to prevent authorities from demolishing a newly constructed mosque.                 The local government held off on the demolition, but later replaced the mosque’s domes and minarets with traditional Chinese-style pagodas.                 The architectural overhaul of mosques has come with allegations of shrinking religious freedoms for the Hui, a 11 million-strong ethnic minority that live in scattered pockets throughout China from the northwest to the coastal cities in the east, including an officially designated “autonomous region,” Ningxia.                 Believed to be distant descendants of Arab and Persian traders, the Hui have been well assimilated into broader Chinese society dominated by the ethnic Han majority.                  Most speak Mandarin, live alongside the Han, and in recent decades had been given more space to practice their faith than other ethnic groups.                 But Hui activists say their ethnic group has become the latest target in the Communist Party’s crackdown on Islam, which began in the western region of Xinjiang.                 Since at least 2017, the Chinese government has been accused of detaining more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in internment camps in Xinjiang and conducting forceful assimilation to suppress their cultural and religious identity.                  A United Nations report last year accused the Chinese government of serious human rights violations against Uyghurs that may amount to “crime against humanity.”                 China has repeatedly denied these accusations and insisted that the massive camps are voluntary “vocational training centers.”                 Hui activists and rights groups claim authorities have stepped up efforts in recent years to restrict religious practices of Hui Muslims across China, including the shuttering of Islamic schools, Arabic classes and barring children from learning and practicing Islam.                 The implementation of the “sinicization” campaign has “had the effect of expunging communities of their connections to Hui culture, religion, and each other so thoroughly that some leaders view the erasure of a meaningful Hui identity within another generation as being a likely possibility,” according to a report submitted to a UN treaty body in January by the Chinese Human Rights Defenders and the Hope Umbrella International Foundation.                 Ma, the US-based Hui activist who founded the Hope Umbrella International Foundation, said Hui in China are now living in a constant state of fear.                 Over two hundred mosques in Yunnan have already lost their domes and minarets, according to Ma, adding to the more than a thousand mosques in the country’s northwest.                 CNN is unable to independently verify the number of mosques affected, and has reached out to the Chinese government for comment on the accusations made by Hui activists.                 “At first, people thought it was only a question of architectural style…but it soon became apparent that (the government) is not only removing the domes from the mosques, but also removing their religious and social functionality,” Ma said.                 Under a raft of restrictions imposed by the government, many Hui are now afraid to go to the mosque, which has long been a center of religious and social life for their communities, Ma said.                 The end goal of the party is to implement a policy of “cultural and religious genocide,” just as it did in Xinjiang, he said. The Chinese government has denied accusations of genocide.                 For the resident in Najiaying, the government’s plan to change the design of the mosque is only the harbinger of a harsher crackdown to come.                  “This is only the first step. What we worry about is after that, (the authorities) will ban our children from going to (religious) classes, bar minors from entering mosques and forbid us from studying the Quran,” they said, referring to the alleged restrictions that have been imposed on Hui communities across China.                 “After they trampled on your dignity, they will suppress you step by step, and assimilate the Hui ethnic group completely into the Han, generation by generation. Because we know, this is what they did to Xinjiang,” they said.                 Despite the permeating culture of fear, they have vowed to “fight till the end” for the freedom of belief and the dignity of the Hui ethnicity.                 “We commoners don’t ask for much. We just want to have our own religious freedom. We just want to live in peace,” they said.                 “I want the world to know what we’re going through right now, and what we’re fearing next.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

And I’m not alone.”                 This is the original teaser for Indian filmmaker Sudipto Sen’s controversial new movie, “The Kerala Story,” the latest box office hit in India despite fears it is deepening religious tensions between majority Hindus and Muslims in the nation of 1.4 billion.                  The low-budget, scripted film has taken $24 million since its release just over two weeks ago, according to Box Office India, a worrying sign according to Debasish Roy Chowdhury, co-author of “To Kill A Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism.”                 Movies like these are “custom-made to spread hate, trigger Islamophobia and justify violence against Muslims,” he said.                 Filmmakers had initially attempted to present the movie as based on a true story of three women in the southern state of Kerala who were allegedly lured into converting to Islam and trafficked into joining ISIS. According to the filmmakers, these women were pawns in a “dangerous conspiracy” hatched against India that has seen tens of thousands of Indian women follow the same path.                  But critics were quick to point out that simply wasn’t true – and there was no evidence to support such a claim. Last week, India’s Supreme Court ordered the filmmakers to add a disclaimer that says the film is a fictionalized version of events, and that there is no data to back its claims of broader conspiracy to radicalize Indian women.                  According to a 2020 report from the US state department’s Country Reports on Terrorism 2020, there were “66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS” as of November that year. In 2021, India’s National Investigation Agency said it had arrested 168 people connected to 37 cases “of terror attacks, conspiracy, and funding” inspired by ISIS. Neither report provided a gender breakdown.                 Kerala’s chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has called the story “fake,” and others say the film perpetuates negative stereotypes of Muslims at a time of increasing religious polarization.                 But many prominent politicians from the country’s ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have praised the film, with some BJP-ruled states even waiving tax on tickets.                 The main character, Unnikrishnan, portrayed by Indian actress Adah Sharma, is depicted as an innocent, fun-loving Hindu girl, studying at a college in Kerala. She befriends her three roommates, including a young Muslim woman.              In the film’s trailer, the Muslim roommate is seen conspiring with older Muslim men at an “Islamic Study Center,” where they instruct a group of boys to “isolate” Unnikrishnan and her roommates from their families. “Develop physical relations… If required, make them pregnant,” an elderly, bearded man, wearing traditional Islamic clothes, says.                  The Muslim roommate makes derogatory comments toward Hindu gods and claims that women who wear hijabs are never raped.                 Unnikrishnan and the two other women appear to become brainwashed to marry Muslim men, convert to Islam, and join ISIS. The trailer also depicts scenes of brutal violence against women, over chants of “Allah is great.”                   Speaking to reporters in Mumbai last week, filmmaker Sen said they “have done a service to the nation” by making the film.                   The film’s producer, Vipul Amrutlal Shah, said they knew the film would be labeled as propaganda. “We knew every criticism that would come our way. But that should not deter us,” he added. “Our country needs to be woken up.”      India's latest box office smash 'The Kashmir Files' exposes deepening religious divides             However, some movie critics have slammed the film for its factual inaccuracy and failure to provide nuance.                  Independent news outlet The Wire called it “a propaganda film that thrives on shock value.”                 Critic Sowmya Rajendran wrote “all the creative liberties … are presented as the absolute truth, with no serious attempt to understand why such radicalisation takes place and what feeds it.”                  Shubhra Gupta from the Indian Express called it “a poorly-made, poorly-acted rant which is not interested in interrogating the social complexities of Kerala, an India state proud of its multi-religious, multi-ethnic identity.”                  She criticized the filmmakers for stereotypes, writing: “All the Muslim figures in the film are dark and intimidating.”                  Several BJP politicians have praised the film for drawing the nation’s attention to “love jihad” – a term used by radical Hindu groups who accuse Muslim men of attempting to convert women of other faiths to Islam.                 Some BJP-run states have introduced anti-conversion laws targeting “love jihad,” making it increasingly difficult for inter-faith couples to marry or for people to convert religions – a move lambasted by rights group for being unconstitutional and Islamophobic.             India’s northern Uttar Pradesh state, which is governed by Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu monk-turned-politician, was one of the first states to pass the law.                  “The Kerala Story draws the attention of the entire nation to the conspiracy of love jihad,” Adityanath told reporters after a special screening of the film. “The entire society must be made aware of this distortion.”                  Critics say religious polarization has increased since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP swept to power in 2014, prompting tensions between Hindus, who make up more than 80% of the country’s population, and Muslims, to simmer.                  Modi, who was campaigning for the BJP during local elections earlier this month, said “The Kerala Story” was “trying to expose the consequences of terrorism in society,” while accusing opposition parties of trying to ban the film.                  According to Chowdhury, the film “follows the familiar pattern of the Modi government’s unalloyed backing of hateful and divisive cinema.”                 He said the film’s success “should be taken as a sign of radicalization” of society.                 “There is no room for cinema like this in the civilized world, because my freedom of expression ends when it begins to threaten your freedom to exist,” he said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/19/asia/isis-k-attacks-afghanistan-taliban-cmd-intl/index.html,‘No one feels safe’: The Taliban promised to provide security to Afghans. New data shows threat from ISIS is growing,"Amid warnings from the United States that Afghanistan is becoming a staging ground for attacks on the West, new open-source data reveals the growing threat ISIS poses to civilians inside the country.","May 19, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Eliza Mackintosh,International,"Qasim received a call in late March that his brother, an employee with Afghanistan’s Taliban government, had been seriously injured in a suicide bombing near the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kabul.                  The 32-year-old rushed to the hospital with his family, but when they got there he was told by the doctors his brother was already dead.                 The explosion hit a security checkpoint as government employees were leaving work for the day. It struck at the heart of what was, until the collapse of the former Afghan government in August 2021, the capital’s heavily fortified diplomatic enclave, known as the “Green Zone.” The attack was later claimed by Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K — the group’s second strike on the ministry this year, as it focuses its firepower on high-profile targets, attempting to undermine the Taliban’s rule and erode public confidence in its assurances of security.                  “The Taliban are saying that they protect us, but really they cannot. Still we face threats from different groups in Afghanistan. I don’t know who is really behind these incidents, ISIS or others,” Qasim, who asked that his last name not be used due to security concerns, told CNN.                 “Currently we don’t have security in Afghanistan at all, whenever we go out we don’t know if we will come home alive or not,” he added.                 In the nearly two years since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan, ISIS-K has scaled up the volume and complexity of attacks across the country, putting pressure on the new government and raising concerns in the West about the possible regeneration of a group that could once again pose a serious threat internationally.                 ISIS-K and the Taliban, both Sunni Islamist extremist groups, are enemies with differing ideologies, fighting each other for control over parts of the country — and recruits.                 ISIS-K’s recent attacks have largely been aimed at the Taliban and other symbolic targets, as well as at Afghanistan’s Shia Muslim minorities, in particular the ethnic Hazaras. Bombings have increased in urban areas, leaving hundreds injured and dead. Between late 2022 and early 2023, ISIS-K attacked the Pakistani and Russian embassies, hit a hotel where Chinese business representatives were staying and carried out an explosion at an air force compound.                  The group has frequently published its claims in its weekly newsletter, Al Naba, alleging that it has struck on 283 occasions in Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover, killing at least 670 people and injuring 1,200 — a significant uptick in casualties per attack.                 With media restrictions severely affecting journalists’ ability to report independently in the country, and an absence of Western intelligence, it’s difficult to verify these figures. In an address to the Security Council in March, the head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), Roza Otunbayeva, said that ISIS-K posed “a growing threat,” and raised concerns over the Taliban’s capacity to cope with that challenge. But the Taliban have insisted that it has full control.                 In light of patchy information on the ground, analysts are increasingly turning to open sources to assess the state of play in Afghanistan.     Afghan Witness, a project run by the UK-based Centre for Information Resilience, which monitors human rights in the country, this week released a new dataset of verified abuses and violent incidents since the Taliban’s takeover. The data, which is available in a live map, includes 367 pieces of open-source evidence — largely videos and images shared on social media — about 70 ISIS-K attacks since August 2021. Taken together, they reveal a gradual shift in the group’s activities in Afghanistan — from a few small-scale attacks targeting Taliban patrols and checkpoints in rural areas, such as the eastern Nangarhar province, where ISIS has maintained a presence since 2015, to a concentration of attacks in urban areas, including in the capital, Kabul, Herat in the west, and Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz in the north.                 Before the Taliban’s return to power, ISIS-K had not claimed any attacks in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan’s third most populous city, but since then the group has claimed nine, including a blast in March that killed the Taliban governor of Balkh province in his office. In the first year under the Taliban’s new government, ISIS-K claimed eight attacks in Kunduz city.                 Afghan Witness’ data on verified attacks and ISIS-K claims reflect the group’s continued targeting of civilians, notably the Hazara community in Kabul, Herat and other cities, though attacks have slowed over the past few months as the group has focused on higher-profile Taliban targets.                 “It is clear from the data and propaganda that they are pursuing elements of strategies used elsewhere, such as the targeting of minorities to promote sectarianism, and they have become increasingly bold in targeting high-profile and symbolic targets within Afghanistan,” said David Osborn, team leader of Afghan Witness.                  “Recently, the Taliban appear to have conducted a series of raids against the Islamic State, coinciding with a reduced number of attacks by the group. This is the picture we get from open source but in the long term it is unclear how far the Taliban’s actions will blunt Islamic State-Khorasan’s capability inside Afghanistan,” he added.                 Despite the Taliban’s promises of a more moderate form of rule than when they were last in power two decades ago, they have reintroduced harsh measures in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, including public executions, flogging and banning women from education and the workplace.                  As the Taliban try to minimize the threat ISIS-K poses, attacks on civilians continue.                  “We’ve seen Islamic State-Khorasan target Shia Hazara as they attend schools, mosques and festivities. What is most striking is the helplessness of those caught up in the violence and the constant state of instability and fear that is created by the attacks,” Osborn said of Afghan Witness’ research. These communities feel the de facto authorities won’t defend them, after years having been persecuted by the Taliban themselves, he added.                  Nearly half of the attacks verified by Afghan Witness hit crowds as they gathered in public spaces, including markets, schools, hospitals, funerals, weddings and religious services.                 In October 2021, two months after the US withdrawal, ISIS-K fighters bypassed Taliban security to access Imam Bargah Mosque, the largest Shia mosque in Kandahar, a city in the south of the country, during Friday prayers. They shot the temple guards, then detonated their explosive vests among the crowds, claiming to have killed and wounded more than 100 people. At the time, CNN was able to confirm more than 30 deaths.                 A year later, in September 2022, a suicide bombing struck Kaaj Educational Center in Kabul’s Dasht-e-Barchi district — a predominantly Hazara and Shia neighborhood that had suffered several devastating ISIS-K attacks before the Taliban took over — killing at least 25 people. The students, many of them girls, were taking a practice university entrance exam. The attack, videos of which were verified by Afghan Witness, was not claimed by ISIS-K, but, according to analysts, bore the hallmarks of the group.                 Earlier that month, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that Taliban authorities “had an obligation to protect at-risk communities” from repeated ISIS-K attacks, but that those authorities were failing to provide them with security, based on interviews with 21 survivors and their family members. Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, has also called for investigations into attacks on Hazara, Shia and Sufi communities, which he described as bearing the hallmarks of “crimes against humanity.”                 Fatima Amiri, 18, was among the students sitting the exam when gunfire erupted. She lost an ear and an eye in the attack that also shattered her jaw, and is still receiving medical treatment for her injuries. She recalls students screaming as a gunman opened fire on them at their desks, followed by the sound of an explosion, and her peers lying bloody around her on the floor.                 “I saw many of my classmates were dying. I tried to escape. All the ways were closed. I climbed on a wall and jumped, I was in a bad condition full of blood,” she said. “I am now a half-normal human being with one eye and one ear.”                  “We know that the Taliban cannot protect us. No one feels safe currently in Afghanistan.”                 ISIS-K’s attacks have stoked anxiety among US officials about the group’s capabilities, with some warning that it could soon develop the ability to strike Western targets.                 Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla, head of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), told lawmakers in March that ISIS-K had become more emboldened, aiming to grow its ranks and inspire or direct attacks in the region and beyond. He estimated that the group would be able to conduct “an external operation against US or Western interests abroad in under six months, with little to no warning.” Pressed about where terrorist attacks originating in Afghanistan might be directed, Kurilla said Europe or Asia were more likely targets than the United States.                 Kurilla’s statement highlights one of the chief concerns among Western intelligence — that now, in the wake of the US withdrawal, it is difficult if not impossible to assess the Taliban’s effectiveness in curtailing ISIS-K. With no military or diplomatic presence on the ground, and drones now having to fly many hours from distant bases to get to Afghanistan for reconnaissance, intelligence access is incredibly limited, according to US officials and analysts.                  For that reason, some have disparaged the Biden administration’s “over-the-horizon” strategy — aimed at striking terrorists without American boots on the ground — as “over the rainbow.” They point to the botched US drone strike in Kabul that killed 10 civilians, including an aid worker and seven children, as an example of the pitfalls for intelligence agencies even before the complete withdrawal, and the killing of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri as one of the sole successes to date.                 In a 2023 threat assessment report by US intelligence agencies, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that ISIS-K “almost certainly retains the intent to conduct operations in the West and will continue efforts to attack outside Afghanistan.”                  The US has not recognized the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. US officials are not cooperating with the Taliban to counter ISIS-K, nor does the US share any intelligence information with them, CENTCOM spokesperson Maj. John Moore told CNN. Instead, the Taliban are fighting the group — which the US estimates now numbers between 2,000 and 2,500 fighters in Afghanistan — on its own.                   The uptick in violence has put the Taliban in a difficult spot. After two decades fighting their own insurgency, they are grappling with delivering security and sticking to their signature pledge under the US-Taliban Doha Agreement in 2020, to prevent any group from using Afghanistan to threaten the safety of the US and its allies.                  Taliban security forces have been waging ongoing operations and night raids against ISIS-K. The raids often target civilians accused of harboring or helping ISIS-K members, with the Taliban assaulting and detaining people without due process, according to research by Human Rights Watch (HRW). In some cases, Taliban authorities have forcibly disappeared or killed detainees, dumping or displaying bodies in public areas.                  “The Taliban have been going after them in ways that are actually counterproductive because they have tackled them in the same way that everyone who’s been in power in Afghanistan has tackled insurgencies, which is as brutally as possible, which means you stir up a lot of resentment in local communities, and that stirs up more recruits,” Patricia Gossman, associate director for HRW’s Asia division, said. “We documented a number of raids by the Taliban in Kunar and Nangarhar, which ended up with a lot of people being killed who may or may not have had anything to do with ISIS-K.”                 The US National Security Council claimed in April that the Taliban had killed the ISIS-K leader who plotted the deadly 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul international airport’s Abbey Gate, which was carried out amid chaotic evacuation efforts, killing 13 US service members and more than 170 Afghans who were trying to flee the country. In the days prior to the attack, the suicide bomber was among thousands of prisoners who were freed by the Taliban from Parwan detention facility at Bagram air base and Pul-e-Charkhi prison.                 “In 2021, ISIS-K was reduced to a couple of cells in the country and a very tiny, small stronghold in Kunar Province, and that was it. However, in the less than stellar handover procedure, in that chaos, the Taliban opened the prisons, including Bagram, which was a big mistake … they underestimated that there were also a couple of thousand ISIS-K members, who, once freed, just walked off,” said Hans-Jakob Schindler, senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, who served as a member and then as coordinator of the UN Security Council’s ISIL, al Qaeda and Taliban Monitoring Team.                  “The organization was very diligently able to reestablish itself.”                 UN Secretary-General António Guterres reported in January 2022 that the number of ISIS-K recruits had doubled in less than a year, from approximately 2,200 to nearly 4,000 fighters, with up to half of them foreign terrorist fighters, according to one assessment. Their ranks were buoyed by the prison breaks, and their diverse membership has meant the Taliban risk defections by countering them, Schindler said, adding that could spur anti-Taliban factionalism. Since the group was established in 2015, ISIS-K has included a number of former Taliban, as well as Pakistani fighters, including from the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States in 2010.                  The group, operating in compartmented cells, is capitalizing on loose tactical partnerships and a large number of unaffiliated fighters, or freelance jihadists, who now have greater access than ever before to a large number of capabilities following the United States’ hurried departure, according to Javid Ahmad, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center who is tracking ISIS-K’s activities.       'I screamed so loud, I blacked out': Afghans tell of the Taliban's return to their old torture playbook             “They now have unfettered access to the black market, for purchasing not just light weapons, but fertilizers for explosives, smaller commercial drones, which they can customize. They have access to sophisticated communication equipment. They are buying laser-guided sniper weapons. They have access to night vision goggles. And oftentimes when they do targeted assassinations, that’s how they do it,” said Ahmad, formerly Afghanistan’s ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, who has worked with the US defense community.                 Ahmad and Schindler both say that the ISIS-K bombing at the entrance of the foreign ministry, past at least three checkpoints, reflects the group’s growing access to intelligence and its capacity to execute complex operations. And though it has not yet demonstrated its ability to carry out attacks outside of Afghanistan, it has ambitions to do so, they agree.                  “We are about to repeat the same mistake that we did in the 1990s, believing that Afghanistan … has very little if anything to do with us,” Schindler said. “We took the eye off the ball and we are about to do the same thing again.”                 Leaked classified documents from the Pentagon, obtained by The Washington Post in April, portray Afghanistan as a staging ground for ISIS-K, and suggest the group is a growing threat to the US, Europe and Asia. The US intelligence assessment, which was disseminated on the Discord messaging platform, revealed the group’s efforts to coordinate several external operations, targeting embassies, churches, business centers and the 2023 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament, the Post reported.                 Responding to a question about the leaks, Vedant Patel, the US State Department’s deputy spokesperson, said: “The degradation of ISIS in the region continues to be a top priority for this administration and it’s something that we continue to work collectively on with our allies and partners.”                 The Taliban rejected the report, with its spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, saying in a statement on Twitter that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan “has full control over the country and does not allow anyone to use Afghanistan against the security of any other country,” adding that terrorist groups like ISIS-K had been “severely affected and are in the process of being destroyed.”     CNN’s Oren Liebermann contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.             As Saudi Arabia continues its drive to attract tourists, authorities in the country appear to be reaching out to a particularly lucrative section of the market: LGBTQ travelers.                 The website of the Saudi Tourism Authority (STA) seems to have had its Q&A section updated to state that gay visitors are welcome in the kingdom.                 “Everyone is welcome to visit Saudi Arabia and visitors are not asked to disclose such personal details,” is the website’s response to the question on its FAQ page: “Are LGBT visitors welcome to visit Saudi Arabia?”                 It is not known exactly when the website was updated. A spokesperson for the STA said the policy had previously been in place, but an archived version of the website on March 14, 2023 and before did not have the question and answer on the page.                 Same-sex sexual activity is an offense in Saudi Arabia, according to Human Rights Watch.                  According to the Human Dignity Trust, which campaigns for the rights of LGBT people around the world, trans people can also face prosecution in Saudi, with “substantial evidence of the law being enforced” and “consistent reports of discrimination and violence” against LGBTQ people.                  LGBTQ+ travelers are a lucrative market, according to Darren Burn, CEO of Out Of Office, a luxury travel planning service for the community, and of Travel Gay, the world’s largest LGBTQ+ travel platform.                  “Research shows they spend more money in a destination than heterosexual couples, and tend to travel more times a year,” he told CNN.                  “It’s a very interesting and lucrative demographic, and countries are plowing major revenue into [attracting] it.”                 Whether LGBTQ travelers will feel comfortable traveling to Saudi, however, is another matter. Burn said that destinations such as the Maldives and Dubai, where homosexuality is a criminal offense, are popular, but without more assurances from the authorities, Saudi Arabia could be a tougher sell.                 “It’s pretty vague, and doesn’t offer the assurances that would make me feel able to send our clients safely to the destination, but anything on the website about LGBT travelers is a good starting point,” he said.                  “I can’t think of another Middle Eastern tourist board that has even mentioned them, except Qatar in the run-up to the World Cup, and even that was vague, saying that everyone was welcome.                 “But my concern is what the reality is like in the destination. Are they saying that a same-sex couple can check into a hotel and get a double bed without any issues? My hunch would be that that’s not the reality.”                 One gay traveler who visited Saudi Arabia on a work trip in October 2022 – before the website was updated – told CNN that he felt “in the closet” during his stay.                 The UK traveler – who did not want to be named – spent time in AlUla, one of Saudi’s tourism-focused destinations.                  “It was OK for a week or so but after that I suddenly realized it gone back to living a life in the closet and not being my true self. More out of fear of what might happen – the unknown – rather than anything specific that happened,” he said.                  “I was sent an email [by the company I was working for] with what I should do. They basically told me to delete anything even remotely LGBTQI related from my phone – all photos, apps, newspapers and magazines. My Egyptian friend suggested I just get a new clean phone.                 “I told close colleagues, but I wasn’t [generally] talking about being gay, or my past experience. I kept it to myself, and suddenly realized that I wasn’t able to talk about what I would normally talk about, and that’s not how I want to live. In practice everyone was very relaxed, but the law’s the law.”     What it's like to visit Saudi Arabia now             However, he added that one “revelation” from his trip was “how friendly and welcoming the Saudi people were.                 “They’re really open to changing attitudes, but they haven’t really [been in contact] with the Western world in their lifetimes. Unless you meet people [from other cultures] and talk about differences there’s no way of learning from them.                 “I found that what the law and the authorities say is very different to how the locals interact with you.                 “If you were to go there and be overtly gay I’d be quite concerned – I wouldn’t feel comfortable going there with a partner – but it’s a country that’s changing very quickly.”                 Saudi Arabia is focusing on expanding its tourism sector, appealing to archaeology fans at the likes of AlUla, where ruins have been left untouched for almost 2,000 years, and creating entire new cities to appeal to visitors.                  CNN’s Richard Quest, who visited in September 2022, wrote that: “I have seen countries change before, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like the change taking place in Saudi Arabia. Saudi’s change is deliberate, deep-reaching and dramatic.” He also flagged its “contradictions,” however – after his visit, 81 people were executed in a single day.                  Human rights researcher Nora Noralla told CNN that the kingdom is following Qatar and Dubai in its bid to attract LGBTQ+ travelers. But she warned that it might not be on the travelers’ terms.                  “In Dubai there are a lot of gay influencers, and as long as you understand the context of the area you’re in and respect the traditional culture and not show your queerness in any way, you’re OK,” she said.                  “That requires you to be cis-passing. If you show up and you’re non-binary, or male with makeup on, or obviously trans, and come to the region you’ll be denied entrance. I wouldn’t say LGBT people are welcome – they say same-sex couples are welcome, and that’s entirely different.”                 She also warned that what goes for “rich tourists” doesn’t fly for others. “Queer residents know what lines they can cross, and it’s all down to your economic and social background,” she said. “They realize the risks with this kind of activity and know how to do it in a discreet way. This [the new move] is basically for Western tourists.                  “They’re trying to copy the Dubai model so they can get some of their money. There’s a lot of competition [for money]. If you’re a cis, gay Westerner you’re welcome. If you’re trans and cis-passing, you’re welcome. But anything that remotely shows your queerness, you’re not. And I think if anyone crosses a line, they will definitely act swiftly.”      What it's like to visit Saudi Arabia now             Despite his skepticism, Darren Burn thinks Saudi could potentially be a gay-friendly destination.                 “We’d welcome a conversation with the tourist board and government to work out a way that LGBTQ+ travelers can genuinely travel in a safe way, to see them put money behind promoting to LGBT communities, and making changes to LGBT rights locally to make Saudi Arabia an authentic destination that appeals.                  “We all know the reason destinations are welcoming tourists now is because they think that’s their future income stream, but that’s good, because it might drive changes in equality law if it’s good for business.”                 He added that travel can broaden minds on both sides.                  “Without travel and tourists coming to the destinations, mindsets would never change – as long as they can do so safely, LGBTQ+ travelers can break down barriers,” he said.                 “Destinations do change – but I don’t think we’d be sending customers any time soon until we can receive assurances that they’d be safe, welcome and able to check in.”                 An STA spokesperson said in a statement: “Everyone is welcome to visit Saudi, provided that they follow and respect our culture, traditions and laws, as you would when you visit any other country in the world.                  “Like other governments, we do not ask visitors personal questions and we respect the right to privacy.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             On the grounds of the Al-Aqsa complex, one of the most revered places in Islam and Judaism, a delicate balance that governs this holy site is under strain.                     Only Muslims are allowed to pray on the sacred grounds known to them as Al Haram Al Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as Temple Mount under a status quo arrangement originally reached more than a century ago. Non-Muslim visitors are allowed visits at certain times and only to certain areas of the complex.                      But many in the Muslim world fear the right to be the sole worshipers at the holy site is slowly being eroded by a growing far-right Jewish movement.                    The complex lies in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state and which most of the international community considers to be occupied territory. Israel captured it from Jordan in a 1967 war and considers both East and West Jerusalem as its united, “eternal capital.”                    It is the complex where Israeli police conducted violent raids twice in less than 24-hours last week. Videos shared on social media showed Israeli police beating screaming Muslim worshipers with batons. Police said they stormed the mosque itself after “hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators barricaded themselves” inside, throwing fireworks and stones at them.                    The violence prompted rocket fire from southern Lebanon and Gaza that Israel blamed on Palestinian militants. Israel retaliated with airstrikes.                   Two Muslim-born CNN journalists were given permission to report from the compound by the Jordanian custodians of the site.                   The compound was relatively calm when CNN visited Tuesday. At the gates of Al-Aqsa mosque, the main mosque in the compound, a group of women recited the Quran ahead of afternoon prayers. It has been a tumultuous Ramadan and Tuesday brought more tensions.                    “I feel pain. True pain deep inside,” Um Kamal Al-Kurdi, a Palestinian resident of the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem told CNN on Tuesday morning. “This is a house of God. It is for worship. Not for occupation or provocation. Even as we pray, we are provoked and monitored by the Israelis.”                     As al-Kurdi spoke, a group of mostly Jewish visitors walked past, escorted by heavily armed Israeli police. One officer filmed the group of women as they began reciting the Quran louder and louder. A raised voice in recitation was their only form of protest in this brief but tense moment.                      By Tuesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced it would prohibit non-Muslims from entering the holy site for the rest of Ramadan. The decision isn’t unprecedented, but his far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said in a statement that it was “a serious mistake that will not bring peace, but may only escalate the situation.”                     The compound consists of large open courtyards as well as the Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock.                  The mosque and dome are built on top of the site where Jews believe their first and second temples stood, and is known as Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism. The Western Wall is believed to be part of the second temple complex, and sits below the courtyard. It is the site that Jew face in prayer.                     Most leading Rabbis say Jews should not step foot on the site. But a growing movement of Jewish extremists has been campaigning to be allowed to perform prayers on the grounds, a call that could upend the status quo arrangement that governs the management of the site. CNN witnessed at least two Jewish worshippers praying without being stopped or removed by police.                      Ben Gvir is a vocal advocate of Jewish prayer at the site. Once considered the fringe of Israeli politics, having been previously convicted of supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, his visit to the compound earlier this year drew international condemnation.        The situation in Jerusalem is boiling over. Here's how it all happened             Jordan’s Hashemite monarchy is the custodian of the complex, based on an agreement that dates back to 1924, and it manages the site under an Islamic trust called the Waqf. But Jordan’s role is becoming increasingly symbolic, experts say, because it is Israel that controls the security checks at entry points and therefore access to the sacred grounds. Tourists can enter during visiting hours on their own, but religious Jews are often escorted by heavily armed guards.                      Sheikh Azzam Khatib, the director general of the Waqf, sees these increasing visits of Jewish groups under Israeli police escort as a provocation to Palestinians and the wider Muslim word.                      “I see these visits as a raid on our holy site,” he said. “Israel should keep its hands off the mosque and the compound because this is a violation (of the sanctity of the site) … and can lead to events that cannot be contained.”                     The status quo itself is an unwieldly subject, fraught with debate. It is not a traditional treaty signed by the various parties during some ceremony, instead built on historical precedents dating back to the Ottoman Empire, amended and agreed upon by various bodies from the British, to the United Nations and beyond. That status quo is slowly being chipped away, says Sheikh Rani Abusibr, an Imam of nearly twenty-years at Al-Aqsa.                      “History is always written by the powerful,” Abusibr said. “Of course, it is expected that if there is no force to stand-up against this encroachment then our rights can easily be lost.”                     Some Jewish extremist calls go beyond the demand for prayer. Far-right fringe movements want to see a third Jewish temple built at the site. On the day of CNN’s visit, small groups of Jewish radicals taunted Muslims by singing “The Temple will be built” at the gates of the compound.                      Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that he is committed to maintaining the status quo, but under his government, the most far-right in Israeli history, extremist voices are growing louder and stronger.                      For the wider Arab world, al-Aqsa is seen as the last enclave of Muslim control in the heart of East Jerusalem. CNN spoke to Muslim worshippers at the site who only gave their first names citing security concerns.                   “Al-Aqsa is ours. No matter what anyone says. Al-Aqsa is ours even it was raided by a million people,” Mohammed, a worshipper at the site, told CNN. “It is an ideology that we carry in our minds.”                      Some Palestinian worshippers must go to great lengths to reach the mosques at the complex, particularly visitors from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who generally need to obtain travel documents from Israeli authorities and can undergo lengthy waits at checkpoints and multiple security checks.                      Without the status quo arrangement being enforced, there are fears that an already tumultuous region could spiral out of control. Any perceived shift in the norms can – and has – set-off cycles of deadly violence. But these periodic flare-ups have always fallen back on the simple understanding that has maintained some semblance of order in one of the most contentious corners of the world.                      “Of course, I don’t feel safe. Everything can change in an instant, so I am always scared,” said Noor, a worshipper inside the Dome of the Rock, the golden-domed shrine that is seen in the holy city’s skyline. “But I am here because I have faith in God.”          © 2024 Cable News Network.

Should the Israeli police, “assault worshipers again, in an attempt to empty [the mosque] of worshipers, in preparation for major incursions into the mosque,” it would, “push the situation towards more tension and violence, for which everyone will pay the price,” the Jordanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ambassador Sinan al-Majali, said in a statement late on Saturday local time.                 “The Israeli government bears responsibility for the escalation in Jerusalem and in all the occupied Palestinian territories and for the deterioration that will worsen if it does not stop its incursions into the holy al-Aqsa mosque… and its terrorization of worshipers in these blessed days,” al-Majali said.                 The warning from Jordan was followed by a statement from the Israeli Foreign Ministry early on Sunday, saying that people who, “barricade themselves inside [the al-Aqsa mosque] are a dangerous mob, radicalized and incited by Hamas and other terror organizations.”      Attacks in West Bank, Tel Aviv as tensions remain high following Israeli strikes             The Israeli Foreign Ministry called on Jordan’s Waqf guards, “to immediately remove from the al-Aqsa Mosque these extremists who are planning to riot (on Sunday) during Muslim prayers on the Temple Mount and the Priestly Blessing at the Western Wall.”                 The Waqf is the Jordan-appointed body that manages the al-Aqsa mosque compound, known as the Temple Mount by Jews.                 Israeli police raided Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque twice on Wednesday last week, claiming that “hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators (had) barricaded themselves” inside.                 On Saturday night, the Israeli police again alleged that, “many youngsters [had] entered the mosque and closed the doors, for no reason.”                 Israeli police raids of al-Aqsa mosque are considered by Muslims as a major provocation.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

But as Frida Ghitis writes, the executions have only ...","Jan 10, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Frida Ghitis,International,"Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             “Dad, my sentence is death,” Mohammad Mehdi Karami informed his father in a phone call from prison last month. Then, last Saturday, the 21-year-old karate champion was executed by the Iranian regime. Karami, an Iranian Kurd, was hanged on the same day as Seyed Mohammad Hosseini, a volunteer children’s coach who was just 20. Both were accused of killing a member of the Basij paramilitary force. In the phone call, the younger Karami reportedly told his father he was tortured into making a false confession. All 16 accused in that case have denied the charges.             Their deaths add to the growing number of young protesters killed since Iranians took to the streets almost four months ago in women-led demonstrations sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. Amini, also an Iranian Kurd, died in police custody after she was detained by the morality policy for improperly wearing the hijab, the Muslim veil that Iran’s clerical rulers obligate every woman to wear.             The death count, and the relentless heartbreak, are all but certain to continue. That’s because the regime’s most powerful domestic weapon – its ability to kill protesters in order to frighten and intimidate them – is not producing its intended results. Despite mounting deaths, Iranians fed up with repression are not giving up.                 Iran’s young protesters are showing a level of courage that is nearly unfathomable. It is up to them whether or not to continue their struggle, demanding “azadi, azadi!” – “freedom!” in Farsi.                  Those watching in awe from outside Iran have other decisions to make – how will they respond as the regime kills its young? The reaction so far has been utterly inadequate.                  The Norway-based Iran Human Rights organization warns of a “serious risk of mass execution of protesters.” Already it estimates security forces have killed 481 people, including 64 children – and it believes 109 protesters face the risk of execution at this moment.     Iran executes karate champion and volunteer children's coach amid crackdown on protests             The executions occur after protesters are charged and allegedly tortured into confessing to crimes they didn’t commit, as Karami told his father on the phone that day. Human rights groups say that the proceedings have been shams, show trials, without any semblance of due process.              Hours after their executions, two other young protesters sentenced to death – Mohammed Broghani, just 19-years-old, and Mohammed Ghobadlu, 22 – were moved out of their cells into solitary confinement, raising concerns that their execution might be imminent. Their supporters spent the night rallying around the prison, hoping to stop the possible executions. As of this writing, they remain alive.                      The first known person to be executed in connection with the protests was 23-year-old Mohsen Shekari, in early December. A viral video purportedly showing his mother getting the news of his death is excruciating.                  A few days later, Iran hanged 23-year-old Majidreza Rahnavard from a construction crane in a public square in the city of Mashhad. He had been convicted of “enmity against God,” in another show trial that found him guilty of stabbing two Basijis. A little over three weeks after his arrest, he was executed before a crowd, his lifeless body suspended from a cable visible in photographs posted by the regime. His court-assigned lawyer had offered no defense.                  Almost no one expected the demonstrations to continue this long. The risks seemed to outweigh the probability of success. “Let’s be honest,” I wrote in October, the protests have been inspiring, “but also terrifying to watch.” We knew the regime would respond with brutality, and so it has.                 The beatings, the shootings, the executions, have not put an end to the protests. On the contrary, the latest executions have reignited protests at universities. Young people seem determined to risk it all for a chance at a different life. In many ways, the calls for an end to the theocracy seem unstoppable.     Opinion: Their brilliance was a mirage. How 2022 exposed the world's tyrants             For the rest of the world, there’s even more moral clarity over the issue of supporting protesters now that Iran has started providing Russia with the weaponry it is using to destroy Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure.                  As Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky told the US Congress, with Iran, “Russia found an ally in [its] genocidal policy… one terrorist has found the other.” Iran claims it only sold Russia drones before the war.                  Stern condemnation of Iran’s executions from western powers poured in almost immediately, and protesters took to the streets in some world capitals. That solidarity is important, but it’s hardly enough. The world can do more.                  Germany, one of Tehran’s top trading partners, recently announced it is suspending export credits and investment guarantees for Iran trade. It had already declared that the situation did not permit “business as usual with Iran.” The world’s responsible governments should curtail trade and quietly persuade other top trading partners, such as the United Arab Emirates India and Turkey, to review their commercial relations.                 It’s also very clear that efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – should be declared over. Biden has already admitted the deal “is dead,” even as he refuses to make the acknowledgment official. The JCPOA won’t be resuscitated, and even if that were possible, it would bring massive funding to a regime that is not just killing its own people and sowing unrest in its region but is also aiding in the destruction of another country in its partnership with Russia.             The European Union should waste no time acting on a Dutch proposal to label the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, a terrorist organization, as the US has already done. Tehran rejects the label, but evidence of the IRGC’s activities is ample, with its intervention in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.                   On the diplomatic front, western nations, led by the United States, should raise the profile of Iran’s misdeeds. Take the case to top diplomatic forums. Force a vote of condemnation at the UN Security Council, where Russia will undoubtedly veto it, and perhaps China will as well. Let us see the despots stand side by side.                 And, if Iran doesn’t relent, target visas of Iranians enjoying their travels in the West. If Iran continues killing its young students, then perhaps the children of Iranian officials and regime allies should know that their ability to study in American and European universities could soon end.                 This is the Iranian people’s fight, as it should be. It’s their country. Their lives. But the rest of the world must do more than issue statements and express disapproval. As long as the Iranian people are risking it all to fight for their freedom against a regime that has inflicted so much harm in so many places, they deserve more support than they have received.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             An Iranian official’s comment signaling that the country’s notorious morality police had been shut down has raised more questions than answers.                   Hasty clarifications by state media that sought to rebut the official’s comment quickly followed, along with pushback on social media by activists denying the so-called victory and even denouncing it as a “PR stunt” by the Iranian regime to silence protesters.                    Experts warned about embracing pledges of either the abolition of the morality police or of the hijab law it seeks to enforce, noting that often regimes will make empty promises to citizens in desperate bids to quell unrest.                    During a religious conference on Saturday in the city of Qom, Attorney General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri said that the Iranian morality police was being “abolished,” a comment that was quickly picked up by international media outlets, some of which hailed the “announcement” as a victory for Iranians who have been protesting against the government for months.                   Montazeri’s comment came in response to a reporter who asked if the country’s morality police – or “guidance patrol” – were being disbanded. The attorney general was quoted by an Iranian state media outlet as saying: “Morality police have nothing to do with the judiciary. It was abolished from the same place it was launched.”                   It is possible the comment was misinterpreted, and the tone from state media quickly changed.                   On Sunday, state media was keen to downplay Montazeri’s comments, saying that the morality police does not fall under the authority of the judiciary.        Iran says hijab law is under review, as state media dismisses claims morality police has been abolished             Arab-language Al-Alam state television claimed foreign media were depicting Montazeri’s comments as “a retreat on the part of the Islamic Republic from its stance on hijab and religious morality as a result of the protests”, but that all that could be understood from his comments was that the morality police were not directly related to the judiciary.                   “No official of the Islamic Republic of Iran has said that the Guidance Patrol has been shut,” Al-Alam said Sunday afternoon.                   The decision to dismantle the morality police technically lies with the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution, a body established in the early 1980s by Iran’s first Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini, and which is today headed by President Ebrahim Raisi.                   CNN has reached out to Iran’s Interior Ministry and the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution for comment.                 Montazeri’s comments about the morality police came just two days after the pro-reform outlet Entekhab reported him saying that Iran’s parliament and judiciary were reviewing the country’s mandatory hijab law, which has been in place since 1983.                   A law enforcement body with access to power, arms and detention centers, the morality police are a major point of grievance for Iranians. Notorious for terrorizing citizens as they enforce the country’s conservative rules, the morality police have been the main coercive tool implementing Iran’s hijab law.                   The morality police were cast into the international spotlight in September, when 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died three days after being arrested by the force and taken to a “re-education” center. The group is sanctioned by the United States and the European Union.                   Since protesters took to the streets, however, witnesses say that the morality police had virtually disappeared from the streets of Tehran, greatly diminishing the state’s ability to regulate women’s dress codes.                    “We see a lot of images, photos, videos of women in public places walking around without the hijab much more than what we had seen before September of this year,” Iranian-American journalist and political analyst Negar Mortazavi told CNN on Monday.                    As Iranian security forces scramble to shut down protests, enforcing hijab may have no longer been a priority, says Sadjadpour.                    “That’s not because their ideology has changed,” he told CNN, “but because their repressive bandwidth is limited.”                   The morality police’s absence from the streets also raised questions about their relevance. While their abolition would indeed count as a win for protesters, experts say, there are other, deeper grievances driving protesters to the streets.                    “When dictatorships know they’re in trouble they begin promising their citizens they will change who they are,” wrote Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington DC.                   “These empty promises tend to embolden, rather than quell, popular demands for fundamental change,” he wrote on Twitter. “The Iranian regime appears to be entering this stage of its life cycle.”       Iran's morality police have terrorized women for decades. Who are they?              Omid Memarian, a US-based Iran analyst, said the morality police had “already become irrelevant” in the wake of the ongoing protests. “When people chant across the country, ‘the Islamic Republic should go,’ such moves seem desperate. The regime is incapable of addressing the real grievances,” he wrote on Twitter.                   Others worry that the Iranian regime may simply “rebrand” the morality police, in an effort to distance itself from its ominous name whilst maintaining tight control over mandatory hijab.                     “In a way it has been interpreted as a play on words because essentially he is saying that there is no morality police, or guidance patrol,” said Mortazavi. “It has in some way been replaced or rebranded as the police of public safety.”                   Mortazavi continued to say that the morality police have become “so notorious” that no official is “willing to take responsibility for it” and it is unclear “how sustainable it is going to be long term.”                   “It goes back to how this enforcement of this law that is still on paper going to be stopped or changed,” she said. “Or is it going to come back after a different brand or a different name or different methods.”        Zahid Mahmood contributed to this report.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

How did he come to be there? Why did the police shoot at his vehicle? And did his outspoken reporting – often critical of the military establishment that wields considerable power in Pakistan – have anything to do with his death?                  One month since Arshad Sharif was killed, Kenyan and Pakistani authorities have not concluded their reports nor have there been any arrests in the case.                   Conflicting accounts offered by the Kenyan police and Pakistani authorities have not provided further clarity. First, police said it was a case of mistaken identity. Later, they said shots were fired from the journalist’s car. Pakistan’s interior minister has cast doubt on the police reports, claiming earlier this month that it was a “targeted killing,” adding that more evidence was needed to “to confirm all this.”                 Pakistani media have aired various lurid theories about the night Sharif died. Some reports suggested the journalist was tortured for hours before he was shot dead, alleging broken fingers, broken ribs, missing fingernails, and other torture marks.                  However, post-mortem reports from separate autopsies carried out in Kenya and Pakistan, obtained by CNN, both concluded that Sharif died from multiple injuries after gunshots to the head and chest. Neither of the reports documented evidence of torture.                 Pakistani media have alleged his fingernails were removed by torture, but it’s standard in Kenya to extract fingernails in an autopsy for DNA, Dr. Ahmed Kalebi, an independent pathologist in Nairobi who has reviewed both reports told CNN.       Killing of Pakistani journalist in Kenya was 'targeted' attack, minister says             The conflicting stories have sown doubt and frustration for Sharif’s family, who are skeptical they will get answers to the mystery of his death.                    “I have no faith in the Pakistani government,” his mother, Riffat Ara Alvi told CNN in a video interview.                    She said she wrote a letter to Pakistan’s Chief Justice this month imploring the Supreme Court to set up a judicial commission “to determine the real motive and identify criminals behind this heinous crime.”                   “It’s not possible to get justice in Pakistan and in Kenya. I know that. But I request all the international journalistic organizations and United Nations to investigate this killing,” his widow, Javeria Siddique told CNN.                  CNN has contacted Pakistan’s high commission in Nairobi for comment on the case.                    In his home country, Sharif was a critic of the Pakistani military and an ally of former prime minister Imran Khan, who was ousted in April after a no confidence vote in parliament. Sharif’s vocal opposition to the current administration earned him many enemies and his family and friends say left the journalist so terrified for his life, he fled the country.                  He also faced sedition charges for allegedly criticizing state institutions and “abetting mutiny” within the military. Former Prime Minister Khan described Sharif, 49, as “one of the best investigative journalists in Pakistan,” and told CNN on November 7 that Sharif had exposed a plot against him, without giving further details.                  “This guy was exposing this whole plot against me. He was hounded out of Pakistan,” Khan claimed.                   Khan was himself shot at a political rally earlier this month and his party called the attack an assassination attempt by establishment figures – which has been vehemently denied by the government and security officials.                  Sharif left Pakistan a month after writing to Pakistan’s Supreme Court and to the president, according to letters obtained by CNN, notifying them of threats against his and other journalists’ lives. “Journalists in Pakistan are subjected to charges of sedition and terrorism to stifle dissent and criticism against the powerful elements of state. It appears that a reign of terror has been unleashed against the media persons who have independent opinions,” he wrote.                 He had initially gone to Dubai but was forced to flee again due to “harassment by Pakistani officials,” the associate said.                  Pakistani investigators traveled to Dubai the week of November 14 to probe Sharif’s stay there, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The team questioned Sharif’s contacts and hosts there, as well as the owner of ARY television, the station Sharif worked for and their investigation is ongoing, the sources said.                  With limited country options for obtaining a visa after he was expelled from Dubai, Sharif traveled to Kenya, one of the few countries he was able to get a quick e-visa with his Pakistani passport, according to his close associate.                  Sharif landed in Kenya around August 20, according to his wife and a close associate, where he quietly lived his life mostly in hiding, for two months – always in fear of being attacked, his friends and family said.                  “He had never disclosed his location to all of us- his family, his mother, to me. He was saying that I’m hiding somewhere because I’m not feeling safe and they are going to assassinate me, so I’m not going to tell you where I am right now,” his wife Siddique recounted.                 Siddique, 35, told CNN he sent her a text message to let her know he was in “far, far away jungles.” However, it wasn’t until news of his killing emerged that Sharif’s mother and wife came to learn he had been in Kenya.                     “He was so kind-hearted, and generous, and he was a brilliant photographer. We did photography together,” Siddique said.                   When Sharif was in Nairobi, he would rarely leave the apartment he was staying in, out of fear of being recognized, his close associate told CNN.                  However, during his two-month stay, he traveled to the outskirts of Nairobi to a shooting range and lodge called Ammodump more than once, according to people with knowledge of the matter.                 On the day he died, Sharif had spent time at a bonfire and barbeque happening near the camp, according to a staff member who did not want to be named.                  After dinner, Sharif and the brother of the owner of Ammodump left together, the staff member said.                   Sharif and Khurram Ahmed  left  Ammodump around 8:30 p.m. local time, a detective involved in the case told CNN.                  Police arrived at the crime scene, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) away from the site of the shooting where Ahmad finally stopped, after 10 p.m. local time, said the detective who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.                  That same evening, police were on the lookout for a reported stolen vehicle, a Mercedes-Benz delivery van, according to an initial police report. Sharif and Ahmad allegedly drove past a makeshift roadblock in a Toyota Land Cruiser which the police mistook for the missing vehicle and opened fire, killing the journalist, the police alleged.                   Four police officers were manning the roadblock, including officers from Kenya’s elite police unit, the detective said. All were standing on the driver’s side of the car when the shooting took place. The driver was not injured in the gunfire, he added.                  In a follow-up report, police said the first shots came from the car – hitting a police officer in the hand in the process – and police returned fire, shooting the car at least nine times.                   Kenya’s Independent Policing Oversight Authority, IPOA, has been tasked with investigating police conduct.                    “We are not investigating the prior events of this incident, or the prior movements and patterns of movements of this Pakistani journalist,” Elema Halake, CEO of IPOA, said. “Our mandate specifies that we only investigate the circumstances of the shooting.”                    Sharif’s death remains a hot-button issue and continues to spark outrage online. Tens of thousands of mourners flooded the streets of Islamabad to attend Sharif’s funeral in the city’s largest mosque in late October, chanting “Arshad, from your blood, revolution will come.”                 Several theories about his death have been circulated ​on social media, including by opponents of the Pakistani government and the Pakistani military who accuse them of plotting his death.      Arshad Sharif, prominent journalist who fled Pakistan, killed in shooting in Kenya             Separate investigations by Kenyan and Pakistani authorities are ongoing and in an unprecedented move, Pakistan’s intelligence chief addressed the media about Sharif’s killing last month, on the day of his funeral.                    “I have come for my agency whose officers are working day and night around the globe, I cannot remain silent when they are targeted,” Chief Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum said in a press conference.                   He called Sharif a “martyr” who had “no threat to his life in Pakistan.”                    Pakistan’s Supreme Court acknowledged the receipt of Sharif’s letter to CNN by a text message and said it was “being dealt with by following a due legal process.”                  While Pakistani President Arif Alvi said he had written a letter to the prime minister in July regarding the letter he received from Sharif, “for necessary action as per law,” in a media briefing on November 16, according to a press release from his office.                  As the investigation gathers pace on different continents, his widow Siddique is left to pick up the pieces and come to terms with his devastating loss.                     “I miss his smile, his voice, his presence,” she told CNN. “He was a great man, he was not only a great journalist, but he was a very loving person,” she remembers. “I lost a gem.”         © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/opinions/world-cup-usa-iran-activism-bishara/index.html,Opinion: This US victory is also a tale of unrealistic expectations,"In the run up to the World Cup, “Iran’s players had been placed in the no-win situation of trying to placate the Islamic leadership that runs the country and show solidarity with protesters suffering back home,” writes Motez Bishara on its loss ...","Nov 30, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Motez Bishara,International,"Editor’s Note: Motez Bishara is a freelance journalist, author and PhD researcher in sports sociology at the University of Leicester. His latest book is “Athletes Who Rock: Stories of Sacrifice, Setbacks and Success in Sports, Music and Life.” The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.              The United States’ decisive World Cup match against Iran on Tuesday provided more than just the obvious clash of cultures between the longstanding political rivals.                 The infectious trend of athlete activism that began stateside and crossed continents in recent years arrived awkwardly at the feet of the Iranian players in Qatar and was handled mostly like a soccer ball set on fire.                   The US’s 1-0 victory on a Christian Pulisic first-half goal advanced them into the knockout stage of the tournament, while Iran’s exasperated players will return home after an emotional fortnight to see what sort of reception awaits them.                   Playing in its sixth World Cup, Iran again failed to get past the group stage. But their challenges in Qatar were at least as daunting off the pitch.                  In the run up to this tournament, Iran’s players had been placed in the no-win situation of trying to placate the Islamic leadership that runs the country and show solidarity with protesters suffering back home.                  Since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini under police custody in mid-September, security forces in Iran have killed hundreds of demonstrators, according to the Iran Human Rights NGO, while injuring and imprisoning thousands more.     Opinion: Dr. Nasser 'Nas' Mohamed sought asylum in the US after coming out as gay. Here's what he wants people to know about Qatar             Gifted striker Mehdi Taremi squirmed when asked about the protesters at a press conference. While Iran’s Portuguese manager, Carlos Queiroz, was questioned by a British journalist if he was comfortable working for a country that represses the rights of women.                 Much has changed since Iran defeated the US in the 1998 World Cup. Back then, crowds of jubilant fans of Team Melli – its nickname denoting it as the people’s team – poured onto the streets, with women removing their headscarves alongside cheerful Revolutionary Guards.                 This time around, sentiment among Iranians was intensely divided over whether to cheer for or root against the national team, seen by many as willing pawns of the government in its campaign against the civil unrest. The view was reinforced by the team’s photo opportunity with President Ebrahim Raisi days before its opening match against England, a listless 6-2 loss.                 Much of that resentment stemmed from newfound expectations placed on athletes around the world to show solidarity with marginalized groups, a movement built upon the actions of American athletes over the past century that first peaked during the civil rights era of the 1960s.                 That stage of athlete activism created hard lines among those who did and did not speak out against the US government. It’s easy to forget that Jackie Robinson, the icon who broke baseball’s color barrier, called Muhammad Ali unappreciative to his country for his refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War.             This time around, sentiment among Iranians was intensely divided on whether to cheer for or root against the national team, seen by many as willing pawns of the government in its campaign against the civil unrest.              Motez Bishara                  As Arthur Ashe once said about his decision to focus on his game early in his tennis career, rather than address racial segregation in the sport: “In those days, if you were a moderate it was the same thing as being an Uncle Tom.”                 Since the police killing of George Floyd in May 2020, athlete activism has been reawakened to those same heights on an unprecedented scale globally. Witness the scene before Friday’s showcase match between England and the US, when the entire England squad took a knee – an anti-racist gesture made famous by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 – as American players stood and watched.                 Rarely has an international sporting event experienced so much controversy, with footballers speaking up for the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers who built stadiums in Qatar under much-scrutinized conditions.                 Yet words – or in the case of the German national team, gestures of silence – have not been enough for some, as similar with-us-or-against-us lines have been drawn from the days of Ali and Ashe.      Seven European team captains, including Harry Kane of England, were criticized for dropping plans to wear LGBTQ rainbow armbands despite facing yellow cards that would have put them at risk of a match ban in the tournament.                 No team, however, faced greater risk for playing the role of activists than Iran, with US Soccer raising the tension this week by removing the emblem of the Islamic Republic from Iran’s flag on a now-deleted social media graphic in support of human rights for Iranian women. Iran’s soccer federation responded by petitioning FIFA to ban the Americans from the tournament.                   US head coach Gregg Berhalter said he had no prior knowledge of the post and apologized, but one wonders whether US Soccer, who confirmed to CNN the gesture was deliberate but always intended to be temporary, were playing mischief to get into the heads of their opponents. (In the same press conference as Berhalter’s apology, clearly ruffled Iranian journalists asked him pointedly about US immigration policy and challenged US team captain Tyler Adams, who is Black, to address discrimination against Black people in America.)     Opinion: A look at one of the two athletes Obama said inspired him most             But despite reports of dissension in their camp, Iran’s footballers began the tournament weighing in on their domestic strife when they refused to sing their national anthem before facing England, while Europe-based players Ehsan Hajsafi and Sardar Azmoun verbally backed the protesters.                 Days later, Iranian-Kurdish player Voria Ghafouri became the latest of several current and former footballers arrested for “incitement against the regime” – a menacing harbinger for Team Melli.                 What punishment could the players or their families face if they continued to provoke the Islamic Republic? One far worse than a yellow card, no doubt.                 Instead, the Iranians came out mouthing their national anthem to jeers from the crowd before their second group match against Wales on Friday, as if to say, “We’re done being activists, let’s let our play do our talking for us.” And that it did. The lifting of that moral burden was reflected in Team Melli’s spirited play, resulting in a thrilling 2-0 victory, with both goals scored in 11 minutes of extra time.                 Iranian players exulted on the field to an ecstatic crowd, but so nuanced are feelings towards Team Melli that even their celebrations were deemed as too excessive by some in light of those who were persecuted back home.                 Iran’s plight in this World Cup should serve as a reminder that social protest does not necessarily align with the conditions of all athletes and should not always be expected of them.                  The old adage in sports is that winning cures all. On Tuesday, however, the Iranians looked spent, and despite needing only a draw against the US to advance, struggled to pose a threat until the dying minutes of the match.                 Perhaps they will have better luck in four years’ time when the World Cup is hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Should Iran qualify, tough questions will no doubt be placed on their players once again.       © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Sign up here.             Electronic music, strobe lights, glittered faces and hundreds of thousands of people in mixed-gender gyrations are all part of a new kind of ritual in Saudi Arabia that didn’t exist just three years ago.                   The kingdom’s Soundstorm music festival, which began in 2019, is back again for its fourth year and will start on Thursday.                   In just five years since Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on musical events, the kingdom’s concert scene has arguably outshined even that of Dubai, long seen as the Gulf region’s premier entertainment hub.                   The country that has been better known as the birthplace of Islam than  a  rave capital has gone through a tremendous makeover since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS) took control of the everyday running of the kingdom in 2017. Soundstorm is an eye-catching  symbol of that change.                  For three days every winter, hundreds of thousands of people from across Saudi Arabia and the region descend on a desert site outside the capital Riyadh to listen to some of the top Western and Arab acts .                  The rave is a manifestation of the ethos behind Saudi Arabia’s socioeconomic transformation, according to Anna Jacobs, a senior analyst at the Crisis Group think tank. “(It)  is a particularly powerful example because it seeks to bring together young people and women from across Saudi Arabia and the world,” she said.                  David Guetta, Post Malone and Bruno Mars are just a few of the stars performing at  this year’s event, which prides itself as being “the loudest festival in the region,” aiming to “amplify the unseen” as it supports local and international music in the Middle East. Tickets  cost between 149 riyals  (around $40) for a single day and 6,699 riyals  (around $1,800 ) for a three-day VIP treatment.                  The festival reportedly welcomed 730,000 partygoers last year. By contrast, Las Vegas’ Electric Daisy Carnival, considered North America’s biggest dance music festival, had an attendance of over 400,000 this year.                  An event like Soundstorm was inconceivable in the country just six years ago, when the notorious religious police would roam the streets and censure Saudis for mixing with the opposite sex or flouting social norms. But it is now part of a liberalization initiative spearheaded by MBS, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. It accompanies a series of steps to relax social rules, including lifting the ban on women’s driving and reining in the religious police.                  In 2016, Saudi Arabia established the General Entertainment Authority in tandem with Vision 2030 – the crown prince’s plan to diversify its economy beyond oil, which accounts for more than half of the government’s revenue. Among its goals was to almost double household spending on cultural and entertainment activities within the kingdom. Riyadh is now seeing more than $64 billion in entertainment investment, reported Arab News, with a significant proportion of that going to the live music industry.                  Vision 2030 prides itself on offering “world-class entertainment” and says that it has organized up to 3,800 entertainment events in the country, attended by more than 80 million people.                  “The whole principle about allowing festivals is to provide youth with domestic entertainment and local tourism opportunities so they don’t need to travel abroad in search of fun,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst.                  Some conservatives may find the festival unacceptable, Shihabi said, but given that youth make up the majority of the country’s population, they remain the primary beneficiaries.                   Around two-thirds of Saudi Arabia’s population is 34 years old or younger, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. Analysts say it’s the youth that MBS needs to placate, not the conservatives.                  Alcohol continues to be banned in the kingdom, as are sexual relations between men, and unmarried couples.                   The festival is not, however, without international criticism and accusations of whitewashing the kingdom’s human rights record. Last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that performers should either “speak up” about Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations or not attend the festival at all.                  “Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars hosting massive entertainment and cultural events in a deliberate (attempt) to whitewash the country’s abysmal human rights record and the Soundstorm music festival is no different,” Joey Shea, a researcher at HRW told CNN. “The creation of the country’s local entertainment industry was accompanied by waves of arbitrary arrests of dissidents, activists, human rights defenders and ordinary Saudi citizens.”                  Shihabi rejects the argument that the festival whitewashes the country’s rights record, saying that it “has little to do with any global image and is purely focused on servicing local needs.”                  Mdlbeast, the organizers of Soundstorm, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.                   Some however argue that opening up countries to international norms and values can allow for better discussion on human rights shortcomings.                   “I think there is a way for these major international events – whether that be the World Cup in Qatar or music festivals in Saudi Arabia – to help open public discourse to critical debate,” said Jacobs.                   “They can help cultivate healthy criticism and discussion around human rights issues in the region,” she added, “and as the Gulf continues to solidify its position as the region’s center of gravity, I think this is what we will see.”                  The families of Iran’s World Cup football team had been threatened with imprisonment and torture if the players failed to “behave” ahead of the match against the United States on Tuesday, a source involved in the security of the games said.                  Following the refusal of Iranian players to sing the nation’s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21, the source said that the players were called to a meeting with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.                  The source said that they were told that their families would face “violence and torture” if they did not sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against the Tehran regime.                  Here’s the latest:      Qatar to send 2 million tons of LNG to Germany in new energy deal              QatarEnergy signed a deal on Tuesday that will allow Germany to receive flows of Qatari liquefied natural gas (LNG) over a period of at least 15 years, Qatar’s state news agency QNA said. The deal is the first of its kind to Europe from the expansion project of Qatar’s North Field, the world’s biggest gas field, and is meant to make up for some of the shortage triggered by Russian supply cuts.      US State Department approves potential anti-drone system sale to Qatar for $1 billion              The US State Department has approved the potential sale of an anti-drone system to Qatar in a deal valued at $1 billion, Reuters cited the Pentagon as saying on Tuesday. The principal contractors will be Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman Corp, the Pentagon said.       US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces fear Turkish ground invasion could start in a week             The head of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on Tuesday said a Turkish ground invasion could take place in a matter of days if Turkey does not see forceful opposition to a military incursion from countries such as the  US and Russia.                  Qatar’s World Cup chief Hassan Al-Thawadi said that between 400 and 500 migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament – a greater figure than Qatari officials have cited previously.                  In an interview with Piers Morgan which aired on TalkTV on Monday, Al-Thawadi was asked about the number of migrant workers fatalities due to construction for the World Cup and said: “The estimate is around 400, between 400 and 500.                  “I don’t have the exact number, that’s something that’s been discussed. One death is too many, it’s as simple as that.”                  In November 2022, a government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on World Cup stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths.

The vehicle will be delivered by the Japanese HAKUTO-R lander and will touch down on the Atlas crater.                    It will spend one lunar day (equivalent to 14.75 days Earth time) where it will analyze the plasma of the moon’s surface and conduct experiments on lunar dust. It will then spend another lunar day in which it will attempt to survive the moon’s harsh environment, before decommissioning.                   The launch aims to be the first step in the UAE’s greater space prospects. By 2117, the country aims to have a colony built on Mars’s surface. “We are starting small,” Hamad Al Marzooqi, project manager of the Emirates Lunar Mission at the MBRSC, told CNN. “But we hope that this small step will be eventually the starting point to reach our targets.”                  The UAE launched a mission to Mars in February last year.

It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.,"Nov 24, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Nadeen Ebrahim,International,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.             “Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker,” FIFA chief Gianni Infantino said in a fiery tirade on Saturday, comparing his own plight as a redhead son of migrants to that of marginalized communities.                   His ostensible empathy with Qatar was due to the barrage of criticism the nation has faced in Western media for hosting the tournament.                    But it’s hypocritical of the West to be giving lessons in morality to others, he said.                   Those statements on the eve of the World Cup went viral, inviting much anger and ridicule. But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.                   Omar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized “from a Western point of view” what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.                    In the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation’s treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain’s public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.                    This year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.                    The Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into “nations and tribes” so they can get to know each other.                   According to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.        World Cup makes history with direct flights from Israel to Qatar             Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.                    But in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup.                  “Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”                  The visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn’t escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.                   Western news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.                     The Times of London on Monday said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country’s population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.                    “I think that the Western media is biased because they don’t want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],” Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.                   But some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar’s Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows “the depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.”       The Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar’s right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was “laced with hypocrisy.”        'Our dreams never came true.' These men helped build Qatar's World Cup, now they are struggling to survive             “I always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,” said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.                   “Scrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,” Al Hussein told CNN.                   “Especially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.”                   James Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been “fair and proportionate.”                   “It’s absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,” he said.                   Workers in the country continue to “face harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,” he said, adding that Qatar’s women and LGBTQ people “face serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.”                   Critics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn’t receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.                   “At the risk of engaging in whataboutism… Qatar’s human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,” said Al Hussein. “Qatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.”                   Maryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.                   “This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” she said. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”                  She noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country’s human rights shortcomings.                    “Many of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,” she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn’t help the cause of Qatar’s migrant workers.                    “The plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN. “It shouldn’t be about whataboutism.”        With additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha              Social media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.                   With media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq’s border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who’d left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.                   The covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.                   US Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is “a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.”                  Read the article here.                   Here’s the latest on the protests in Iran:                  Saudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.                  Many had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.      Watch CNN’s Becky Anderson speak to celebrating fans of the Saudi team:                  Also read:      Teenage student dies in twin explosions in Jerusalem              Two explosions shook Jerusalem early Wednesday, killing one person and injuring 18 others in a suspected “combined terror attack,” according to an Israeli police spokesperson. The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.      Russia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says              Iran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.      Saudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market              Oil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China’s rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghanistan’s Supreme Leader Alaiqadar Amirul Momineen made the “obligatory” command after meeting with judges to “investigate the cases of thieves, kidnappers, and seditionists.”                  “Those cases that have met all the Shariah conditions of limitation and retribution, you are obliged to issue the limitation and retribution, because this is the order of the Sharia… and it is obligatory to act,” Mujahid tweeted Sunday.                  Kaheld Abou El Fadl, a professor of Islamic Law at UCLA and one of the world’s leading authorities on Sharia law, told CNN there’s a rich history of debate on the laws of Sharia and various interpretations of their meaning.                 “Every point of law you’ll find 10 different opinions … Sharia is very open-ended,” he said.                 Sharia law within Islamic jurisprudence means the “search for the divine will,” El Fadl told CNN. “Although, both in Western and native discourses, it is common to use Sharia interchangeably with Islamic law, Sharia is a much broader and all encompassing concept, according to a statement from El Fadl’s website.     Women stopped from entering amusement parks in Kabul             The Taliban’s hardline implementation of the doctrine when the group was last in power from 1996 to 2001 included violent punishments, such as public executions, stoning, floggings and amputations.                 El Fadl said that within the 1400-year tradition of Sharia, those punishments were rarely implemented because the majority of Islamic jurists throughout history didn’t interpret the law the way the Taliban currently does. “The Taliban have a particular approach to Sharia that one cannot ignore,” El Fadl said. “Anyone who doesn’t fit their definition can be possibly put to death.”                    After seizing power last August, the Taliban attempted to project a more moderate image to gain international support, but in the months since, the group has clamped down on rights and freedoms.                 Women in Afghanistan can no longer work in most sectors and require a male guardian for long-distance travel, while girls have been barred from returning to secondary school.                 Last week, women were stopped from entering amusement parks in the capital Kabul after the Taliban’s morality ministry said women’s access to public parks would be restricted. Taliban supreme leader warns foreigners not to interfere in Afghanistan             During the group’s first stint in power, the Taliban banned most forms of music as un-Islamic, and this August, in echoes of the policy,  Afghan folk singer Fawad Andarabi was dragged from his home and killed.                 Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General, told CNN the Taliban’s recent announcement regarding Sharia law was “worrying.”                  “Since they took over as de facto authority, we expect them to abide by their promise to uphold existing human rights commitments made in Afghanistan,” Haq said. “They have not been living up to the commitments. We will continue to press them on this. We are opposed to death penalty in all its forms.”                  The security situation in the country has also deteriorated since the group’s takeover last year, with the nation growing increasingly isolated and impoverished.                  Nearly half of the country faces acute hunger, according to the United Nations. An estimated 43% of Afghanistan’s population is living on less than one meal a day, with 90% of Afghans surveyed reporting food as their primary need, according to a May report by the International Rescue Committee.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The Islamic Republic is facing one of the biggest and unprecedented shows of dissent following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman detained by the morality police allegedly for not wearing her hijab properly.                 In an open letter signed by 227 of Iran’s 290 members of Parliament, Press TV reports the lawmakers calls for protesters to be taught a “good lesson” to deter others who threaten the authority of the Iranian government.                 “We, the representatives of this nation, ask all state officials, including the Judiciary, to treat those, who waged war (against the Islamic establishment) and attacked people’s life and property like the Daesh (terrorists), in a way that would serve as a good lesson in the shortest possible time,” the letter read according to state-run Press TV.                 Lawmakers added that such a punishment – the methods of which were not specified – would “prove to all that life, property, security and honor of our dear people is a red line for this (Islamic) establishment, and that it would show no leniency to anybody in this regard.”     Iran has charged at least 1,000 people in Tehran province for their alleged involvement in the nationwide protests over Amini’s death, the largest such show of dissent in years, state news agency IRNA has reported. Their trials are public and have been underway for more than a week.                  Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) said in a report last Wednesday that dozens of protesters are facing charges including “enmity against God” and “corruption on earth,” which carry the death sentence.                 The letter from the members of Parliament also reiterates prior Iranian government claims that the ongoing protests – that it calls riots – were incited by the United States and other enemies of Iran.  Iran’s government has provided no evidence to back up its claims of foreign involvement in the protest movement.       Young Iranians are rising up against decades of repression -- arguably bolder than ever             Javaid Rehman, the U.N.’s special rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, told the UN Security Council last week that as many as 14,000 people, including journalists, activists, lawyers and educators, had been arrested since protests erupted in Iran in mid-September.                 Rehman said the “unabated violent response of security forces” had caused at least 277 deaths.                 The recent death of Kurdish-Iranian woman Nasrin Qadri sparked a wave of protests in her hometown Marivan on Sunday, with the Kurdish rights group Hengaw Organization for Human Rights and activist outlet IranWire alleging that she had “suffered severe injuries” from baton blows to the head wielded by Iranian security forces.                  Her cause of death has been disputed; the public prosecutor in Shahriyar, a town about half-an-hour outside Tehran where Qadri reportedly lived, said that the initial medical diagnosis for her cause of death was poisoning, adding that according to a family statement, she had a prior illness as well, as reported by the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).                  Her father separately said in an on-camera statement which aired on Iranian state television that Qadri died from the flu and that “rumors” about her death were false – an explanation that Hengaw activist Azhin Shekhi believes was forced.                 “First they forced her family to say publicly that her death was caused by disease,” Shekhi told CNN.                 “Security forces also did not allow her relatives to gather at her parents’ house when her body was returned home, and they also forbade any kind of funeral or burial service,” Sheikh added.                   CNN cannot independently verify arrest figures, death tolls, and many of the accounts of those killed due to the Iranian government’s suppression of the media, the internet and transparency. Nor can media directly access the government for their account on such cases, unless there is reporting on state media, the mouthpiece of the government.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/middleeast/iran-saudi-cartoons-quran-mime-intl/index.html,Cartoons and Quranic verses form the latest Saudi-Iran battleground,"For Iran, attacking Saudi Arabia – or even threatening to do so – is the closest it can come to hitting America without actually hitting America, and risking catastrophic consequences.","Nov 4, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Abbas Al Lawati,International,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.             The animated simulation shows a fleet of drones approaching an oil facility belonging to Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company. Air raid sirens are heard with ominous background music as the drones aim at the facility, apparently ready to strike.                   The one-minute video ends with a telling verse from the Quran about God repelling the invaders of Mecca by having them pelted with stones from the sky. “And He sent upon them birds, in flocks,” it says.                   The aircraft have a strong resemblance to Iran’s Shahid suicide drones, which have been in the headlines lately for wreaking havoc in Ukraine.                    This footage was posted on a Telegram channel sympathetic to Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Wednesday, shortly after US and Saudi officials sounded alarms about an imminent Iranian attack on energy infrastructure in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia.                    Iran’s foreign ministry hit back, calling the reports baseless attempts by “Western and Zionist circles” aimed at “creating a negative atmosphere against the Islamic Republic.”         US and Saudi Arabia concerned that Iran may be planning attack on energy infrastructure in Middle East             But just last month, IRGC chief Hossein Salami warned Saudi Arabia of “consequences” twice in one week for its alleged support for Israel and the nationwide protests that have gripped Iran. Tehran’s Yemeni proxy, the Houthi group, also threatened to strike Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a truce in Yemen expired in October. US Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking traveled to the UAE and Saudi Arabia this week to try to “renew and expand” that truce, the State Department said Thursday.                   For Iran, attacking Saudi Arabia – or even threatening to do so – is the closest it can come to hitting America without actually hitting America, and risking catastrophic consequences. This was demonstrated in 2019, when an audacious predawn attack on Saudi oil facilities that the United States blamed on Iran was met with a largely muffled response by the Trump White House, arguably the most pro-Saudi US administration ever. Tehran’s calculations likely take that into account. Iran denied involvement then, and the attack was claimed by the Houthis.                    Iran is also proving to be a thorn in the US’s side by providing missiles and drones to foster Russia’s Ukraine invasion.                    If Iran does indeed want to cause damage to both Saudi Arabia and the Biden administration, it likely considers the time to be ripe now, given the deep fissure in Saudi-American relations.                    But its window to do so is probably small. When Aramco was hit in 2019, half of Saudi Arabia’s oil supply was knocked off the market, sending global crude prices soaring by 19.5%, the biggest jump on record. A similar scenario ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections would likely have a detrimental impact on the Democratic Party’s prospects in the vote as President Joe Biden struggles to battle inflation at home.                    The bellicose battle of cartoons and Quranic verses between Saudi Arabia and Iran isn’t new. In late 2017, an animation surfaced on YouTube from a channel called Saudi Strike Force showing the kingdom’s forces invading Iran and capturing a quivering man, eerily similar to Qasem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC’s Qods Force who was killed by the US in a January 2020 drone strike. In the footage, Iranians in Tehran are shown celebrating Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS) as their liberator.       London-based TV channel sparks Iranian leaders' ire amid protests               That video started with a quote by MBS saying Saudi Arabia will “bring the fight to Iran” and it also ended with a Quranic verse – this one about a plea from Abraham to God: “O, my Lord! Make this city (Mecca) one of peace and security and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.”                    But that was a different era. Now, the Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen and regionally has calmed, and Riyadh has actually been talking to Tehran, perhaps in an effort to prevent the heated rhetoric that culminated in the 2019 attack. The two countries held their sixth round of talks in April and both parties have cited progress.                    The messages from Iran have been mixed. Last month, while the IRGC was threatening Riyadh, the Iranian Supreme Leader’s adviser called for Saudi Arabia and Iran to reopen their embassies in each other’s capitals. “We are neighbors of Saudi Arabia and we must coexist,” said Ali Akbar Velayati.                    An Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia would serve as a convenient distraction from public civil rights protests at home due to the damage it could cause to its regional nemesis and to the global economy. This time, however, given Iran’s very public threats to Saudi Arabia, Tehran may not have the option of plausible deniability as it did in 2019.                    But the saber-rattling may also just be intended to keep the Saudis and Americans on their toes, the oil markets jittery, and prices high enough to hurt wallets and politics.                      Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi hit back at his US counterpart  Biden for voicing his support for the protest movement in the country and promising to “free Iran.”                    “A few hours ago, I was informed that the President of America absentmindedly [said] ‘We will soon free Iran.’ We were freed 43-years-ago, and Iran will never be your milking cow,” Raisi said during a televised address on Friday.                  Speaking at a campaign event in  California Thursday ahead of the midterm elections, Biden seemed to imply his administration would support Iran’s nationwide uprising, telling the crowd, “don’t worry, we’re going to free Iran, they’re going to free themselves pretty soon.”                   Here’s the latest:       Pope Francis speaks out against death penalty in Bahrain              The pontiff spoke against the death penalty on Thursday at the start of a trip to Bahrain where the opposition has accused the government of overseeing human rights abuses and families of death row inmates had sought help from the pontiff, Reuters reported.      China-GCC Free Trade Agreement nears               Talks for a free trade agreement (FTA) between China and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have entered their final stage, according to the UAE’s state news agency WAM, citing a Chinese diplomat.       Erdogan rival is first target of Turkish media law, opposition party says              Turkey’s main opposition party has said its leader is the first target of a media “disinformation” law after police asked prosecutors to open an investigation into comments he made blaming authorities for a drug “epidemic,” Reuters reported. On Monday, Republican People’s Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said on Twitter that Ankara had not questioned the origin of money brought into the country and this “dirty money” from drug smuggling had been used to finance Turkey’s current account deficit. The police and interior ministry declined to comment.                  CNN’s Hadas Gold speaks to Becky Anderson about Israel’s election, the country’s surge to the right and Netanyahu’s comeback.

The monastery included a church, refectory, cisterns and cells for the monks, according to a statement by state news agency WAM.                  Radiocarbon dating suggests the monastery belonged to a community that flourished in the emirate between the late sixth to mid-eighth centuries, into the Islamic era.                  Zaki Nusseibeh, a cultural adviser to the UAE president, described it as one of the most important archaeological discoveries in the region, according to WAM.                  This is the latest in a series of archeological sites discovered in the UAE in recent years.                  In February, the UAE’s oldest buildings were discovered on the island of Ghagha, west of the city of Abu Dhabi.                   The buildings dated discovered then went back at least 8,500 years according to Abu Dhabi’s Department of Culture and Tourism – more than 500 years older than the previous record-breaking discovery.

They also added to the moral imperative for the rest of the world to do more, writes Frida Ghitis.","Oct 30, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Frida Ghitis,International,"Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             On the 40th day after Mahsa Amini died while in the custody of the Iranian regime’s intrusive morality police, protests sparked by her death grew even more widespread, more defiant, more determined.                   They also added to the moral imperative for the rest of the world to do more.                 In Amini’s birthplace of Saqqez, where the 22-year-old also known as Zhina is now buried, thousands of people defied the police and turned out to mark an important day in the mourning process, even as security forces fired live bullets and tear gas to stop them.                 Demonstrations also took place in numerous other cities: In Isfahan, women waved black scarves in the air, chanting “Azadi, Azadi!” (“Freedom, freedom!”) in Farsi. In Shiraz, young women walked confidently on city sidewalks without veils, their hair flowing in the air in violation of Iranian law. In Amol, where authorities have already shot and killed protesters, unarmed men and women marched directly toward armed security forces, kneeled, put their hands up, and declared themselves ready to die for their cause.                  While Amini’s death has become the trigger for this uprising, it is the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, that’s become its symbol, because her run-in with the morality police was so familiar to so many women. She was visiting Tehran from her hometown in Iran’s Kurdish region last month when she was detained for, allegedly, not properly wearing her hijab – a degrading experience familiar to Iranian women who are routinely harassed for minor clothing infractions. Authorities later claimed Amini died of an illness while at a “re-education center.” Her family says she was perfectly healthy.     Iranians are risking it all to protest. Their families say some of them aren't coming home             In the weeks since, the regime has killed hundreds of peaceful protesters, among them many children and idealistic young women.                 One of the teenagers whose bravery and death has become a rallying cry is Nika Shahkarami, a 16-year-old who disappeared last month after waving her hijab in the air at a protest in Tehran, and then setting fire to another headscarf in front of a small crowd.                 Nika later turned up dead. Though Iran’s government and state media have claimed her death had nothing to do with the uprising, a CNN investigation found video and witness testimony showing she was hunted down by plain clothes Basiji militias – security forces utilized by the regime to crack down on demonstrators – following her protest. Eyewitnesses told CNN they saw Nika among groups of protesters being detained later that night. That was the last time she was seen, days before her battered body was returned to her grieving family. Now her mother, too, is rallying protesters.                  The courage of Iranians, young and old, risking it all for a chance at freedom, is defying the predictions of jaded foreign observers. Recalling previous failed protests, many have argued that the strength of this one, with its shouts “Women, life, freedom,” was little more than a doomed social media mirage.                  But the protests are persisting. Seven weeks in, they have lasted longer than any uprising since the 1979 revolution toppled the Pahlavi regime and brought to power today’s theocracy. And these protests are different from their predecessors. In 2009, the Green Movement supported a reformist candidate. In 2019, demonstrators called out harsh economic conditions.     Stalked, tortured, disappeared: Iranian authorities have a playbook for silencing dissent, and they're using it again             This time, women, and the men who have joined them, are crying out, “Death to the dictator.” This is not about reform. This is about fundamental change.                 Let’s be honest. From the first day of protests, this has been inspiring, but also terrifying to watch. We have seen what the Islamic Republic is capable of. We fear for the safety of these brave people, and it can seem irresponsible to encourage them. The odds, after all, are stacked against them. And yet, they have made the choice to continue the fight. They deserve our solidarity.                 As a group of 12 female foreign ministers declared in an October 26 statement, “we have a moral obligation” to support this women-led movement. But the people demanding their freedom in Iran need more than symbolic backing – even if symbols matter.                  The United States and other Western powers have always worried about backing Iranian protesters, because the regime already dismisses those who oppose them as tools of the West. The Obama administration allowed such concerns to muzzle its response during the 2009 protests. The Biden administration is trying to avoid making the same mistake. Already, Washington has spoken out repeatedly in support of the protest movement. On Wednesday, the State Department announced new sanctions against Iranians involved in repressing demonstrations.                 That’s a good start. Anyone – regime officials, the Basiji militias, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps – involved in crushing the protests should be banned from entering the US. Other countries should follow suit.     CNN Exclusive: After Ukraine, Biden administration turns to Musk's satellite internet for Iran              But much more can be done.                  Germany this week announced that, given the situation, there can be no “business as usual,” with Iran, launching a wide-ranging diplomatic response that includes a review of bilateral trade and financial relations, support for nongovernmental organizations monitoring crimes against protestors and expanded protections for “particularly vulnerable Iranians,” among other efforts.                   The US, its other allies, democracies across the world and any country that rejects the regime’s actions should join in isolating Iran diplomatically. Diplomatic relations should continue, but as long as Iran is killing protesters, relations should be downgraded. And Iran must be expelled from the UN Commission on the Status of Women. Its presence there is a travesty.                 Then there’s the matter of the abandoned 2015 nuclear deal – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA – which the Biden administration has been working to reinstate. Currently, negotiations to revive the deal, designed to delay Iran’s ability to build a nuclear weapon, are stuck because Iran keeps raising the stakes. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has said he foresees no return to the JCPOA in the “near term.” Such phrasing likely means the goal of reviving it has not died entirely.                 The US and its allies want to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon, an unimpeachable objective. But restarting the deal could bring hundreds of billions of dollars to the regime that is currently killing peaceful protesters, arming Russia with killer drones used to slaughter innocent Ukrainians and continuing to support terrorist groups across the Middle East. At the very least, the wisdom of reviving the nuclear deal must be reevaluated.                 The relentless bravery of the Iranian women, of the Iranian people, is a timely moral test for the rest of the world. They deserve more than they have received.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Two children were among the victims, according to state-run Press TV.                 Iranian security forces have arrested two of the suspected attackers, and a manhunt is underway to capture a third, state news said.                 The terror group ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, releasing a statement through its affiliated Amaq news agency that said one of its members had “targeted groups of Sunni refusal infidels inside the shrine with his machine gun, causing the death of tens of them.”                 Nour News Agency, which is affiliated with Iran’s top security body, said the suspects were foreign nationals.                 Wednesday evening is one of the busiest times for the shrine, reported the state-run IRNA, and eyewitnesses said an attacker was in a car before targeting worshippers at its entrance.                  The governor of Fars province said that “the terrorist first targeted the servant and guard of the shrine, and intended to attack the congregational evening prayers, but one of the servants shut the door on him,” state news said quoting the governor.                 “Loud screams were heard in the women’s section of the shrine at the time of adhan [the call for prayer] and suddenly an armed man was spotted with a Kalashnikov firing indiscriminately in the compound of the shrine,” an eyewitness told state media.                 “After the initial burst of fire, the attacker went near the shrine and fired many rounds at those present at the scene,” the eyewitness added.                 The attack took place on the same day that clashes broke out throughout Iran as thousands of people came to the burial site of Mahsa Amini in Saqqez, a city in the Kurdistan province, to mark 40 days since her death, semi-official Iranian state news agency ISNA said. It’s unclear if the attack was related to the protests.                  Protests have swept through the Islamic Republic following the death of the 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, who died on September 16 after being detained by “morality police” and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             A top Iranian military official issued a warning to Saudi Arabia last week as his government continued to face off against protesters at home. “You are involved in this matter and know that you are vulnerable, it is better to be careful,” he said at the sidelines of a military drill.                   Major General Hossein Salami, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was referring to what state news outlets called a “media war” that they say is being waged against “the Iranian youth and nation” by foreign conspirators seeking to create unrest in the country by supporting protesters there.                  Then, on Thursday Iran again warned Saudi Arabia, as well as the United States and the United Kingdom, to “stop interfering in the country’s internal affairs.”         Iran last week said it sanctioned a number of media outlets in the UK for “supporting terrorism” and “inciting violence”, reported Tasnim news agency The sanctioned entities include, among others, Volant Media, Global Media, and DMA Media, as well as the “anti-Iranian TV channels” that the companies support, such as Iran International, reported Tasnim agency.                  Now in their sixth week, protests have swept through the Islamic Republic following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died on September 16 after being detained by “morality police” and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.        Iran says it will sue US, alleging 'direct involvement' in protests              As the protests rage, Iran is turning up the heat on its adversaries, mainly the United States and Israel. But last week, Saudi Arabia found itself in the line of fire, which risks further complicating attempts by the two regional rivals to mend ties.                    Riyadh hasn’t publicly commented on the protests. The kingdom’s foreign minister refused to give his view when asked to during an interview with Al Arabiya news channel on October 12.                     “Saudi Arabia has a fixed policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of states,” he said. “Surely, we are following [the situation] and we wish Iran and its people the best.”                  Iran and Saudi Arabia severed ties in 2016 and both parties have backed opposite sides in proxy conflicts across the Middle East. Last year, they began direct talks in an attempt to improve relations. Baghdad has hosted five rounds of talks so far, the last of which was held in April.                    At the heart of Iran’s most recent accusations against Saudi Arabia may be Iran International, a Persian-language news channel that broadcasts from London. The channel has become one of the go-to sources for many Persian speakers looking for news on the protests. It has been at the forefront of covering the demonstrations, getting breaking news and exclusive footage of the events on the ground. Its Twitter account has over a million followers.                   Founded in 2017, Iran International has previously come under scrutiny by the Iranian government. Some say it is due to their coverage of the protests at home, which in recent weeks have rocked the Islamic Republic.                   Salami didn’t name the channel in his warning, but government-backed Iranian media last week accused Saudi Arabia of funding it. Saudi Arabia has not addressed the allegations. Karim Sa djadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment  for International Peace think tank in Washington DC, said on Twitter that Iran has demanded the shuttering of the channel in talks with Saudi Arabia, citing a senior Gulf official.                  In 2018, Iran International released a statement denying connections to any government, including Saudi Arabia or Iran after The Guardian reported that it was funded by a firm  whose director has ties to Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.                   Saudi Arabia did not comment on the Guardian report. The Saudi government did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.                   “We have heard these accusations before most often promoted by those in whose interests it is to deny a free press,” a spokesperson for Volant Media told CNN.                    “Iran International and its sister channel, Afghanistan International, are editorially independent television channels owned by Volant Media, a company based in London owned by a Saudi Arabian/British citizen; it has no state backing or affiliation,” added the spokesperson.      Azadeh Moaveni, associate professor of journalism at New York University, described the channel as “one of the most pernicious and damaging forces to enter the Iranian media sphere,” calling it an arm of Saudi foreign policy. “I would not describe Iran International as pro-reform, or organically Iranian in any manner,” she told CNN.        Mohammad Marandi, a professor at the University of Tehran who was also an adviser to the Iranian nuclear talks negotiating team, said there’s “no doubt” that Iran International is funded by Saudi Arabia. A prominent figure on state-funded Iranian outlets, Marandi added that Iran International spreads rumors, ethnic and sectarian strife “and it tries to use misinformation to create fear, chaos and promote violence.”                   Saudi Research and Marketing Group, a media conglomerate with ties to the Saudi ruling family, has run the Persian language website of the UK’s Independent newspaper since 2018. Its account on Instagram, where many Iranians get their news, has over 600,000 followers.                   CNN’s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which has a partnership with Saudi Research and Media Group, a Saudi joint stock company.                  Saudi Arabia has for years accused Iran of doing the same with its own Arabic-language news channels: targeting Arab audiences with propaganda. State-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting runs Al Alam TV, an Arabic news channel that has interviewed Saudi opposition figures and has been blocked by Arab states. Iran-backed Hezbollah’s Al Manar channel has also been blocked.                  “It’s about time Iran gets a taste of its own medicine,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst. “Iran has spent decades inciting and funding instability in the Arab world so having them pay the price of such behavior themselves is certainly a source of satisfaction to a lot of people,” he told CNN.       Iran faces dilemma as children join protests in 'unprecedented' phenomenon              The channel “is making an impact on public behavior in Iran and they are nervous about their domestic situation,” added Shihabi.                   Analysts say that Iran’s tight grip on domestic media outlets and its lack of freedom of expression have created “fertile ground” for anti-establishment platforms such as Iran International to flourish.                    “It is not so much the broadcasters themselves, but the situation in Iran has provided the possibility for broadcasters outside of Iran to gather a certain degree of popularity in the Iranian context,” said Gholam Khiabany, a reader in media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London.       Harun Najafizada, a former journalist at Iran International who is now a director at the sister Afghanistan International news channel, said the parent company Volant Media is privately funded but “I don’t care as long as they do not influence my editorial take,” adding that shareholders never interfere in decision making.                   Iran International stood out from other Western-backed Persian language news outlets “by taking the side of the disenchanted, oppressed, voiceless people,” while competitor Persian channels in the West were focused on bringing balance by giving the Iranian government a voice, he told CNN.                   “They have a vision, of course – they don’t do it for God,” said Najafizada, referring to the shareholders. “That vision is democracy.”                   Just two days after Salami’s first warning, however, Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, was quoted saying that the two countries should reopen their embassies to facilitate a rapprochement, according to the semi-official Iranian news agency ISNA.                    “We are neighbors of Saudi Arabia and we must coexist,” he was cited as saying by ISNA. “The embassies of the two countries should reopen in order to solve our problems in a better way.”                    Business owners and factory workers in Iran’s Kurdish region went on strike over the weekend as anti-government protests continued.                   Video shared with CNN by pro-reform activist outlet IranWire shows Sanandaj, the capital of the Kurdish region, quiet at the beginning of the work week as stores remain shut.                  The Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw said shopkeepers were on strike in Bukan, Sanandaj and Saqez, as well as Marivan. Strikes and protests have become common in cities and towns across Iran as people unite against the regime.                  The nationwide protests are now in their fifth week, triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died three days after being arrested by the country’s morality police and taken to a re-education center.                  Here’s the latest on this developing story:       Israel and Lebanon could sign maritime border agreement on Thursday, Biden energy adviser says               Senior US adviser for global energy security Amos Hochstein said on Sunday that Israel and Lebanon could sign their historic maritime borders agreement as early as Thursday.      Human Rights Watch says LGBTQ people subjected to arrest and mistreatment in Qatar ahead of World Cup              Human Rights Watch (HRW) has accused Qatar’s security forces of arbitrarily arresting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and subjecting them to ill-treatment in detention ahead of the FIFA World Cup.

United Arab Emirates: #Diwali               Also known as Deepavali, the holiday is widely trending across social platforms in the United Arab Emirates, with many flooding Twitter with colorful photos of candles and wishing joy and prosperity to the world.                  Some are also posting photos of themselves in traditional celebratory garments. Diwali is one of the most important festivals in Hinduism, the largest religion in India. This year, it falls on October 24.                   India and the UAE share a strong political and economic relationship, one that has grown closer in recent years.                   The Indian expatriate community in the UAE is around 3.5 million, according to the Indian embassy in the UAE, adding that it is reportedly the largest ethnic community in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf state. Approximately 15% of the diaspora are in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, added the Indian embassy, while the rest are in six northern Emirates, including business hub Dubai.                  The UAE also accounts for 33% of foreign remittances to India, at more than $20 billion a year.                   Diwali is also significant for Sikhs and Jains. It is celebrated in India, Nepal, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries with South Asian diasporas.       © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here.                 The social media outburst this month from the rapper Ye, né Kanye West, may be the example of antisemitism capturing the most attention these days. But we’d be remiss not to locate this instance of anti-Jewish bigotry within a larger social climate.                 Mere days after Ye’s rant (and after the comedian Sarah Silverman was rebuked for suggesting that Black Americans haven’t condemned Ye; read on to learn more about the knotty dynamics at play here), former President Donald Trump rehashed dangerous tropes about Jewish people and loyalty.                 Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano and former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard also have raised concerns in recent weeks for embracing language that draws on age-old antisemitic narratives.                 This rhetoric arrives just before the four-year anniversary of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting – the deadliest assault on Jewish people in the US – and makes clear the persistence of antisemitism.                 “It’s hard for me to say that we, as a country, have learned anything,” Emily Tamkin, a senior editor at The New Statesman, told CNN. “I actually don’t think that the lessons that should’ve been learned from the attack were learned by Americans generally and certainly not by American politicians on the right.”                 Tamkin explores some of the fallout from the Tree of Life shooting in her new book, “Bad Jews: A History of American Jewish Politics and Identities,” a combination of historical analysis and memoir. But she doesn’t focus purely on tragedy. Rather, she gives dimension to American Jewish lives at a time when antisemitism is on the rise.     A survivor of the Holocaust and the Tree of Life massacre has died. He never lost hope in humanity             “It’d be impossible to write a book about American Jewish history and not include antisemitism. But this isn’t a book about antisemitism,” she explained. “This is a book about American Jews. American Jewish history is the history of American Jews, not the people who hate us.”                 Tamkin and I spoke at greater length about this history and the ways it ought to inform our present day. The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.     What has the social climate even just over the past several months – Whoopi Goldberg’s claim about the Holocaust in February, Ye’s antisemitic remarks – revealed about the way so many in US society view Jewish people and Jewish experiences?              I grew up in a town without many Jewish people and experienced antisemitism in my day-to-day life. So, it’s not that I’m surprised that antisemitism exists. As an adult, I’ve been a little bit surprised by the extent to which it’s been embraced by some of our politicians.                  I think that what Ye said was horrible. Personally, I’m more concerned about the fact that he was on a TV show run by a person who regularly has guests on who espouse antisemitic tropes and stereotypes.                 The fact that many people know better than to say “Jews” or “Jewish” doesn’t mean that what they’re saying isn’t antisemitic. The same week Ye tweeted about Jews, we had Tulsi Gabbard say that she was leaving the Democratic Party because it’s run by an “elitist cabal.” And Doug Mastriano, who’s running to be the governor of Pennsylvania, has slammed his Democratic opponent, Josh Shapiro, who’s Jewish, for sending his children to a Jewish day school.                  It’s important that we don’t just point to one celebrity and say, “Oh, my goodness, how could he say that?” Instead, we should look at this within the context of the current political moment.     What tension are you seeking to capture with the notion of “bad Jews”?             “Bad Jews” is a term American Jews throw at one another and ourselves. It’s a concept that many of us have deeply internalized, that we’re somehow doing this wrong. It’s a label people try to force others to wear, to claim that they’re somehow less authentic, that they haven’t inherited the tradition correctly. And this book attempts to push back.                  Right now in US politics, and specifically American Jewish politics, it sometimes feels like we’re just throwing the label of “bad Jew” back and forth at one other. Part of what I wanted to do is put this political moment in context. I started writing this book during the Trump years, when you had a president who said that American Jews who vote for Democrats, which is most American Jews, are disloyal.                  I think that when you look at American Jewish history, what you find is that there’s never been consensus on what it means to be a good American Jew, or even just an American Jew. And as much as things are changing today and as much as people might feel like we’re in crisis today and as much as things are polarized and politicized today, what I wanted to do was put the present moment in this larger context.      In one of your chapters, you tell a more complex history of Jewish people’s participation in the civil rights movement. Tell me more about why it’s important to complicate this history.              I’ve joked to some people that another title for the book could’ve been “Stories We Tell Ourselves and Why They’re Incomplete.” The common narrative is that American Jews were very supportive of the civil rights movement. Broadly speaking, this is true – there were many American Jews who supported the civil rights movement. At the same time, there were American Jews who didn’t. There were American Jews who said that rather than fighting for civil rights for Black Americans, we should be focusing on our “own” issues. There’s the broader context that for most of US history, most American Jews have gone through life as White people and been treated as White under the laws of the US.                 And it’s important to understand all of this. Just last week, we saw some American Jews invoke the civil rights movement and ask why more Black Americans weren’t speaking out against Ye’s remarks about Jewish people. First of all, to demand that Black Americans answer for one rapper is wrong. But also, this idea that all American Jews showed up during the civil rights movement, it’s just not true. It’s ahistorical. If we’re going to cite our history, we should at least understand that history.                  I think that there’s also a tendency, in some quarters of some American Jewish communities, to point to the civil rights movement as though our work in the US toward building a more just and equitable country is done. For this book, I interviewed Susannah Heschel, a scholar and the daughter of Rabbi Heschel, who famously marched with Martin Luther King Jr. She pointed out two things. She said that many people who said that they were supportive of the movement at the time weren’t supportive in tangible ways – in material ways – and still lived in largely White neighborhoods and perhaps resisted affirmative action. And that was for their own historic reasons, because of how quotas had been used against American Jews. But nevertheless.                  And she’s gone on the record many times saying that this isn’t how she wants her father’s memory to be used. It’s not meant as an excuse to check out of calls for justice today or to act as though racism and racial inequality have nothing to do with you.                  It’s important that we recognize that there are Jews of color, that there are Black Jews, that the face of American Jewish life, such as it is, is changing, and that when we talk about Black and Jewish relations, we do so in a way that doesn’t erase the existence of Black Jews.     What do you think gets overlooked in our conversations about antisemitism?              One thing that should be noted is that when we talk about antisemitism, people use it in really different ways. They understand it differently.                  That said, I think that one important element of understanding antisemitism is that, within the antisemite’s conception, Jews are always foreign. They can never really be a part of the nation. When you look at conspiracy theories wherein Jews are trying to corrupt or corrode the nation – well, why would they do that? It’s because they can never really belong. You see this again and again throughout Jewish history. And part of what’s so upsetting about that to me is that that’s what I hear. You’re telling me that you don’t really think that I’m both American and Jewish.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The UAE foreign ministry said the remarks were “inappropriate and discriminatory” and “contribute to a worsening climate of intolerance and discrimination worldwide” UAE state news agency (WAM) reported.                 In his remarks at the new European Diplomatic Academy in Bruges, Belgium, which have been widely circulated online since he made them last week, Borrell called Europe “a garden” and most of the world a “jungle” that “could invade the garden.”                 “The gardeners should take care of the garden, but they will not protect the garden by building walls. A nice small garden surrounded by high walls in order to prevent the jungle coming in is not going to be a solution. Because the jungle has a strong growth capacity, and the wall will never be high enough,” said Borrell, a Spanish politician.                 “The gardeners have to go to the jungle. Europeans have to be much more engaged with the rest of the world. Otherwise, the rest of the world will invade us,” he said.                 At a press conference on Monday, Borrell denied that his message was racist or colonialist, news agency EFE reported. The comments were intended to reject the idea of “fortress Europe” and to encourage students to engage with the world, he said.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Here are three of their stories,"As the protest cries of exasperated Iranians continue to ring through the streets of the country, reflected in videos posted on social media, here are a few of the key stories that have shaped the movement on the one-month anniversary of Mahsa ...","Oct 13, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Artemis Moshtaghian,International,"As the protest cries of exasperated Iranians continue to ring through the streets of the country, reflected in videos posted on social media, here are a few of the key stories that have shaped the movement on the one-month anniversary of Mahsa Amini’s arrest.                 To date, more than 1,000 people have been arrested across Iran, according to state news agency IRNA. At least 40 journalists are among those arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and a handful of athletes have been either arrested or detained for questioning.                  Below is a closer look at the faces and stories behind just three of those arrested, and in some cases released, in connection with the protests.                 Shervin Hajipour’s emotional song “Baraye,” which in English translates to “For…,” has been watched by millions across the globe.                 The poignant two-and-a-half-minute ballad is based on tweets composed by Iranians expressing their anger and frustration with the government. Hajipour despondently sings about grievances that range from “for dancing in the street”, “for yearning for a normal life ” to “for the children who pick through the trash in search of their dreams.”                 Instagram post not found.                   Post has been removed or is no longer public.                     The young up-and-coming singer could not have expected just how much of an impact his song would have.                  Hajipour posted the video of himself singing “Baraye” on Instagram on Tuesday September 27 and was arrested two days later. The song was viewed over 40 million times on his Instagram page before he took it down on the day of his arrest.                   The 25-year-old singer was summoned to a police station over questioning for “encouragement to protest,” according to Iranian news agency Entekhab.                  In the days following his detention, Hajipour deleted his Instagram page altogether, but his song had already gone viral and Iranians called upon each other to keep sharing the song to amplify his voice and, as a result, their grievances.                   “Baraye” soon became an anthem for the worldwide protests and rallies held on a day of solidarity dubbed “Freedom Rally for Iran.” On October 1, crowds of Iranians around the world in over 200 cities, including Melbourne, Tokyo, Brussels, Paris, London, Los Angeles and Toronto, marched through the streets with some people singing along to the lyrics of the song.                   People started calling for Hajipour’s song to be nominated for a Grammy in the “Best Song for Social Change” category. The newly created award “recognizes a song that has had profound social influence and impact,” and “that responds to the social issues of our time and has the potential for positive global impact,” according to the Recording Academy.                  On Monday, “Baraye” received 95,000 of the 115,000 submissions for the new Grammy Award, according to a statement from the Recording Academy.                  “The Academy is deeply moved by the overwhelming volume of submissions for Shervin Hajipour’s ‘Baraye’ for our new Special Merit Award, Best Song for Social Change,” Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said in a statement.                  “The Academy steadfastly supports freedom of expression and art that’s created to empower communities in need. Because music serves the world, and the Recording Academy exists to serve music.”                 The singer was released on bail on October 4, according to state-aligned news agency Tasnim, and now faces charges of spreading propaganda against the regime and encouraging and inciting people to acts of violence, according to his attorney, Majid Kaveh. Hajipour’s sister posted on social media that her brother is at home spending time with his family.                   “I’m infinitely grateful for all your kindness towards me during this time,” the singer wrote the day he was released in a social media post on his newly re-activated Instagram. “I came to say that I am doing well.” Hajipour wrote about how he was disappointed that his song has become politicized.                 “I won’t be a puppet to the people who don’t care about me, you, and this country,” he wrote.                 A week later, Hajipour addressed fans in a video message on an Instagram post pleading Iranians to treat each other like family during these trying times. “After all, we are all from the same soil and blood … and I would like it if the authorities, particularly during these conditions, approach people, who are in similar situation like me, like parents do with their children,” he said.                  The video message raised concerns among skeptical Iranians that Hajipour’s statement was forced by Iranian authorities because of an unidentified man sitting in the backseat of the car where he had recorded his video.                  Iran’s Deputy Interior Minister for security and police Seyed Majid Mirahmadi rebuked these claims saying that ever since the singer’s release from detention, any videos and claims he’s made have been on his own accord, adding that “he was not forced to publish any videos of himself,” according to the country’s semi-official ISNA news agency.                 The Iranian journalist who broke the news of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death is still under arrest and awaiting clarification on the charges made against her, according to her husband Mohammad Hossein Ajorloo.                 Niloofar Hamedi, a journalist at Shargh Daily newspaper in Tehran, was assigned to cover Amini’s story, Shargh Daily Community Editor Shahrzad Hemmati said in an op-ed.                 Covering the municipal beat, Hamedi went to Tehran’s Kasra hospital where Amini was being treated and where her family were gathered. She then tweeted a photo on her since-suspended Twitter account of Mahsa’s father and grandmother crying and embracing each other in the halls of the facility. Amini died that same day, September 16.                  A few days later, after protests broke out in outrage over Amini’s death, agents of Iran’s Ministry of Information raided Hamedi’s home and arrested her, saying they had a warrant for her arrest without providing further details, her husband Ajorloo explained on social media.                   “Although they showed us some papers, they did not allow us to read them,” Ajorloo said.                  The agents searched the couple’s home and seized all their electronic devices, including mobile phones and laptops. “Contrary to the law, they did not hand over the second copy of the house inspection report to us,” Ajorloo explained.                 Niloofar was then taken to Evin Prison, where her husband said her case was being investigated. Tehran’s Evin Prison is a notoriously brutal facility where the regime incarcerates political dissidents and is exclusively designated for prisoners managed by Iran’s Intelligence Ministry.                  On October 2, Ajorloo said his wife called him from prison to say that she was out of solitary confinement where she passed the time practicing yoga, but was not allowed to elaborate on her condition any further.                    On her 13th day of incarceration, she told her husband that she was doing well, sharing a cell with eight other female detainees, he shared on social media.                  Ajorloo says that he still has no information about his wife’s case and has no idea if or when she will be released.                   “The frequent calls from Shargh Daily newspaper readers to our editorial office inquiring about Niloofar’s well-being, how they get choked up on the phone line, is a sign that she was the voice of the people,” Shargh editor Hemmati said in her op-ed. Seemingly addressing a court judge she writes, “we are journalists Mr. Judge, allow us to fearlessly and without the fear of being labeled as political, with these laughable yet sad salaries, to be happy that we are relaying the people’s voice.”                   Hemmati ends her piece by saying that journalists are waiting for the day when they can truly believe that they will not be threatened to tell the truth.                  In recent days, Hamedi’s husband has started sharing intimate photos of the couple on his social media, speaking of his longing and concern for his wife.                  “Niloofar always says that we should take pictures of hardships so that we can remember how difficult it was to achieve happiness,” Ajorloo wrote in a tweet sharing a photo of what appears to be the pair camping. “This photo is one of those moments; The night before the climb up Sabalan [mountain], when Niloofar suffered altitude-sickness and I didn’t know what would happen tomorrow,” Ajorloo writes. “These days, however bitter and difficult, will pass, and the day of the great celebration of freedom is coming.      نیلوفر همیشه میگه باید از سختی‌ها هم عکس بگیریم تا یادمون بمونه خوشی‌ها با چه مشقتی به دست اومده.این عکس یکی از همون لحظاته؛ شب قبل از صعود سبلان که نیلوفر ارتفاع‌زده بود و نمی‌دونستم فردا چی میشه.این روزها هم هرچند تلخ و سخت، می‌گذره و روز جشن بزرگ آزادی می‌رسه.#نیلوفر_حامدی pic.twitter.com/bo96fw7cYC             Hamedi has been imprisoned in Evin prison for over 20 days, waiting alongside several other jailed journalists, activists and human rights lawyers who were arrested during the most recent protests.                  Iranian security forces arrested a woman after a photo of her and another woman eating at a Tehran restaurant without their head scarves was widely circulated online, one of the women’s family members said in a statement.                  The photo, which first emerged on social media on September 29, shows two women having breakfast at a type of cafe that, like most coffeehouses in Iran, is traditionally patronized by men.                   One of the women in the photo, Donya Rad, was arrested shortly after the photo was published online. CNN spoke with her sister who said security agencies contacted Donya, summoning her to explain her actions.                    “After visiting the designated place she was arrested, after a few hours of no news, Donya told me in a short call that she was transferred to Ward 209 of Evin Prison,” her sister said in a post on social media.                  Donya’s sister tweeted that her sister was released from prison last Sunday, over a week after she was initially detained. “I am grateful to the friends who understood us and supported us,” she wrote.                  In recent weeks, actions like this – in which women defy religious and cultural norms in Iran – are no longer isolated incidents. Women young and old are seen walking through the streets without their headscarves and in some instances, dancing with their headscarves in their hands.

In an interview with an independent reformist Iranian newspaper, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed that some school students have indeed been detained and referred to what he called “psychological institutions.”                 The establishments holding the students, he said, are meant to reform and reeducate the students to prevent “anti-social” behavior.                 “It is possible these students have become ‘anti-social characters’ and we want to reform them,” he told the Shargh newspaper, adding that the students “can return to class after they’ve been reformed.”     Mother of Nika Shahkarami, teenage protester found dead in Tehran, denies daughter fell from building             Nearly a month ago, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died after being taken to a “reeducation center” by state “morality police” for not abiding by the state’s conservative dress code. Amini’s death has sparked weeks of anti-government protests that have spread across the country.                  The education minister could not put an exact figure on the number of detained students, saying “the number is not a lot and there are not many.”     Girls and women across Iran have played a vital role in the demonstrations, and in recent weeks have protested at schools, university campuses and out on the streets.                  Footage circulated across social media has showed Iranian women and girls chanting “death to the dictator” as they take off their headscarves; on one occasion, CNN witnessed girls from a vocational high school in Tehran protesting on a street near their school and chanting, “woman, life, freedom.”                 The demonstrations have, at times, turned dangerous. Police fired tear gas on protesters in Tehran on Wednesday, and book shops and offices near Tehran University shut their doors as anti-riot police chased and fired rubber bullets on demonstrators, an eyewitness said. In Kaj Square, members of Iran’s Basij paramilitary organization ordered people to move along and stopped others from standing on the streets, according to the eyewitness.                 Videos obtained by the pro-reform activist outlet IranWire posted on social media on Wednesday showed demonstrations across Tehran and other Iranian cities.                 Police and Basij members fired tear gas at the gathering of Iranian lawyers in Tehran, while uniformed and plainclothes police were seen firing weapons in the air in West Tehran, dispersing people from the scene. In one of the busiest shopping streets in the city, riot police were seen gathering. In another, protesters chanted “Mullahs, get lost.”                 Footage from Rasht, northwest of Tehran, showed police wearing riot gear beating people with batons and pulling them from the sidewalk                 On Tuesday, the United Nations’ children’s agency UNICEF called for the protection of children and adolescents amid public unrest in Iran, which is now in its third week.                  “We are extremely concerned by continuing reports of children and adolescents being killed, injured and detained amid the ongoing public unrest in Iran,” read the UNICEF statement.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/opinions/kanye-west-antisemitism-responses-filipovic/index.html,Opinion: These responses to Kanye West are truly frightening,"The impulse among conservatives to use Kanye West’s recent comments as a way of endorsing bigotry and conspiracy theories to their base should concern us much, much more than the question about what to do about West himself, ...","Oct 12, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,: Jill Filipovic,International,"Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.             The appropriate response to Kanye West’s latest intentional bigoted provocations – his antisemitic tweet, his “White Lives Matter” t-shirt – is fairly simple: Condemn the message, and encourage West, who reportedly struggles with mental health issues, to get help and get out of the public eye.                  Instead, the latest West affair has turned into a bizarre way for people across the political spectrum to put on a performance, either as a highly moralistic progressive who paints the world in black and white and good people versus bad, or as a West sympathizer, sending a message (sometimes tacit, in other cases overt) to their followers that they perhaps share West’s hateful sentiments.                  The first group is simplistic and annoying. The second response, though – the conservatives who are using this moment to amplify themselves because they realize that West’s bigotry may well resonate with their followers – is indecent and dangerous.                  West has a long history of misogyny, bigotry and intentional provocation. Just a few days ago, he wore a White Lives Matter shirt at the Yeezy show at Paris Fashion Week, and had several models – plus right-wing commentator Candace Owens – do the same. For that public gesture to White supremacy, he was invited on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show and roundly applauded by a number of Republicans, even after the interview predictably went off the rails.                  During his interview with Carlson, West wore an ultrasound pendant to signal his anti-abortion views. He pointed to abortion and the singer Lizzo’s weight and blamed both for “the genocide of the Black race.” Republicans and conservative talking heads cheered West for “spitting facts” and declared him “a cultural icon.” Opinion: The breathtaking cluelessness of Elon Musk             Just days later, West wrote on both Twitter and Instagram to say, “I’m a bit sleepy but when I wake up I’m going death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE. The funny thing is I actually can’t be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda.”                 That got him restricted on both platforms, and that particular message was deleted. And while most Republicans and conservatives suddenly clammed up after their West lovefest, a few continued to signal their support – including via the GOP House Judiciary’s Twitter account, which had tweeted “Kanye. Elon. Trump” after West’s Fox News interview, and has still refused to delete the tweet despite many calls to do so.      Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who catapulted to right-wing fame after he opened a criminal inquiry into a doctor who helped a pregnant 10-year-old rape victim who needed an abortion, tweeted that “The constant hypocrisy from the media is at an all-time high. They have now gone after Kanye for his new fashion line, his independent thinking, & for having opposing thoughts from the norm of Hollywood.” That was after West’s threat to go “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE.”                  Rokita later claimed that “My post was specifically and clearly aimed at the hypocrisy of the media and Hollywood elites, not anything to do with other comments. I have an obvious, clear and substantial Congressional and public record of being 100% supportive of the Jewish community and Israel.” But at the time he sent out his first tweet defending West on Sunday evening, West’s antisemitic tweet was the primary topic of conversation.      Kanye West on shirt decision: 'Idea of me wearing it was funny'             Candace Owens of the White Lives Matter T-shirt also joined in, saying, “If you are an honest person, you did not think this tweet was antisemitic. If you are an honest person you read this tweet you had no idea what the hell he was talking about.” I’m not sure what kind of “honest person” reads “death con 3 on Jewish people” and doesn’t understand that to be baldly, repulsively anti-Semitic, but Owens also lamented that “It’s like you cannot even say the word ‘Jewish’ without people getting upset.”                  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz couldn’t be bothered to condemn West’s remarks, but did take the opportunity to attack New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because she condemned West’s remarks.                  The left-wing line on West, which amounts to “mental illness does not make you a bigot, only bigots are bigots” is too simplistic and dismissive. Mental illnesses are not all alike, and painting them with a broad brush is silly. No, your anxiety does not make you spout antisemitic conspiracy theories.                  But a small number of serious mental illnesses can indeed make a person delusional, prone to conspiracy theories and extremely vulnerable to latching onto bigoted beliefs as a way of making sense of a world that, because of their mental state, has become unintelligible. Culture can impact those delusions and hallucinations, and it is entirely possible that a person who is not racist or misogynist or antisemitic while in their right mind might latch onto these noxious ideas when they aren’t.                  It’s also possible that a person can be both a bigot and mentally ill.      Opinion: Kim Kardashian gives us a glimpse of how hard it was to be Marilyn Monroe, the star             West didn’t invent antisemitic conspiracy theories, nor the racist claim that Black women who end pregnancies are genocidaires, nor White supremacy. But West’s psychology is honestly the least important part of this story. His words are indefensible, and at this point, so is giving him a platform, money or the attention he craves. Those who know West personally and love him and have his best interests at heart should push him to hit pause, seek help and refrain from public provocations – and perhaps seek out a quiet life away from celebrity and out of the public eye.                  For the rest of us, though, this is more than just a choice between ignoring or condemning. More interesting and important than West himself is how West’s reactionary bigotry has been embraced on the right – and how West has in turn also embraced the same kind of racism and conspiracy-mongering that is increasingly a fixture of today’s profoundly deranged Republican Party.                  Why is it that key figures in the GOP world and their conservative supporters have embraced this grotesquely attention-seeking person spouting dangerous conspiracy theories? That is a question that could be asked in a column about West – but also one about former President Donald Trump, or Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene or Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, or frankly any smattering of Republican politicians, conservative commentators and right-wing celebrities. That is a much more serious and pervasive problem than how to respond to West’s tweets.                  Some in the GOP may well be reticent to disown West, since GOP operatives sought to use him in 2020 to siphon voters away from Biden. But this ongoing right-wing embrace of West is a way to signal to Republican supporters that the now-dominant Trump wing of the GOP believes the outrageous claims that (or is willing to leave silently uncontested) West professes: That women’s bodies should be policed by men; that in response to White police officers killing unarmed Black men and women the appropriate thing to do is to disregard and devalue Black lives and emphasize the greater importance of White ones; and that there is indeed a secretive cabal of shady Jews (or perhaps in more coded terms, a “cosmopolitan elite” or “globalists”) controlling the world and ruining your life – and certainly rigging elections.                  All of that is indefensible – and much more dangerous than a few tweets from a single musician. And the impulse among conservatives to use West’s comments as a way of hinting at their own bigotries should concern us much, much more than the question about what to do about West himself.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

Wolf,International,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.              The Islamic regime in Iran has ruled for decades with fear and intimidation.                  Outrage at the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22 year-old who died after being detained by Iran’s morality policy, allegedly for improperly wearing her hijab, ignited nationwide protests across the country that have gone on for weeks.                  That Iranians are risking their lives and freedom to stand up to their government has sparked hope among many that change is coming. Read CNN’s latest report.                 I talked on the phone to Masih Alinejad, an Iranian in exile in the US who works as a journalist and activist.                 Key points:                 Our conversation, edited for clarity and length, is below. I’ve also added some context and links in parentheses where appropriate.     WHAT MATTERS: This newsletter is not usually focused on Iran. Can you first just explain what’s happening? ALINEJAD: Mahsa Amini was only 22 years old. … She came from Saqqez to Tehran for a vacation. Then she got arrested by the so-called morality police – because I call them the hijab police.                  And for your audience, if they don’t know what morality police means, they’re a bunch of police walking in the streets, telling people whether their way of wearing hijab is proper or not.                  Mahsa was arrested for wearing inappropriate hijab. So she was not unveiled.      (Here is a CNN report in which the Iranian police deny the allegation she was beaten.) ALINEJAD: That created huge anger among Iranians. And that is why women across Iran first started to cut their hair. Then they took to the street and they started to burn their headscarves. And now, with men, shoulder to shoulder, across Iran they’re not only saying no to compulsory hijab, they are actually chanting against the dictator and they are saying we want an end to the Islamic Republic.                  This is a revolution.                  To me, this is a women’s revolution against a gender apartheid regime.     WHAT MATTERS: The Iranian government has tried to crack down on this. We see video that gets out of Iran of these protests. How have things changed in the weeks since Mahsa’s death?  ALINEJAD: From the beginning, the level of crackdown was so brutal. They opened fire, they really opened fire on teenagers, school leaders, university students, they opened fire on unarmed people.                  Now some reports say more than 130 people have been killed. But it’s strongly believed the number is much more than this. Only in Zahedan on only one day, they opened fire on those who were praying. Who were praying. They killed more than 80 people in Zahedan.      (CNN has not verified all of these claims. Related CNN report: Iranian security forces beat, shot and detained students of elite Tehran university, witnesses say. Amnesty International has reported on the killing of 66 in Zahedan along with other deaths recorded in other places.  Regarding death tolls: CNN cannot independently verify the death toll –  a precise figure is impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm – and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists.) ALINEJAD: The Iranian regime cut off the internet in some cities to prevent the rest of the world from getting to know about the crackdown, to get to learn about the number of people killed.                  But again. That didn’t stop people. Actually, it changed the tone of the protesters. They became more angry. They were holding the names and photos of those who got killed and the major slogan was this: ‘We are ready to die, but we won’t live under humiliation.’                  One of the young women whose name was Hadis Najafi, she was only 20 years old. She made a video of herself walking in the street and saying I’m joining the protests. In the future, if I see that Iran has changed, that change came, then I was proudly part of this demonstration. She got killed. There are many of them.      (CNN has reported that Najafi’s family said she was shot six times and never made it home from a protest. She was 23. There are reports of multiple young women killed. Here’s a CNN video report on Nika Shahkarami, whose family found her body at a morgue after not being able to find her for 10 days following an Instagram story of her burning her headscarf.)             Students filmed themselves burning their headscarves, but they got killed. But murdering and killing didn’t stop the protests. Instead they became more angry. Now schoolgirls came out, university professors came out, teachers came out and ask for a strike.     (Here’s a CNN report that explains the special significance of strikes in Iran.) WHAT MATTERS: The flashpoint is one woman’s death that set off all of these protests. But it’s a movement that’s been building for months – ALINEJAD: Don’t say for months. I don’t accept that. It has been building for years. Years of women pushing back the boundaries the anti-woman laws, especially compulsory hijab laws.                  For years and years, these women that you see in the streets, they have been fighting back compulsory hijabs alone. Like lonely soldiers. I myself have published videos of women being beaten by morality police under the hashtag #mycameraismyweapon. I really want you to go and check this hashtag. Brave women filming themselves while being harassed by morality police and looking to the morality police and saying that you cannot tell me what to wear.                 Slavery used to be legal. I’m not going to respect bad law in Iran.                 This is being built up by women within the society practicing their civil disobedience in bravely saying no to forced hijab and the gender apartheid regime for years and years. That’s my opinion. Mahsa’s name became a symbol of resistance for women to take to the streets in large numbers. That’s the new thing.     WHAT MATTERS: How will this be transformed into permanent change? How will it evolve from here?  ALINEJAD: Look, this is not going to happen overnight. This is the beginning of an end. It takes time. It reminds me of the revolution 40 years ago. People were taking to the streets for like one month and were going back home and then coming back again. The national strike helped a lot. For me and millions of people, this is just the beginning to an end.                 The compulsory hijab is not just a small piece of cloth for Iranians. It’s like the Berlin Wall. I keep saying that. If women can successfully tear this wall down, the Islamic Republic won’t exist.                  Maybe in the West, people ignore me and they never take this seriously. But the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, he knows what I’m talking about. That’s why, just two days ago, he referred to my statement comparing the hijab to the Berlin Wall, saying that ‘she is an American agent and we have taken action against her.’      (Alinejad shared this video of Khamenei on Twitter, in which he refers to US political elements making the comparison to the Berlin Wall.) ALINEJAD: But it’s not me. It’s millions of people who believe that compulsory hijab is like the main pillar of the religious dictatorship. It’s like the main pillar of the Islamic Republic.                  That’s why I believe that now people are being fearless and clear that we want to break this weakest pillar of the Islamic Republic… I strongly believe that the biggest threat to the Islamic Republic are the women who are leading the revolution, who are facing guns and bullets and saying that we want an end for this gender apartheid regime.      WHAT MATTERS: In Iran, and we’ve seen this in Russia as well, social media is helping spread the word and is essential to organizing protests. Here in the US, it is often viewed as a threat to our democracy because that’s where misinformation is spread. I wonder if you had any thoughts on that dichotomy. ALINEJAD: Let me be very clear with you. Right now, the tech companies are actually helping the Islamic Republic. First of all, Iranians are banned from using social media – Instagram, Facebook and Twitter are filtered. The leaders like Khamenei and other officials who ban 80 million people from using social media, they all have verified accounts. They have multiple accounts on social media. Basically, the Iranian regime cut off the Internet for its own people, but they’re being more than welcomed on social media to spread fake information, misinformation, disinformation.     (Accounts that appear to be associated with Khamenei are on Twitter and Instagram and have large followings. They are not verified by Instagram or Twitter. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Meta said this in an email: “Iranians use apps like Instagram to stay close to their loved ones, find information and shed light on important events - and we hope the Iranian authorities restore their access soon. In the meantime, our teams are following the situation closely, and are focused on only removing content that breaks our rules, while addressing any enforcement mistakes as quickly as possible.”) WHAT MATTERS: The US government has tried to increase Iranian’s access to the internet. Is that working? ALINEJAD: Oh, of course, this is phenomenal. But we need more. We need more.                 The thing is, at the same time, the US government, we’re pleased that they’re providing internet access for Iranians. This is good. We appreciate that.                  But at the same time, the US government is focused on getting a deal from this regime, the same regime.                  They condemn the brutality, they condemn the Iranian government for killings, but at the same time, they try to give money, billions of dollars, to the same murderers. And I don’t understand this contradiction.      (The US government could give Iran’s government ​access to billions of dollars of frozen Iranian funds if it re-joins an agreement whereby Iran can sell oil in exchange for abandoning nuclear weapons capability. Recent talks, however, have not gone well. Read more.) ALINEJAD: Many people in the streets are now risking their lives and want an end for the same regime. They aren’t asking for US government to go there and save them at all. They’re brave enough to do it themselves. But they’re really clearly asking the US government not to save the Iranian regime. …                 People believe that the money goes to the benefit of the people. It doesn’t go to the people. The money goes to Syria, Lebanon, to Hamas, Hezbollah, to terrorist organizations.                  For millions of Iranians now, this is the moment they want the US government to ask its allies, the European countries, to recall their ambassadors and to cut their ties with the murders until the day that they are sure that the Iranian regime is stopped killing its own people.     (CNN isn’t able to confirm that all the money goes to terrorist organizations or that none of it goes to Iranian people. Iran does fund terror groups outside its borders, according to the US government, and its own Islamic Revolutionary Guard is a terror group, according to the US government.) Swedish politician cuts hair in solidarity with Iranian women WHAT MATTERS: I want to talk about another dichotomy you’ve pointed out. You wrote in The Washington Post that feminists all over the world need to pay attention and take to the streets.  ALINEJAD: You cannot call yourself a feminist in the West, in America, and not take action on one of the most important feminist revolutions, in Iran.                  By saying that, I don’t mean that I want the feminists to just appear on TV and cut their hair to show their solidarity.                  I want, especially the female politicians, to cut their ties … and instead take to the streets to show their solidarity with the women of Iran. When the Women’s March happened here in America, like every single feminist around the world showed solidarity. I was part of the Women’s March in New York. The main slogan was ‘my body my choice.’                  But at the same time I’m witnessing that when it comes to Iran and Afghanistan, it seems that my body my choice is not as important as it is in the West.                  (Here Alinejad said women representing Western governments who meet with Iranian and Afghan officials should refrain from wearing headscarves.)     WHAT MATTERS: You took part this week in an Oslo Freedom Forum event in New York with other dissidents from Russia and Venezuela. Those are two places that are repressive, and they’re also funded largely by oil. The US wants more oil on the market. I just wondered if you had any larger comments to make on this question?  ALINEJAD: This is what’s missing here. The dictators are more united than our freedom fighters.                 Let me give you an example. Just two months ago, (Vladimir) Putin went to Iran. (Nicolás) Maduro from Venezuela went to Iran … from China to Russia to Venezuela to Nicaragua, everywhere. The leaders from autocracies and dictatorships are united. They’re helping each other. They’re supporting each other to oppress protests taking place in each country. But we the freedom fighters, we the opposition to these dictators must be united as well, because when we fight against autocracy or dictatorship on our own, we’re not going to be successful.                 (Alinejad said she has talked to dissidents from Russia and Venezuela about calling a World Liberty Congress for opposition and activist leaders.)     ALINEJAD: If we don’t get united to end dictatorship, then the dictators will get united to end democracy. We’re not fighting just for ourselves. I’m not fighting just for Iran. Garry Kasparov is not fighting for just Russia. Leopoldo Lopez is not fighting just for Venezuela. We are fighting for democracy. We’re trying to protect the rest of the world from these dictators.     (Our conversation continued from here and Alinejad argued the “United Nations is useless.” It’s true the United Nations prioritizes inclusion of most countries over action. And it is awkward at best that Iran sits on the UN’s Commission on Women’s Rights and Russia sits on the Security Council.) ALINEJAD: We need to have our own alternative United Nations, where all the good people get united, not the bad guys. Now the bad guys are winning because they’re helping each other. So this is the time that all the good people who care for freedom and democracy get united and have their own society.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Her death has sparked violent clashes between demonstrators and authorities, reportedly leaving scores dead.                 The uprising has received considerable attention in the Western press, especially as the fundamentalist Islamic regime has cracked down on the demonstrations with brute force.                 But as protesters surge through the streets of Iran, Western news organizations largely aren’t filing stories from the authoritarian-led country that has curtailed the free press, jailed journalists, and shut down the Internet. NBC News does have a correspondent in Tehran (kudos to them), but because of logistical issues and security concerns, the vast majority of Western outlets do not maintain a presence in the country. Most datelines on stories are from the nearby region, outside Iran. The Associated Press and Reuters, for example, are filing stories about the unrest from Dubai.     A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.             Western news organizations are largely relying on networks of contacts, groups like Amnesty International, a student-run news agency, as well as social media reports for information. CNN’s stories notably state that the network has “not been able to independently verify the number of the dead and injured.”                 Pouria Mahrouyan, a senior editor at BBC News Persian who oversees the social media and interactive team, said that because the news organization has no reporters in Iran, they are “largely relying on social media and user-generated-content” each day.                  But doing so doesn’t come without risk. Of particular concern, Mahrouyan said, some videos posted to social media sites are part of a government disinformation campaign. “They have a cyber army and they massively produce social media videos, even fake interviews,” Mahrouyan said of the Iranian regime. The government, he said, has also attempted to set traps to manipulate Western media into reporting falsehoods: “They can then say foreign media is reporting fake news.”                 While the Iranian government is seeking to manipulate the conversation outside its borders, it is simultaneously using its state-controlled television and radio apparatus to control the narrative inside the country.                 Trita Parsi, a prominent Iran expert, said the outlets have worked to “downplay the protests, ignore the protests, or cast them as a conspiracy.” Amir Hossein Mahdavi, another Iran expert, said state-controlled media is “depicting these events” in the same way the country’s supreme leader has: “Initiated by the outside, by the CIA and Mossad.”                  Recent stories from Fars News Agency and Press TV, which both publish and broadcast in English, have breathlessly echoed the deceptions pushed by the country’s government.                 But the regime’s attempts to control the narrative has faced setbacks. “There is a massive amount of people who have access to satellite dishes and getting their news from the outside,” Parsi explained. “It’s not like they are only relying only on Iranian news outlets, which they take with a grain of salt.”                 In fact, BBC Persian is one of the most influential sources of information for those inside Iran. Mahrouyan noted the outlet’s Instagram account has one of the largest followings within Persian media, boasting 18.6 million followers.                 “The ability of the state,” Parsi said, “to be able to push their narrative has been significantly weakened.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/golf/muslim-golf-association-amir-malik-spc-intl/index.html,Amir Malik is on a drive to make golf more inclusive for Muslims,The UK’s Muslim Golf Association is proving a hit with both men and women.,"Oct 6, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Jack Bantock,International,"Amir Malik is a man in love with golf. Yet golf has not always loved him back.                 A devoted sports fan since his childhood in Kingston upon Thames, London, he was fascinated with golf long before he took his first swing. But knowing nobody else who played, Malik settled for a sideline view.                 That all changed in 2012, when his former boss invited him to try his hand at a driving range.                 “From the first ball I thought, ‘This is it. This game is incredible,’” Malik, now aged 38, told CNN.                 “I’ve played a lot of sports, but there aren’t too many when you go to bed thinking about it and you can’t wait to get up to go back and play again.”                 Eventually, Malik was ready to take his game to the next level. Joining a municipal club in 2017, he began competing in Sunday morning tournaments.                 It was at these events that the “ugly side” of the game was swiftly revealed to Malik, who felt isolated by the jarring clash of club culture and his Muslim faith.                  The discomfort would begin before a ball was struck, as Malik says he drew questioning looks at his refusal to partake in wagers over in-house competitions, as gambling is forbidden in Islam. Out on the course, stepping aside to observe salat – ritual Islamic prayers performed five times a day – further heightened his anxieties.                 “You would feel scared, intimidated. How are people going to react?” he recalled.                 “We always made sure we were out of the way, but you were made to feel very, very uncomfortable.”                  His unease was exacerbated by the commonplace tradition of clubhouse drinking after competitions. As Malik doesn’t drink alcohol, he was left to hand in his scorecard and make an early exit.                  As he improved and played more prestigious courses, discomfort often escalated into outright hostility. Malik, who is of Pakistani descent, said he has experienced racism on the golf course.                  “You turn up and immediately you can feel the vibe and the atmosphere, the way you’re spoken to, the way you’re treated,” he said.                 “And you’re just like ‘Wow, just because I’ve got a beard, I’m brown, and I don’t look like you, you probably think I can’t play or you don’t think I know the etiquette.                 “It used to really frustrate me because you sense it, you feel it, you grow up in it, you know what it feels like. And it’s not until you hit one straight down the middle of the fairway – when you’ve smoked a drive – that people then think, ‘Oh, he can play,’ and it’s too late by then.”                 Malik’s passion for golf was not soured by his experiences. On the contrary, they spurred him to scout out other British Muslims who shared his love of the game.                 Encouraged by “pockets” of interest he had seen on his travels, in December 2019 Malik put a name to his new venture – the Muslim Golf Association (MGA) – and sent out invitations to a charity golf day at The Grove, a prestigious venue just outside London.                  The MGA’s maiden event would be open to all religions; prayer facilities would be provided and there would be no alcohol or gambling. Malik was stunned by the response. Within 24 hours, all 72 places had been booked, with over 100 people on the waiting list by the week’s end.                  The event, held in August 2020, raised £18,000 for charity, and the sight of over 60 players praying together in the Grove’s courtyard marked a watershed moment for Malik.                 “That for me was just amazing,” he said. “That we could get guys together, feeling safe and comfortable and just be on our own platform.”                 Since then, the MGA has partnered with the Marriott hotel chain to stage a tri-series tournament beginning in 2021, with the winners of this year’s edition securing an all-expenses paid trip to the Turkish golfing paradise of Belek.                 “I looked at golf and thought, it’s a sport played by White, old, rich men, period,” Malik said. “We’ve now got an opportunity to actually show the world that non-Whites can play this game and we’re pretty damn good at it.”                 The overwhelming response to MGA events among Muslim women has been equally exciting for Malik. After launching a trio of pilot sessions in Birmingham last year, 1,000 players have already signed up to the string of women-only taster events scheduled across the country over the next two months.                   Malik believes Muslim women in the UK are being held back from participating in more sports because of a lack of all-female facilities and sessions.                 The MGA has no dress code, which means women can play in a niqab (face veil) and an abaya (long robe) if they wish, and it hires sections of courses for its exclusive use for taster events, to ensure a comfortable experience for new players.                  “The response has been absolutely incredible, mindblowing,” Malik said. “I say to women, ‘I don’t care what you wear, what you look like, just come with a smile and with a pair of trainers and we’ll take care of everything else.’ We’ve not done anything revolutionary, we’ve just made it accessible, and the demand is incredible.”                 To date, MGA events have attracted over 1,300 participants. Looking forward, the organization aims to take its efforts global to reach as many new players as possible.                 Growing up, Malik had to look to other sports for Muslim role models, such as England cricketer Moeen Ali. From Muhammad Ali, to Kareem Abdul-Jabaar, to Mohamed Salah, countless Muslim athletes have carved out glittering careers across a range of sports, yet professional golf offers a comparative scarcity of examples.                 According to a survey cited by England Golf, the country’s governing body for amateur golf, just 5% of golfers in England are from ethnically diverse groups.                 By establishing relationships with groups such as the MGA, England Golf’s chief operating officer Richard Flint believes the barriers that have contributed to a lack of diversity in the game can be understood and broken down.                 “No-one should feel uncomfortable walking through the doors of a golf club or facility simply because of their age, race, ethnicity or gender,” Flint told CNN.                 “As a modern, forward-thinking organization, we want golf to be open to everyone and change negative perceptions around the game that belong in the past.”                 While Malik hopes to soon see Muslim players competing on professional tours, he says he did not form the MGA to produce a Muslim Tiger Woods.     Meet 'Snappy Gilmore,' the viral TikTok sensation reinventing the golf swing              “If that happens as a byproduct, then great,” he said. “But if we can get the golf industry to take a long, hard look at itself and make itself accessible, make itself open and diverse, then that’s a huge achievement.                 “The golf course doesn’t discriminate. The ball doesn’t ask what color, race or gender you are … yet it’s been a very closed club that’s been open to very few people.                 Malik believes it’s time for change. “Golf has a lot of exceptional values and traditions, which I still think it needs to keep firm, but it has to evolve … if it were to open itself up and let other cultures and traditions bring all that great stuff to this game, it could be absolutely wonderful.”       This story has been updated to clarify England Golf’s relationship with the MGA. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             As anti-government protests enter their third week in Iran, the Islamic Republic has imposed a near total blackout of independent information coming out of the country.                  A fierce battle to control the narrative is now being fought online, where supporters and opponents of the government alike are taking to social media to tell their version of the truth and, in some cases, go beyond the truth.                   With access to Twitter blocked in Iran, that battle is primarily being fought outside the country.                  “It is normal for people to rush to social media when protests break out… It has happened in Iran and the Arab world,” said Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor at Qatar’s Hamad Bin Khalifa University who specializes in digital disinformation. “But the scale here seems quite substantial.”                  Protests aren’t new to Iran, and neither are internet blackouts. What’s changing, say experts, is the sophistication of those trying to get their message across.                   The protests started following the death of 22- year-old Mahsa Amini after she was detained by the Islamic Republic’s “morality police,” sparking outrage among Iranians who took to the streets to demand more freedoms.                  A hashtag with her name has garnered 52 million tweets, said Jones, who has analyzed pro- and anti-regime activity on Twitter. Some of those tweets, he said, suggest there may be coordinated manipulation campaigns at play, possibly including bots.                   Bots are social media accounts controlled by software, not real people, that are designed to promote certain topics.                  He told CNN that an analysis of those tweeting the hashtags associated with the protests showed “a striking number of new accounts created” since the protests started.                  Of the 108,000 accounts in a sample using #OpIran, another hashtag associated with the protests, he found that around 13,000 were created in September, while the average number of accounts created per month in the sample was only 500.  Most of the September accounts were created in around 10 days following Amini’s death, he said.                  “It’s quite rare to see this amount of new online mobilization of accounts that then subsequent and continuously engage in tweet activity,” he said, adding that while this indicates manipulation, it isn’t conclusive evidence of it.      I want to share some of the iconic imagery and music from the protests in Iran and around the world. Singer Shervin Hajipour's song ""Baraye"" brings up grievances such as the economy and a lack of women's rights in his country. It has now been removed from Hajipour's account. pic.twitter.com/WZOmh7CPUR             Asked to comment on the matter, Twitter referred CNN to its policy of “taking robust and proactive action against violating content” where evidence of coordinated inauthentic activity is detected.                  The creation of new accounts “is a repeated hallmark of dis- and misinformation actors… [who] participate in the conversation to push a narrative,” said Steph Shample, a non-resident scholar with the Middle East Institute’s Cyber Program. Content from such accounts is not trustworthy, she said.                  Maziar Bahari, editor of IranWire, a pro-reform activist outlet, says there are many ways to verify content on social media, “but in a chaotic, angry situation it’s impossible to expect every member of the public to try and fact check, especially if those exaggerated reports have roots in the reality.”                  Bahari said there have been several cases of fake news successfully being portrayed as reality from both sides. “After every protest, the government shows confiscated firearms from archives or taken from common criminals and attributes it to their critics,” he told CNN. There are also cases of social media users exaggerating reports of killings and sexual violence by the security forces, he said.                  The harm comes “more when important public figures, such as politicians or educators, retweet the false narratives of controlling countries and their politicians,” said Shample.                  Any account on any social media platform that is successfully posting pro-Iranian government material while most of the country is cut off from those services is suspect, she said. “It is very, very dangerous to take things at face value anymore.”                  So, who’s behind all the Twitter activity around #MahsaAmini?                   Since Twitter is blocked in Iran, Jones suggests that the large Iranian diaspora may be mobilizing to keep her story alive, but other interests may also be at play.                   “We also know there are a number of people with stakes in trying to see regime change in Iran, from right-wing hawks in US and Israel, to the MeK,” he said, referring to Mujahideen-e-Khalq, an Albania-based Iranian dissident group. “The MeK certainly have been active in social media manipulation prior to the [death of] Mahsa Amini.”                  Shample suggests that the government itself could be behind some of the anti-regime tweets in an effort to track those who support the movement.       The US says it's helping Iranians navigate a massive internet blackout. Activists say it's too little, too late             The war of narratives between opposing parties on social media isn’t new. Twitter regularly removes accounts it says are tied to the Iranian government that engage in coordinated manipulation. Last year, Facebook removed hundreds of fake accounts linked to a troll farm in Albania that it said were linked to the MeK. The group was removed from the US terror list in 2012.                   Facebook describes troll farms as a “physical location where a collective of operators share computers and phones to jointly manage a pool of fake accounts as part of an influence operation.”                  Neither the MeK, which also goes by the name People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, or the Iranian foreign ministry respondedto CNN’s requests for comment.                   The Iranian government has time and again blamed foreign conspiracies aimed at spreading false news about the situation in Iran. But Bahari says the disinformation and foreign exploitation of the protests don’t discredit a movement that has genuine demands for change.                  “Disinformation has existed as long as movements have existed,” he said. “But the advent of social media means that [it] can spread more quickly… when movements are popular and have roots in people’s aspirations for change, disinformation is just a nuisance.”       OPEC+ agrees on a 2 million bpd cut in oil output, defying US pressure              OPEC+ on Wednesday agreed on a 2 million barrel per day output cut, defying a pressure campaign by the US for the cartel not to make such a drastic reduction. The cut was the biggest since the Covid-19 pandemic and was twice as much as analysts had expected.

Ahmed said in a TV interview that the video was filmed spontaneously early in the morning by his friend.                   Ahmed’s lyrics are barely comprehensible to English or Arabic speakers.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/middleeast/iran-protests-regime-intl/index.html,A barrier of fear has been broken in Iran. The regime may be at a point of no return,"Iran’s latest protests transcend Iran’s many social and ethnic divisions, breaking a decades-old barrier of fear and posing an unprecedented threat to the regime.","Oct 5, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Jomana Karadsheh,International,"A woman dressed in black raises a framed portrait of her son, Siavash Mahmoudi, in the air as she paces the sidewalk in Iran’s capital, Tehran. “I am not scared of anyone. They told me to be silent. I will not be,” the woman seen in a viral social media video yells, her voice fraught with emotion.                   “I will carry my son’s picture everywhere. They killed him.”                 Mahmoudi’s mother is among many Iranians who claim the regime tried to silence them as they mourned loved ones slain in ongoing nationwide demonstrations.              But Iran’s protesters, and their supporters, are defiant. For weeks, a nationwide protest movement has relentlessly gathered momentum and appears to have blunted the government’s decades-old intimidation tactics. Slogans against the clerical leadership echo throughout the city. Videos of schoolgirls waving their headscarves in the air as they sing protest songs in classrooms have gone viral, as have images of protesters fighting back against members of the formidable paramilitary group Basij.        The US says it's helping Iranians navigate a massive internet blackout. Activists say it's too little, too late             These are scenes previously believed to be unthinkable in Iran, where the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei rules with an iron fist. But experts say that these protests transcend Iran’s many social and ethnic divisions, breaking a decades-old barrier of fear and posing an unprecedented threat to the regime.                 Across Iran, protesters seem intent on exposing the weaknesses of a clerical establishment which is widely accused of corruption and has stamped out dissent with arbitrary detentions and even mass executions.                 Tehran has been convulsing with demonstrations since the death in mid-September of Mahsa (also known as Zhina) Amini, the 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman who died after being detained by the country’s morality police for how she was dressed.                 Protests crop up sporadically in various parts of the capital throughout each day. At night, a chant that has become a staple of the protests — “death to the dictator” — sounds from the rooftops of buildings. It’s a reference to Khamenei, who was once considered beyond reproach because of his elevated clerical status.                  Anti-regime demonstrations have also penetrated the Islamic Republic’s power bases, including the Shia holy cities of Mashhad and Qom. Ethnic minorities — notably Kurds in the country’s north and northwest, and Baloch people in the southeast — have also staged protests, enduring what appear to be some of the most brutal crackdowns, with scores reportedly killed.                  Secondary schools and universities around the country are flashpoints, and women and girls have been taking off their mandatory headscarves, known as hijabs.                   “These terrorists think that our generation is the previous generation. We are not. Let me assure you,” a protester from Tehran’s prestigious Sharif University of Technology told CNN, referring to Iranian police who had violently cracked down on demonstrators on campus, and detained scores of young people.       'It was a warzone.' Iranian security forces beat, shot and detained students of elite Tehran university, witnesses say, as crackdown escalates             Social media video showed cars filling the streets shortly after news spread Sunday of the crackdown on students, horns blaring in solidarity with protesters as the showdown unfolded at the university, known for educating Iran’s best and brightest students.                  “If the dust settles and we stop protesting, they are going to kill even more of us. They are going to detain even more people and they are going to turn us to North Korea,” the impassioned protester said. “This is not the end. I promise you that.”                   CNN has not been able to independently verify the number of the dead and injured, but state media says 40 people have died since the start of demonstrations in mid-September. Rights group Amnesty International says at least 52 have been killed. Over 1,000 people are believed to have been detained, including journalists and artists.                  Last week, Amnesty International said it had obtained a leaked document which appeared to instruct commanders of armed forces in all provinces to “mercilessly confront” protesters, deploying riot police as well as some members of the military’s elite Revolutionary guards, the Basij paramilitary force and plainclothes security agents.                   CNN has not seen the leaked documents obtained by Amnesty International and cannot verify the reporting. CNN has reached out to Amnesty International on how it received the leaked documents but hasn’t received a reply.                  CNN has also reached out to Iranian government officials for a comment on Amnesty International’s reporting but hasn’t received a reply.                    In addition, Amnesty International said it had seen evidence of sexual assault against female protesters – CNN has not been able to verify this. Social media video has also shown Iranian security forces dragging unveiled women through the streets by their hair.                   The threat posed by these protests, analysts say, is existential to the regime, and is one of the biggest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced in years.                  “These are primarily very, very young people, a younger generation who have apparently completely lost faith that this Islamic Republic can be reformed,” said Trita Parsi, executive vice-president at the Washington, DC-based Quincy Institute.                  “They’re breaking from their previous generation who was seeking to reform the system from within,” Parsi added. “This new generation seems to not have any faith in that at all.”                 The 83-year-old Khamenei, who commented on the protests for the first time on Monday, blamed – without evidence – the United States and Israel for fueling the protests. He also made clear that the regime would block the protesters’ desire for change.                     “I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by the US and the occupying, false Zionist regime (Israel), as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad,” said Khamenei in his address.                   The current protests may eventually be quashed or simply lose momentum, but analysts say Iran can expect another cycle of nationwide demonstrations in months to come. The latest demonstrations follow similar, but less widespread, protests against the government in 2019, 2017 and 2009.                    “The protests transcend social sectarian boundaries, bringing together a much broader strata of Iranian society than we have seen in years,” said Ali Vaez, director of the International Crisis Group’s Iran Project. “But they suffer from the same shortcomings that the previous movements in Iran also suffered from. Primarily, the lack of leadership.                  “It’s very difficult to be able to maintain and sustain a movement that over the long run will bring the regime to its knees without coordination and leadership,” Vaez said.                  Still, the protesters appear bolder than ever, sensing a window of opportunity that could quickly close as Iran appears to near development of a nuclear weapon, which would both entrench the regime’s grip on power and deepen its isolation.                  This is the scenario that anti-regime Iranians are trying desperately to avoid, said Vaez.                  “The only thing worse than a regime that kills and represses its own people is a regime with a nuclear weapon and that kills and represses its own people,” he said.

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             On Sunday, almost by accident, two groups of demonstrators came together in London. One was waving Ukrainian flags; the other Iranian flags. When they met, they cheered each other, and chanted, “All together we will win.”                  The uprising in Iran and the war in Ukraine are, on the surface, very different conflicts. At their core, however, they are being fought by individuals who have decided to risk their lives, to do what it takes to defend their right to live as they choose; to push back against violent, entrenched dictatorships.                  For decades autocrats have been gaining ground while democracies looked almost spent, in retreat. Now suddenly, when we least expected, a ferocious pushback against two of the most brazen tyrannies has burst into view. In Ukraine and in Iran, the people have decided to defy the odds for the sake of their dignity, freedom and self-determination.                 These David v. Goliath battles show bravery that is almost unimaginable to the rest of us – and is inspiring equally courageous support in places like Afghanistan.                  The consequences could prove far reaching.                 In Iran, the spark was the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini last month. Known as “Zhina,” she died in the custody of morality police who detained her for breaking the relentlessly, violently enforced rules requiring women to dress modestly.                  In scenes of exhilarated defiance, Iranian women have danced around fires in the night, shedding the hijab – the headcover mandated by the regime – and tossing it into the flames.                 Their peaceful uprising is not really about the hijab; it’s about cutting the shackles of oppression, which is why men have joined them in large numbers, even as the regime kills more and more protesters.                  It’s why women are climbing on cars, waving their hijab in the air, like a flag of freedom, and gathering crowds of supporters in city streets, and in universities, where security forces are opening fire to try and silence them.                 It’s why even elderly women have joined in; why regime brutality has so far proven incapable of snuffing out this rebellion.                 If the prospects for success in Iran’s “Women, life, freedom!” uprising look dim, consider what the prognosis was for Ukraine when what was supposed to be one of the world’s mightiest military forces set out to seize their country.                  After all, it was less than a decade ago that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military entered Syria’s long civil war, helping to save the dictator Bashar al-Assad (as Iran had).                  Putin had built up his forces and thought he could conquer democratic, neighboring Ukraine in a few days. Even US intelligence predicted Russia would capture the capital, Kyiv, in a matter of days, if not hours. That’s why the US reportedly offered to evacuate Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to safety just after Russian forces moved in. But Zelensky refused.                  As Washington warned that Zelensky was a “prime target for Russian aggression,” the Ukrainian president sent a message to his country and to the rest of the world, vowing to stay.                 “We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend all of this.” He concluded, “That is it. That’s all I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”                 A little over seven months later, Russia’s trajectory looks like a trail of war crimes, with hundreds of bombed hospitals, schools, civilian convoys, and mass graves filled with Ukrainians.                  And still Ukraine is pushing ahead, is doing very well in fact, and very possibly winning this war.                  Western support and weaponry have proven key, but the indispensable element in Ukrainians’ success to date is the spirit of their fight. Like the women in Iran, they occupy the moral high ground. They are fighting for their lives, for their freedom. The other side is fighting for power and control over others.                 Because they hold the moral high ground, the struggles of the Ukrainian and the Iranian people have inspired support around the globe among backers of democracy and human rights. In this era of social media, their anthems against fascism have gone viral, as has the brutality of their foes.                  The repressive regimes in Moscow and Tehran are now isolated, pariahs among much of the world, openly supported for the most part by a smattering of autocrats.                 Is it any wonder that Putin’s first trip outside the former Soviet Union since the start of his Ukraine war was to Iran? Is it any wonder Iran has trained Russian forces and is now believed to have provided Russia with advanced drones to kill Ukrainians?                 These are two regimes that, while very different in their ideologies, have much in common in their tactics of repression and their willingness to project power abroad.             These are two regimes that, while very different in their ideologies, have much in common in their tactics of repression and their willingness to project power abroad.             Frida Ghitis                  They both pretend to be democracies. But there’s no genuine choice about who holds power and who makes the rules.                 Iran’s prisons are filled with regime critics and courageous journalists – including Niloofar Hamedi, first to report what happened to Mahsa Amini. In Russia as well, journalism is a deadly profession. So is criticizing Putin. After trying and failing to kill opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Putin’s people manufactured charges to keep him in a penal colony indefinitely.                 Multiple Putin critics have suffered mysterious deaths. Many have fallen out of windows. And both Iran and Russia have become leading practitioners of transnational repression, killing critics on foreign soil, according to Freedom House and other democracy research and advocacy groups.                    Moscow and Tehran have sought to foment their ideologies beyond their borders. That’s why the struggles of the Ukrainian and Iranian people will have repercussions beyond their countries.                  For people in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, there’s more than passing interest in the admittedly low probability that the Iranian regime could fall. It would be transformative for their countries and their lives, heavily influenced by Tehran. After all, Iran’s constitution calls for spreading its Islamist revolution.                   For people living in autocracies supported by Putin, the Ukrainian war could change everything at home.                 For the rest of the world, it’s a time of uncertainty and expectation. Seven months ago, some viewed Putin as something of a genius. That myth has turned to dust. The man who helped suppress uprisings, entered wars, and tried to manipulate elections across the planet now looks cornered.                  Nobody knows what happens next. No one knows how all this ends. As the people in Ukraine and Iran fight for their freedom, for self-determination, the world stands at an inflection point.

Meanwhile, the IRGC, the elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country’s revolution in 1979, has asked all people to identify protesters, the country’s semi-official news agency Fars News said.                 Thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets in protest since the death last week of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was apprehended in Tehran and taken to a “re-education center,” apparently for not wearing her hijab properly.                   Since Friday, demonstrations have taken place in at least 40 cities nationwide, including the capital Tehran, with protesters demanding an end to violence and discrimination against women as well as an end to compulsory wearing of the hijab.                 At least 1,200 have been arrested in connection to the protests, Iranian state-backed news agency Tasmin reported Saturday, citing a security official.                 Dozens of protesters have reportedly been killed in the resulting clashes with security forces.                  CNN cannot independently verify the death toll –  a precise figure is impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm – and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists. Amnesty International said Friday that at least 30 people, including four children, had died; according to state media the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, 35 people have died.                 The demonstrations have also seen journalists targeted by authorities, with at least 17 arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit that monitors press freedom.                 Meanwhile, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has asked all people to identify protesters, the country’s semi-official news agency Fars News said.                 The IRCG is the elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country’s revolution in 1979.                 Authorities hope that by restricting the internet they can control the protests – the latest in a wave that has swept Iran in recent years. They started with the Green movement in 2009 over contested election results and more recently the 2019 protests sparked by a rise in fuel prices. Hundreds were believed to have been killed in the violent crackdown three years ago and thousands injured, according to estimates released by the UN and rights groups.                  But this year’s protests are different – in their scope, scale and unprecedented feminist nature. There is also mobilization across the socio-economic divide. A young generation of Iranians are rising up on the streets against decades of repression – arguably bolder than ever.                  The demonstrations have spread to dozens of Iranian cities, from the Kurdish region in the northwest, to the capital Tehran and even more traditionally conservative cities like Mashhad.                  While they were ignited by the death of Amini, the initial calls for accountability have turned into demands for more rights and freedoms, especially for women who for decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have faced discrimination and severe restrictions on their rights.                  But calls for regime change are growing too. People across the country are chanting for “death to the dictator,” in a reference to the Supreme Leader, tearing down portraits of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Remarkable images emerged on Friday night from Khamenei’s birthplace in the city of Mashhad, where protesters set fire to the statue of a man considered one of the symbols of the Islamic Revolution. Such scenes were unthinkable in the past.                  This is all happening at a time when Iran’s hardline leadership is under growing pressure with talks to revive the stalled 2015 nuclear agreement and the state of the economy under US sanctions; ordinary Iranians are struggling to cope with soaring levels of inflation.                 While these protests are the biggest challenge for the government for years, analysts believe the government will likely move to contain them by resorting to the heavy-handed tactics it has used in the past. There are signs a brutal crackdown is coming, along with the internet restrictions on a level not seen since 2019. Other measures include the government mobilizing its supporters in mass rallies following Friday prayers; officials dismissing the demonstrators as rioters and foreign agents, and ominous warnings the army and powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will be deployed to deal with the protests.                  Speaking with state broadcaster IRIB on Friday, Iran’s Minister of Communications Ahmad Vahidi said, “Until the riots end, the internet will have limitations. To prevent riot organization through social media, we are obliged to create internet limitations.”                 Vahidi’s comments came after videos on social media showed scenes of public defiance, with women removing and burning their headscarves and demonstrators chanting such slogans as, “women, life, freedom.”                 The move to further restrict the internet also followed a call by the United Nations for an independent investigation into Amini’s death and for Iran’s security forces to refrain from using  “disproportionate force” on the protesters.                 Outrage over Amini’s death comes from public skepticism over the account given by state officials, who claim she died after suffering a “heart attack” and fell into a coma. But Amini’s family have said she had no pre-existing heart condition.     Iranians are risking it all to protest. Their families say some of them aren't coming home             Amini’s death has now become a symbol of the violent oppression women have faced in Iran for decades, and her name has spread around the globe, with world leaders invoking her even at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City this week.                 The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday said UN experts strongly condemned the use of physical violence against women in Iran by state authorities.                 “Iranian authorities said (Amini) died of a heart attack, and claimed her death was from natural causes. However, some reports suggested that Amini’s death was a result of alleged torture and ill-treatment,” it said in a statement.                 “We call on the Iranian authorities to hold an independent, impartial, and prompt investigation into Ms Amini’s death, make the findings of the investigation public and hold all perpetrators accountable,” it added.                 The internet monitoring agency Netblocks said Friday Iranians are facing a third wave of “nation-scale” loss of mobile internet connectivity as the protests continue.                  The watchdog group said earlier in the week that Iran was experiencing the most severe internet restrictions since 2019, with mobile networks largely shutdown and social networks Instagram and WhatsApp restricted in the country since protests began.                 To circumvent internet blocks, Iranians both inside the country and in the diaspora are turning to popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers such as Tor Project and Hula VPN – the top downloaded apps available in Iran via Google Play Store, a marketplace for Android smartphone users to download apps, according to monitoring service AppBrain.                 However, Netblocks has warned that the kind of internet disruption seen currently in the country “cannot generally be worked around with the use of circumvention software or VPNs.”                  Similar internet restrictions took place in Iran in November 2019, taking Iranians almost entirely offline as authorities tried to curb the spread of nationwide protests over fuel prices.                  Oracle’s Internet Intelligence called it at the time the “largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran.”                 Meanwhile, Internet activist hacker group Anonymous has also targeted the Iranian government online over the past week, announcing several breaches of government websites on Thursday.                  Using the hashtag #OpIran, short for Operation Iran, which started gaining traction on social media following the death of Amini, Anonymous also tweeted Thursday that the organization was successful in hacking more than 1,000 CCTV Iranian cameras – a claim CNN has not been able to independently confirm.                  UN Secretary General António Guterres said Friday he was “concerned about reports of peaceful protests being met with excessive use of force leading to dozens of deaths and injuries.”                  “We call on the security forces to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force and appeal to all to exercise restraint to avoid further escalation,” Dujarric said at the daily briefing on UNTV.                  The UN said it’s closely following the protests in Iran and called on authorities to “respect the right to freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association.”                 “We also call on the authorities to respect women’s rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and implement effective measures to protect them from other human rights violations, in accordance with international standards.”                  Guterres reiterated a call from the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights for a prompt investigation into the death of Amini by an “independent competent authority.”                  Iran’s Interior Minister denied Mahsa Amini was beaten up, citing investigations into the incident, the country’s state news agency, IRNA, reported Saturday.                 “The results of observations, talking with those who were on the scene, receiving reports from relevant bodies and other investigations showed that late Ms. Amini was not beaten, Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi told (Iran’s state broadcaster) IRIB,” IRNA reported.                 Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called Amini’s family saying he had ordered the incident to be investigated carefully so that no rights would be violated, according to IRNA. He said during his trip to the UNGA in New York last week that early coroner’s findings found no signs of beating.                 After returning to Iran follow his trip to the UNGA in New York, Raisi also called the family of a Basij member, a volunteer paramilitary group connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed during protests in Mashhad, according to his official website.                 In the statement released by his office, Raisi expressed his condolences to the family of Rasool Doust Mohammadi, the Basij member, and said there is a “need to distinguish between protest and disruption of public order and security,” while also describing the protests “as rioting and evil.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The sea of people, many of them men, roar as she chops off her ponytail and raises her fist in the air.                 It was a powerful act of defiance Tuesday night in the Iranian city of Kerman, where women are required to wear hijabs (or headscarves) in public, as outrage over the death of a woman in police custody fuels protests across the country.                 Iranian authorities said Wednesday that three people, including a member of the security forces, have been killed in the unrest, which has stretched into a fifth day.                 Human rights groups have reported that at least seven people have been killed.                 The death last week of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested in Tehran by morality police – a dedicated unit that enforces strict dress codes for women, such as wearing the compulsory headscarf – has sparked an outpouring anger over issues ranging from freedoms in the Islamic Republic to the crippling economic impacts of sanctions.     Iran's morality police have terrorized women for decades. Who are they?              The protests are striking for their scale, ferocity and rare feminist nature; the last demonstrations of this size were three years ago, after the government hiked gas prices in 2019.                  After starting Saturday at Amini’s funeral in Iran’s Kurdistan province, the demonstrations have swept much of the country, leading to clashes with security forces trying to quell them.                  Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made no mention of the protests during a speech on Wednesday to veterans and military commanders commemorating the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988.                 The prosecutor in the western city of Kermanshah said two people were killed during “riots” on Tuesday, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The official IRNA state news agency said a police “assistant” was killed and four others injured during protests in Shiraz, the capital city of Fars province in southwestern Iran.                  A 23-year-old in Urmia and a 16-year-old in Piranshahar were shot dead during protests on Tuesday, bringing the total number of demonstrators killed to seven, according to two Kurdish human rights groups monitoring violations in Iran – Kurdistan Human Rights Network and Hengaw, a Norwegian-registered organization.                   Iranian authorities did not confirm the deaths.                 Thousands took to the streets Tuesday night, with videos of protests emerging from dozens of towns and cities – ranging from the capital Tehran to more traditionally conservative strongholds like Mashad.                 Footage shows some protesters chanting, “Women, life, freedom.” Others can be seen setting up bonfires, scuffling with police, or removing and burning their headscarves – as well as destroying posters of the country’s Supreme Leader and shouting, “Death to the dictator.”                 In one video in Tehran, young protesters march around a bonfire on the street at night, chanting: “We are the children of war. Come on and fight, and we’ll fight back.”     Five people killed in Iran in protests over death of woman in police custody, human rights group says             Almost all the provincial towns in Iran’s Kurdish region, including Kermanshah and Hamedan, have seen demonstrations as well.                 Witnesses tell CNN that the Tuesday night demonstrations appeared to be “flash protests” – meaning groups form and disperse quickly, to avoid run-ins with Iran’s security forces after the escalating violence of the last week.                  A source said there was at least one instance of a heavy-handed police response on Tuesday, near Iran’s Enghelab (“Revolution”) Square on the western side of Tehran University – historically a rallying point for protests.                  “Two young men were hit and beaten up by plainclothes police and anti-riot police, then dragged to the van in front of (the) subway entrance gate,” an eyewitness told CNN. “A wounded girl lying on the sidewalk was taken by ambulance to the hospital, and five others arrested on the north side of Enghelab Square.”     Hengaw said 450 people have been injured in the protests.                 Amini was stopped and detained by Iran’s morality police last Tuesday. Iranian officials said that she died last Friday after suffering a “heart attack” and falling into a coma following her arrest.                 However, her family said she had no pre-existing heart condition, according to Emtedad news, an Iranian pro-reform media outlet which claimed to have spoken to Amini’s father.                 Edited security camera footage released by Iran’s state media appeared to show Amini collapsing at a “re-education” center where she was taken to receive “guidance” on her attire.                 Iran’s morality police are part of the country’s law enforcement and are tasked with enforcing the strict social rules of the Islamic Republic, including its dress code that mandates women wear a headscarf, or hijab, in public.                 An aide to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei promised a “thorough investigation” into Amini’s death during a meeting with her family in their home on Monday, according to Iran’s semi-official Nour News agency.     Iranian police say death of Mahsa Amini 'unfortunate' as protestors take to the streets             Abdolreza Pourzahabi, Khamenei’s representative in Iran’s Kurdish province, said the Supreme Leader “is sad” and that the family’s sorrow “is his sorrow too,” according to Nour.                  He added that he hopes the family shows “good will to help bring back calm in society.”                 During a news conference, also on Monday, Greater Tehran Police Commander Hossein Rahimi denied “false accusations” against the Iranian police, saying they had “done everything” to keep Amini alive.                  He added that Amini had not been harmed physically during or after she was taken into custody, and called her death “unfortunate.”                 In the wake of Amini’s death, internet monitoring website Netblocks has documented internet outages since Friday – a tactic Iran has previously used to prevent the spread of protests.                  On Monday, the watchdog said that “real-time network data show a near-total disruption to internet connectivity in Sanandaj, the capital of Kurdistan province.”                 Iran’s minister of communications, Issa Zarepour, said that internet services could be disrupted for “security purposes and discussions related to recent events,” by security forces, the country’s semi-official ISNA news agency reported.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/middleeast/iran-morality-police-mime-intl/index.html,Iran’s morality police have terrorized women for decades. Who are they?,The death of Mahsa Amini has galvanized thousands of Iranian women who have for decades faced the wrath of the Islamic Republic’s morality enforcers firsthand.,"Sep 21, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Nadeen Ebrahim,International,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.             A young Iranian woman was pulled off the streets of Tehran by the country’s notorious morality police and taken to a “re-education center” for lessons in modesty last week. Three days later, she was dead.                   The government has strongly rejected responsibility for 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death, but the news has nonetheless galvanized thousands of Iranian women who have for decades faced the wrath of the Islamic Republic’s morality enforcers firsthand.                  Amini’s story has pulled Iran’s  apparatus of discipline back into the limelight, raising the question of accountability and impunity enjoyed by the country’s clerical elite.                  “It would be hard to find an average Iranian woman or an average family who does not have a story of interaction with [the morality police and re-education centers],” said Tara Sepehri Far, a senior researcher in the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch. “That is how present they are.”                  The morality police are a law enforcement force with access to power, arms and detention centers, she said. They also have control over the recently introduced “re-education centers.”                   The centers act like detention facilities, where women – and sometimes men – are taken into custody for failing to comply with the state’s rules on modesty. Inside the facilities, detainees are given classes about Islam and the importance of the hijab (or headscarf), and then  forced to sign a pledge to abide by the state’s clothing regulations before they are released.                      The first of these establishments opened in 2019, said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, adding that “since their creation, which has no basis in any law, agents of these centers have arbitrarily detained countless women under the pretense of not complying with the state’s forced hijab.”                  “The women are then treated like criminal[s], booked for their offense, photographed and forced to take a class about how to wear a proper hijab and Islamic morality,” he added.      Iran's Supreme Leader shown at event amid reports of deteriorating health             Iran had been dictating to women how they should dress long before the establishment of the current Islamic Republic. In 1936, the pro-Western ruler Reza Shah banned the wearing of allveils and headscarves in an effort to modernize the country. Many women resisted. Then, the Islamic regime that overthrew the Shah’s Pahlavi dynasty made the hjiab compulsory in 1979, but the rule was only written into law in 1983.                  A task force with all the powers of a law enforcement agency, the morality police are  tasked with ensuring that the rules are followed.                   A number of anti-hijab movements emerge every few years in Iran, often leading to waves of arrests and persecution. These include the “Girls of Revolution Street” in 2017 , as well as this year’s brief social media protests on the country’s National Hijab and Chastity Day, which is observed annually on July 12 to promote veiling.                  But disagreements have emerged on the issue of the compulsory hijab, both among citizens and within the leadership.                  A survey by a parliament-linked research center in 2018 showed that there has been a decrease in the number of people who believe that the government should enforce the headscarf. And a 2014 report by the Iranian Students’ News Agency showed a 15% rise in those believing that hijab should not be compulsory.                   There has also been a rhetorical shift among the country’s leadership, calling for “education” and “correction” as opposed to forceful implementation of Islamic values, says the researcher, Sepehri Far.                  Some say that Iran is slowly nearing a tipping point as the government faces mounting discontent over a crippled economy and skyrocketing inflation caused by US sanctions.                   Amini’s death seems to be uniting Iranians of different mindsets, says Sepehri Far, adding that criticism over the incident is coming not just from regime opponents, but also from citizens with no previous history of dissidence, as well as those who are close to power.       Thousands across Iran took to the streets Tuesday night, according to witnesses and social media footage.       Videos on social media showed a woman cutting her hair in protest, as the crowd chants “death to the dictator” in Kerman province in southeast Iran. In other parts of the country, demonstrators chanted “We are the children of war, come on and fight, we’ll fight back,” and “death to Khamenei.”                  “This time protesters aren’t only calling for justice for Mahsa Amini,” said Ghaemi. “They’re also calling for women’s rights, for their civil and human rights, for a life without a religious dictatorship.”                   While there is a sense that the regime may feel vulnerable, some question whether the current movement will expand or simply weaken in the face of a state crackdown.                   “Not only are these protests brutally cracked down [on] and contained each time, but there is no leadership,” said Tara Kangarlou, author of “The Heartbeat of Iran,” who grew up under the gaze of the morality police.                   “Growing up as a teenager, we would make sure we avoid[ed] streets that we knew the morality police vans would be parked [on] during the weekend,” said Kangarlou.                   She says young Iranians have evolved within the “oppressive system” in order to live their lives, but the “average Iranian is fed up.”      Tunisia’s anti-terrorism police  arrest former leader              Tunisia’s anti-terrorism police detained for one day Ali Laarayedh, a former prime minister and senior official in the opposition Ennahda party, after an investigation into allegations jihadists were sent to Syria, Reuters cited lawyers as saying on Tuesday. In the same case, police also temporarily postponed  a hearing for  Tunisia’s opposition leader and speaker of the dissolved parliament, Rached Ghannouchi.

Several users replied with photos from the 1956 Suez crisis, which took place four years after the Queen took the throne and saw a joint Israeli-British-French invade Egypt to retake the Suez Canal after it was nationalized. Another user called on Salah to read up on the Queen’s history in the Arab world. “Brother do u know what this woman’s empire did to our country or shall I inform u,” tweeted another.                   Other users, however, jumped to Salah’s defense, saying the blowback was not justified. Egyptian sports journalist Omar Elbanouby tweeted: “Hands off Mohammed Salah… he is a professional footballer.. not a political activist.”                   Sudanese writer Mohammed Abo Zaco called out some of Salah’s critics for hypocrisy, pointing out that it was seemingly  OK for Arabs to support British football clubs and drive British cars, but not to pay respects to the Queen, who was laid to rest on Monday.                   European football clubs are immensely popular in the Arab world, with some being owned by regional governments, including Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain. Salah lives in the United Kingdom.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/11/tv-shows/muslim-representation-television-study-trnd/index.html,"Muslims are 25% of the world population. But in 200 shows researchers studied, they were just 1% of speaking characters","Despite making up one quarter of the world’s population, Muslims are severely underrepresented on television – and when they are represented, they’re depicted as shallow stereotypes, according to a new study.","Sep 11, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Zoe Sottile,International,"Despite making up one quarter of the world’s population, Muslims are severely underrepresented on television – and when they are represented, they’re depicted as shallow stereotypes, according to a new study.                 Researchers from the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism analyzed over 200 TV series that aired between 2018 and 2019, hoping to understand how Muslims were portrayed on popular shows.                 They found that only 1% of speaking characters were Muslim – whereas 25% of the world’s population is Muslim.             And across the 200 TV series, only 12 series regulars were Muslim, the study found. Seven of those Muslim series regulars were perpetrators or targets of physical violence – part of the pervasive stereotyping of Muslim characters, according to the researchers.     On 'Ramy' he plays a sidekick. Now he's starring in his own show             The research focused on scripted, episodic series from the US, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. A total of 87% of the shows studied didn’t include even one Muslim speaking character, says the study.                 The Muslims that were portrayed tended to follow stereotypes – and they lacked the diversity that characterizes the real Muslim population, according to the study. Over half of Muslim speaking characters were men, and they were mostly Middle Eastern. Very few Muslims were identified with the LGBTQ community and none were shown with a disability, the researchers found.                 The researchers identified several tropes that dominated the depiction of Muslim characters on TV. Muslims tended to be depicted as “foreign,” speaking accented English or not speaking English at all. Almost a third of Muslim speaking characters were violent against other characters – and 40% were the targets of violence.                 Muslim women tended to be depicted as “fearful and endangered,” according to the study. They were shown mostly as the victims of threats and violence.                 These portrayals have real-life impact on the ways that viewers think about Muslims, argued the researchers. The Pew Research Center has consistently found that Americans have the most negative views of Muslims as compared to other religious groups.                 “Attitudes toward Muslims may be formed by a variety of factors,” they wrote. “However, one in particular, the mass media, is a component within the control of storytellers and content creators.”                 The researchers pointed to some recent series that have countered these stereotypes, like Hulu’s “Ramy,” a comedy series about a young Egyptian American man living in New Jersey.                 And they called for greater and more complex portrayals of Muslim characters on TV, particularly those created by Muslim filmmakers.                  “Centering stories on Muslim characters will require changes both on screen as well as behind the camera,” wrote the research team.                  “Across the sample in this study, it was clear that few if any writers were Muslim. Working with Muslim creatives to develop and bring stories about Muslims to the screen is essential to increasing authentic portrayals.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Syed, 51, is being held on murder charges for the July 26 killing of 41-year-old Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of 27-year-old Muhammad Afzaal Hussain. He has not been charged but police say he is the primary suspect in two other homicides: that of 62-year-old Mohammad Zaher Ahmadi, killed November 7, and of 25-year-old Naeem Hussain, killed August 5.                  Syed denied involvement in the killings during an interview with police, according to an arrest affidavit.                  Authorities are still exploring what could have been the motive behind the killings, Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the city police department’s criminal investigation division, said at a news conference Tuesday.     Related articleSuspect in the killings of Muslim men in Albuquerque makes his first court appearance             One of the victims’ relatives spoke to CNN about his experience with Syed. Sharief Hadi – whose brother, Ahmadi, was killed in November – said it’s agonizing waiting for answers.                  When police announced Syed’s name as a primary suspect in the killing, Hadi said he remembered him as a disgruntled customer at the halal market he owned with his slain brother. Hadi recalled a time several years ago, during which Syed purchased rice using food stamps and then tried to return the rice to get cash back. Hadi said he told Syed he couldn’t receive cash and said Syed grew angry and returned several times trying to get money back for the rice. He alleges Syed also called and harassed Hadi and his brother.                  Ahmadi was found with a gunshot wound near the back door of their market, where Hadi said he’d been taking a break after a long day of work. Authorities said the victim was ambushed and fired upon.                 “I feel miserable every day,” Hadi said through tears. “I lost my lovely brother.”                 Albuquerque police this week also shared eight incident reports with CNN involving Syed dating back to 2017. Those included allegations of domestic violence, battery, assault, battery domestic violence, aggravated assault, food stamp fraud and shoplifting, though not all resulted in an arrest. Police also listed an allegation of child abuse in 2019, but they could not release any details on that incident.                  The disposition of all charges against Syed could not be immediately determined. However, all three domestic violence charges against Syed were dismissed, Hartsock said in a Tuesday news conference. A spokeswoman for the Bernalillo County district attorney’s office told the New York Times that the victims in the cases did not want to pursue charges.                 As for other allegations against Syed, Hartsock characterized them as “minor, misdemeanor arrests.”                 Syed’s daughter, who spoke to CNN reporters earlier this week, said the family arrived from Afghanistan roughly six years ago. The daughter, who CNN is not naming out of concerns for her safety, said Syed is “not a person who can kill somebody,” and had always talked about peace.                   Among the reports that were shared with CNN was an instance in July 2017 when Syed’s then 20-year-old daughter “reported ongoing verbal and physical disputes” but said she did not want to have her father arrested because it would make the “family dynamic worse,” according to a police report.                 In another instance, in February 2018, a man who identified himself as Syed’s former son-in-law told police the two had gotten into a verbal argument about him dating Syed’s daughter and Syed verbally threatened to kill him, according to an incident report from the police department. Syed reported he wanted the man to stop calling him and had not threatened him, according to the report. The man declined to press charges, according to the report, and no charges were filed due to lack of evidence.      Related articleHundreds of tips helped police identify and charge 'primary suspect' in killings of Muslim men, police say. Now they're searching for motive             In May 2018, Syed was arrested after an alleged altercation with his wife at the New Mexico Human Services Department. He told police that they were arguing over his wife’s driving and she slapped him. His wife told authorities she was driving the two of them to the department and her husband, who was yelling that she was not a good driver, allegedly “pulled her by the hair and kicked her out of the vehicle,” and made her walk the roughly two-hour journey to the building, according to a police report. When she arrived, he allegedly grabbed his wife by the hair and threw her on the ground, where an employee found her crying and saw a “large piece of hair” on the floor, according to the report. Syed was arrested on charges of domestic violence and battery. He pleaded not guilty and the charges were dismissed, court records show.                 Syed was arrested again in December 2018 after his then 17-year-old son called police and alleged his father hit him in the back of his head “with a large metal slotted spoon causing a laceration,” according to a police report. The son told police his father regularly “beat him and his mother” and showed an officer the blood on the back of his head, according to that report, but Syed denied the violence. Syed was arrested on charges of domestic violence and aggravated battery. He again pleaded not guilty, and his case was dismissed after he complied with prosecution conditions that court records didn’t specify.                 Mazin Kadhim,  the case manager assigned to provide refugee services to the family, described his relationship with Syed as a turbulent one and said he had grown worried over the relationship with his family.                  “With him – one time he’s happy with me, nine times he’s angry with me. For no reason,” Kadhim told CNN. “The way he was talking to me as a case worker was sometimes scary.”                 Kadhim said he believed Syed’s family was “afraid of him” and that he had reported his concerns about Syed to the refugee assistance program he worked for at the time, as well as to authorities.

On Tuesday, police announced they had arrested 51-year-old Muhammad Syed, saying they would be charging him with two of the homicides: the July 26 killing of Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain.                 As for the two other killings, police said there is evidence that Syed as the “most likely person of interest or suspect” in those as well, Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the city police department’s criminal investigations division said.                 According to the criminal complaint, Syed denied any involvement in the killings during an interview with police on Tuesday.                 Here’s what we know about the lives lost. CNN will continue to update this story with more details as we learn them:                  Mohammad Ahmadi was shot and killed outside of a business he and his brother ran together in November 2021, according to CNN affiliate KOAT.                 Ahmadi was from Afghanistan, police said.                  Muhammad Imtiaz Hussain had been living with his brother, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, in the same apartment complex for almost five years and had never had any problems.                 The brothers came to the US on student visas, studying at the University of New Mexico, and they would often take early morning or late night walks to the university library without any fear for their safety – until now.                 On August 1, police got a call about a drive-by shooting near the intersection of Cornell Drive and Garfield Avenue. They found Muhammad Afzaal Hussain with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a criminal complaint obtained from CNN affiliate KOAT.                 His face was distorted from gunshot wounds, his brother Imtiaz Hussain said.                 “This is not a random killing,” Hussain said. “This is extremely motivated and extreme hatred.”                 Afzaal Hussain was loved by everyone and a student leader excited for a future in politics once he gained US citizenship.                  “We are in extreme fear,” Imtiaz Hussain said. “Living in this place is very painful.”                 Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española. He had studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan before receiving both master’s and bachelor’s degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico, according to a news release from Española Mayor John Ramon Vigil.                  “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.”                 Naeem Hussain, 25, had been a US citizen for less than a month when he was found by Albuquerque police officers just before midnight Friday.                 His brother-in-law Ehsan Shahalami identified Hussian to CNN on Sunday and said he had migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim.                 “He had a lot of dreams and he accomplished some of them,” Shahalami said. “His others were cut short by this heinous act.”                 Hours before his own death, Hussain attended a funeral for two of the recent victims and expressed concern about the shootings, said Tahir Gauba, spokesperson for the Islamic Center of New Mexico.                 Hussain worked as a truck driver for several years from Albuquerque, a job he took immense pride in, according to Shahalami.                 “He was not even a citizen at the time but he would say, ‘This is our country, these people need us more than any other time,’ so he drove extra shifts to keep things rolling,” Shahalami said.                  After becoming a US citizen, Hussain opened his own trucking business, had plans to bring over his wife from Pakistan and was interested in buying property in Virginia, according to Shahalami.                 “He was the most generous, kind, giving, patient, and down-to-earth person that I could ever meet,” he said. “He was very hard working.”                  Hussain wasn’t just working to support himself – he would share his earnings with family back home, Shahalami said.                 After the funerals Friday, Gauba said, Hussain attended a lunch at the mosque and approached him asking if he had more information on the shootings.                 “We (The Islamic Center of New Mexico) thought after burial of these two young men (on Friday), we would have closure and move on and let law enforcement investigate,” Gauba said. “Waking up Saturday morning to his (Naeem Hussain) death, the whole community just feels helpless. There’s a lot of fear.”                   About 700 to 800 Muslims on Fridays attend the Islamic Center of New Mexico, the largest mosque in Albuquerque founded in the mid-1970s, according to Gauba.                 Aftab Hussein was found with multiple gunshot wounds, lying next to a car on Rhode Island Street on July 26.                 Detectives learned that a gunman had waited behind a bush near the driveway where the victim usually parks his vehicle and then fired through the bush multiple times when Hussein got out of his vehicle, according to the complaint.                 He was a Muslim man from Pakistan, police said.        CNN’s Nouran Salahieh contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Here's what we know about them             Albuquerque police announced Tuesday they had arrested 51-year-old Muhammad Syed, who they described as the “primary suspect” and the driver of a dark silver sedan-style vehicle authorities previously described as a “vehicle of interest.”                  The suspect is being charged with two of the homicides: the July 26 killing of Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain.                 The FBI is assisting with the investigation, and an online portal was set up for residents to upload videos and images which might help authorities investigating the killings. The local Crime Stoppers Board has also voted to increase a reward for information leading to an arrest to $20,000.                 “While we are still sifting through all the evidence to look for more connections, it is deeply troubling that these three men were Muslim and of similar descent,” deputy commander of Albuquerque Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division, Kyle Hartsock, previously said.                 Here’s what we know about the killings and the investigation so far:                 The most recent of the killings was reported Friday, when Naeem Hussain was found dead by Albuquerque police officers who responded to reports of a shooting just before midnight in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue.                 After the discovery, Albuquerque police said the homicide “may be connected” to three previous killings of Muslim men from South Asia.                 Those three men – Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, Aftab Hussein and Mohammad Ahmadi – were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” Hartsock previously said.     Related articleOne of four Muslim men slain in potentially linked Albuquerque killings remembered as 'brilliant public servant'              Two of them, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain and Aftab Hussein, were both Pakistani men and were killed in Southeast Albuquerque near Central Avenue. Police said they “determined there is a connection” between those two deaths.                 On August 1, police got a call about a drive-by shooting near the intersection of Cornell Drive and Garfield Avenue. They found Muhammad Afzaal Hussain with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a criminal complaint obtained from CNN affiliate KOAT.                 On July 26, police responded to Rhode Island Street where they found Aftab Hussein with multiple gunshot wounds, lying next to a car. Detectives learned that the gunman had waited behind a bush near the driveway where the victim usually parks his vehicle and then fired through the bush multiple times when Hussein got out of his vehicle,  the complaint states.                 Police found that casings from both the August 1 and July 26 shootings were likely fired from the same firearm, according to Hartsock.                 As investigators probed those two recent killings, they turned their attention to the November 7, 2021, homicide of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan who was killed outside a business he ran with his brother on San Mateo Boulevard.                 Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had just become a US citizen last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami.                 He opened his own trucking business this year and was described as being a kind, generous and hardworking person.                 The day he was killed, he had attended a funeral for the two recent victims and expressed fear about the shootings, according to a spokesman with a mosque in Albuquerque.                 Muhammad Afzaal Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española. He had studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan before receiving both master’s and bachelor degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico, according to a news release from the mayor.                 “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Mayor John Ramon Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.”                 Few details have been released about the two other victims. Police said Mohammad Ahmadi was a Muslim man from Afghanistan and Aftab Hussein was a Muslim man from Pakistan.                 Prior to the news Tuesday that a suspect had been detained, police had only released a flyer showing a “vehicle of interest” in all four killings. But it remained unclear who the car belongs to, or how they are potentially connected to the attacks.                 Police said the vehicle “is suspected as being used as a conveyance in recent homicides of 4 Muslim men.”                 “We have a very, very strong lead. We have a vehicle of interest … we have got to find this vehicle,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller previously said. “We don’t know at this point what it is associated with, or who owns it.”                 While police have not definitively said all four attacks are connected, they have said they are looking into whether it is the case.                 “There is one strong commonality in all the victims; the race and religion,” Hartsock said in a Thursday briefing.                 Authorities are asking the public to come forward with any information which might help in the investigation. Tips may be submitted to the Albuquerque Metro CrimeStoppers website.                 Authorities are still searching for a motive behind the killings and working to confirm whether they’re all related.  Syed is now being charged with two of the homicides – of Aftab Hussein and Muhammad Afzaal Hussain – and police said there is evidence “strong enough that” authorities are continuing to view Syed as the “most likely person of interest or suspect” in the other two killings as well, Hartsock said.                 After Friday’s killing, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Saturday she would send additional state police to Albuquerque.                 “I am angered and saddened that this is happening in New Mexico, a place that prides itself on diversity of culture and thought. This is not who we are,” Grisham said in a statement. “We will not stop in our pursuit of justice for the victims and their families and are bringing every resource to bear to apprehend the killer or killers – and we WILL find them.”                 The attacks have drew condemnation from President Joe Biden, who said he was “angered and saddened” by the attacks.     Related articleOpinion: In the world's largest democracy, 'looking Muslim' could cost your life             Meanwhile, local and national Muslim groups had warned residents to be cautious.                 “We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” Islamic Center of New Mexico posted on Facebook. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.”                 The center said while there was no evidence its mosque is being targeted, it was still taking steps to provide additional security measures.                 “The lives of Albuquerque Muslims are in danger.

Now he’s haunted by the spot where his brother was ambushed and killed.                  “I see from the window, this is the place where my brother died,” said Hussain, who lived in the same Albuquerque apartment complex as his brother Muhammad Afzaal Hussain.                  “I’m scared to go outside of my apartment,” the grieving brother said. “I’m scared to sit on my balcony.”                 For Muslims in New Mexico, everyday life is now permeated by fear after four Muslim men — including Muhammad Afzaal Hussain – were gunned down in Albuquerque.     Related articleMuhammad Afzaal Hussain was a 'brilliant public servant,' a New Mexico mayor says             Three of the victims – Hussain, 27; Aftab Hussein, 41, and Mohammad Ahmadi, 62 – were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” said Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of Albuquerque Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division.                 The fourth victim – 25-year-old Naeem Hussain – was found dead Friday night by Albuquerque police. He became the third Muslim man killed in the city within two weeks and the fourth since November.                 Hours before his death, Naeem Hussain – who just became a US citizen – attended a funeral for two of the other shooting victims. The young man expressed concern about the recent shootings, said Tahir Gauba, spokesperson for the Islamic Center of New Mexico.                 While no suspect information has been released, Albuquerque police say the killings of the four men from South Asia “may be connected.”                 Hussain said whoever killed his brother didn’t just steal the life of a beloved family member; they also ripped away his family’s sense of freedom.                 “My kids do not allow me even to step out of my apartment. They say, ‘Dad, it’s scary,’” Hussain said just steps from where his brother was gunned down.                 “We planted some flowers in our yard, and we haven’t even watered them. They said, ‘No, somebody might be hiding over there.’”                 Hussain had the grim task of identifying his brother’s remains at the medical examiner’s office. He said his brother’s body was mutilated so badly, it was clear the killing was deliberate.                  “More than half of his head is gone. … At the time that I saw the body, he didn’t even have half of the face,” Hussain said.                  “This is not a random killing. This is extremely motivated and extreme hatred.”                 The grief and terror have spread to Muslims across New Mexico, said Ahmad Assed, president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico.                 “Incredibly terrified. Panicked. Some people want to move from the state until this thing is over. Some people have moved from the state,” Assed said.                  “Businesses are closing … early. Students won’t leave their homes,” he said. “It’s affecting people from coming over to the mosque to conduct their services, their prayers.”                 Police are seeking “a vehicle of interest” that might be connected to the four killings. They tweeted a photo of the car, a dark gray or silver Volkswagen with four doors and tinted windows. Police said it might be a Volkswagen Jetta.

But he said he’s speaking out to try to stop the violence.                 “I am raising voice for my brother because I do not want any other’s brother to become victim of those shooters, any sister to become victim of those shooters, any mom or dad to become victim of shooter,” Hussain said.                  He said he hopes “other people do not become victim of those shooters and suffer like I’m suffering.”                 While police have not called the four killings hate crimes, “in my opinion, clearly it is hate-driven,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said Monday.                 “They are obviously targeting Muslim men, and they are happening right here in our own refugee community,” Keller told CNN.                 “We know that folks in our community, in the Muslim community especially, they are afraid to even leave their house, especially at night. They are afraid to pray. They are afraid to go to school,” the mayor said.      Related article49 states and territories have hate crime laws -- but they vary             Albuquerque is not just “in a place of grieving right now, but also at a place of outrage,” Keller said. But the community is determined to help.                  “We have marshaled every resource to have now police presence at all our mosques during prayer time,” the mayor said. “We are even doing meal deliveries for families that are afraid to leave their house to get food.”                 Assed, the mosque president, said he’s now among the many Muslims in New Mexico grappling with fear every day.                 “I get in the car, and I’m watching every which way possible. I’m watching my side mirror. I’m looking in the back. I’m looking out for any sign of anything out of the ordinary,” he said.                 “At the end of the day, we don’t have an alternative.”                  Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had become a US citizen just last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami.                 “He was the most generous, kind, giving, patient and down-to-earth person that I could ever meet,” said Shahalami. “He was very hardworking. He shared whatever he made with his family back home.”                 The young man, who opened his own trucking business this year, had plans to bring his wife over from Pakistan and buy some property in Virginia, Shahalami said.                 “He had a lot of dreams, and he accomplished some of them,” Shahalami said. “His others were cut short by this heinous act.”                 The day he was killed, Hussain attended a funeral for two other Muslim men who were recently killed in the city, said Tahir Gauba, director of public affairs with the Islamic Center of New Mexico.                 Hussain went to a lunch at the mosque after the funerals and approached Gauba to ask if he had more information on the shootings, Gauba told CNN.                 “He stopped by to say ‘Hey, what’s going on?’ He was worried. I told him to be careful,” Gauba said.                 “We thought after burial of these two young men (on Friday), we would have closure and move on and let law enforcement investigate,” Gauba said. “Waking up Saturday morning to his death, the whole community just feels helpless. There’s a lot of fear. … It’s driving everybody crazy.”                 Two other Muslim men killed – Muhammed Afzaal Hussain and Aftab Hussein – were members of the same mosque. Both were from Pakistan and were killed in southeast Albuquerque just days apart, police said.                 After their killings, police began investigating whether the November 7 slaying of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan, was connected.                 The Islamic Center of New Mexico is painfully familiar with violence against Muslims in the community.                  An arsonist started a fire on the center’s property in November, the city of Albuquerque’s website said. A month later, police arrested someone on suspicion of arson and negligent arson.                 Fortunately, no one was in the mosque at the time of the fire, Assed said.                 But now the center, where about 700 to 800 Muslims gather on Fridays, is warning residents to be cautious.     Related articleThe recent killings of 4 Muslim men in Albuquerque have shaken the city. Here's what we know             “We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” the center posted on Facebook. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.”                 After Hussain’s killing Friday, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced she will send additional state police to Albuquerque.                 The city is also increasing police presence at mosques, Muslim-affiliated schools and the University of New Mexico, officials announced.                 “We have heard from the community that the fear is so strong, there is a concern about even things like groceries and getting meals for certain folks in certain areas of town,” Keller said in a weekend briefing, adding the city is helping with providing meals for those affected by the killings.                 Albuquerque has always felt like a welcoming community for Muslims, even after 9/11, Gauba said. “This is the first time we are feeling this kind of atmosphere,” he said. “We are in fear.”       CNN’s Raja Razek contributed to this report.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

According to a complaint filed last week in federal district court, the plaintiffs, Abobakkr Dirar and Mohamed Elamin, allege they boarded a flight from Seattle to San Francisco on February 17, 2020, and after being seated in their first-class seats, they started speaking and texting in Arabic. Another passenger, who did not speak Arabic the complaint says, saw some of Dirar’s text messages and told the crew who removed Dirar and Elamin from the flight due to what they claimed to be a “ticket issue.”                    Once Dirar and Elamin were off the flight, the men spoke with an Alaska Airlines manager who translated their text messages and the messages were deemed not to be a threat, but the men were subsequently surrounded by law enforcement, according to the complaint.                 Dirar and Elamin, the complaint says, felt humiliated for being taken off the plane and being surrounded by law enforcement while allowing other passengers to observe “humiliating Plaintiffs before their fellow passengers by unnecessarily deplaning said passengers and allowing them to observe Plaintiffs surrounded by uniformed law enforcement personnel.”                   According to the complaint, they are seeking damages against the airline.                  The pair was booked on subsequent flights separately to San Francisco, but Elamin had to sit in a downgraded seat and both passengers arrived at their destinations hours later than originally intended.                  Dirar and Elamin’s attorney, Luis Segura, told CNN in a statement that Alaska Airlines could have handled the situation better after finding that the complaining passenger’s claims were baseless.                   The airline “…could have acted responsibly by calming tensions, apologizing to our clients for their mistreatment, and allowing our clients to remain in their rightful seats, he said. “Instead, Alaska Airlines chose to pile onto the bigotry by using these two Black, Muslim American passengers as props in an admittedly unjustified, unnecessary, and self-serving display of security theater. By bringing this lawsuit, our clients not only seek justice for themselves, but also for an entire community tired of being scapegoated to justify discrimination in air travel.”                   When asked why it took more than two years to file a lawsuit, Segura told CNN that in December of 2020, Alaska Airline’s counsel stated that they would be conducting an internal investigation into the matter but never reached back out to his clients.                 In a statement to CNN, Alaska Airlines says it takes discrimination complaints very seriously.                 “Our greatest responsibility is to ensure that our flight operations are safe every day, and that includes complying with federal regulations on investigating any passenger safety reports.  Since this case remains pending litigation, we’re unable to share any further comment or details at this time.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.             In “The Wizard of Oz,” a tornado sends Dorothy and her Kansas home spinning into the “Merry Old Land of Oz.” Last week it was what Politico called a “political earthquake” in Kansas that sent the national debate over abortion into a new phase with many unknowns.                 For decades, the anti-abortion movement worked to overturn the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a national right to abortion. But their long-sought goal, finally achieved in June, may turn out to be a case of “be careful what you wish for.” By a vote of 59% to 41%, the people of Kansas rejected an amendment to the state constitution that would have eliminated the right to an abortion.                 “It’s a huge victory for abortion rights,” wrote Jill Filipovic. “The result in Kansas confirms that Americans simply do not want an extreme anti-abortion movement regulating women’s bodies. Kansans have said what most Americans believe: abortion is an issue best left to women and their doctors.”                 But she added that this was a vote which should never have happened. “Fundamental rights – and it doesn’t get more fundamental than sovereignty over one’s own body – should not be up for a vote, even if the righteous side is likely to win,” Filipovic argued.                 Writing for Politico, John F. Harris suggested that the vote in Kansas, along with others that may follow, could scramble the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority opinion overturning Roe. He may go down in history as the “the justice who facilitated a national consensus on behalf of abortion rights. Quite unintentionally, today’s hero of the ‘pro-life’ movement could end up being a giant of the ‘pro-choice’ movement.”                 Tuesday’s vote in Kansas, which “mirrors polling showing solid majorities of people supported leaving Roe v. Wade intact, suggests that opponents of legal abortion do better when the prospect of an abortion ban is hypothetical, while abortion-rights supporters do better when the issue is tangibly real,” wrote Harris.                 A moderate Republican, former Rep. Charlie Dent, noted that “the overturning of Roe v. Wade has energized a previously demoralized Democratic base and could galvanize college educated suburban women in particular … If the GOP can’t win an abortion fight in Kansas, imagine the difficulty it will face in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.”                 “Coupled with Trump’s stolen election obsession, mass shootings and a growing number of extreme GOP candidates in competitive races, the unpopularity of the Roe decision may mitigate Democratic losses in November, despite vulnerabilities on a number of other fronts (namely, the economy).”                 Dent also faulted Democrats for running ads that backed extreme, election-denying candidates in the GOP primaries in the hope that Democratic candidates could more easily defeat them in the general election. In Michigan, “the courageous freshman Congressman Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Trump just days after being sworn into Congress, fell to an election-denying candidate, John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who was backed by the former President,” Dent wrote.                  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent more than $300,000 on ads touting Gibbs’ “conservatism and fidelity to Trump,” wrote Dent. “I’m sure plenty of Democratic operatives are cackling over their success meddling in the GOP primary, but any smugness may turn into deep regret if Gibbs ends up prevailing in November. Those who play with fire often get burned.”                 For more:     Mary Ziegler and Elizabeth Sepper: The coming state-federal showdown over abortion Aziza Ahmed and Ji Seon Song: Protecting patients’ privacy is paramount in time of uncertain abortion access             China fired off missiles, flew jets into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and called off talks with the US on issues such as climate change and military relations. The reason: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, which China sees as part of its territory.                 While Pelosi’s visit sparked apocalyptic warnings and fevered headlines, Taiwanese-American journalist Clarissa Wei wrote that the people of Taiwan are mostly unfazed. “What’s most frustrating about the reaction to Pelosi’s visit is not the prophetic declaration of imminent doom, but the expectation of fear and the surprise that follows when people realize that we aren’t all panicking in Taiwan – as if the calm we exude in light of unprecedented threats is a symptom of our ignorance of the facts before us.”                 “Threats from China are nothing new. They have been a part of my life, my parents’ lives and their parents’ lives for as long as almost anyone in my family can remember. In fact, Taiwan has been under threat by the People’s Republic of China for nearly 70 years. The three Taiwan Strait crises are proof of that.”                 A Texas jury ordered incendiary radio host Alex Jones to pay a combined $49.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages to the parents of a child killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting 10 years ago. Jones’ legal troubles aren’t over by any means: he faces two more such trials.                     One of the parents, Scarlett Lewis, even had to testify that her son “Jesse was real. I’m a real mom.”                 “It’s an unthinkable statement for a grief-stricken parent to have to make,” wrote Nicole Hemmer, “testifying that her 6-year-old son, murdered while he sat in school, had actually lived, and that she was the woman who had given birth to him and raised him for the too-few years he was alive. But that was the testimony Scarlett Lewis gave this week at a hearing to determine damages against Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist and media personality.”                 “After 20 children and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jones began to spin lurid conspiracies that the shootings never happened and that the shattered families were simply actors. The conspiracy triggered years of harassment as conspiracists targeted the mourning parents, who have had to hire security to protect themselves.”                  But as Hemmer noted, Jones is not a lone fringe player in the media world. He is “part of the right-wing power structure, from his interviews with soon-to-be president Donald Trump to his alleged role as an organizer at the January 6 insurrection.”                 “More than that, many in the Republican Party and conservative movement increasingly sound like Jones, with talk of false flags, crisis actors and pedophile rings now a mainstay of right-wing rhetoric. And while the Trump presidency opened the door for the mainstreaming of Jones, it’s important to understand how ripe the GOP was for Alex Jonesification.”                 In Dallas, the Conservative Political Action Conference gave a warm welcome to Hungary’s autocratic Prime Minister Viktor Orban.                  “The audience cheered him on during his blistering attacks on abortion, immigration, LGBTQ rights and more,” Julian Zelizer observed.                 “The illiberal and anti-democratic elements of Republican politics, which flared during the Trump presidency, are alive and well. As Orban’s popularity indicates, the profoundly anti-democratic strains that have been shaping the GOP keep getting stronger, not weaker…”                 “The talk comes on the same week that several election deniers, as well as participants in the January 6 insurrection, won in the primaries. The assault on the 2020 election continues to be a unifying theme in Republican circles. Even if some Republican voters are tiring of Trump, his rallying cry animates much of the electorate.”                 Eleven years after then-President Barack Obama announced the killing of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in a US raid, President Joe Biden described the tracking down and elimination of bin Laden’s former associate, Ayman al-Zawahiri.                  “The airstrike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri over the weekend in Afghanistan is part of the long and justified campaign by the United States to bring all the heads of the terror group to justice,” wrote Peter Bergen.                  Still, some of the claims about al-Zawahiri’s impact were overblown. “While Zawahiri was influential in the very early years of al Qaeda in turning bin Laden against the regimes in the Middle East, he wasn’t involved in bin Laden’s most important strategic decisions – that is, turning him against the US and planning 9/11. And Zawahiri proved to be an incompetent leader of al Qaeda when he took over the group more than a decade ago.”                 Bergen added, “Zawahiri was not a charismatic leader of al Qaeda in the mold of Osama bin Laden. Instead, he had all the charisma of a boring uncle given to long, arcane monologues, someone that you would best avoid sitting next to at Thanksgiving dinner.”                 Guy Reffitt was sentenced to more than seven years in prison, the longest penalty meted out so far to insurrectionists who took part in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. His son Jackson Reffitt had reported his father to the FBI on Christmas Eve 2020.                  “The Reffitts’ story is tragic, but hardly unique,” observed SE Cupp. “Chances are, you probably do know someone who’s been sucked into the cult of Trumpism, as Guy was.                 “Maybe it’s an aunt or uncle posting about rigged elections on Facebook, spreading Trump’s lie that the election was stolen…                 “Maybe it’s a father, or a mother, or a brother, who’s gone down a QAnon rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, and is no longer attached to reality.”                 “The carnage from Trump’s divisive rhetoric, lies, and conspiracy theories is incalculable. Trumpism is a powerful drug, one that can even cause a father to threaten his own child.                 “This was, incidentally, all by design. Trump stoked the fears and grievances of his base, turned Americans against each other, spread lies and conspiracy theories, undermined our faith in democratic institutions – all so that he could keep his supporters rabid, angry, willing to do whatever he asked. And sadly, many of them did.”                 For more:     Peggy Drexler: Loving your family even when they make horrible choices             On and off the field, Bill Russell was a leader. On and off the screen, Nichelle Nichols was an inspirational role model. Both died last weekend.     Peniel Joseph recalled Russell’s contributions as an athlete and a crusader against racism. “Russell was a 6-foot-10 center whose defensive prowess, rebounding skills and all-around leadership propelled the Celtics to 11 titles in 13 years,” Joseph wrote. “As if appearing in a news reel of the most significant events of the civil rights era, he was present, time and again, at key moments for the movement, from the March on Washington in 1963 to his visit to Mississippi that same year following the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers…”                 “Over the years, he never lost his willingness to call out racism, or a perceived indifference to it. In recent years, he chided White Americans for their incredulity – in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder and the racial and political reckoning that followed – about the existence of systemic racism.”                  When “Star Trek” premiered in 1966, one of the cast members “was the cool, sultry, supremely self-possessed Lt. Nyota Uhura, played by Nichelle Nichols, still a relative newcomer to television,” Gene Seymour recalled. In an era when the civil rights movement achieved its biggest successes, Nichols’ role had a symbolic significance. Yet “she was discouraged by her lines being cut from some of the episodes and was ready to move on to the Broadway stage. And she would have left if she hadn’t met a die-hard ‘Trek’ fan at an NAACP fundraiser in Hollywood: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.”                 King “told her that he and his family enjoyed watching ‘Trek’ and rooted for her playing a non-stereotypical Black character. She thanked him but said she was on her way out,” Seymour wrote.                 “‘You cannot and must not!’” Nichols recalled King saying in her autobiography. “’Don’t you realize how important your presence, your character is? Don’t you see? This is not a Black role, and this is not a female role… You have broken ground. For the first time, the world sees us as we should be seen, as equals, as intelligent people – as we should be.’”                 Nichols stayed with the show for its remaining two seasons and later would embrace “her importance as an inspiration and role model for young Black people whose dreams of space science and travel were emboldened by her character’s futuristic adventures.”     Dean Obeidallah: There’s a good reason Jon Stewart is angry at Ted Cruz Kara Alaimo: What petrifies me about sending my kids to school this year David A. Andelman: One miscalculation away from nuclear holocaust Aaron David Miller: The big mistake the US could make on Iran nuclear talks AND…             It’s no easy task – getting the attention of two of the world’s biggest music superstars. And even more impressive, getting them to make changes in their work.                 Yet Hannah Diviney, a disability activist in Australia, accomplished just that.                  She called out Lizzo and Beyoncé on Twitter for including an offensive term referring to her disability in recent albums. Both artists soon responded and revised their songs’ lyrics.      “Words matter,” Diviney wrote. “They always have and they always will. Language is one of the few tools in the world most people can wield with ease and on social media even more so. That’s why it’s worth paying attention to how we use it. That’s why my mom always taught me the pen was mightier than the sword. If anything, this week has taught me that thanks to social media and the power of a well-crafted tweet, we have access to the mightiest pens of all.

Bergen’s new paperback is “The Rise and fall of Osama bin Laden.” from which this article is, in part, adapted. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.             The airstrike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri over the weekend in Afghanistan is part of the long and justified campaign by the United States to bring all the heads of the terror group to justice.                 Let’s be clear about who Zawahiri really was. In remarks at the White House on Monday, President Joe Biden described Zawahiri as a terrorist mastermind “deeply involved in the planning of 9/11,” as well as the bombings of the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000 and two US embassies in Africa in 1998 that killed more than 200 people.                  But in my two-and-a-half decades of intensive reporting on al Qaeda, and based on discussions with key CIA and FBI officials tracking both Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden, as well as militants who knew both men, I have found little or no evidence for those assertions.                 As for Zawahiri’s role in recent years as al Qaeda leader, he was unable to resuscitate the terrorist group, which hasn’t carried out a major attack in the West since al Qaeda-trained suicide bombers killed 52 commuters in London in 2005.                 Zawahiri was not a charismatic leader of al Qaeda in the mold of Osama bin Laden. Instead, he had all the charisma of a boring uncle given to long, arcane monologues, someone that you would best avoid sitting next to at Thanksgiving dinner.     How Joe Biden and his team decided to kill the world's most wanted terrorist             This is not to undercut the significance of killing bin Laden’s successor. But let’s be realistic about Zawahiri’s importance historically in the hierarchy of al Qaeda and his role in the organization in more recent years.                  While Zawahiri was influential in the very early years of al Qaeda in turning bin Laden against the regimes in the Middle East, he wasn’t involved in bin Laden’s most important strategic decisions – that is, turning him against the US and planning 9/11. And Zawahiri proved to be an incompetent leader of al Qaeda when he took over the group more than a decade ago.                  Looking ahead, might there be a plausible successor to Zawahiri waiting in the wings who could revive the group’s flagging fortunes?                 The strike against Zawahiri indicates that his successor will likely have substantial freedom of movement to operate in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Indeed Zawahiri was living in downtown Kabul, a fact that was well known to some leaders of the Taliban, according to senior US government officials.                  Before 9/11, Zawahiri was a relatively marginal player in al-Qaeda, despite his role as one of the public faces of the organization.                 In 1986, bin Laden first met Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon, at a hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan where bin Laden was giving a lecture. Bin Laden was intrigued by the older, more politically experienced Zawahiri, who had joined a jihadist group at 15 and had served three years in prison in Egypt. The two became close and Zawahiri encouraged bin Laden to imagine the possibilities of overthrowing the regimes in Arab countries such as Egypt.                 As a result, during the late 1980s Zawahiri influenced bin Laden’s thinking about the need to fight the “near-enemy” Arab regimes such as Egypt. But by the time bin Laden had taken up residence in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in 1996 the two men’s relative importance on the “field of jihad” had changed quite dramatically. Zawahiri was a penniless refugee with virtually no followers whereas bin Laden was a well-known jihadist hero the Taliban had appointed to be responsible for all the Arabs living in Afghanistan.      Opinion: The global jihadist movement is down -- but not out             But bin Laden found a way to use Zawahiri for his own purposes – to advance his goals instead of those of this fellow jihadist whose focus was not on the US but on Egypt. Bin Laden released a statement on behalf of the “World Islamic Front,” a joint declaration made by himself, Zawahiri, and other militant leaders from Bangladesh, Egypt and Pakistan on February 22, 1998. The declaration claimed it was now a religious duty for any Muslim to kill American civilians anywhere in the world.                  This declaration of war made no mention of Zawahiri’s lifelong goal of overthrowing the “near-enemy” Egyptian regime and instead was focused on bin Laden’s “far-enemy” goal of attacking America. Bin Laden had co-opted Zawahiri to be part of his holy war against the US, not the other way around, which was the dominant narrative in the years after the 9/11 attacks.                 There is no evidence that bin Laden’s decision to target the US had any input from Zawahiri, despite later claims that Zawahiri was really the “brains” behind bin Laden.                  The troika who founded and ran al-Qaeda was bin Laden at the apex and his two key lieutenants, the Egyptian military commanders, Abu Ubaidah and Abu Hafs al-Masri (whose real name was Mohammed Atef), both of whom had been on bin Laden’s payroll since the beginning of 1987. They were bin Laden’s men, not Zawahiri’s.                  Like other reporters, I had inflated Zawahiri’s importance to bin Laden’s thinking in my 2001 book, “Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden.” After examining all the evidence, I have since concluded that Zawahiri was a marginal figure when it came to influencing bin Laden’s views, and that he played only a small role in the actions of al-Qaeda in the years leading up the 9/11 attacks.                  This view is also shared by Michael Scheuer, who led the bin Laden unit at CIA from 1996 to 1999, by Daniel Coleman, the most knowledgeable FBI agent investigating bin Laden in the years before 9/11 and by Montasser al-Zayyat, who spent years in prison in Egypt with Zawahiri.      Ayman al-Zawahiri Fast Facts             Noman Benotman, a leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, who knew both men, also said it was bin Laden who told Zawahiri, “Forget about the ‘near enemy’ [the Egyptian government]. The main enemy is the Americans because they dominate the whole area and they’re supporting these Arab regimes.”                  According to the 9/11 Commission, it was bin Laden, Abu Hafs al-Masri, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed an operational planner of 9/11, who discussed what American targets to hit. They selected the US Capitol, the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Zawahiri was not involved in deciding to attack these targets, according to the Commission.                  Bin Laden formally merged Zawahiri’s own Egyptian Jihad Group into al-Qaeda in June 2001. Feroz Ali Abbasi, a Ugandan Briton who was then training at an al-Qaeda camp, described the merger as “more like the assimilation” of Zawahiri’s group. At this point, Zawahiri’s group consisted of only ten men, according to Abu Walid al-Misri, who edited the Taliban’s Arabic-language newspaper. Abu Jandal, one of bin Laden’s key bodyguards, put the number of Zawahiri’s followers at seven Egyptians.                  It was only in the summer of 2001 that bin Laden told Zawahiri the details of the upcoming attacks on New York and Washington.                  Months after the 9/11 attacks, Abu Hafs al-Masri was killed in a US airstrike and Zawahiri succeeded him as bin Laden’s deputy. For the next decade bin Laden and Zawahiri both disappeared until bin Laden was tracked down by the CIA to the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where he was killed in a US Navy SEAL operation in early May 2011.                  Even though Zawahiri had been bin Laden’s deputy since 2001, it took more than six weeks for the group to announce Zawahiri’s ascension to the top spot. Saif al-Adel, an Egyptian former Special Forces officer was appointed “caretaker” leader of al Qaeda in the wake of bin Laden’s death, according to CNN. Adel had long played a prominent role in the terrorist group.                  Eventually Zawahiri was appointed to the top job but proved so incompetent in the job that al-Qaeda and its most successful affiliate, ISIS, formally split in 2014.  It was the first time in its history that al-Qaeda had officially rejected one of its affiliates, and this was not a sign of strength since ISIS was now the most lethal terrorist group in the world.                  During Zawahiri’s time as leader of al Qaeda, the terrorist group was never able to launch an attack in the US, nor against American interests around the world. (An al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen was in communication with a Saudi military officer who killed three US sailors at Naval Air Station Pensacola in 2019, but the central al Qaeda organization led by Zawahiri seems to have had no role in that attack.)                  The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has given al Qaeda “increased freedom of action” in Afghanistan according to a report by the United Nations released in May. Zawahiri apparently felt comfortable at his safehouse in Kabul where he produced video messages, according to senior US officials.                  According to the UN, Zawahiri “issued more frequent recorded messages after the Taliban took over Afghanistan last August,” appearing in eight videos. And al Qaeda also renewed its pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Taliban, according to the UN.             The most likely successor to Zawahiri is Saif al Adel – the former al Qaeda caretaker when bin Laden was killed – who lived in Iran for years after 9/11 and could already be back in Afghanistan.

According to senior Saudi counterterrorism officials, from Iran, Adel authorized al Qaeda’s branch in Saudi Arabia to launch a campaign of terrorist attacks in the Saudi kingdom that began in May 2003, a campaign that killed scores of people.                  If it is Adel who is tapped for the top job in al Qaeda, he will likely do a far better job of resuscitating al Qaeda than Zawahiri did, which, admittedly, is a low bar.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Zubair – co-founder of fact-checking website Alt News, which debunks misinformation in the Indian media – was arrested by Delhi police on June 27 after a Twitter user accused him of insulting Hindus in a 2018 post about the renaming of a hotel after a Hindu god.                 Zubair had already been granted bail for the case in Delhi but had remained in custody after several police complaints were filed against him in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh in June and July over separate social media posts.                 On Wednesday, the Supreme Court said all of the outstanding cases would be combined and investigated by a special unit of the Delhi police, and ordered his release by 6 p.m. local time.      Related articleIndian police arrest Muslim journalist accused of insulting Hindus             Zubair often tweets criticism of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for what he and other critics claim is a crackdown on the rights of the country’s roughly 200 million Muslims.                 Among his recent social media posts are videos he claims show Hindu extremists giving hate speeches against Islam, a minority religion in India where nearly 80% of people are Hindu.                 Zubair’s arrest came amid repeated accusations by critics that the BJP is using colonial-era laws to quash any form of criticism and encourage self-censorship, and was condemned by free speech advocates.                 In early June, Zubair had highlighted derogatory comments made by a BJP spokesperson about Islam’s Prophet Mohammed that sparked a diplomatic row with several Gulf states.                  The spokesperson, Nurpur Sharma, was suspended by the BJP after at least 15 Muslim-majority nations condemned her remarks, several of them summoning India’s ambassadors.                 In a statement after Zubair’s arrest in June, the Editors Guild of India said it was “apparent that Alt News’ alert vigilance was resented by those who use disinformation as a tool to polarise society and rake nationalist sentiments.”                 Early Thursday, Pratik Sinha, Alt News’ co-founder, posted a photo of him with Zubair on Twitter, thanking their supporters.                  “Zubair wants to convey his heartfelt gratitude to everyone who stood by us and supported us in the last few weeks,” Sinha wrote. “He’ll be back real soon.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Bergen’s new paperback is “The Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.             ISIS and al Qaeda have largely receded from the headlines. It’s been three years since ISIS lost the last vestiges of the vast geographical “caliphate” that it had once lorded over in Iraq and Syria, while al Qaeda has found it hard to regroup after the death of its founder Osama bin Laden more than a decade ago.                    Yet ISIS is far from defeated in its heartland. The United Nations points to the continued presence of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, estimating their total strength to be between 6,000 and 10,000 fighters, according to a report published on Tuesday.             That strength was underlined by a dramatic prison break in January at a prison in Hasakah in northeastern Syria, where more than 3,000 ISIS fighters reportedly were held. ISIS fighters and US-allied Kurdish forces fought a 10-day battle at the prison, during which 100 to 300 ISIS fighters escaped, according to the UN report.                 As a result of this resilience, the US continues a campaign of special operations forces ground raids and airstrikes against ISIS leaders. In February, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, the group’s leader, died in a US ground operation, while earlier this month, a US airstrike killed another militant who was part of the group’s leadership, according to US Central Command.                  But these military operations will not achieve much in the long term if the thousands of ISIS fighters and tens of thousands of displaced women and children from multiple countries remain unrepatriated in lightly secured and unsafe prisons and camps in northeastern Syria, creating what could be a whole new generation of ISIS recruits.                  The solution is for the many countries that have their nationals in prisons and camps in northeastern Syria to take back their ISIS fighters for prosecution in cases where it’s merited. As for women and children living in the camps, they should be reintegrated back into their home societies and entered into deradicalization programs if that should prove necessary.                  Senior US government officials, speaking Wednesday at a conference at the Middle East Institute in Washington, stressed that ISIS is far from defeated. Joshua Geltzer, US deputy homeland security adviser, told me in a discussion at the institute that ISIS remains “a threat to countries where it continues to have a presence, which is about 30 countries worldwide. It is still a threat to the region, Iraq, Syria and neighbors. And it is still a threat to the United States and our allies and partners.”     As the West winds down its war on terror, jihadists are filling the vacuum, UN warns             Of particular concern are more than 10,000 ISIS fighters and around 60,000 mostly women and children who are being held by America’s Kurdish allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces, in prisons and camps in northeastern Syria. The United Nations estimates that 30,000 of those held in the camps are under the age of 12 and are “at risk of radicalization” by ISIS ideologues.                 Few countries will take back their nationals who are living in the squalid camps, fearing that they may be importing an ISIS problem. In the past three years, Iraq has taken back more than 600 fighters and nearly 2,500 “displaced Iraqi nationals,” according to Timothy Betts, the acting US special envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. This month, France took back 51 women and children, while 39 Americans have been returned to the United States, according to Betts.                   Yet that number is less than 5% of the mostly 60,000 women and children – the majority from Iraq and Syria – and the more than 10,000 ISIS fighters who are being held in northeastern Syria.                   At the current slow rate of repatriation, the ISIS fighters and tens of thousands of women and children might take decades to return to their home countries. By that time, even the youngest children in the camps could be adults in their 30s and will have spent almost their entire lives living in the filthy, disease-infested camps, which are ripe for ISIS indoctrination.                  A wild card causing considerable consternation among US national security officials is the saber rattling by Turkey in recent weeks that it plans to send its military into neighboring northeastern Syria to annex territory controlled by the US-allied Kurdish groups fighting ISIS and running the facilities where the ISIS fighters and the women and children are being held. Turkey considers those Kurdish groups to be terrorists.     Dana Stroul, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, warned last week, “The United States opposes any Turkish operation in northern Syria. Such an operation puts at risk US forces, the coalition’s campaign against ISIS, and will introduce more violence into Syria. It would effectively end a ceasefire that has been in place for years at a time when violence is at its lowest levels since the onset of the conflict.”     Trump and Biden were both foolish about Afghanistan. Now we're all paying the price             Also concerning is that the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan almost a year ago because of President Joe Biden’s foolhardy decision to pull out all US troops from the country has given both al Qaeda and ISIS greater room to maneuver there, according to Tuesday’s UN report. Biden’s move was bad policy, and the US pullout was terribly executed, allowing the Taliban to maintain their alliance with al Qaeda and to bar women from jobs and teenage girls from education.                  The UN report noted that Ayman al-Zawahiri, who replaced bin Laden as al Qaeda’s leader, is issuing “regular video messages that provided almost current proof of life” and “Zawahiri’s apparent increased comfort and ability to communicate has coincided with the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. …”                 In Afghanistan, both ISIS and al Qaeda have acquired “night vision equipment, thermal imagers, and steel-penetrating bullets,” according to the UN report.                 The United Nations assessed, however, that – for the moment – al Qaeda does not pose an “immediate international threat from its safe haven in Afghanistan … and does not currently wish to cause the Taliban international difficulty or embarrassment.”     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              That’s the good news. But the bad news, according to the UN, is that al Qaeda now has key allies within the Taliban’s de facto government in Afghanistan, which will doubtless give al Qaeda more resources to regroup.  Meanwhile, the local branch of ISIS in Afghanistan is now one of the “most vigorous” of ISIS’ regional networks globally, according to the UN.                 The global jihadist movement, whether in Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria, and whether part of ISIS or al Qaeda, is down but not out. And these groups will continue to take advantage of ungoverned or lightly governed spaces in the Muslim world, where they will remain a threat to the governments and populations of Muslim-majority countries – and to the West – for the foreseeable future.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Minister of Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi resigned on Wednesday, one day before his term was expected to come to an end. The Indian parliament has nearly 800 lawmakers in total.                 “My work in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of parliament) is over, but my political and social work will never be over,” Naqvi told local news channel NDTV Thursday, without providing details over why he will not be seeking reelection.                  Naqvi’s resignation comes at a volatile time for India’s Hindu and Muslim communities. Religious tensions have been flaring in recent weeks, following comments by the now suspended BJP spokesperson, Nupur Sharma, about the Prophet Mohammed widely condemned as Islamophobic.     Violent and deadly clashes have since broken out in parts of the country between Hindus and Muslims – who respectively make up about 80% and 14% of the country’s 1.3 billion population.                 Tensions reached a boiling point last week following the brutal killing of a Hindu tailor, allegedly by two Muslim men.                  With about 200 million Muslims in India, the country is home to the third-largest Muslim population in the world, following Indonesia and Pakistan.     Related articleIndian officials demolish several houses after protests over anti-Islam remarks             Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP swept to power in 2014 promising economic reform and development, but critics feared his rise could signal an ideological shift ​away from the nation’s secular ​political underpinnings to those of a Hindu-nationalist state.                 The BJP has its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu group that counts Modi among its members, and adheres to Hindutva ideology which seeks to define Indian culture in accordance with Hindu values.                 Since then, the ruling party has been repeatedly accused by rights groups, activists and opposition parties of stirring anti-Muslim sentiment.                 Over the last eight years, several BJP-run states have imposed new laws that critics say are rooted in Hindutva ideology. At the same time, reports of violence and hate-speech against Muslims have  made headlines across the country.                 Some of the most controversial new laws are in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, ruled by Hindu monk-turned-politician Yogi Adityanath. The state has introduced laws to protect cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus, from slaughter, and made it increasingly difficult to transport cattle. It has also introduced an anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                 Earlier this year, the BJP-ruled southern state of Karnataka banned Muslim girls from wearing ​religious headscarves in classrooms, prompting several to challenge the decision in the ​state’s top court – a battle they ultimately lost.                 Last month, India scrambled to contain the diplomatic fallout as at least 15 Muslim-majority countries condemned Sharma’s remarks about the Prophet Mohammed. The incident sparked uproar among India’s key Arab trading partners and calls from around the Gulf to boycott Indian goods.                 In response, the BJP said on its website that the party respected all religions.                  “The BJP strongly denounces insult of any religious personalities of any religion,” it said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             Oil has added trillions of dollars to Saudi Arabia’s coffers over the decades, but it’s a resource that will someday run out or lose value as the world turns to alternative energy.                   Despite current high oil prices, the kingdom knows this, and it has embarked on an ambitious project to diversify its sources of revenue for a post-oil future. One of those sources is the pilgrimage, an eternal monopoly that has a potential market of almost two billion Muslims.                  Soon after King Salman bin Abdulaziz took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a $21 billion project to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to diversify the Saudi economy by 2030.                  “Unlike [the energy sector], where Saudi Arabia always has to worry about future competitors, in the area of Hajj and Umrah, they are guaranteed to have zero competition in perpetuity,” said Omar Al-Ubaydli, director of research at the Bahrain-based Derasat think tank.                   Muslims from the world over return to Saudi Arabia this week to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage after a two-year hiatus caused by Covid-19 restrictions. It’s an opportunity for Muslims to fulfill a once-in-a-lifetime religious obligation, but also a chance for the economy of Saudi Arabia’s holy cities to get a jump start.                  The pandemic caused the number of Hajj pilgrims to dwindle to 1,000 in 2020, but it rose to about 60,000 in 2021, when the Hajj was opened only to residents of Saudi Arabia. This year, the kingdom authorized one million Muslims to perform the rites.      Middle East oil exporters are cashing in as Ukraine war hits global economy             Experts say that with crude oil prices hovering around $100 a barrel, generating billions of dollars a day, the pilgrimage’s economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term.                   “Religious tourism in Saudi Arabia may not have the current revenue-generating capacity of the oil and gas sector, but the religious significance of Mecca and Medina will never run dry,” said Robert Mogielnicki, a senior scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “It serves as a crucial foundation to build out the broader Saudi tourism sector and market it to local, regional, and international audiences.”                  The potential for expansion is significant, says Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics. Pilgrims could, for example, be incentivized to extend their trips in the country to visit other religious sites or engage in recreation, particularly during the year-round minor pilgrimage, the Umrah, where Hajj-related bottlenecks can be avoided, he said.                  According to Mastercard’s latest Global Destination Cities Index, Mecca attracted $20 billion in tourist dollars in 2018, second only to Dubai.                  Before the pandemic, pilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about $30 billion a year and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis by 2022. That was when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, according to official data cited by Reuters.                    The number of pilgrims has shrunk significantly during the pandemic but the government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030, which some analysts have said is an ambitious figure.                  The pilgrimage has been a drain on the government’s finances due to the cost of infrastructure, maintenance, and security, according to Hertog, but it has made big money for the private sector.                   Mecca’s skyline around the millennia-old pilgrimage site is crowded with swanky skyscrapers housing Western hotel chains overlooking the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure Muslims turn to in prayer five times a day. A night at the iconic Fairmont Makkah Clock Royal Tower, which overlooks the Kaaba, costs up to $4,000 for its most opulent suites for this year’s Hajj season.       5 alternative energy sources to speed our transition away from fossil fuels             But the government has been trying to get a slice of that cake. In two years, the state-owned Public Investment Fund plans to open the Rou’a Al Haram Al Makki project just under a mile from the Kaaba, with 70,000 new hotel rooms and 9,000 residential units. It is expected to contribute 8 billion riyals ($2.1 billion) to the Saudi economy.                   In a blow to private travel agencies abroad that organize pilgrimages for Muslims in the West, the Saudi government this year announced a new booking platform that obliges foreign pilgrims to register and pay for the process directly through the new government-run system called “Motawif.”                   The system is designed to streamline the application process, but it has put travel agencies abroad out of business. In the United Kingdom alone, the sector is worth approximately $240 million, and many Hajj operators there are now facing liquidation, according to the Independent newspaper.                   Saudi authorities did not respond to CNN’s request for a comment.                  The only threat to Saudi Arabia’s ambitions to capitalize on the pilgrimage “is decreasing religiosity across the world,” said Al-Ubaydli. “But as long as Muslims continue to want to visit these sites, they will represent massive economic opportunities to Saudi Arabia.”      CNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report  Iran is adding demands to nuclear talks, US says              Iran added “unrelated” demands to the discussion table during the last round of talks on its nuclear program, US Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley said on Tuesday in an interview with National Public Radio, adding that and it has made “alarming” progress in its uranium enrichment field that would allow it to make a nuclear weapon “in a matter of weeks.”      Ben & Jerry’s sues Unilever to block sale of Israeli business              Ben & Jerry’s is suing its parent company in an attempt to cancel the sale of its business in Israel to a local partner that would continue to distribute its products in the West Bank.

By Ben Morse              Algeria this week marked 60 years since its independence from France following a bloody war of independence whose wounds are yet to heal.                  France began its rule of Algeria in 1830. The city of Algiers was originally taken by the French as a military measure, but as more settlers began arriving with French protection, France’s boundaries continued to advance.                  In 1954, the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) was formed as a guerilla group to liberate the country from its colonizer. It started an uprising that took the next seven years, known as the Algerian War, which led to Tunisia and Morocco being granted independence by France in return for militarizing their borders with Algeria.                  On March 16, 1962, an agreement was signed in France promising Algeria independence pending a national referendum and on July 5, Algeria celebrated its independence from France.                  Following its independence, most of the one million Europeans returned to their countries. More than 100,000 Muslims were killed in the seven-year Algerian war. Algeria says that over 5.6 million were killed over 130 years of colonization. French President Emanuel Macron last year accused Algeria of “rewriting history,” prompting the North African nation to recall its ambassador in Paris. To this day, France has not apologized for its role in Algeria’s colonization. There will be “no repentance nor apologies,” Macron’s office said last year.

It is forbidden to have any kind of help or relationship with them,” the Taliban said in a  resolution on Saturday.                 The resolution follows a three-day conference of religious leaders and elders in Kabul, according to Afghanistan’s state-run news agency, Bakthar.                 ISIS-K (the k stands for Khorasan, the name of a historical region that covered parts of modern Afghanistan and Pakisan) has been operating in Afghanistan for the last few years.                 It is a branch of ISIS – the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria – according to the Wilson Center, a non-partisan policy forum.

The Taliban’s resolution said that Afghanistan follows an Islamic system of rule and that “armed opposition to this system is considered rebellion and corruption.”                 It added that “any kind of opposition to this Islamic ruling system, which is in conflict with Islamic Sharia and national interests, is corruption and illegal action.”                 The connection between ISIS-K and its apparent parent group Islamic State is not entirely clear; the affiliates share an ideology and tactics, but the depth of their relationship with regards to organization and command and control has never been entirely established.     Related articleAfter earthquake that killed 1,000, Afghanistan braces for cholera, disease outbreaks             US intelligence officials previously told CNN that the ISIS-K membership includes “a small number of veteran jihadists from Syria and other foreign terrorist fighters,” saying that the US had identified 10 to 15 of their top operatives in Afghanistan.                 Its earliest members included Pakistani militants who emerged in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province around a decade ago, many of whom had fled Pakistan and defected from other terror groups, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).                 Counter-terrorism analysts last year estimated its strength at around 1,500-2,000, but that number may have grown.                  The Kabul gathering of 3,000 attendees – all male, according to state media – concluded on Saturday with a call on the international community to recognize Afghanistan’s Taliban-led government as legitimate.                  The United States and other counties have been reluctant to recognize the Taliban following its swift takeover of the country in August 2021, just weeks after the withdrawal of US troops began.                  Since then, the Taliban has imposed new restrictions on women, prohibiting them from working in most sectors and requiring them to cover their faces in public and have a male guardian for long-distance travel. Girls have been barred from returning to secondary school.                  UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned on Friday that “women and girls in Afghanistan were experiencing the most significant and rapid roll-back in the enjoyment of their rights across the board in decades.” The World Bank has frozen projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars over the issue.     Related article Top Taliban leader makes more promises on women's rights but quips 'naughty women' should stay home             An 11-point resolution released at the end of the meeting called for the recognition and the unlocking of foreign aid, while pledging to “take valuable steps in the direction of realizing national interests and people’s welfare and preventing poverty and unemployment,” Bakthar reported.                  “We call the United Nations and other international organizations, especially Islamic countries and organizations, to recognize Islamic emirate as a legitimate system, interact positively with it, remove all sanctions from Afghanistan, free the frozen funds of the Afghan nation, and promote the economic development and reconstruction of our nation,” the resolution said, according to Bakhthar.                  In the resolution, the Taliban also pledged allegiance to Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada, the group’s reclusive supreme leader, whom it referred to as the “leader of the people.”                 In a rare speech at the gathering, Akhundzada praised the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan last year as “a source of pride for Afghans but also for Muslims all over the world.”                 “Thank God, we are now an independent country. (Foreigners) should not give us their orders, it is our system, and we have our own decisions,” Akhundzada added.                 Speaking to the clerics, Akhundzada reaffirmed his commitment to the implementation of Sharia law, Islam’s legal system derived from the Quran, while voicing his opposition to the “way of life of non-believers.”                 The Taliban’s harsh interpretation of Sharia law when it was last in power led to scores of violent punishments, including the stoning of alleged adulterers, public executions, and amputations.

Officials in the western city of Udaipur, Rajasthan state, announced a curfew and blocked internet access after videos of the incident went viral on social media, triggering mass outrage across the country.                  In one video, two men can be seen beginning to attack the victim. In another, two Muslim men appear to confess to the crime and claim to have “decapitated” the Hindu man. However, police in the state told CNN Wednesday the victim had deep cuts all over his body, including slashes on his neck, but that he had not been beheaded.                  India’s Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday said it had directed the National Investigation Agency – the country’s main anti-terrorism task force – to investigate the case.                   “The involvement of any organisation and international links will be thoroughly investigated,” it said on Twitter.                  The two suspects allegedly killed the victim, a tailor, after a post appeared on his social media account in favor of the now suspended national spokesperson for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Nupur Sharma, who made derogatory comments about Islam’s Prophet Mohammed, Rajasthan police official Hawa Singh Ghumaria told CNN Wednesday.                  The victim was arrested on June 12 for allegedly “inflaming religious sentiments” and had since been released on bail, Ghumaria said.                 The two suspects have been arrested and an investigation is underway, the state’s Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.                   Authorities in the state have responded by deploying more than 600 policemen to the area.                   “This incident is very shameful,” Ghumaria said during a news conference Tuesday, before urging the public not to watch the videos and appealing for calm.                  “There will be tension.

Asaduddin Owaisi, a lawmaker and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen political party, condemned the killing and demanded the “strictest possible action” against the suspects.                   “There can be no justification for it,” he wrote on Twitter Tuesday. “Our party’s consistent stand is to oppose such violence. No one can take the law into their own hands.”                 Leader of the opposition Congress party Rahul Gandhi said he was “deeply shocked” by the incident.                  “Brutality in the name of religion cannot be tolerated,” he wrote on Twitter. “We have to come together to defeat hatred. I appeal to everyone to please maintain peace and brotherhood.”                  Hindu-Muslim tensions have remained a constant throughout India’s modern history, occasionally erupting into violence, but analysts and activists say relations have worsened since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP rose to power with a Hindu-nationalist agenda in 2014.

At least 15 Muslim-majority nations condemned Sharma’s remarks, several of them summoning India’s ambassadors and describing the comments as “Islamophobic.”                  Among Zubair’s recent social media posts are videos he claims show Hindu extremists giving hate-speeches against Islam, a minority religion in India where nearly 80% of people are Hindu.                  Zubair’s arrest has outraged politicians, journalists and news organizations, who have demanded his release.                  The Editors Guild of India in a statement Tuesday said it was “apparent that Alt News’ alert vigilance was resented by those who use disinformation as a tool to polarise society and rake nationalist sentiments.”                  Shashi Tharoor, an MP from India’s opposition Congress party, said the arrest was an “assault on truth.”                  “India’s few fact-checking services, especially Alt News, perform a vital service in our post-truth political environment, rife with disinformation,” Tharoor wrote on Twitter Monday. “They debunk falsehoods whoever perpetrates them. To arrest (Zubair) is an assault on truth. He should be released immediately.”                  The Committee to Protect Journalists on Monday called on Indian authorities to “immediately and unconditionally release” Zubair, and “cease harassing him in retaliation for his work.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.             The Republican Party has a rape problem.                  The conservative moment scored a major victory on Friday when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, overturning Roe v. Wade – ending the era of federal protection for legal abortion in the United States and instituting one of the most significant rollbacks of civil rights in US history. But a number of Republican candidates and elected officials don’t seem content with simply stripping women of our right to control our own reproductive organs. They’re also taking aim at rape victims.                   While rape and incest exceptions were once standard in anti-abortion laws, along with exceptions for a pregnant woman’s health or life, they are increasingly a thing of the past (health exceptions, too, are becoming much narrower and less common). This comes despite recent polling showing that the vast majority of Americans – 85%, according to Monmouth – support exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman. As conservative states scramble to further criminalize abortion in the wake of Roe being overturned, many Republicans seem absolutely giddy with possibility, realizing that their control of a great many state legislatures gives them wide latitude to impose whatever restrictions they like.                  And that means forcing rape and incest victims to carry pregnancies to term.                   The rhetoric from Republicans from multiple states is astonishing in its outright cruelty.                 In Virginia, GOP congressional candidate Yesli Vega, who also cited her time as a police officer, gave credence to an absurd untruth – that a woman who is raped may have a lower chance of getting pregnant. Axios published audio recordings of her comments on Monday.                 According to those published recordings, Vega said, “The left will say, ‘What about in cases of rape or incest?’” and then claimed that, in her years in law enforcement, she only saw one rape case in which a woman became pregnant. (She did not seem to consider that she wouldn’t necessarily know about a pregnancy a rape victim terminated. Particularly given Vega’s open hostility to abortion rights – what victim would confide in her?).      Bash asks GOP governor why he signed bill that would force rape victims to carry babies to term             A woman at the event then asked a question premised on a bizarre and false theory: “I’ve actually heard that it’s harder for a woman to get pregnant if she’s been raped. Have you heard that?” To which Vega responded that she didn’t know, but “it wouldn’t surprise me. Because it’s not something that’s happening organically. You’re forcing it. The individual, the male, is doing it as quickly – it’s not like, you know – and so I can see why there is truth to that. It’s unfortunate.”                 It should surprise her, because the idea is so plainly misogynistic and unscientific that anyone who gives it any airtime at all is by definition unfit to serve in any elected office – or as a law enforcement officer.                  But Vega isn’t the only Republican whose views on rape are positively medieval.                   Last fall, Ohio US Senate candidate JD Vance called pregnancies from rape merely “inconvenient” and emphasized that in matters relating to pregnancy resulting from rape, “The question to me is really about the baby.” (Apparently the woman matters very little, if at all.) Earlier this year, Ohio Republican Rep. Jean Schmidt said that her state’s law criminalizing abortion gave child rape victims the “opportunity” to “help that life be a productive human being.”                 That is, if a child victim makes it that far. Pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading killer of girls aged 15-19 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. And adolescent motherhood means that girls are more likely to be in abusive relationships; that they wind up poorer; that they and their children are less likely to reach their educational potential; and that their children are less healthy and are more likely to die in infancy.      Opinion: The aftershocks of America's abortion earthquake will be felt for decades             We know this: Women who are forced to carry pregnancies to term are more likely to die than women who can get the safe, legal abortions they seek. Laws criminalizing abortion are a death sentence for women – especially in a country with the highest maternal mortality rates in the industrialized world, and where maternal mortality is highest in the states with the strictest anti-abortion laws.                  Republicans know this, too. They seem to have decided it doesn’t matter.                  On Saturday, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said that when it comes to her state’s abortion criminalization law that does not allow exceptions for rape survivors or children impregnated by a family member, “I just have never believed that having a tragedy or tragic situation happened to someone is a reason to have another tragedy occur.” And just this week, in a stunningly callous interview with CNN’s Pamela Brown, Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio applauded his state’s strict anti-abortion law, which outlaws abortion roughly six weeks after the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period with few exceptions and without any exemption for rape or incest.                   “What happens when a twelve-year-old girl falls pregnant after being raped?” Brown asked him. “Are you ok with her being forced to carry that fetus to term?”                 “You don’t know you were raped for two months?” Warren asked, as if women and girls seeking abortions after rape are either liars, idiots or irresponsible. “I think it’s a great law,” he said. “And it is a compromise.” The “compromise,” apparently, is that most rape and incest victims are forced to carry pregnancies to term. That, Warren reiterated, didn’t bother him. “It’s hard to conceive of somebody who doesn’t know they were raped for two months,” he said.      Opinion: Roe's reversal doesn't just hurt women -- it harms us all              It’s not hard for me to conceive of, because I’ve met a girl in the exact position Pamela Brown described. She was 12, raped by a family friend and forced to carry the pregnancy to term because she lives in Honduras, where abortion is illegal in nearly all cases (in the story I wrote about her, I gave her the pseudonym “Sofia”). When I met her, she was heavily pregnant and clutching a stuffed bunny – her primary confidante about a situation she didn’t quite understand. The thing about children is that they trust adults; and young children, like Sofia, don’t always know what sex is, or what rape is, or what pregnancy entails. When Sofia found out she was going to have a baby, she asked if she could have a doll instead.                   Rape is a trauma. Even adult women who, unlike little girls, probably understand what sex and pregnancy even are may not realize they’re pregnant right away because they’re still reeling from their bodies being so intimately violated – they may be dissociating or in denial or simply too overwhelmed to notice the signs of pregnancy. Many trauma survivors go to great lengths to avoid fearful memories that can trigger post-traumatic stress and send them spiraling – and this certainly means that a great many rape survivors, in order to keep surviving, shut down any thoughts at all that have to do with their sexual health or reproductive organs.                  The harm of rape is a physical invasion, but it’s also a crime of power and control – it tells a victim that her body is not hers, that it’s subject to the will of another (usually a man). Laws that criminalize abortion do the same – and while all laws criminalizing abortion are unconscionable, those without exceptions for rape and incest are utterly inhumane. Women and girls who are raped and refused abortions face the magnified trauma of having their most intimate and often most pleasurable body parts violated, followed by being told that they have no right to determine the outcome of that violation – that, for a second time, they have no right to say “no,” and that their bodies can be controlled against their will.      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              Forcing a girl or woman to give birth after she was forced into sex are fundamentally inseparable cruelties. And their increasing prevalence in laws that regulate or ban abortion reflect a Republican Party that has grown ever more radical and comfortable with blatant misogyny in the past decade. Back in 2012, when Missouri senate candidate Todd Akin made comments similar to Yesli Vega’s, it not only sunk his campaign, but was a moment so shocking and definitional that it headlined his obituary in news outlets when he passed away last year.                    But that was then. Now, the Republican Party has lined up behind a man who has bragged about sexual assault and said that “there has to be some form of punishment” women who have abortions. They have coalesced around the idea that a woman is not a full citizen, and that she has fewer rights over her own internal organs than an embryo or a dead person.                   The GOP has become the party of hostile misogyny. And Republicans’ mistreatment of rape victims is just the beginning.       © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Sign up here.             The brutal killing of a young woman in broad daylight on an Egyptian street has shocked the Arab world, bringing the country’s gender-based violence crisis into the spotlight.                  Naira Ashraf, 21, was fatally stabbed on Monday by a man whose advances she rejected, according to Egyptian prosecutors who said the suspect was arrested outside northern Egypt’s Mansoura University, where the incident took place and where Ashraf was studying.                  Video from a nearby CCTV camera showing a man attacking a woman outside the university went viral across the Arab world this week. A lawyer for Ashraf’s family confirmed to CNN that the video shows the incident in which Ashraf was killed.                   The Egyptian prosecution said that the suspect had been referred to the criminal court and will stand trial for premeditated murder. The first court hearing is scheduled for Sunday.  CNN could not reach the suspect or his family for comment, and it was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney.                   Women’s rights experts in Egypt say that the problem of gender-based violence is widespread in the country, and that a number of social and legal shortcomings continue to hamper proper action.                  “Definitely, Naira’s killing was not an isolated incident,” Lobna Darwish, gender and human rights officer at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), told CNN. “[But] we are [now] seeing more coverage of violence against women.”                  Data is lacking since such incidents are not properly documented by the state, Darwish said, but cases of abuse are seen in the news on an almost monthly basis. “We are seeing patterns that are alarming,” she added.                 The Arabic equivalent of the hashtag #Justice_for_Naira_Ashraf has been widely trending across Arab countries since the killing.                  “We need a law that fights violence,” said Azza Suliman, an Egyptian lawyer and chairwoman of the Center for Egyptian Women and Legal Assistance. There also needs to be a discourse around women that is respectful and dignifying in order to create trust between women and the state apparatus, she added.                  The slain woman’s father, Ashraf Abdelkader, told CNN that the suspect had asked to marry her several times but was rejected. The suspect had also allegedly created fake accounts to follow her on social media, he added. Eventually Abdelkader filed for a restraining order in April.                  “She did not want to get married, she wanted to follow her career … and wanted to be a flight attendant,” Abdelkader said.                   Darwish said that the victim and her family exhausted all measures to protect Ashraf, “and yet again, the whole system – whether social or legal, failed.”                  Suliman said that for women to feel comfortable reporting such incidents, there is a need to “rehabilitate the channels for justice, which include the police, judges, and the prosecution.”                  Some responded to the killing by laying the blame on the victim. A controversial former TV host, Mabrouk Atteya, said in a video on social media that women “should cover up” to stop men from killing them.                  “Women and girls should cover up and dress loosely to stop the temptation… if you feel like your life is precious, leave the house completely covered up to stop those wanting you from slaughtering you,” Atteya said in a live stream.                  Atteya’s comments sparked outrage on social media and spurred a social media campaign calling for his arrest.                     Darwish noted that while Egypt is moving forward with tougher sexual harassment laws, enforcement is still lacking among both police and society, which in turn discourages many women from seeking legal assistance.                  Egypt’s State Information Services did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Egypt’s National Council for Women could not be reached.                  Harassment is illegal in Egypt, and in June of last year, the state tightened sexual harassment laws, raising fines and extending prison sentences, according to state media.                  The United Nations Development Program in 2019 ranked Egypt 108 out of 162 countries measured on gender inequalities in health, empowerment and economic activity.                   Last year, nine women were prosecuted on charges of violating family values after they posted videos in which they danced and sang and invited millions of followers to make money on social media platforms, Reuters reported.                  “When the state supports this kind of discourse in any way by criminalizing women for the way they dress or how they present themselves, it gives a green light for these people,” Darwish said, referring to men who put the onus of modesty and morality on women.                   “This happens a lot,” said Darwish, referring to violence against women. “Just not on camera.”      CNN’s Celine Alkhaldi contributed to this report.   Iran-backed parties strengthened after Sadrists exit Iraq parliament              Iraq’s parliament swore in dozens of new lawmakers on Thursday to replace a bloc loyal to the powerful Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, strengthening the power of rival Iran-backed politicians in the assembly.      Top EU official travels to Tehran to discuss Iran nuclear deal              The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell was set to visit Iran on Friday and Saturday to discuss reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, according to a tweet on his official account.       Turkey and Israel work toward restoring ambassadors             Turkey and Israel are working on restoring diplomatic ties back to the ambassador level, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday at a joint news conference with his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid.

The tags will serve as shortcuts to phone numbers. They consist of a hashtag followed by one to five digits. The country’s main telecom company e& (formerly known as Etisalat) has begun auctioning some of the most sought-after numbers.                  In a country that’s obsessed with distinguished numbers, some tags are fetching bids in the millions of dirhams.                  Some of the tags that are up for grabs include #10, #1234, #11, and #55555.                   While final bids have not been announced, bidding for the #10 tag reached 1.5 million dirhams ($408,000) while #15 hit 800,000 dirhams, according to Khaleej Times, a local paper.                  “#TAG is not only a unique short phone number, but also an innovative marketing and communication tool,” said Omar Matar Al Manna, the Executive Director of Emirates Auction, which is arranging the sale. “Creating a VIP number that is personal to the business sets them apart and draws new customers with ease,” he told state-run WAM news agency.                  The country has seen bids for phone numbers and car plates run into millions of dirhams in the past. In April, the Abu Dhabi license plate number “2” was sold at auction for a whopping $6.3 million, while a traditional phone number last year was sold for over $800,000.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/india/muslim-teenager-shot-islam-protest-police-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,A Muslim teenager was killed at a protest in India. His family wants answers,A 15-year-old student was killed during a violent protest in India. His family wants to know who fired the lethal shot.,"Jun 23, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Hannah Ritchie,International,"“They’re firing bullets, they’re firing bullets!” a voice yells on video over the sound of gunfire during clashes between police and Muslim protesters in the eastern Indian city of Ranchi.                 Footage posted to social media of the June 10 protest shows 15-year-old Mudassir Alam raising his fist in the air as the crowd chants, “Long live Islam.”                 More shots ring out, and Mudassir falls to the ground.                 “He’s dead!” a bystander shouts, as people try to stop blood flowing from a wound to the teenager’s head.                 Mudassir died later in hospital, one of two young men killed in the Ranchi clash – the latest victims of a deepening religious divide between India’s majority Hindu population and the minority Muslim community.                 The June 10 protest was one of several demonstrations that erupted around the country after two former spokespeople for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made derogatory comments about Islam’s Prophet Mohammed.                 Mudassir’s grieving father, Parvez Alam, doesn’t know who killed his teenage son, but in a police complaint he accused officers of “indiscriminately firing using AK-47s and pistols targeting the Muslim mob.”                 He claimed at least three other men were firing bullets at protesters from the rooftop of the Hindu Shree Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near where Mudassir was standing in the street.                 “Due to the firing from the temple roof and by the police, there was a chaotic situation and one bullet hit my son in his head,” Alam said in his complaint.                 Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Chhavi Ranjan confirmed that Mudassir and another man, Sahil Ansari, were later pronounced dead  at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Science from “bullet injuries” sustained during the protest.                  Ansari’s father, Mohammad Afzal, told CNN his 20-year-old son was returning home from his job selling cellphones in the market when “police opened fire.”                 Ranjan said “police opened fire because the mob was violent and initial firing happened from the mob,” but he would not comment on which mob he was referring to, saying the matter was under investigation.                 Amol Homkar, Inspector General of Jharkhand Police, said a two-member committee had been formed to investigate the incident, and a Special Investigation Team from the Ranchi Police are also making inquiries. Homkar said 12 people were injured during the protest, and 30 have been arrested in the days since, though he didn’t specify any charges.                 CNN has examined footage from the protest, which at times shows police firing indiscriminately at the demonstrators, none of whom – including Mudassir – appear to be carrying firearms.                  The boy’s father says he wants answers.                 “I lost my only child to this violence,” Alam said. “He was just 15, not even an adult.”                 Father and son were working at the family’s fruit stall on Mahatma Gandhi Main Road, a main thoroughfare through Ranchi, when protesters gathered after Friday prayers, Alam told CNN.                 “I was removing my fruit kiosk to avoid damage due to protests,” he said. “Mudassir was helping me.”                 Alam described his son as a “very polite boy” who, like many teenagers his age, loved making TikTok videos and taking photos on his cellphone.                 In a report to Ranchi police, filed two days after his son’s death, Alam said he saw a “mob” from the “Muslim community” moving north along the main road, and when they reached Shree Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, Mudassir joined them.                 Alam claimed the men standing on the temple rooftop started throwing rocks at the protesters and fired shots into the crowd.                  Video from inside Shree Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, verified by CNN, shows several people sheltering on the ground floor, including police officers.                 Over the sound of projectiles hitting the building, a woman’s panicked voice says, “Everyone is throwing stones at the temple. The administration is trying to stop it … but they can’t.” Through the temple’s security screens, protesters can be seen throwing rocks.                 Another video shows crowds outside, hurling stones towards the temple before gunfire rings out. It’s not clear who’s firing the shots, but the crowd is seen carrying away an unidentified man whose white clothes appear stained with blood.                 Towards the end of the video, police with guns are seen walking towards the Muslim protesters, who have retreated from their position outside the temple.                 Under India’s Code of Criminal Procedure, police officers can use “force” to disperse what they deem to be an unlawful assembly.                  Irfan Ansari, a Muslim legislator from India’s Congress party, which is part of the ruling coalition in the state, questioned why the police fired bullets at the crowd and said that he would demand the Chief Minister order a judicial inquiry.                 “The Ranchi incident has put the state to shame,” Ansari wrote on Twitter. “It is the job of the police to protect, not to shoot.”                 Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP party came to power in 2014, Muslims say they’ve been unfairly treated by a government committed to policies favoring Hindus.                 India’s Muslim population of 220 million is vastly outnumbered in a country of 1.4 billion people, and while India claims to be a secular country, many Muslims say they’re living in fear.                 The recent comments by former BJP representatives about the Prophet Mohammed did not only anger Muslims in India. At least 15 Muslim-majority nations condemned the remarks, and some demanded a diplomatic response from Indian ambassadors.                 India’s Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar told a town hall held by CNN affiliate News-18 on Saturday that the comments didn’t reflect the BJP’s views.                 “What was said was not the position of the party. The party made it very clear and took action,” Jaishankar said.                 “Some countries had concerns on it. They deal with us, we are their image of India. Countries who had concerns do appreciate that this was not the government’s position,” he added.                 But high-level diplomacy has failed to ease anger on Indian streets, where the comments sparked protests in several major cities. In some places, Muslims say they have been targeted for speaking out.                  Activists in the northern BJP-ruled state of Uttar Pradesh, ruled by the Hindu priest-turned-politician Yogi Adityanath, accused authorities of punishing Muslims allegedly involved in the protests by destroying their houses.                 Authorities defended their actions by saying they were targeting homes built illegally on public land whose owners had ignored repeated demolition notices.                 But victims told CNN only Muslim homes had been destroyed, and that no warning was given before their properties were reduced to rubble.                 In a statement last week, Amnesty accused the Indian government of “selectively and viciously cracking down on Muslims who dare to speak up and peacefully express their dissent against the discrimination faced by them.”     Related articleArundhati Roy: 'The damage to Indian democracy is not reversible'             Aakar Patel, Chair of the Amnesty International India Board, told CNN that authorities were “violating Indian law and Indian obligations to various treaties that the country has signed.”                 “What India is doing is without the justice process running through it, (it) is targeting Muslims, targeting their homes, shooting them even – all on the pretext of trying to make sure that there is no violence on the street,” he said.                 CNN has contacted Adityanath’s office but did not receive a response. In a tweet on June 11, his media adviser shared a photograph on Twitter of a yellow bulldozer demolishing a property, writing: “Remember, every Friday is followed by a Saturday.”                  At the family’s modest home in Ranchi last Wednesday, women surrounded Mudassir’s grief-stricken mother, Nikhat Parveen, wiping tears from her eyes as she wailed.                 Parveen told CNN Mudassir had phoned her after he finished helping his father to say he was coming home. “He put his phone down, and then he died,” Parveen said.                 She said her son was waiting for his high school exam results, and on Tuesday, they found out he was awarded straight A’s for five of his six Year 10 subjects.                  “He used to tell me: ‘I’m going to get a government job. I’m going to go far in life,’” Parveen said.                 “He was incredibly intelligent … he was loved by all. He’s not here today, and everyone has tears in their eyes.”                   His father, Alam, said police have so far frustrated his efforts to file an FIR – a First Information Report – which is required to start an official investigation.                 “We have been trying to take legal action, but the authorities are not cooperating,” he said. “We filed a complaint with the police, but they did not register (it).”                 Homkar declined to comment on the claim, and Alam’s other allegations,pending the outcome of the investigation.                 Alam said his son’s death has robbed his family of their future.                  “I am (a) poor laborer, me and my son (now dead) would sell fruits and vegetables. He was the only son and future of my family,” he wrote in his police complaint.                 Mudassir’s mother asked why any shots needed to be fired on a busy street where children, like her son, were present.                 “Does anyone have the right to do that? Do the police or whoever else have the right to fire shots like this?”                 When asked what she wanted from police, she said with resolve: “I want justice for my son.”       CNN’s Arpit Goel and Teele Rebane contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

View more opinion at CNN.             When two spokespeople from India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made derogatory comments about the Prophet Mohammed last month, it prompted an international firestorm.              The incident led to protests among India’s Muslim minority in several states. Some Muslim-majority nations summoned their India ambassadors. India’s foreign ministry said the comments did not reflect the views of the government, and the officials involved – one of whom later withdrew her remarks – faced disciplinary action.                  But for India’s 200 million Muslims, these comments were not an isolated incident.                  Rather, they were the culmination of the BJP’s “engineering hatred of a common enemy,” says bestselling Indian author Arundhati Roy.      Indian officials demolish several houses after protests over anti-Islam remarks             “India’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there. We’re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously,” she told CNN.                  “Many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison, most of them charged under a dreaded law called the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, all of them for speaking up for minorities, Dalits and forest-dwellers facing displacement and state terror.                 “Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means. What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking?” writes Roy.                  In this email interview with CNN Opinion, Roy says Indian politics has something in common with the US Capitol riots, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stoking hatred, and talks about who the real power in India lies with.      CNN: What does this incident involving BJP officials’ comments about the Prophet Mohammed reveal about Indian politics today?  Roy: It reveals how successfully the clear and present existential threat posed by Hindu nationalism in India has been masked by the face it presents to the outside world. You know the people in strange clothes, the man in furs and antlers who stormed the US Capitol? We’re being ruled by their equivalent here. The difference is that they are not a collection of random lunatics. They are members of the most powerful organization in India – the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), whose founding ideologues openly admired Hitler and likened the Muslims of India to the Jews of Germany. RSS is the real power in India.     CNN: What is the connection between the BJP and RSS?  Roy: The ruling party, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), considered to be one of the richest political parties in the world, is only the front office of the RSS. Founded in 1925, the RSS, traditionally controlled by a handful of Brahmins, now has millions of members including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been a member since his teenage years, and most of his cabinet ministers.                  It has its own vast militia, its own schools, labor unions and women’s organizations. It’s not a political party, it’s something of a shape-shifter, a master of double-speak, its sources of funding are amorphous and leave no legal trail, it works through an array of affiliates, but it’s a nation within a nation.                 The RSS believes that India should be declared a Hindu nation, just as Pakistan, Iran and several countries in the Persian Gulf are Islamic nations, just as Israel is legally the “nation-state of the Jewish people.”             In fact, the RSS believes in what it calls “Akhand Bharat,” a sort of fantasy that is futuristic and ancient all at once – a future Ancient India which includes Pakistan and Bangladesh which will be conquered and subject to Hindu rule. To flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, socialand subnational identities, more diverse than all of Europe, into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process. It means setting aside the constitution and undoing the very idea of India.                  First in the line of fire is the Muslim community. Close behind are Christians – a tiny minority that is also being brutalized. Last year alone there were more than 400 attacks on Christians. Churches have been vandalized, priests and nuns beaten up, their congregations threatened and humiliated.                  In the last two national elections, in 2014 and 2019, the BJP has shown that it can win a solid majority in the national parliament without the votes of India’s 200-million-strong Muslim community. That has effectively resulted in a sort of disenfranchisement and political isolation of Muslims, which is extremely dangerous.      Opinion: In the world's largest democracy, 'looking Muslim' could cost your life             There is also a new anti-Muslim citizenship law, a sort of refugee-manufacturing policy in which those who cannot produce a mandated set of “legacy papers,” which few people have, can find themselves deprived of citizenship. Nearly 2 million people in the state of Assam have already been struck off the National Register of Citizens. Massive detention centers for those who have been stripped of citizenship are being constructed all over the country.                 But isolating Muslims is not enough. Creating an artificial majority out of a very diverse Hindu community that consists of thousands of castes and ethnicities is equally important if the BJP is to remain in power. The cement for that is engineering hatred of a common enemy. This requires an incremental ratcheting up of bigotry.                  Apart from the mass killings and lynching of Muslims by Hindu vigilantes in recent years, we have the steady drumbeat of hatred and outlandish disinformation beamed into peoples’ homes by approximately 400 TV channels and countless newspapers. On social media handles viewed by millions of people there are open calls for the genocide of Muslims – and videos demonstrating how it should be done.                  We regularly see provocative demonstrations by thousands of sword-wielding Hindu men marching through areas in which Muslims live. The deeply disrespectful comments about Prophet Mohammed made by a BJP spokeswoman on national TV this May was a part of this constituency-building exercise. As was the unconscionable bulldozing by municipal authorities of the homes of Muslims who dared to come out in protest.              To flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, social, and subnational identities… into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process             Arundhati Roy                 Some of the protestors publicly called for beheadings and hanging and asking for a blasphemy law which the BJP would probably be more than happy to pass and use to silence its critics in swifter and more deadly ways. These individuals helped to confirm every deeply held prejudice about Muslims that the Hindu Right works so hard to perpetuate.                  As a concession to international outrage, the BJP has suspended its spokeswoman, Nupur Sharma, but she has been openly embraced by its cadre. The polarization has worked in the BJP’s favor.      CNN: And what does Prime Minister Narendra Modi have to do with it? Roy: Modi has made no comment whatsoever about the spokeswoman or the protests. A standard tactic of his. In situations like this, his followers, correctly I believe, read his silence as support. Although he increasingly positions himself as a messiah, he is an RSS man, and he knows that the organization is grooming other leaders who are waiting in the wings. But for now, he is the uncontested figurehead.                  Modi made his political debut in October 2001. He was appointed, not elected, chief minister of the state of Gujarat. It was just weeks after the 9/11 attacks in the United States. The world was convulsed by Islamophobia. It was the perfect political climate for the RSS.                  A few months later, in February 2002, following an act of arson in which a railway carriage carrying Hindu pilgrims was burnt, there was a brutal pogrom against Muslims in the villages and towns of Gujarat. It lasted for weeks. While the police watched, more than a thousand people were slaughtered in broad daylight, women were gang-raped and burnt alive, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes. Subsequently the murderers were caught on camera boasting of their deeds. Many spoke of how they were inspired and protected by Modi.                 Modi was unapologetic and came to be known as “Hindu Hriday Samrat” – the Emperor of Hindu Hearts. Soon after the 2002 massacre, he called for state elections and won with a massive majority. He has never looked back since – he was elected Chief Minister of Gujarat for three terms and in 2014 was elected prime minister. And we in India have begun to look at massacres and hatefulness against Muslims as an integral part of election campaigns. During Modi’s tenure as Gujarat Chief Minster, Hitler made it into a school textbook published by the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks as an inspirational leader.   CNN: Over the years, Modi’s popularity and his brand of politics has not waned. Why is that? Roy: For the same reasons that studies of the algorithms of Facebook and Twitter show that hatefulness gets far more traction than decency. Miserable people, oppressed people, unemployed people, people living in crushing poverty are voting themselves into further hellishness, their sunken eyes fixed on the object of their hate.                  After Modi’s shocking display of callous incompetence during the pandemic – the sudden lockdown in the first wave that led to millions of stranded workers many of who had to walk thousands of miles home to their villages, the millions of deaths in the second wave – some still shake their heads in sorrowful awe and say, “Without Modi, it would have been worse.”                  They’ve swallowed the story they’ve been fed about themselves, about their own lives. Meanwhile Modi has zero accountability. He has never addressed a single press conference in all his years as prime minister. All we get are staged performances and photo ops.      CNN: What has contributed to this situation where the Modi government feels immune from any international reaction or action?    Roy: I don’t think it is immune at all. On the contrary, our globe-trotting, head-of-state-hugging prime minister cares deeply about international opinion. None of us have ever seen him hug a fellow Indian. The optics of his foreign trips are carefully curated. His millions of followers refer to him as “Vishwa-Guru,” the Guru of the Whole World.      'We have been living in terror': Muslims in New Delhi say they are being targeted             Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson have all indulged him. International action and reaction is only a game of pragmatism and expediency. It has to do with trade and geopolitics, race, religion and ethnicity, and very little with values and morality.                  If India is buying a fleet of fighter planes from, say, France, it knows that lynching and a little mass murder will, at most, get a delicate finger-wag. A big market is excellent insurance against moral censure.                  Right now, foreign relations are a little tricky for India because of the Ukraine war and India’s proximity to Russia. So, India’s crimes in Kashmir and this very violent form of Hindu nationalism is coming under a little scrutiny. But these are all just bargaining chips in the Great Game. Sorry to sound so cynical, but I am.      CNN: How should India’s international Muslim trading partners respond? (And the world, for that matter?) Roy: Most of the countries that you refer to as India’s “Muslim trading partners” have long ago given up any pretense of democracy or diversity. They are already at the destination that Modi and the BJP are trying to drag India toward. The destination that we dread to arrive at, the theocratic state.                  India’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there. We’re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously. Failing because our elected leaders are blinded by hate – and crippled by a severe lack of intelligence, which is the more dangerous thing. The consequences will be unimaginable.                  As for what the rest of the world can do, all one can hope for is that people pay attention and form an informed opinion. And realize that their profits from this immense “market” will dry up if the market ceases to exist. The Indian economy is in a lot of trouble. Wealthy people, businesses big and small, have begun to flee. They are good and accurate weather vanes.        CNN: Is India truly the world’s largest democracy?  Roy: A democracy doesn’t just mean having regular elections. You cannot be a democracy when 200 million people who constitute a religious minority are expected to live without rights. When you can lynch them, kill them, incarcerate them, economically and socially boycott them, bulldoze their homes with complete immunity and threaten to strip them of citizenship. When the murderers and lynchers can aspire to move swiftly up the political ladder.      CNN: The damage done to Indian democracy – is it reversible?  Roy: The systematic indoctrination of people on the scale on which it has taken place over decades is hard to reverse. Every institution that is supposed to make up the system of checks and balances has been hollowed out, repurposed and deployed against people as a weapon of Hindu nationalism. In terms of political opposition, there are political parties that have successfully opposed the BJP at the state level in Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, but opposition is virtually non-existent at the national level.                  The whole system of elections has been gamed. You can win a huge majority of seats even without anything close to a majority of actual votes. In India, we have a first-past-the-post, multi-party democracy. This means that even if you get say only 20% of the vote in a constituency, as long as its higher than your closest rival, you win. A rich party can put up spurious candidates to split the votes. But that’s just one trick in a whole bag of tricks.                  And, anyway, how do you woo an indoctrinated population? By proving that you are a better, prouder Hindu? Nobody can beat the BJP at that game. And right now, that’s the only game in town. As far as mainstream politics goes.                  So, no, I don’t believe the damage is reversible. I believe we will be broken and then reborn. Change will only come when and if at all an accepting, gullible, fatalistic people realize what’s being done to them. And then it will come suddenly, and from the street. Not from the system. Until then… God help us.      CNN: What changes have you personally experienced that echo the changes taking place in India at large?   Roy: To begin with, many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison. Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means.                  What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? What does it mean to be considered a ‘success’ when the world is failing and everything you care about is being decimated? What is the moral way to be? The moral thing to do?                  I am one of those unfortunate people who saw this coming decades ago. I said so. I wrote so. At the time that made me something of a crazy outlier – one of those people who sets off a fire alarm right when the party’s going really well and everyone’s happy. In some ways it un-homed (not un-housed) me in all sorts of ways, literally and metaphorically – which is not a bad thing for a writer, actually.              What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking?             Arundhati Roy                  The idea of patriotism has been fused with the idea of Hindu nationalism, so people like myself are on the A-list of “anti-nationals.” Of course it helps their cause that I am not Hindu. My mother who raised me is Christian. My estranged father who I never really knew came from a Hindu family and converted to Christianity as did his father and his father’s father. But this doesn’t enrage them as much as the things I write and say. Particularly about Kashmir. A Bollywood actor and BJP member of parliament suggested that I be tied to an army jeep and used as a human shield by the Indian Army in Kashmir. They really should try that.                  Sadly, the BJP’s macro-radicalization has resulted in micro-versions of the same thing. It is mirrored by its allies, its doorkeepers, concierges and maintenance staff, as well as its victims. As everybody turns inward, bitter and doctrinaire, as every form of solidarity crumbles, as the garbage mountains grow and the rivers shrink, as stock characters locked into their own little ideological bubbles shout at each other on TV, I feel my own skin tightening around me, containing me, too. I struggle against that every day. The only home one has is in literature and poetry. That sentence that makes you gasp – or smile out loud. The song that breaks your heart.      CNN: What kind of India would you like to see – and how do we get there?  Roy: My dreams are not, and never have been, limited by the shape of the map of India, or any country. They’ve always been either much smaller or much bigger. The dream worth dreaming is to see our world moving toward a shared understanding of justice, however slowly, instead of racing away from it at the pace we are.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

Nupur Sharma, a spokesperson for the party, had made derogatory remarks regarding the Prophet Mohammed during a panel discussion on a news channel and her comments were allegedly followed by anti-Islam comments by another party leader on Twitter.     Related articleTwo killed in Sikh temple attack in Afghanistan's capital Kabul              Seven gunmen had tried to storm the temple in the early hours of Saturday morning and all were killed after a standoff that lasted several hours, according to Kabul police.                 ISIS-K said in its Telegram post that its suicide bomber Abu Muhammad al-Tajik had gained entry to the temple by throwing a hand grenade at the security guard officer at the entrance, killing him.                 “Armed with a rifle, pistol and hand grenades, he proceeded to shoot,” the worshippers inside the temple, ISIS-K said.                 A temple official said 30 people were inside the temple at the time.                 ISIS-K also claimed its members had clashed with Taliban government fighters trying to reach the temple, targeting them with a car bomb and four other explosive devices.                 It said the clashes between ISIS-K and the Taliban fighters had lasted three hours and that the suicide bomber al-Tajik had died in these exchanges.                  “The IEA [Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan] strongly condemns the targeting of the Hindu shrine in Kabul by the enemies of the Afghan people. The IEA expresses its condolences to the families of the victims and assures that serious measures will be taken to identify and punish the perpetrators of this crime,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, tweeted referring to the Sikh temple.     Related articleIndia is facing a firestorm over ruling party officials' comments about Islam.

Last year, ISIS claimed another attack against the Sikh community that killed more than two dozen people at another temple in Kabul.                  Saturday’s attack comes amid growing outrage in the Muslim world towards India for the comments by the BJP members and New Delhi is struggling to contain the diplomatic fallout from Muslim-majority nations like the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Oman and Iraq.                  The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemned the most recent attack, calling on Twitter for the “protection of all minorities in Afghanistan, including Sikhs, Hazaras and Sufis.”                 The European Union Ambassador to Afghanistan also condemned the attack, saying “religious (and ethnic) pluralism needs to be protected with full force.”                 India’s Foreign Ministry said it was “deeply concerned at the reports emanating from Kabul about an attack on a sacred Gurdwara in that city.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

White supremacy has long been bound up with rigid views about gender, masculinity and sexuality.                 Take a long-since-forgotten Ku Klux Klan raid on a gay nightclub in what’s today Miami-Dade County. In November 1937, nearly 200 members of the Klan, wearing spectral robes, publicly burned a cross during an induction ceremony.                 Then they descended on La Paloma nightclub, where they assaulted patrons in an attempt to close a joint that the Klan saw as an affront to tradition.                 Julio Capó Jr., an associate professor of history at Florida International University, analyzes how the raid and transnational forces shaped the city’s history in his 2017 book, “Welcome to Fairyland: Queer Miami Before 1940.”                 Capó has written before that the Klan claimed that its actions during the raid and elsewhere “represented its commitment to saving White homes, families, women and traditions.”                 To further explore the White supremacist dynamics that were on display last weekend in Idaho, we spoke with Capó, whose research focuses on how gender and sexuality have historically intersected with ethnicity, race, class and other aspects of identity.                 Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.     Why would White supremacists target a Pride event? Isn’t their bigotry focused elsewhere?             Homophobia is often rooted and embedded in anti-Blackness, in forms of White supremacy, including in building a particular vision of what the nation should look like or what they (White supremacists) imagine the nation should look like. Homophobia, whether it looks like an attack on a gay club or different forms of policy, is very much about White supremacy. Homophobia and White supremacy are often parts of the same structure.     The names of White supremacist groups change over time. But their core ambitions stay the same: They want to maintain a rigid social order. Could you give an example of a historical parallel that might put into context what happened last weekend?             As advances are made in, for example, LGBTQ rights, there’s a kind of fear among White supremacist groups that they’re losing their power. This story is now decades if not centuries old.                 When I was writing my book, I uncovered a raid on a gay bar on the outskirts of Miami called La Paloma. It was raided in November 1937, but not by police. It was raided by nearly 200 members of the Ku Klux Klan.                 A lot of people wanted Miami to be this town where they could live what they imagined to be a moral life (or) or live in what they wanted to be a model city. The city relied heavily on its tourist industry and on things like queer culture and queer entertainment, which provided forms of tourist dollars and pesos from the Caribbean and Latin America during this time.                 There was a debate about what Miami should look like, and the Klan wrote to the city commission basically saying, “Hey, there’s all this stuff going on, and if law enforcement looks the other way, we’ll take this into our own hands,” and they did. They raided the club.                 We could even take this more recently to Charlottesville, where some of the chants that you heard were “f**s, go home.” So, this isn’t a new story.     Among some White supremacist groups, there’s talk about declining birth rates and shifting demographics. Are there any links between these ideas and White supremacists’ perceptions of LGBTQ communities?             So much of this is at the root of anti-Blackness and anti-LGBTQ sentiments. Whether it was the integration of Black children into schools that had historically been White or something else, people have always talked about being concerned about children. The modeling and the language of “save the children” often gets employed by a lot of these groups – that no doubt happened in the 1970s with the Anita Bryant campaign. Much of this is tied to child protectionist language and to a very particular idea of what morality looks like or doesn’t look like and the dangers of being exposed to LGBTQ history or people. And the same with Black history. It’s such an interconnected history.     What do you think is important for people to take away from an attempted White supremacist riot near a Pride parade? It seems hard to separate this conspiracy to riot from many Republican leaders’ insistence on demonizing LGBTQ Americans.             We are very much in a particular political climate and in a very difficult time for a number of reasons. We’re seeing these tensions boil over, and not in new ways but perhaps in different ways. Anita Bryant won that battle in the ’70s, but she didn’t win that war.                 I think that it’s really important to find moments of hope. With the Idaho Pride event, someone reported it. Someone voiced their concern. In 1937, La Paloma reopened within just a few weeks, even though the Klan tried to shut it down.                 When people still host Pride events, when people still stand up for one another – these are forms of resistance and resilience, and should be understood as such.     The FBI is investigating what happened in Idaho, and a number of cities with upcoming Pride celebrations are giving their security measures a second look. They’re working to prevent violence in the short term. But what do you think needs to be done to find a long-term solution?             One of the things that has to happen is that we really have to understand these issues –  anti-Blackness, homophobia, misogyny, classism – as interconnected and in this way combat them. There’s no one quick solution. Rather, there’s a structural one that we need to work toward.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

In Indian Kashmir, police arrested a youth for posting a video threatening to behead the ruling party’s former spokeswoman who had made some of the remarks, officials said. The video, circulated on YouTube, has been withdrawn by authorities.                 Muslims have taken to the streets across India in recent weeks to protest against the anti-Islamic comments by two members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).                 Clashes have broken out between Muslims and Hindus and in some cases between protesters and police in several areas. Police in Uttar Pradesh arrested more than 300 people in connection with the unrest.                 Some in India’s minority Muslim community see the comments as the latest instance of pressure and humiliation under BJP rule on issues ranging from freedom of worship to the wearing of hijab head scarves.                 The BJP has suspended its spokeswoman Nupur Sharma and expelled another leader, Naveen Kumar Jindal, for the comments, which have also caused a diplomatic row with several Muslim countries.     Related articleIndia is facing a firestorm over ruling party officials' comments about Islam. Here's what you need to know             Police have filed cases against the two and the government has said the comments do not reflect its views.                 Muslim groups have demanded their arrest, while some hardline Hindu groups label them as brave and nationalist politicians.                 Over the weekend the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, Yogi Adityanath, ordered officials to demolish any illegal establishments and homes of people accused of involvement in riots there last week, the BJP’s state spokesperson said.                 The house of an alleged mastermind of the riots, whose daughter is a female Muslim rights activist, was demolished amid a heavy police presence on Sunday. Properties of two more people accused of throwing stones after Friday prayers were also demolished in the state.                 Mrityunjay Kumar, Adityanath’s media adviser, tweeted a photo of a bulldozer demolishing a building and said, “Unruly elements remember, every Friday is followed by a Saturday.”                 Opposition leaders said Adityanath’s government was pursuing an unconstitutional method to silence protesters.                 On Sunday, Jindal said his family faced continuous threats and some of his followers said a crude bomb was defused near his residence in capital New Delhi.                 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far not commented on the communal unrest.                 In the eastern state of West Bengal, authorities enforced an emergency law prohibiting public gatherings in the industrial district of Howrah until June 16.                 BJP’s West Bengal president on Sunday staged a sit-in protest and accused neighboring Bangladesh, a mainly Muslim nation, of inciting violence in the state.                 On Friday, two teenagers were killed in clashes between Hindus and Muslims in eastern India, police said on Saturday. Police opened fire to break up the violence in the city of Ranchi in Jharkhand state but it was not clear if the two victims were killed by the police or by rioters.                 Senior police official Surendra Kumar Jha said at least 14 police officials were injured in the incident in Ranchi and other areas. A curfew was imposed and Internet services suspended to stop the unrest escalating.                 Last week countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Iran – which are key trade partners of India – lodged diplomatic protests to demand an apology from Modi’s government for the comments.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Here’s what you need to know,India is trying to contain the diplomatic fallout as outrage grows in the Muslim world following derogatory comments made by ruling party officials about the Prophet Mohammed.,"Jun 11, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Helen Regan,International,"India is trying to contain the diplomatic fallout as outrage grows in the Muslim world following derogatory comments made by ruling party officials about the Prophet Mohammed.                 The United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Oman, and Iraq are amongat least 15Muslim-majority nations to have condemned the remarks, which were described as “Islamophobic,” with several countries summoning India’s ambassadors.                  The incident sparked protests in neighboring Pakistan and prompted calls from around the region to boycott Indian goods.                 India’s Hindu nationalist ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) disciplined the two officials involved, but the firestorm involving India’s major Arab trade partners is yet to die down.                  Here’s what you need to know.                 At the center of the controversy is Nupur Sharma, now suspended national spokesperson for the BJP – the party of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.                  On May 26, Sharma made comments during a televised debate on an Indian news channel about the Prophet Mohammed that were widely deemed offensive and Islamophobic.      Related articleWhy India is in damage-control mode with Arab nations               Most Indian news outlets have not directly quoted Sharma’s original comments.                 Sharma later withdrew her remarks and said it was never her intention to “hurt anyone’s religious feelings.” On Twitter, Sharma said her words were a response to derogatory comments made during the debate about a Hindu god.                 “If my words have caused discomfort or hurt religious feelings of anyone whatsoever, I hereby unconditionally withdraw my statement,” she said.                 Another BJP spokesperson, Naveen Jindal, who has since been expelled, had also made comments about the Prophet on social media.                  The BJP said on June 5 it had suspended Sharma and expelled Jindal from the party.                  “The Bharatiya Janata Party is also strongly against any ideology which insults or demeans any sect or religion. The BJP does not promote such people or philosophy,” the party said in a statement on June 5 without directly referring to the comments from Sharma or Jindal.                  Police in the Indian capital Delhi have also registered cases against Sharma and several others accused of disrupting public tranquility and incitement, according to a tweet from the Delhi police’s official Twitter account.                  A complaint was also earlier filed in Mumbai against Sharma for her inflammatory comments.                 On June 8, Indian police said they had arrested a former BJP local youth leader in the northern city of Kanpur for posting inflammatory content on social media about Prophet Mohammed.                 The incident has led to protests among the country’s Muslim minority in several states. In Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur on Friday, at least 54 people were arrested in connection with the protests, senior Kanpur police official Pramod Kumar told CNN.                 The BJP’s move to suspend its spokesperson failed to stop the controversy escalating beyond India’s borders.                  Qatar, Kuwait and Iran summoned India’s ambassadors, and the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation issued statements of condemnation. Malaysia was the latest country to condemn the remarks. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the High Commissioner of India to Malaysia on Tuesday to convey their “total repudiation over this incident.”                 Protesters in the Pakistani city of Lahore called on Indian Prime Minister Modi to issue an apology. And some stores in Kuwait have removed Indian products from their shelves following similar calls for a boycott.      Related articleIndia's ruling party suspends official over comments about Islam             The hashtag “Anyone but the Prophet, oh Modi” has been trending on Twitter in all six Gulf countries, and as far away as Algeria. Oman’s outspoken Grand Mufti Sheikh Ahmad Al-Khalili, the chief religious figure in the country, called Sharma’s comments “a war on all Muslims” and a matter that “calls for all Muslims to rise as one nation.”                 Modi has not publicly commented on the incident but Indian embassies in Gulf nations have made statements saying the comments “do not, in any manner, reflect the views of the government of India” and the government “accords the highest respect to all religions.”                 CNN has reached out to India’s Home Affairs Ministry for comment.                  Depictions of Islam’s Prophet are considered blasphemous by many Muslims and offending images or comments have in the past led to mass boycotts, diplomatic crises, riots and even terror attacks.             On June 8, the terrorist network al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) issued a statement condemning the remarks from the BJP officials and called for revenge, warning they will “find refuge neither in their homes nor in their fortified army cantonments.”                 But Mohammed Sinan Siyech, a non-resident fellow at Observer Research Foundation, a global think tank based in Delhi, said that such threats are more of a recruitment strategy than a solid plan.                  “In some ways this is them trying to publicize their views rather than taking action,” Siyech said.                  AQIS had not recruited many people since forming in the subcontinent in 2014 so might not have the capacity to carry out such an attack, he said.                  In 2015, Islamist militants attacked the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which had printed cartoons of the Prophet, and a Jewish supermarket in Paris, killing 17 people.                 For many of India’s 200 million Muslims, Sharma’s comments were not an isolated incident.                  They came amid a broader trend in India, which has cracked down on its minority Muslim population ever since Modi’s BJP came to power nearly eight years ago.                 Analysts say there has been a rise in support for extremist Hindu nationalist groups and suspected hate crimes against Muslims since 2014.                  In January, a senior member of the right-wing Hindu Mahasabha political party called on her supporters to kill Muslims and “protect” the country. It triggered an outcry made worse by the subsequent lack of arrests.                 In February, the southern state of Karnataka banned headscarves in classrooms, sparking protests in the state and major cities including the capital New Delhi. The demonstrations prompted rival protests from right-wing Hindus who chanted a religious slogan in support of the BJP.     Related articleOpinion: In the world's largest democracy, 'looking Muslim' could cost your life             In 2018, India’s current Home Minister Amit Shah said Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers from Bangladesh were “termites” and promised to rid the nation of them. And between 2015 and 2018, vigilante groups killed dozens of people – many of whom were Muslims – for allegedly consuming or killing cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus, according to Human Rights Watch.                 In 2019, India’s Parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims. It led to extended protests and international condemnation.                 And in December 2020, Uttar Pradesh enacted a controversial anti-conversion law, making it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                 All of this, analysts say, is evidence that Modi and his BJP party have pushed an agenda of Hindu nationalism onto secular India, a country of 1.3 billion people.                 Analysts said Modi has walked a tightrope between keeping his Muslim international allies happy while pushing his party’s Hindu nationalist agenda at home.                 “Modi has tried very hard to prevent his party’s domestic political agenda from spilling over and poisoning India’s relations with the Gulf states,” said Hasan Alhasan, a Bahrain-based fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who researches Indian foreign policy in the Gulf.                  “The extent to which Sharma’s comments have clouded India’s relations with the Gulf states is unprecedented, and that’s of course because she is, or was, the spokesperson of the BJP.”                 India has much to lose if it can’t keep a lid on the controversy. It comes as Gulf states and India look to enhance their economic partnership.                  India, the world’s third-biggest importer of oil, looks to the Middle East for 65% of its crude. The South Asian nation also sends to the Gulf states millions of workers who send home billions of dollars in remittances each year. And the UAE has singled out India among seven other nations as its future economic partner.                 The Gulf states are key sources of India’s oil and gas imports, with bilateral trade worth more than $100 billion, according to Alhasan.

India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday suspended a spokesperson and expelled another official after derogatory comments they made about Islam’s prophet led to an outcry in Arab countries.                   “India was taken aback by the response,” said Kabir Taneja, a fellow with the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “Communal issues are not new in India and in previous cases, we have not had such a response [from Arab states].”                   On May 26, BJP spokeswoman Nupur Sharma made comments on an Indian news channel about Prophet Mohammad that were deemed offensive and Islamophobic.

India, the world’s third-biggest importer of oil, looks to the Middle East for 65% of its crude imports. On the other hand, the Asian nation sends millions of workers to the Gulf states who send home billions of dollars in remittances.                    “There are over 8 million non-resident Indians across the Gulf. The Gulf states are key sources of India’s oil and gas imports, and bilateral trade is over $100 billion,” said Alhasan. “So it is a very important set of relationships from the Indian perspective.”                   The UAE alone, where some 3.5 million Indians live, accounts for 33% of remittances to India, at more than $20 billion a year.                   The UAE has singled out India among seven other nations as its future economic partner.

The UAE pact aims to see annual trade rise to $100 billion in five years and contribute to the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs in India.                  Abdulaziz Sager, chairman and founder of the Gulf Research Center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, said that nature of India-Saudi relations gives Riyadh political and economic leverage over the Indian government.                     “I don’t think that will have a jeopardizing effect in terms of the economic or political relations because India is still an important country,” said Sager. “It is an important relationship but Saudi Arabia is not going to accept any sort of insult to the Prophet or undermining of religious Islamic issues,” said Sager.                     There are more than 2.2 million Indians in Saudi Arabia, according to Indian officials.                   Taneja said India knows the clout Gulf states have over it because of the diaspora in those countries. “That is why we saw such a brisk response from the government.”       CNN’s Esha Mitra contributed to this report.

Briton sentenced to 15 years in prison in Iraq for artifact smuggling               A retired British geologist was sentenced to 15 years in prison by an Iraqi court on Monday for attempting to smuggle ancient artifacts out of the country.                   Extreme drought has wreaked havoc in Iraq, causing sandstorms that have sent thousands of people to the hospital. But for some archaeologists it has been a temporary blessing.                  As water levels in the Mosul reservoir dropped late last year, an ancient city emerged, and scientists rushed to study it before it disappeared underwater again.                  A team of German and Iraqi-Kurdish archeologists was in a race against time after the 3400-year-old city under the Tigris River in Iraq’s Kurdistan region was uncovered this year.                   As the water levels began to rise again, scientists rushed to excavate and document what is believed to be the urban center of the Mittani Empire, which stretched from northern Iraq through Syria and into Turkey.                   The researchers, who announced their findings last week, were able to map a massive fortification of walls, storage facilities and an industrial complex. The team was stunned at how well preserved the city walls were, made from sun-dried mud bricks.                   “This good preservation is due to the fact that the city was destroyed in an earthquake around 1350 BC, during which the collapsing upper parts of the walls buried the buildings,” the researchers said in a statement.                  To prepare for the city’s looming reflooding, excavated buildings were covered with plastic sheeting and gravel fill. The city is once again underwater, waiting to be rediscovered.

When, as journalists, we prepare for a job, we think carefully about our questions, locations and equipment. But for one of us, documentary photographer Roshan Abbas, there is an added consideration – how much of his true identity to reveal.                  Abbas, co-author of this article, is a Muslim man in India. A country where, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch, Muslims are being vilified and evicted from their homes, their freedom of religious expression stifled.             It’s oppression Abbas has experienced firsthand, choosing not to wear a kurta – a loose, collarless shirt – that might point to his identity as a Muslim, when traveling the country for work.

Just one example of the targeted persecution of Muslims is a controversial citizenship law granting Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants, introduced by the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019.                 Prime Minister Modi has previously suggested that people protesting against the law can be “identified by their clothes” – a clear reference to Muslim protesters. Little wonder then, that Indian Muslims feel they have had to change how they dress, eat and speak in public.                 Tensions between Indian Hindus and Muslims have been flashpoints for decades, even before the British left in 1947 and the country gained independence. But since Modi’s government came to power in 2014, crimes against the Muslim minority have steadily increased.              Until recently, members of the BJP hadn’t outwardly acknowledged their goal of making India a Hindu nation. Othering Muslims, the country’s second largest religion, has proven to be an effective strategy in the BJP’s majoritarian politics.                 Now, India’s roughly 200 million Muslims – just over 14% of the population – are defending their right to live.                 Last month, local authorities and bulldozers razed shops and homes in Jahangirpuri – a low-income, predominantly Muslim neighbourhood in Delhi. The demolition followed communal clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the area. It mirrored the manner in which authorities responded to similar outbreaks of violence in other parts of the country – with bulldozers.     His house was demolished because he is Muslim, he says             What we are seeing in India is more than the systemic oppression of Muslims and other minorities. Prior to 2014, Muslims already accounted for only 14% of the population, but almost 20% of inmates in India’s jails.             But with authorities having abandoned their fundamental duty to safeguard the constitutional rights of minorities, India’s Muslim population is being rendered insignificant by the day.                 What’s more, open calls for violence against Muslims have become increasingly frequent. Following the southern state of Karnataka’s controversial ban on headscarves in classrooms earlier this year, a member of a Hindu nationalist youth group called for those who wore hijabs to be “cut… into pieces.”             And in December last year, a Hindu leader at an event in the northern state of Uttarakhand called for “Hindus to take up weapons” to ensure a “Muslim didn’t become the prime minister in 2029.”                 Yet world leaders seem unbothered by the state of affairs on the ground in India. There are no sanctions or wide condemnations of the Modi government. What little international media coverage there is of the situation – in our experience as journalists – been pushed aside to cover the war in Ukraine. And while that news needs due coverage, so does this.                 There have been some international breakout moments. On his recent visit to Gujarat, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited a JCB plant and posed for photos on a bulldozer – the same brand of bulldozers used to demolish Muslim-owned shops and homes.                  This caused outrage both in India and the UK, with members of the opposition in the UK even going so far as to question whether Johnson’s trip to India “helped legitmize the actions of Modi’s far-right government.”                  It is perhaps unsurprising that Modi has yet to condemn the recent spurts of communal violence across the country. Despite India being the world’s largest democracy, and constitutionally secular, the BJP has repeatedly stoked the flames of communalism, othering Muslims, branding them dangerous and violent.             In recent years, several BJP-governed states passed a “love jihad” (or “anti-conversion”) law. The law aims to prevent women from converting when they marry outside their faith, particularly, as the nickname suggests, keeping Hindu women from marrying Muslim men. It’s been likened to the 1935 Nuremberg laws banning marriages between Jews and those of “pure” German blood in Nazi Germany.                 This year, we find ourselves inching further toward a propaganda nation-state. A controversial film about a fictional university student who finds out Islamist militants murdered his Kashmiri Hindu parents was openly praised by Modi.                 The film enjoyed a “tax free” status in several states to make it more accessible to a wider audience. However, this too was accompanied by anti-Muslim sloganeering and its screening in “mixed population areas” of Delhi was accompanied by increased police presence.                 Islamophobia has permeated every aspect of Indian society. Our cities are being renamed to erase traces of Muslim history, while Muslims in metropolitan areas face ghettoization on account of structural biases.                 And while beef and meat bans intimidate economically deprived marginalized groups including Muslims, the gross double standards of beef exports from India continue. (Cows, for those unfamiliar, are sometimes considered sacred in Hinduism.)                 Indian Muslims are forced to navigate social spaces with an eye of caution, amid a so-called “anti-terror” law to arrest and incarcerate for years without trial. For many activists and journalists jailed under the law, their only fault is their Muslim identity. But any unjust incarceration does more than silence the brave; it instills a sense of fear in the young minds of the Muslim community.

India on the Brink, a genocide prevention summit, also declared that the country was on the brink of genocide.                  How Abbas dresses for work is just the tip of the iceberg; Muslim women continue to face the brunt of Hindu nationalism. What’s happening to India’s Muslim population is a humanitarian issue we should all be paying attention to.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

In many tweets, Barnette also spread the false conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim.                  In one speech uploaded to YouTube in 2015, Barnette forcefully argued it was OK to discriminate against Muslims and compared rejecting Islam to “… rejecting Hitler’s or Stalin’s worldviews.” In comments on her radio show, she said accepting homosexuality would lead to the accepting of incest and pedophilia. One post she wrote called a transgender person “deformed” and “demonic.”                  Barnette surged in recent polls in the upcoming Pennsylvania Republican US Senate primary, putting her in a dead heat between Donald Trump-endorsed former TV star Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund manager David McCormick. The Pennsylvania Senate seat is one of the one of the best pickup opportunities for Democrats this November, and Barnette’s sudden, rapid rise is causing worry among Trump allies.                  Barnette has had a quick and unpredicted rise in the polls ahead of next Tuesday’s primary. She is best known as an Army Reserves veteran and conservative political commentator who regularly appeared on Fox, and previously she was the host of a Christian radio show called “Truth Exchange,” which also had a website where she sometimes blogged. She previously ran for Congress in 2020 in Pennsylvania’s 4th Congressional District but lost to Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean.                   Barnette’s campaign did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.                 In posts, and comments on her radio show, Barnette frequently condemned being gay and transgender.                  “Two men sleeping together, two men holding hands, two men caressing, that is not normal,” she said on her radio show in July 2015, when a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for same-sex marriage.                  On the same show, Barnette argued accepting same-sex marriage would lead to a “slippery slope” of accepting incest and pedophilia, in an episode that was deleted from her SoundCloud page after CNN’s KFile reached out to the Barnette campaign for comment.                   “If love is the litmus test, who are we to say, well, your love is legitimate love, same-sex couples, but your love, father and daughter, is not legitimate. Or your love, one man and three women, is not legitimate, or one older man and a 12-year-old child. If love is the litmus test, it becomes a very slippery slope. And that is where we, we find ourselves today.”      In one 2015 post, Barnette attacked the transgender former reality star and Olympic champion Caitlyn Jenner as “deformed” and “demonic,” while attacking what she called a “barrage to normalize sexual perversion.” In comments in the same post, Barnette warned of a “take-over” occurring by the “Homosexual agenda.”                   On another show from the same time, Barnette hosted “two ex-gays” to show “the real story behind all those happy ‘gay’ photos we see, & God’s Redemptive story in both of their lives.” One conversation featured the president of “Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays & Gays (PFOX).” In one post from 2010, Barnette wrote the “homosexual AGENDA” seeks “domination.” In a post in 2013, Barnette said America couldn’t coexist with the “Homosexual agenda.”                  “The aggressive homosexual agenda is coming soon to a kitchen table near you,” she wrote.                  In tweets and posts, Barnette frequently targeted Islam and Muslims. In one post, on her website, Barnette shared an obviously doctored image of a Muslim man holding up a sign in front of the rubble of the World Trade Center that said, “Vote Democrat! We need your help to kill you.”      Speaking in December 2015, in a speech posted online, Barnette argued it was acceptable to discriminate against Muslims and Islam, comparing it to rejecting the worldviews of Stalin and Hitler, leaders who systematically discriminated against and ordered the killing of millions of people – including Jews, people with disabilities, Slavs and gay men.                  “You are not a racist if you reject Islam, or if you reject Muslims, because they are not a race of people. They are a particular view. They are people that have a particular view of the world, and we have a right to discriminate against worldviews,” she said. “We discriminated against Hitler’s Nazi Germany view of the world, right? That was a worldview. That’s how he saw the world around him. And we discriminated against it. We rejected it. We rejected Stalin’s view … of the world, right? Because that’s a particular view of the world that we don’t agree with.”                  “We have the right to discriminate against worldviews because all views are not morally equal,” she added. “All views are not equal. So we have the right to reject it. And let me just say offhand, I reject how Muslims see the world.”      She tweeted in 2015, “There is nothing rational about Islam.” In another she wrote, “Pedophilia is a Cornerstone of Islam.”                  In 2019, Barnette attacked Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for comments she made about Trump, tweeting she was a “MUSLIM” in all capital letters.                   “Aren’t you all so glad you voted in the first ‘openly’ Palestinian Muslim? (Sarcasm for ya’ll who don’t get sarcasm),” wrote Barnette.              Barnette also frequently shared the conspiracy theory that Obama, who is a Christian, was Muslim. One tweet derided Obama as a “Muslim or from another country.”                   On her radio show and in speeches, Barnette frequently called Obama by his full name, Barack Hussein Obama, apparently to imply he was Muslim.                  “We have a president in office right now, Barack Hussein Obama,” she said in 2015 in a speech. “I try to mention his name as much as possible. Thinking that at some point a light bulb is going to go off in someone’s head.”                  “Don’t we get it? Obama is a Muslim!” read one tweet in January 2016.                  “Obama is a Muslim. Doing Muslim like THINGS!” read one 2016 tweet. One 2015 tweet called him “Muslim Obama.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/us/eid-al-fitr-ramadan-muslim-american-milestones/index.html,These young Muslim Americans hit significant turning points in their lives this Ramadan. Here’s how they observed the holy month,"Six months after Mussab Ali started his first year of Harvard Law School, he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and underwent chemotherapy during Ramadan.","May 1, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Aya Elamroussi,International,"Six months after Mussab Ali started hisfirst year of Harvard Law School, he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and underwent chemotherapy during Ramadan.                 Ali was 23 at the time and had just become the youngest school board president to lead Jersey City public schools in New Jersey – a feat he strove toward for years – just as the district was navigating the coronavirus pandemicin winter 2021.                 Suddenly, the virus was not only a health issue discussed during intense board meetings on how to safely reopen schools.                  As a Hodgkin’s lymphoma cancer patient, Ali’s life depended on not catching the virus that had already killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. He also felt pressured to meet his obligations as a law student and a school board official – all while battling cancer.                  “The struggle aspect of it was this impossible balancing act,” Ali told CNN. “I think back, having gone through that and coming out the other side, it’s kind of ridiculous.”                  At the time, Ali was living with his family in their Jersey City home while undergoing chemotherapy and attending law school virtually. His mother quit her job as a teacher in New York to avoid catching the virus, and his father and siblings went to great lengths in their months-long quarantine.                  “It was very lonely. I didn’t have a sense of community. I didn’t get to feel this very special month where you get to see people and celebrate every night,” Ali recalled.                 Due to his treatment, Ali couldn’t fast during Ramadan, which is one of the most communal times of the year for millions of Muslims around the world.      Related articleRamadan Fast Facts             Ramadan serves as a spiritual resetting for Muslims who use the holy month to become closer to God through increased prayer, Quran reading, giving to charity and the general practice of good deeds.                  The annual ritual is marked by abstaining from food, drink and sexual activity from a little before the sun rises until the sun sets in a practice of self-discipline and patience. The general goal is to nurture those habits and maintain them beyond Ramadan, which ends Sunday at sundown this year.                 Muslims usually gather with family and friends for iftar, the meal after sunset that breaks the daylong fast – a tradition Ali described as “Thanksgiving every night for 30 days.”                 But last year, Ali didn’t experience any of that.                  “I just remember struggle,” Ali said.                 Ali, now 25, said he’s filled with gratitude to experience his first Ramadan this year as a cancer survivor after praying to reach the milestone.                 “For some people, especially for non-Muslim people, that might be a weird thing to have been asking for – asking to have the ability to not eat all day,” Ali said. “But that’s something that I really wanted.”                  For millions of Muslims, this Ramadan marks a particularly special milestone. It’s the first time many have been able to safely celebrate together since the pandemic began. It’s also the first time many are observing the holy month after undergoing significant changes in their own lives.                 CNN spoke with Muslim Americans who reflected on how this year’s Ramadan marks a turning point for them. Here’s what they had to say.                  Amanda Rushlow’s soul-searching journey began with an existential question: “I remember asking God, ‘What do I need to do to get into heaven?’”                 The question came during a plant medicine ceremony in Peru last year at a time in her life when she was on a search for spirituality and trying to get closer to God.                 The answer was an epiphany that led her to read the Bible extensively and explore Christianity, but she noticed what she described as “dissonance” in the faith between what was often preached versus what the Bible taught.                 Then she started having conversations about faith with a Muslim friend. To her surprise at the time, their beliefs had overwhelming similarities.                  “I remember so much would be aligning,” Rushlow told CNN. And she asked herself, “How is this true? … One of us has to be wrong, and I was very convinced that I was the one who was right.”                  Within the US, there are about 3.45 million Muslims, according to 2017 estimates by the Pew Research Center.                  And while the population has been steadily growing, more than half of Americans say they don’t personally know someone who is Muslim, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center report. Another survey showed that 52% of Americans said they either know “not much” or “nothing at all” about Islam.                 Rushlow took her friend’s advice to research Prophet Mohammed, whom Muslims believe is the messenger of the faith, but with the goal to find fault with the beliefs. And after going down the Internet rabbit hole where she sifted through articles and videos – it was time to go to the source: the Quran, Islam’s holy book.                 She listened to it on a trip from her home in Michigan to Arizona.                 “I just couldn’t stop listening. I had headphones on the whole time I was hiking. Headphones on the entire flight there and back,” Rushlow told CNN.                  And then it hit her: “This is my God,” she said. “I was overwhelmed.”     Related articleA Ramadan etiquette guide for non-Muslims             As she reflects on her first Ramadan as a Muslim, she was filled with heartwarming emotions, especially during her first visit to a mosque during night prayers. She has also found community in the Detroit area with other women who converted to the faith.                 “My heart felt so raw and open,” she said.                 Rushlow has spent the month reading the Quran, journaling and building the habit to pray the five daily obligatory prayers.                  “It felt like such a gift receiving Islam. It’s an honor … I will not eat happily out of obedience and out of submission,” she said. “It warms my heart so much to be able to participate.”                  For the past five years, Sharmin Hossain has been missing out on the Ramadan spirit.                  The 29-year-old was in a relationship and lived in New York City with a partner who didn’t observe the holy month. She also didn’t tend to her other spiritual practices.                 “I just did not have anybody to break fast with,” she said. “I remember how alone I was.”                 For Hossain, this Ramadan has marked a new phase in her life. She’s single for the first time in five years, and she’s using the time to go to Friday prayers more, “which is a big deal for me,” Hossain said, adding that she goes offline for two hours to attend the weekly sermon and prayer.                  She’s also marking the holy month in a new city after moving to Philadelphia a few months ago.                 “The first few days were actually surprisingly some of the most beautiful days because all my friends would break fast with me every day,” Hossain said.                   One of her close friends who isn’t Muslim has also been working out and breaking fast with her.                  “The communal part of it is something I didn’t know was really missing from my experiences and why previous Ramadans were so much harder just getting through the day,” she said.                   This year, Philadelphia’s slower pace has also allowed for more community gatherings.                 “It just feels very close and tender,” she told CNN. “This was definitely a more special Ramadan being single and being able to intentionally fast differently and go out to prayers by myself.”                 As a queer Muslim, she said she’s often on the receiving end of people’s surprised reactions when they learn she practices the faith.                 After her divorced parents learned of her queer identity about five years ago, she became estranged from her mother. But her father has been accepting and supportive of who she is.                 “When I’m in a mosque, I’m not thinking, ‘Oh, I’m a queer Muslim. May Allah forgive me and accept my prayers,’” she said. “I go into the mosque knowing that I’m a divine creature of the most Divine, and Allah knows that I worship Him and Him only, and I’m here to do that and not a sinner because I exist as a queer Muslim.”                 Living alone for the first time brings its own set of challenges, and with Ramadan coming at a time when Mohsin Mirza was taking on a new job thousands of miles from family and friends, it added to the emotionally and mentally challenging experience.                  “I definitely miss the community environment. There are people whose faces you don’t see except for a few months of the year, and this is one of those months,” said Mirza, 28, who recently moved to Washington, DC, from California’s Bay Area.                 “There’s more homesickness now than there would be in another month,” he noted. “So there’s a certain detachment.”                  Mirza belongs to the Shia sect of Islam, which comprises of about 10-13% of the world’s Muslim population, according to a 2011 Pew Research Center report. Most Muslims follow the Sunni sect of the faith.                  Ramadan is one of those times when Mirza feels a heightened sense of being a minority within a minority in the US because there are slight differences in how people in both sects choose to practice. Shia Muslims break their fast a little later than Sunni Muslims and commemorate certain days during the holy month in specific ways.                  While Mirza said he feels Ramadan brings the entire Muslim community together, he felt the distinctions more this year when he went to iftar events and was surrounded with Sunnis who rushed to break their fast before him.                  “It makes you feel a little different and puts you on the spot,” he said. “There’s always a hint of awkwardness. … It can be the source of some discomfort.”                 At another event, times to break the fast were announced for both Shias and Sunnis.                 “It’s a kind of small example of respect and inclusion that helps those of us who are a minority within the broader Muslim community feel like institutions that have been set up for the Muslim community are for us as well,” he said.                 Mirza also described experiencing some difficulty accessing a mosque for Shia Muslims in the DC area without a car. He has attended prayer at his local mosque, but he prefers to visit a Shia mosque when possible.                 Overall, Mirza said the experience has affirmed his view that the Muslim community worldwide is more similar than different.                  “In so many spaces, our communities are integrated and working together,” he said. “When those differences come up, they’re an opportunity to have discussions about why, and that can lead to mutual respect and understanding.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.             Out of the world’s nearly 2 billion Muslims, only about 4 million are Americans. So it’s not surprising that many of us often assume we have little relevance to the immediate concerns, let alone future prospects, of the ummah, the global Muslim community. But at a time when Muslims everywhere are searching for new visions, American Islam has something special to offer.                  That’s not to say we’ve done everything right, or even achieved the right outcomes for the right reasons, but we’ve preserved something essential from Islam’s past without which there can be no promising or prosperous Islam in the years to come. To explain why, consider Eid al-Fitr, the big holiday that marks the end of Ramadan.                  It’s soon… ish. I only say that because my Eid and yours may not fall on the same day.                  For peculiarly American reasons, many American Muslims might celebrate the same Eid on a different date. Even between kith and kin: My immediate family lives in Ohio. But some of my extended family, like my dad, live in Maryland. (Same time zone, mind you.) Of course, I plan to call the Maryland Moghuls and wish them an Eid Mubarak. I just don’t know when their Eid will be.                   To the average American, this might sound strange. Before you call your parents to wish them a Merry Christmas, you don’t have to confirm that you’re all celebrating Christmas on the same day. But on a consistent basis, many American Muslims have no idea, up to and including the day beforehand, exactly when they’ll be celebrating their holiest holidays.                     That’s because we track our religious calendar by the moon. But we don’t agree on how to track the moon. Some Muslims (let’s say Team A) contend it’s entirely sufficient to astronomically calculate lunar phases in advance, meaning that they’ll know how to organize their sacred obligations years ahead.                  Others (let’s say Team B) believe astronomical calculation isn’t sufficient. They hold that someone qualified must actually see the first crescent moon as well (of course, it has to be an astronomically viable sighting by someone who won’t mix up the moon for Mars). This is a live dispute. Sometimes a minefield. For while I’m with Team B, our local mosque is Team A.                   Meanwhile, my father’s mosque sides with Team B, although he himself believes that the calendar should be anchored to Mecca, no matter where you are (Team C?). For many Muslims, especially outside America, this debate is an anachronism at best. A centralized body, often government-run or backed, decides such things for everyone.                   As a recent Pew analysis finds, “Islam is the most common government-endorsed faith,” which holds in places as diverse as Southeast Asia and West Africa. Even where there is no state religion, many Muslim-majority countries, from Turkey to Indonesia, feature centralized clerical bodies or offer some degree of state protection to designated faiths.                   Of course, calendrically speaking at least, there’s a benefit to that level of coordination. After all, what’s the logic in not knowing when your most important religious occasions are set to commence? Unless you consider this minor hindrance a condensed symbol, a small thing that stands in for a much bigger truth, a challenge that is more so an opportunity. As I do.                  Because America (mercifully) has no single Muslim directorate, neighboring mosques, even from the same denominations, might celebrate Eid (or, for that matter, start Ramadan) on different days.      A Ramadan etiquette guide for non-Muslims             It’s as if some churches did Christmas on December 24 and others in the exact same town went with December 25. Further, though, it’s as if several didn’t know which day it’d be until December 23. And then the next year it was 11 days (give or take a day) before one of those days. (The lunar year being shorter than the solar year, Ramadan reverses through the seasons on a 33-year rhythm.) The next time Ramadan will overlap with all of April, as it did this year, is roundabout 2055.                   I hope that even then, in 2055, we’ll still be disagreeing.                   Of course, when I was growing up, plenty of Muslims used to get quite irked by such disunion (even though we seem fine with the idea that when we start and stop fasting each day differs by geography). Often these frustrated Muslims didn’t like the idea that all of us couldn’t concur. Sometimes they considered our divergence damning evidence of a broader deficiency, with worrisome consequences for Muslim cooperation on more urgent matters.                   The more I reflect on it, though, the more I suspect it’s the other way around. Because we have too little experience embracing disagreement, we don’t cooperate and collaborate all that effectively. Maybe an additional reason the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, modeled variations in his prayer, his recitation of the Qur’an, and in a number of other areas wasn’t just to create flexibility in those specific things.                  But perhaps it was also to empower his followers to live Islam in his absence, as one day they would have to – a Prophet, yes, but also still a mortal man. The lunar debate reveals what Islam was meant to be and, I pray, what Islam could be again. Orbiting this simple, significant truth: Because Muhammad is the last Prophet, there’s no revelation after him.       France is on a dangerous collision course with its Muslim population             Upholding that is one of two conditions of becoming and staying Muslim. (The first is unitarian monotheism.) After the Prophet’s passing and forevermore, there will never again be anyone who can conclusively decide on a matter. This design feature, this core consequence of the Islamic creed, should hearten democrats and deject despots.                  Because it means there’s no Islam without each of us having the rights and responsibilities that flow from moral agency. We can and should create communities to translate our strengths and priorities into the world, but none of these should impose on any other – and all of these should start and end with the sacred status of the individual in Islam.                     After all, we are judged by God individually. And that which God holds each individual accountable for, no one should deny.                   Of course, they can – practically speaking.                   But then they’ll have to answer for it – theologically speaking. (It’s called the afterlife.)                   American Islam doesn’t just present a provocative contrast with rigidly hierarchical interpretations of Islam, but actually also – dare I say – more closely approximates the founding Islamic spirit. And we’ll desperately need that egalitarianism, flexibility and nuance if we’re going to thrive in the future that accelerates toward us.                   From climate change to cultural secularization, from rapidly growing populations to the turbulence introduced by disruptive new technologies, we face too many challenges and too much uncertainty not to invest in autonomy. A dynamic, flexible ummah – a web of overlapping sentiments – would be much more likely to prepare us for a fast-changing future.

But many more can’t – not because of Covid, but because people in power decide what is and isn’t Islam. Their Islam or not-Islam.  It’s no wonder there’s a rising tide of atheism and cultural secularism in so much of the Muslim world.                  People don’t feel attached to something they aren’t responsible for. Or made to feel they have any right to. How different for those of us who have to choose for ourselves – and choose again and again. If you focus on the messiness that follows, you’ll miss the point. But if you focus on why there’s messiness in the first place?                   So, yes, I will call the Maryland branch of the family this weekend. I’ll tell them that on Monday morning, we’ll be heading to the Islamic Center of Greater Cincinnati for Eid prayers, but the 10 a.m.service, not the 7 a.m., thank God. They’ll wish me Eid Mubarak. And maybe I’ll wish them Eid Mubarak. Because while Monday will be my Eid, it might not be theirs.                   And we’ll do the exact same thing next year.                   And that’s more than just OK. It’s genuinely beautiful.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Because of slavery and the system of racial caste that it created, US society tends to view race and ethnicity through the limited categories of Black and White.","Apr 29, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Mirna Alsharif,International,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here.                 “You ask 10 different people what it means to be Arab, and you could get 10 different answers.”                 That’s how 31-year-old Danny Hajjar, who’s Lebanese American and grew up in Boston, describes the diversity and richness of Arab and Arab American identities.                 “People from Lebanon, for example, have a different idea of what it means to be Arab compared with people from Morocco,” he told CNN. Hajjar now lives in Washington DC.                 But with that complexity can come frustration, especially in a country such as the US. Because of slavery and the system of racial caste that it created, US society tends to view race and ethnicity through the limited categories of Black and White.                 “I always tick ‘other’ and then write in Middle Eastern, Lebanese or Arab,” Hajjar said. “I remember, distinctly, when I was applying to high school – I went to a private high school – I ticked ‘other’ and the admissions person asked me what I was, and when I told them, they changed it to White. I still can’t believe that happened. That was really something.”                 Put a little bit differently, while the treatment of identity in the US is robust and rigorous in some ways, it’s impoverished in others. And there are consequences.                 “Our community is uniquely disadvantaged because we’re not granted the ability to accurately communicate our identity on the census and other survey data, meaning that the socioeconomic challenges of our heavily first-generation and immigrant communities, as well as the wide range of environmentally linked diseases specific to our ethnic population, are undocumented,” 20-year-old Nooralhuda Sami said.                 Originally from Iraq, Sami and her family moved to Dearborn, Michigan – one of the US cities with the most densely populated Arab community – in 2010.                 “There are so many repercussions of this (lack of data and visibility) in Dearborn I observed growing up. Most notably in the south end of Dearborn – racism, classism and capitalism, and extremely high respiratory illnesses among its refugee and Yemeni residents,” Sami added.                 As the US celebrates Arab American Heritage Month, it’s important to acknowledge the community’s long history, which stretches to the end of the 19th century, when Arabs started to immigrate to the US to escape conflict, persecution and other hardships.                 Arab Americans can trace their origins to 22 Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Yet on records such as the census and even on medical paperwork, US society tends to see this dimension of diversity with little nuance – when it sees it at all.                 Based on the standards set by the Office of Management and Budget, there are seven categories for data on race and ethnicity: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic or Latino, according to the 2020 census program memorandum.                 As a result, Arab Americans must select “White” or “other” on the census and similar data products.                 It’s worth noting that the Census Bureau acknowledges just seven of the 22 Arabic-speaking countries: Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Morocco and Jordan in its ancestry survey. People who write in “Arab” or “Arabic” are listed under the “Arab” subcategory, and those who list one of the other countries are counted as “other Arab.” The Census Bureau also tabulates people who write in Kurd and Amazigh as “other Arab.” Though Kurds and the Amazigh originate from the Middle East and North Africa region, they’re ethnic minorities and don’t identify as Arab.                 “We’re the invisible minority. We’re treated as a minority in all aspects, but we’re identified as White. White isn’t a minority in this country,” Samer Khalaf, the national president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a grassroots organization, told CNN.                 “Because we’re not counted, because we’re invisible, we don’t get the culturally and linguistically competent help that many other communities get, whether it’s mental health resources or Covid-19 information,” he added. “We don’t get those resources because we’re White and fall under the generic White community that doesn’t get needs-based assistance.”                 This invisibility, this lack of a more granular identifier or category, can take a psychological toll.                 Consider 23-year-old Ayia AlMufti, who was born in Iraq right before the US invasion. She said that, growing up in a largely White community in Detroit in the post-9/11 era, she encountered anti-Arab racism everywhere, particularly in comments about her background and her faith.                 Such experiences structured her and many other young Arab Americans’ thinking about race and identity.                 “For so many of us, being counted as White doesn’t reflect our day-to-day experiences,” AlMufti said. “We know that we’re not invisible to the government. They clearly see us. We wouldn’t be the targets of discriminatory counterterrorism programs if they didn’t.”                 The whitewashing of Arab Americans, she added, feels like a dispossession of culture, “a violent act of erasing our existence and diminishing our collective identity and power.”                 Crucially, visibility isn’t always an uncomplicated good. At times, it can be attended by heightened vulnerability.                 “Some people think that identifying themselves (as Arab American) can put a target on their back, so we have to think about it from that side as well,” AlMufti said.                 Still, there are lots of benefits to securing greater visibility on the census and elsewhere.                 “An identifier is important for every single reason we can think of,” said Maya Berry, the executive director of the Arab American Institute. “It’s important for the trillion dollar-plus federal budget, the voter registration ballots, the classes for English as a second language. I can’t think of a way that data and information don’t affect everyday life. For us to be rendered invisible data-wise, it’s harming the community.”                 The Arab population of the US is just north of 2 million, according to the 2020 ancestry survey. But advocacy groups say that there’s a severe undercount of the community due to the lack of a more concrete identifier.                 Most Arabs in the US live in and just outside of big cities on the coasts and in the Midwest. Wayne County (which includes Detroit) in Michigan, Cook County (which includes Chicago) in Illinois, Los Angeles County in California and Kings County in New York have the country’s largest Arab populations, per the survey.                 Even with the clusters on the coasts and in the Midwest, it’s clear that the distribution of the Arab population across the country is as wide-ranging as the nearly two dozen countries members of the community can trace their roots back to.                 Arab Americans have long been key components of the national fabric.                 On April 1, President Joe Biden celebrated April as Arab American Heritage Month and expressed gratitude to the community “for representing the best of who we are.”                 “The history and story of the Arab American community is deeply woven into the diverse tapestry of America,” Biden wrote on Twitter. “This National Arab American Heritage Month, I thank the community for all that you have done to help move us forward.”                 Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered a similar message that day.                 “Immigrants with origins from the Arab world have been arriving to the United States since before our country’s independence and have contributed to our nation’s advancements in science, business, technology, foreign policy and national security,” Blinken said. “The litany is long and includes Private Nathan Badeen, a Syrian immigrant who fought and gave his life during the American Revolution.”                 Arab Americans’ contributions extend far beyond the spheres of foreign policy and national security.                 “Former NASA scientist Farouk El-Baz, who led the agency’s study of the moon’s geology prior to the Apollo 11 landing, comes immediately to mind,” Mahmoud El-Hamalawy, a member of the Arab Americans in Foreign Affairs Agencies group and the communications coordinator for the Department of State, told CNN.                 “The successes of Lebanese American designer Reem Acra, the late Lebanese American poet Kahlil Gibran and the Egyptian American actor Rami Malek reinforce those contributions by showcasing to the world that America continues to be the land of possibility and opportunity for all immigrants,” El-Hamalawy added.                 Of course, this isn’t to suggest that there’s anything close to adequate representation throughout all aspects of US life. In the US Congress, for instance, the number of Arab Americans is still meager.                 Arab American Heritage Month isn’t officially honored by the entire federal government. But it isn’t difficult to detect why securing broader recognition would be significant.                 “For us to claim our place in US society, as so many others have done, it’s important to be recognized by the government,” Khalaf, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee national president, said. “We’ve contributed a lot to this country and to its success. We can’t have that erased or watered down.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/india-kashmir-files-controversy-intl-hnk/index.html,India’s latest box office smash ‘The Kashmir Files’ exposes deepening religious divides,"A new movie based on the mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s has sparked huge debate in India, with critics arguing that its graphic violence and religious stereotyping may exacerbate tensions between the country’s Hindus ...","Apr 28, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Rhea Mogul,International,"“If you don’t leave from here, we will burn your houses,” a bearded Muslim man in a traditional skullcap cries as he rallies against Kashmir’s minority Hindus.                  The packed mosque erupts in rapturous support of his disturbing call. “Go away from here,” continues the man. “Convert, leave or die.”                 This is a scene from Indian filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri’s controversial new movie, “The Kashmir Files,” which is based on the mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits – members of Hinduism’s highest caste, the Brahmin, or “priestly class” – from the restive region as they fled violent Islamic militants in the 1990s.                  Produced on a relatively small budget of around $3 million, it has become the highest-grossing Hindi film released in India during the pandemic, raking in more than $30 million since it hit theaters last month.                   A large part of the film’s success may be down to India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While India’s government did not fund the production, the movie has been praised by several prominent politicians, with some BJP-ruled states waiving tax on tickets – and others giving police officers and government workers time off to watch it.                  Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi – who has previously been criticized for failing to condemn violence against Muslims – backed the movie. During a parliamentary meeting in New Delhi in March, he said there had been a “campaign to discredit” the movie before praising the filmmaker for “showing the truth.”                   Not everyone in India agrees. While there is little doubt that many Kashmiri Pandits suffered at the hands of Islamic militants, critics have questioned the timing of the film’s release and argued that its graphic violence vilifies Muslims and reinforces negative stereotypes.                   Some have also suggested such portrayals – as well as the plot’s alleged historical revisionism – could exacerbate conflict between India’s Hindus and Muslims at a time when religious tensions in the country are increasingly hostile.                  Several videos that went viral on social media appear to show audience members screaming Islamophobic hate speech outside movie theaters and calling for boycotts of Muslim-owned businesses.                  In one, a man can be heard imploring audience members to never watch a film with Muslim actors. In another, a man tells a reporter to “stay far away” from Muslims after exiting the theater. “They can attack us again,” he is heard saying.                  Several petitions have been filed to prevent the film from being shown in local theaters, out of fear that the movie could fuel – or has already fueled – anti-Muslim sentiments.                  And some Muslims have reported fearing for their safety while watching the movie. Recounting her experience in the Washington Post, prominent Indian journalist Rana Ayyub wrote: “I left the theater, just 30 minutes into the movie, feeling humiliated and physically unsafe. A man yelled at me “Ja Pakistan!” (Go to Pakistan).”                   While some Kashmiri Pandits believe the film helps spotlight a neglected part of their history, Nitasha Kaul, a Kashmiri novelist and associate professor in politics and international relations at the University of Westminster, said the film is a “troubling” account of her community’s painful experiences of murder, violence and forced displacement.                  She believes displaced Pandits – of whom about 60,000 fled Kashmir after January 1990, according to the Indian government – have never been given adequate support and were left to battle their trauma in isolation while attempting to build new lives elsewhere.                  Kaul believes the BJP is brazenly adopting the film for political gain and to further a Hindutva ideology that seeks to transform secular India into a Hindu nation.                 “The movie is divisive and clearly has propagandist intent,” said Kaul in a phone interview. “It is Islamophobic and deeply so. It has missed numerous opportunities to portray any solidarity between Kashmiri Pandits and Kashmiri Muslims. And it has been backed by those who control the state.”                 Agnihotri has repeatedly rejected criticism of his movie.                   “The truth inspired me to make this film,” the director told CNN via WhatsApp, explaining that he wrote the script after speaking with hundreds of Kashmiri Pandit families who were impacted by the violence.                  “I believe the biggest enemy of humanity is terrorism, so I decided to make a film based on the living victims of Kashmir genocide.”                  “How can a film on terrorism be propaganda?” he added. “The film is only against terrorism. I have not criticized Muslims.”                  The BJP did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.                  Tensions in Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region, have run high for decades due to a complex and bitter territorial dispute between India and Pakistan that has, on several occasions, led to military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.                  In the 1980s, an insurgency by separatist Islamic militants began targeting Kashmiri Hindus – who were considered pro-India by the separatists – forcing thousands of people to flee their homes and killing as many as 400, though estimates vary.                  The militants also attacked fellow Muslims during the unrest, according to Kaul.                 Against this backdrop, “The Kashmir Files” follows the story of a young Hindu university student who fled Kashmir for New Delhi as a young child after his family was killed by insurgents. Raised by his grandfather and shielded from the nature of his parents’ deaths, the student goes on a journey to uncover the truth of his past, aided by old newspaper clippings. The timeline flits between the past and present.                  But according to Kaul, “The Kashmir Files” rewrites history and ignores political and geographical complexities by blaming regional instability on Muslims alone. Furthermore, she added, the movie fails to depict any of the recorded examples of solidarity between the two religious groups during the conflict – or acknowledge the violence carried out by militants against moderate Muslims.                  “The film completely collapses the multi-dimensional Kashmiri trauma into a very simplistic morality tale,” she said. “It relentlessly hammers away that Kashmiri Muslims are the perpetrators of all suffering… instead of showing any solidarity or attempts by Kashmiri Muslims to help the Pandits. It universally reduces them to terrorist figures.”                 Umesh Talashi, a Kashmiri Pandit who is now a member of the Jammu Kashmir National Conference political party, was 6 years old when the insurgency began. Speaking about the movie, he told CNN that sympathetic Kashmiri Muslims helped his father hide from Islamic militants during the insurgency.                  “I will never forget the help they gave my family,” he said over the phone from his home in Jammu. “I’m not against the depiction of cruelty against the Kashmiri Pandits in the film. But I’m against how all Muslims were depicted as evil terrorists. It is fueling hate and creating a social divide instead of healing old wounds.”                 The director acknowledged he had heard “a few stray stories” but that the film “is not about the Hindu-Muslim brotherhood,” instead choosing to focus on “victims and what happened with them because of terrorism.”                  Numerous reviews have noted that Muslims are portrayed as villains throughout the film’s historical scenes, with the men often depicted holding weapons and wearing heavy kohl-eyeliner and Islamic dress as they commit heinous acts of violence.                  Farooq Malik Bitta, a character seemingly based on real-life separatist figures Farooq Ahmed Dar and Yasin Malik, commands the most horrifying scenes, including one where he forces a Pandit woman to eat rice soaked in her murdered husband’s blood. Elsewhere, a Muslim neighbor, who at first shows concern for a Hindu family’s safety, later betrays them by giving the militants their hiding location. Muslim children are even shown tormenting a young Hindu boy.                  In the movie’s modern-day timeline, Kashmiri characters praise the BJP for revoking the region’s constitutional autonomy and bringing it under closer government control in 2019 – a move that was, in fact, criticized by many high-profile Kashmiris and international human rights organizations. A liberal university professor is meanwhile portrayed negatively because she advocates for an independent Kashmir and sympathizes with the region’s Muslims.                 When asked about if the events depicted in “The Kashmir Files” could drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims, Agnihotri said such accusations were “agenda-driven” and that his film is a “response” to “religious fundamentalist terrorism.”                  The movie has been well-received in many quarters – with reviews describing it as “must watch” and “gut-wrenching,” while others commend the actors’ performances. Aarti Tikoo, a Kashmiri Pandit and journalist, wrote that the film has “done what nobody else in the Indian cinema could accomplish.”                  “It brings out, in multiple shades, the denial of our story by the Indian bureaucracy, media, academia and intelligentsia,” she wrote. “The most gruesome acts of terror unleashed on Hindus in Kashmir and later their life in displacement and destitution in refugee camps in Jammu, have been shown with remarkable intensity, and yet poignantly.”                 And the success of the film has not surprised Agnihotri, who said he’s “very glad” that it has resonated with people. “We tried to tell honest stories as sincerely as possible.”                 He said he was also prepared for criticism.                 “I knew it would come from Western media especially because they are obsessed with Islamophobia. So many people had to leave their motherland. Nobody is talking about Hinduphobia.”                 Delhi-based film critic Tanul Thakur says the Indian film industry – which includes Bollywood and, prior to the pandemic, generated around $2.5 billion a year – has always been “invested in the idea of nationalism.” Compared to the “secular, inclusive values” of films made in the post-independence era, many of today’s storylines reflect the government’s religious agenda, he said.                  Since Modi came to power in 2014, the “tone has changed,” Thakur said in a phone interview, adding: “We’ve also seen a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment and caste-pride (in movies).”                  “The Kashmir Files,” is just one of many Hindu nationalist narratives that have proven popular among movie-goers. The 2017 comedy “Toilet: Ek Prem Katha” (“Toilet: A Love Story”), featuring Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar, is about a man who builds his wife a toilet in their small village home, a nod to the BJP’s rural hygiene campaign.                  The 2018 historical drama “Padmaavat,” which tells the story of a beautiful Hindu queen whose husband is killed by a Muslim sultan, was meanwhile criticized for glorifying the misogynistic Hindu practice of “sati” (whereby a widow self-immolates) and for depicting Muslims as barbaric.                  “PM Narendra Modi,” a 2019 biographical drama based on the life of the prime minister and played by Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi, chronicled Modi’s successful rise from poor tea seller to the most powerful man in India.                 Though nationalist movies like these rarely attract the political backing enjoyed by “The Kashmir Files,” support from the government may take the form of what is and is not shown in theaters. Indian filmmakers have faced censorship for decades, with reasons ranging from religious objections to accusations that plots are “obscene” or “immoral.”                  As a result, movies have been pulled from cinemas and even banned from being released altogether.                  Take the 2007 drama “Parzania,” which tells the real-life story of a Parsi family whose son goes missing during the Gujarat religious riots of 2002 – a time when Modi was chief minister of the western Indian state.                  Although the movie was approved by India’s Central Board of Film Certification, movie theaters in Gujarat refused to screen it.                  Writer and director Rahul Dholakia said state officials feared backlash from right-wing Hindus unhappy with the film’s portrayal of them instigating the riots, which Indian government estimates say led to more than 1,000 people – 790 of whom were Muslims – killed in communal violence, with thousands more displaced.                  Dholakia told CNN via email that he faced numerous hurdles while promoting his film.                  “The biggest challenge was to release ‘Parzania’ in the theaters, because in Gujarat they refused to give me a single screen. They canceled all my allotted shows three days before release,” he said, adding officials told him “no one will watch the film.”                 “I offered to pay for all (the) seats, so that they didn’t lose money. It was then that they said it was a matter of law and order.”                  TV shows and movies have been boycotted, and commercials even forced off air, following outcry from the Hindu right.                  In 2020, Netflix received significant backlash in India for a scene in the series “A Suitable Boy” that depicts a Hindu woman and Muslim man kissing at a Hindu temple.                  That same year, Indian jewelry brand Tanishq withdrew an advert featuring an interfaith couple following online criticism.                  In June 2021, India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting proposed an amendment to its certification process that would allow the government to re-evaluate films that have already been passed by the censorship board – a move that the BJP’s opponents said would give politicians sweeping censorship powers. More than 100 actors, filmmakers and producers penned an open letter imploring the government to rethink its decision, calling it “another blow to the film fraternity.”                 By contrast, the BJP’s overt support for “The Kashmir Files,” which opened in all major theaters across the country, is seen by some critics as a double standard – particularly given the movie’s violent content and sensationalized interpretation of historical events.                  “Hindus and Muslims have been working together to heal from the pain,” Talashi said. “Kashmiri Muslims are apologetic about the past. But when you see such propaganda, when you feel such hatred, it becomes very difficult for us to bridge that gap.”     Top image caption: Women walk past a banner of “The Kashmir Files’” outside a cinema hall in the old quarters of Delhi on March 21, 2022.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/europe/french-muslim-voters-2022-election-intl-cmd/index.html,A vitriolic election campaign marked by anti-Islam narratives has left many French Muslims feeling marginalized,"Hiba Latreche took a last gulp of water and reached for a date, her eyes flitting between the plates of food before her and her phone screen as it blinked toward 5:42 a.m., the beginning of her fast.","Apr 22, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Joseph Ataman,International,"Hiba Latreche took a last gulp of water and reached for a date, her eyes flitting between the plates of food before her and her phone screen as it blinked toward 5:42 a.m., the beginning of her fast.                 This year, the month of Ramadan coincides with the presidential elections in France, the climax of a campaign that has been marked by anti-Muslim vitriol on a scale not seen for decades.                 As France goes to the polls for the presidential run-off on April 24, many French Muslims like Latreche have been facing a difficult question: Do these would-be presidents really represent my interests?                 Considering the candidates who entered the race, the answer for many is no.                  Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate ​who will challenge incumbent Emmanuel Macron in Sunday’s final round, lists “eradicating Islamist ideologies” from France as her second manifesto priority.                  Eric Zemmour, a former TV pundit convicted three times for hate speech, racial or religious hatred, has said he wants to “save France” from Islam. Center-right candidate Valerie Pecresse declared the headscarf a “sign of a woman’s submission,” claiming with a nationalistic flourish that “Marianne is not a veiled woman.” Zemmour and Pecresse polled fourth and fifth, respectively, in the first round and have been eliminated.                 Even Macron found time in his only campaign rallybefore the first round vote to highlight the threat of Islamists and Muslim “separatists” in France, entwiningFrance’s motto of “Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité” (liberty, equality, brotherhood) with another favored French Republican value: Laicité (secularism).                 Only one candidate, the third-placed far-left politician Jean-Luc Melenchon, has historically taken a position more supportive of the Muslim community. First round polling by Ifop suggested that some two thirds of French Muslim voters backed him. He too was eliminated after the first round of voting.                  “What’s really scary with this upcoming election is that most of the (top) candidates simply rely on programs based on stigmatization of minorities, on the erosion of our most basic rights and freedom,” Latreche, a law student, said ahead of the first round.                 With the “normalization of Islamophobia, we directly face the consequences,” added Latreche, who is also a vocal activist for the civil liberties of young Muslim women.                 The French political landscape this year is vastly different from just a few elections ago. With the country’s traditionally heavyweight center-left and center-right forces struggling, the political extremes have profited.                 In the first round of the presidential election on April 10, Le Pen and Zemmour, the two far-right candidates with the most extreme policies affecting the lives of Muslims in France, ​together ​collected just over 30% of the total votes; Le Pen ​alone received enough votes to enter the runoff with 23% ​of the first round votes​. Their surge has been accompanied by a clamor of anti-immigrant and anti-Islam narratives that have dominated much of the debate and coverage.                 Strasbourg’s Grand Mosque – the largest in France – sits tucked discreetly away on a riverbank in the eastern border city.                 Many of the worshipers there say they don’t feel represented by any of the dozens of candidates who competed​ for the presidency in the first round.     Related articleOpinion: Macron flirted with the far-right. And France lost              “We’re constantly being marginalized, excluded from society and then being told that we’re not taking part in society,”said Latreche. Being refused agency and choice over her own life and contribution to society, she felt, inevitably had a negative effect on her mental health and that of her friends, she added.                 As he entered for evening prayers, Wagner Dino expressed dismay at the choice of candidates.                 “There is no one who presents himself, who really has the necessary parameters to put everything in place, to have a France united with Muslims,” he said.                 Mosque volunteer Safia Abdouni said she believes none of the candidates “know what we are going through, our daily life and what we really need.”                 “I feel that I’m not represented as a young, female student. As a young, female, Muslim student, even less,” she added.                 Yet Saïd Aalla, the president of the Grand Mosque, said that if young Muslims “want to change the situation, that can only happen with the vote.”                 Aalla did not express a preference for any of the contenders. As a cleric, he’s prohibited by French law from publicly backing a political candidate.                 In successive election seasons, hijabs and Muslim women’s headscarves have been easy targets for politicians trying to fire up support for traditional French Republican values.                 “Laicité” – or secularism – claims to ensure equality for all by removing markers of difference, rendering all citizens French first and protecting freedom of worship in the private sphere. Religious symbols are banned in ​primary and secondary schools, public office and state places of work, as well as even in some sports federations.                 “Laicité per se is not a problem,” according to Rim-Sarah Alouane, a PhD candidate in comparative law at the University Toulouse-Capitole and a specialist on religious freedoms and human rights in Europe.                 “Laicité has been transformed (and) has been weaponized as a tool for political identity in order to target the visibility of Muslims in France, of French Muslims, and especially Muslim women, and the wearing of the headscarf. So it’s more of the modern illiberal interpretation of laicité that is problematic, than laicité itself,” she said.                 Today’s laicité debate has put hijabs front and center in France’s culture wars pitting ​what conservatives describe as “secularism​” against religious civil liberties                 Le Pen and Zemmour both proposed banning ​what they refer to as “the hijab,” but neither campaign has offered detail on what exactly such a ban would encompass, or how it would be enforced. In her campaign manifesto, Le Pen has proposed banning in public all “Islamic attire,” a definition that critics say is open to arbitrary and imprecise interpretation. The French government has already banned women from wearing the niqab – a full-face veil with an opening for the eyes.      Related articleThe quest for égalité: What's at stake for women in the French election             The Macron government reacted furiously to a diversity campaign funded in part by the European Union last year, which depicted pictures of women wearing the headscarves superimposed over the same images without the head covering. The campaign tagline was, “Beauty is in diversity, as freedom is in hijab.”                  The French government demanded an investigation into the campaign and its withdrawal in France. In the words of one minister: “We can’t confuse religious freedom and a campaign for the promotion of the hijab, it’s not acceptable.”     Last month, the French Supreme Court ruled that local bar associations can ban headscarves, and other “religious symbols,” from courtrooms in the name of secularism – forcing hijab-wearing women like Latreche to choose between their career and ​the public practice of ​their faith.                 “It’s actually extremely demotivating and disheartening to see that, you know, we wouldn’t be able to help to contribute to society and to make it more vibrant despite our abilities,” Latreche said, “just because we are choosing to exercise our rights.                 “We (should) have control over our own rights and bodies and beliefs,” she said.                  Ludwig Knoepffler, a member of Le Pen’s campaign team, denied that Le Pen’s ​anti-hijab platform is done “in the name of laicité.” Rather, he ​​said the intent was to combat totalitarianism.                 “The idea is to fight the hijab as a political tool used and promoted by Islamist militants,” he said. “If you believe that the Islamist political project is indeed totalitarian, then you have to fight its distinctive signs. The same way you would ban the swastika in the public sphere, as is the case already.”                 Le Pen addressed the topic during the presidential debate Wednesday night, calling the headscarf “a uniform imposed by the Islamists.”                 Macron accused her of creating a “system of equivalence” among Islamism, terrorism and foreigners that would “create civil war.”                 Aalla, the mosque president, said France’s Muslims have the same aspirations as other citizens.                 “The Muslims of France have been here for several generations, but we still continue to regard them as strangers,” he said.                 Aalla decried the idea of a “Muslim vote.” There are Muslims who support all French parties, he said – people that hope to be taken into consideration by politicians, particularly regarding religious freedoms.                 For legal scholar Alouane, debate about the ​headscarf​ is a fearmongering distraction: “I mean, we have inflation, the price of energy has increased massively, there is poverty, our public services are being dismantled, unemployment and so on… and all we talk about, is a piece of cloth that women wear… like, seriously.”                 Aalla said that French Muslims expect France and French society to devote themselves to economic, social questions, to those of housing or discrimination, the questions “that all citizens, Muslims included, expect from their new president.”                 But for the French citizens and voters gathering to pray and break their fast amid a darkening political atmosphere, the hopes of many in their community can be summed up in one phrase: “Liberté, égalité, fraternité.”       Journalist Camille Knight contributed reporting. © 2024 Cable News Network.

His home was one of several properties in Khargone city’s Chhoti Mohan Talkies neighborhood, in India’s central Madhya Pradesh state, ​that he says were demolished by authorities following violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims that broke out on April 10 – the day of the Hindu festival Ram Navami.                 Authorities have ​defended the demolitions by saying they had acted against both “rioters” and “encroachers,” claiming the houses and shops were built illegally on public land. But Baig and others spoken to by CNN say only Muslim homes have been targeted.                 Experts say the demolitions are the tip of a far deeper problem and that this is only the latest in a string of attacks on the country’s Muslim population, fueled in part by the ​ascendance of India’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).                  They argue that Muslims in BJP-run Madhya Pradesh have been disproportionately punished following the violence, raising fears that members of the country’s ​largest minority religion – about 200 million of India’s 1.3 billion population are Muslim – are being persecuted under the BJP.                 They point to similar problems in the capital New Delhi, where ​witnesses told CNN that authorities began demolishing shops and other structures in the predominantly Muslim neighborhood of Jahangirpuri on Wednesday, days after violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims broke out following Hanuman Jayanti, a celebration of the birthday of the Hindu god Hanuman.                 For Baig, there is an extra sense of injustice.                 Baig said he and his neighbors were nowhere near the scene of the clashes.                 “I don’t know what is happening in my country,” said Baig, who ​says he has lived in the property for more than 30 years. “But all I can say is that I’m paying the price of being a Muslim.”                  The communal violence in Khargone erupted after groups of Hindu men carrying saffron flags – a color associated with Hinduism that has in recent years become increasingly politicized – marched through Muslim-majority neighborhoods on Ram Navami, a festival that celebrates the birth of the revered Hindu god, Lord Ram.                  The details of the clashes are disputed. Violent skirmishes between Hindus and Muslims erupted, with some men throwing stones and holding weapons in the air, according to video from local news outlets. Houses and cars were set on fire, and at least one person died ​– a Muslim man – in the clashes, state police told reporters. A curfew was imposed in the city to quell the violence on April 10, and some restrictions were lifted after 11 days, they said. The government said they have set aside a cumulative sum of $131,000 for families affected by the violence.                  But it is the scenes of state officials bulldozing properties that gained the most attention, with activists and citizens decrying the move as unjust and unlawful.                 Dr. Tameezuddin Shaikh was at home on April 11 when he received a phone call from a friend informing him that authorities were bulldozing his son’s medical shop in the predominantly Muslim neighborhood of Talab Chowk in Khargone.                 “I was stunned,” said Shaikh, who ​says he often provides free services to impoverished and marginalized families. “There was a curfew imposed in the city and I had not been given any notice warning of any illegality. I live far away from my medical store, and with the curfew imposed, there was no way that we could go and stop the demolitions.”                 About a dozen shops in Talab Chowk were demolished by Khargone authorities, according to Shaikh.                   Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra ​described the state’s actions ​as a form of revenge, telling reporters on April 11: “From the homes where stones were pelted, we will turn those homes to a pile of stones.” He offered no proof the ​residents whose homes were destroyed had been linked to the violence.                 Shaikh said neither he nor his son were involved in the violence. And he has served the local community from that shop for more than five decades without an issue, he added.                 “I’m a respected name in Khargone, having served people all my life,” he said. “But all the medicines and everything in my clinic worth over 10 lakh rupees ($13,000) turned to rubble.”     Related articleHijab protests spread in India as girls refuse to be told what not to wear             Muslim group Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind has filed a petition in India’s Supreme Court, urging an intervention into the demolitions, and calling them a “violation” of India’s constitution.                 According to lawyer and activist Kawalpreet Kaur, district officers “cannot take the law into their own hands and cannot be the adjudicating authority.”                  “They cannot decide who is a criminal,” she said.                   Rahul Verma, a fellow from the Centre for Policy Research, said the demolitions in Madhya Pradesh were “unprecedented.”                  “It’s not a job of the municipal office to give punishment to people who might be involved in ​stone-pelting or violence,” he said.                 Ayub Khan, a resident of the Aurangpura Square neighborhood, about 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) from Talab Chowk, lost seven shops when authorities demolished them a day after the violence.                  Khan ​says he lost more than $26,000 in the destruction, and now faces the daunting task of rebuilding without sufficient money. He plans to file a petition against state officials in the country’s Supreme Court.                 “The demolished shops had stood there for over 70 years and we never received a single (government) notice,” he said. “Indeed my shops were demolished because I am a Muslim who refused to bend before BJP leaders. The way the district administration is targeting Muslims after the violence in Khargone, it’s evident that they hate a particular community.”​                 CNN contacted the secretary for Madhya Pradesh’s Home Minister, Secretary Home Minister, Khargone’s District Collector and the police, but did not receive a response.                 Tensions between Indian Hindus and Muslims have ​been flashpoints for decades – even before India gained its independence from the British. But when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP swept to power in 2014, promising economic reform and development, experts feared his rise could signal an ideological shift ​away from the nation’s secular ​norms to​ward those of a Hindu-nationalist state.                   The BJP has its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu group that counts Modi among its members and adheres to Hindutva ideology – which seeks to make India the land of the Hindus.                  Analysts and activists feared Modi’s election would leave India’s Muslims – about 14% of the country’s population – vulnerable to exploitation.             According to Debasish Roy Chowdhury, co-author of “To Kill A Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism,” the “demonstrable subjugation and domination of Muslims through their constant humiliation and disempowerment” is “central” to the BJP’s Hindutva project.                  “It charges the party’s Hindu-right voter base, as well as helps enlist more supporters by constantly polarizing voters on the basis of religious identity through a relentless campaign of hate,” he said.                 And according to Chowdhury, Hindu vigilante groups are “increasingly allowed more leeway.”             Over the last eight years, several BJP-run states have imposed new laws that critics say are rooted in Hindutva ideology. At the same time, reports of violence and hate-speech against Muslims have increasingly made headlines across the country.      Related articleAn election in India's most populous state pits Covid-19 anger against Hindu nationalism             The most controversial new laws are in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, ruled by Hindu monk-turned-politician Yogi Adityanath. The state has introduced laws to protect cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus, from slaughter, and made it increasingly difficult to transport cattle. It has also introduced an anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                  Most recently, the BJP-ruled southern state of Karnataka banned Muslim girls from wearing ​religious headscarves in classrooms, prompting several to challenge the decision in the ​state’s top court – a battle they ultimately lost.                   According to Muslim author and journalist Rana Ayyub, Muslims are “made to feel like victims in their own country.”                  “From what I see in India right now, I feel for my Muslims,” she said. “I feel for my brother each time he goes for Namaz (prayers) wearing a skullcap during the month of (Ramadan).”                 And the demolition of Muslim-owned properties during Ramadan, according to Ayyub is “demonizing and demoralizing.”                 “It’s like (state authorities) are doing it purposefully,” she said. “They’re trying to tell us that (during) a month that is sacrosanct for Muslims, ‘we are going to humiliate your beliefs and your system’.”                 Baig continues to live in a small room in his home – the only one spared demolition – with his wife, children and ailing father.                  They have no running water or electricity. Food is running out, ​he says, and with his livelihood destroyed Baig does not know how he can afford to feed his family.                 “With temperatures touching 42 degrees Celsius (107 degrees Fahrenheit), we are struggling to soothe our crying children,” his wife Parveen said.                 Meanwhile, Khargone district officials have posted ​numerous photos and videos to their official social media, showing police patrolling the streets and bulldozing more properties.                  “Do not let harmony become divided,” read a tweet from Tuesday. “Create an atmosphere of peace and harmony.”                  But Baig ​believes that the very institutions in place to protect him and his family betray​ed him by destroying their home.                 “I want to ask the government, how can a man who struggles to make ends meet, but feeds his family by working hard each day, have the means to indulge in (violent) activities?” ​Baig asked.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The incident Saturday was the second report of vandalism at West End Islamic Center in the past six months.                 The most recent incident took place during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Police found “trash, graffiti, tables and chairs flipped inside the building” as well as a shattered glass window, Lieutenant Matthew Pecka told CNN.                 “There were no notes or specifics regarding graffiti,” said Pecka. “Henrico Police has responded, documented the incident and this remains an open active investigation. We want all community members to feel safe in their place and choice of worship.”                 Pecka added the incident is not currently classified as a hate crime and there will be increased patrols in the area.                 The previous incident took place in November 2021 and it is not known if the two incidents are related, said Pecka.

The statement includes pictures of the damage.                 “Rights of all people of faith is a founding principle of America,” read the statement. “We do not know or understand the motivation of the person(s).

The riots erupted in several of Sweden’s southern cities after burnings of the Quran by Rasmus Paludan, leader of the Danish far-right Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party.                  Paludan planned and carried out the anti-Muslim demonstration, posting a picture of himself on social media with a burning Quran and declared intentions of burning more.                 Police “don’t know for sure yet” if the riots began as a protest to the anti-Muslim rally led by Paludan, the spokesperson said, adding that the police were “looking into why and who.” CNN has reached out to Stram Kurs for comment.                 In the city of Norrköping, three people needed medical attention after being hit by police bullets during clashes between police and protesters.                  “Three people seem to have been hit by ricochets and are now being cared for in hospital. All three injured are arrested on suspicion of crime,” police said in an online statement, adding none of the injuries were life-threatening.                 The violence spread south to the city of Malmö on Saturday and continued throughout Sunday, the spokesperson said.                 Police used weapons against the rioters, the spokesperson said, but would not confirm local media reports that tear gas was used. Rioters can be seen hurling objects at police in video filmed by the Reuters news agency Sunday, which also shows vehicles ablaze.                 Police believe that people with links to criminal gangs took advantage of the situation, according to the spokesperson.                 Officers saw no further unrest on Monday but will continue to be present in Norrköping, they added.                 Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has also condemned the violence.                 Countries with Muslim majority populations have condemned the burnings of the Quran, with Saudi Arabia calling Paludan’s actions a “deliberate abuse of the Holy Qur’an.”                 In a statement published on their state news agency SPA on Sunday, the kingdom called the burnings “provocations and incitement against Muslims by some extremists in Sweden” and stressed “the importance of concerted efforts to spread the values of dialogue, tolerance and coexistence, reject hatred, extremism and exclusion, and prevent abuse of all religions and sanctities.”     Related articleThe 'anti-woke' crusade has come to Europe. Its effects could be chilling             Turkey’s Foreign Ministry denounced the “vile attacks against our holy book,” adding in a statement: “There is still hesitation to prevent Islamophobic and racist provocative acts, and committing crimes of hatred openly and publicly are tolerated under the guise of freedom of expression.”                 In Iraq, the government urged the Swedish authorities to stop “provocative” actions.                 “[The act] was considered a provocation to the feelings of Muslims and extremely offensive to their sanctities…this matter has serious repercussions on the relations between Sweden and Muslims in general,” a statement by the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Sunday.                 In a tweet, the Emirati diplomatic adviser to the president, Anwar Gargash, rejected the “hatred” and “intolerance” against Islam.                 The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs “condemned the intentional abuse of the Holy Qur’an” by the far-right, saying it is “among the extreme right-wing practices that incite against immigrants in general and Muslims in particular.”                 Kuwait “expressed its utter condemnation and disgust towards the acts of desecration perpetrated by Swedish extremists against the Holy Quran,” the state news agency KUNA said.                 And Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the action “contradicts all religious values and principles, human rights principles and basic freedoms, and fuels feelings of hatred and violence and threatens peaceful coexistence.”       Additional reporting from Reuters. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The charges against Mohammad Moiz Omar, a 24-year-old Mississauga resident, include assault with a weapon; administering noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm; possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose; utter threat to cause death or bodily harm; carrying concealed weapon; and mischief to religious property, according to the release.                 The attempted attack took place Saturday around 7 a.m. local time at Dar Al-Tawheed Islamic Centre during the dawn prayer of Fajr, police said. The mosque said in a Facebook post the suspect who walked in was also armed with “numerous other sharp edged weapons.”                 Noonrani Sairally, who’s been attending the mosque for more than a decade, told CNN Monday he heard a noise about seven to 10 minutes after the congregation started morning prayers.                 “I heard a hissing noise over the sound system followed by a scream and when I turned around, I saw this man with a can of bear spray and a hatchet in his hand,” he said.                 Sairally said that’s when worshippers, who were lined up in the middle of the mosque, immediately approached the attacker and pinned him to the ground.                   “He (the attacker) didn’t realize the spray was making noise so that immediately alerted people in the first row,” Sairally said. “One of the young fellows in that row saw the hatchet and acted very quickly to knock it out of his hand. Then everyone quickly jumped on him and pushed him to the floor.”                  The attacker didn’t say anything as worshippers waited for police to arrive because he had inhaled bear spray and was having trouble breathing, Sairally said.

Carrying saffron-colored flags and matching scarves, the men chant loudly in unison as they taunt their targets: Muslim women in hijabs who remain huddled in one corner of the street.                 The visual confrontation between their black and blue Islamic garments and the raging sea of saffron – a color closely associated with Hinduism – is symbolic of deepening divisions in the country caused, in part, by the rise of Hindu nationalism.     Makes me so sad to see the youth of India divided- pic.twitter.com/eOpFsNjuFl             What started in January as a peaceful demonstration by six Muslim students protesting for the right to wear hijabs in their state-run school has morphed into a larger movement defined by gender, religion and clothing. And the arrival, weeks later, of counter demonstrators clad in saffron is indicative of the blurring lines between the Indian state and religion.                  The orange-yellow hue, seen as a symbol of divinity in Hinduism, has been brazenly adopted by the far-right Hindutva movement and, in recent years, increasingly politicized. The movement seeks to homogenize Indian culture around Hindu values.                 For India’s Muslims, meanwhile, the hijab has become a symbol of resistance against the wave of Islamophobia spreading across the country, as women wearing the religious garment protest in various towns and cities in support of the students.                  “I started covering my head three years ago as a protest against crimes against Muslims,” said 23-year-old Muslim activist Afreen Fatima in a phone interview. She had been demonstrating in her hometown of Allahabad in northern Uttar Pradesh state.                 “But now, it has become a spiritual obligation for me. It’s an assertion of my identity. I am an Indian Muslim and I’m not going anywhere.”                 The hijab, an Islamic headscarf, is worn by millions of Muslim women around the world as a sign of modesty and privacy. But in some countries the garment has proven controversial, with critics depicting it as a symbol of oppression or arguing that it is incompatible with secular values.                  In 2004 the French government banned religious garments, including the hijab, in state schools. Seven years later France became the first country in Europe to ban all face-covering garments in public spaces, with policymakers describing the move a matter of national identity and security.      Other European countries have since followed suit with similar restrictions, though the types of veil permitted – and where they can be worn – differ.                 In India, however, the hijab is neither banned nor restricted in public spaces, and the right to practice one’s faith is guaranteed under the country’s secular constitution. But, like elsewhere in the world, Muslim women can face backlash and discrimination for choosing to wear one.                  According to Indian poet and activist Nabiya Khan, Muslim women are “imagined in an Islamic veil and seen as submissive” because they do not “fit the feminist narrative of the liberal elite.”                  “I wear (a) hijab because I want to,” she said via WhatsApp. “It serves me a religious and spiritual significance. It brings me closer to my god.”                 The conflict in Karnataka began after a small group of hijabi students were denied entry to their classrooms in the coastal city of Udupi, according to the petition they later filed in the state’s top court. In early January, the girls staged a protest outside their government-run school, demanding they be allowed inside. But their teachers refused.                 Their demonstration prompted rival protests from right-wing Hindus carrying saffron scarves and flags (such as those captured in the aforementioned video), chanting a religious Hindu slogan in support of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and demanding the girls remove their head coverings.                   The clashes proliferated through Karnataka, with the state ordering a three-day closure of all high schools and colleges in early February. Authorities in the state’s capital, Bengaluru, also banned protests outside schools for two weeks.                  Karnataka’s education minister B.C. Nagesh said he supported banning the hijab in educational institutions. Citing the state’s mandate on religious attire, the CNN affiliate CNN News-18 that Karnataka’s government “is very firm that the school is not a platform to practice dharma (religion).”                  But activists say the hijab row runs deeper than a dress code, claiming it’s just the latest in a wider crackdown on India’s minority Muslim population since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP came to power almost eight years ago.                 The BJP did not respond to CNN’s request for comment or to allegations that it advocates Hindu nationalism and is using the hijab row for political gain. When asked about the hijab controversy during a meeting with reporters in February, India’s Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, told CNN the matter was for Karnataka’s government to handle.                  Karnataka has already passed legislation that, critics say, is rooted in Hindutva ideology. Last year, the state banned the sale and slaughter of cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus. It also introduced a controversial anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                 For Fatima, the hijab row is just the latest move from authorities to quell Muslim voices.                  “This movement is us fighting for our faith, identity and religious freedom,” she said. “By wearing our hijab and taking this stand, we are telling Hindus that we are not going to back down.”                 In one of the most striking scenes from the February stand-off, a hijab-wearing Muslim student, Muskan Khan, does exactly that. In another video, which also went viral, Khan is seen being accosted by men as she gets off her scooter to hand in a school assignment.                 They heckle her, demanding she take off her hijab. But instead of complying, Khan shouts back “Allahu Akbar” – meaning “God is great” in Arabic – and punches her fist in the air.                 Her raised fist has become an icon of defiance. In an act of solidarity, scores of Muslim women have changed their Twitter profile photos to a silhouette of Khan’s raised fist, while her likeness has appeared on placards and posters at demonstrations.                  Ashish Bagchi is one of many designers and artists who have shared illustrations inspired by Khan on social media. His image depicts her walking with her head held high as saffron-tinted arms – representative of the Hindu right – encroach on her.                  Bagchi’s personal political works, which appear on his Instagram and Twitter, present a narrative of India’s shrinking freedoms.                 “What really moved me was the way she stood her ground,” he said. “What stood out for me was those men shouting and brandishing her with their saffron stoles. Sadly, the saffron color now symbolizes a particular political ideology.”                 The color saffron has roots in Hinduism – one of the world’s oldest religions – and represents peace. About 80% of India’s 1.3 billion people are Hindu, and the color is seen draped on idols in the temples, tied around the neck of cows and used as street decorations during festivals.                  But ever since the BJP swept to power with a Hindu nationalist agenda in 2014, the color has become increasingly politicized. Modi and his compatriots are often seen donning saffron-hued clothing and accessories at election rallies, while supporters wave the party’s flag (which is primarily saffron) or other similarly colored ones.                   “The appropriation of saffron is a way of signaling that the party is not just political, but deeply rooted in religion,” said Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at India’s Ashoka University, in a phone interview.                  “The color serves the purpose of a ‘uniform’ and gives BJP supporters a sense of unity and commonality.”                 The BJP’s Yogi Adityanath, Chief Minister of India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, is one high-profile figure who is almost always seen dressed head-to-toe in the color. Arguably one of the most polarizing figures in Indian politics, Adityanath – a former Hindu priest – is known for his provocative rhetoric against Muslims.                 And while not every Hindu that wears the color espouses Hindu nationalism, when politicians dressed in saffron make statements against the country’s minorities, it emboldens far-right groups to do the same, according to historian Aditya Mukherjee.                  “The religious symbolism used by the Hindu right today is a complete inversion of what Indian culture is. They have given the color a different meaning,” said Mukherjee.                  “This is not what the Hindu religion stands for. And it’s certainly not an organic feeling coming from many Hindu Indians.                 “It is a very scary moment for India,” he added, referring to how extremists have carried out violent attacks against Muslims.                      It is symbolic, perhaps, that as saffron becomes an increasingly common sight in public life, the hijab’s status in India has now been thrown into question. Karnataka’s High Court has finished deliberating over whether schools can ban headscarves or not, and a ruling is expected soon. In the meantime, its interim order to prohibit all religious clothing in educational institutes with an existing dress code or uniform, still stands.                  For the activist Fatima, removing the hijab is “like asking our women to strip.”                  “It is fathomably disturbing. It is unethical,” she said, adding that she will not be “silenced” by the growing Hindu right.                  “The options we as Muslims have to demand justice are very few. Muslim women have it worse. We don’t have the privilege to remain silent. We will assert our identity even more.”      Top image caption: Students and activists hold banners while shouting slogans during a demonstration in Karnataka after Muslim students were told not to wear hijabs in schools.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

She writes: “We are painfully seeing that refugees are selectively ...","Mar 8, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Arwa Damon,International,"Editor’s Note: Arwa Damon is CNN’s award-winning senior international correspondent usually based in Istanbul and President and co-founder of the charity INARA. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             I see parallel images in the floods of humanity coming toward me. One is happening in front of my eyes on the Ukraine-Poland border; large hands clutching little ones, tiny heads resting on weary shoulders, the constant hum of rolling suitcases. I see faces frozen in shock, etched with lines of trauma that will never fully fade. Their eyes glazed over in sheer disbelief, minds unable to comprehend the lives they have left behind.                   The other image has superimposed itself in my psyche, created by the torrent of memories from covering the 2015 refugee crisis. Back then, crowds crushed against concertina wire on the Greece-Macedonia border. A mother cradled her baby under a plastic tarp in the pouring rain, a father held up his listless feverish little girl saying, “look at her, look at her state, in Syria she was a princess.”                 Today it feels like the world has woken up and finally realized how ruthless and murderous the Russian government is. As if for years Syrians were not dying under the same Russian bombs. As if countless Syrian voices were not begging the world to help them. At the time, they asked me, “why doesn’t the world care about us?” But I could never answer the question without crushing them even more. How do you tell someone their life is not part of a geopolitical calculus, that in the grand scheme of the puppet masters their life is not worth all that much?                  We are painfully seeing that refugees are selectively welcomed, and war criminals are selectively punished. It’s not just the western media that is biased; it’s the western world.                 I hear it in the rhetoric coming out of from politicians, journalists and global leaders. Rhetoric about how Ukrainians are a “prosperous middle-class people,” “the family next door,” “civilized.”  As if what is defined as a human worth saving is identified by the color of their skin, the language they speak, the religion they practice or where they were born.      Refugee tells CNN he was told they were 'not allowing Blacks' to board train             The ugly truth is our humanity is skin deep. And it breaks my heart.                  Today in Poland I see the beauty of what can happen when refugees are welcomed. When kindness and compassion is what greets those on the run for their lives. When hundreds of volunteers wait for bus after bus with signs offering free rides and warm places to stay. When security forces of the host nation facilitate movement, provide information and shelter. When a stranger says, “It’s OK, you are safe now, what can I do for you?” ​                 Again, I flash back to what happens when refugees are not welcome. In 2015, none of the restaurants or cafes around Hungary’s Budapest train station allowed refugees inside. Those fleeing were corralled like cattle by security forces until they broke through and just ran. Miles and miles of people walking, hoping and praying someone would show them mercy.                    There was so much anti-refugee rhetoric from European governments and populations back then, shrouded in fears that ISIS would infiltrate, that those on the road were “too different.”  And yes, this was also at the peak of ISIS’s bombings in Europe. But it was also the peak of ISIS and other terrorist groups attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond.                  At the heart of this is the sad reality, that the refugees I’ve reported on in years past were from the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan and were deemed “the other” by many in the Western world. And for some reason that made their pain and suffering unrelatable.                 I told the world on CNN the Syrians are like anyone else; they had dreams, homes, a sense of security they believed in. I felt like it was not resonating, not penetrating. For the vast majority of our Western audience, they remained “the other.”                  As a journalist, I often ask myself: Did I somehow fail back then? How could I have told those refugee stories to make the world care? I have carried that guilt with me for years, still even today. Because surely, there should have been a way to show the Western world – the same world now standing with Ukrainians; that the Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and others who took this same path through Europe are just like them.                  I am Arab American, but my appearance – light skinned, green-eyed, fair haired – is so outside of the Arab stereotype no one questions if I belong.                  I see Syrian and Iraqi faces in those of the Ukrainians. And I’m taken back to Greece in 2015 when an elderly, elegant Syrian lady fleeing for safety in the mud grabbed my arm, her touch as soft as my Nana’s.                  I remember that same year, a woman in Hungary asked us not to film, not because she was worried about the security of her family still in Syria, but because she did not want them to see her humiliated, sitting on the ground, dirty.      'He has decided to destroy the whole world': Six global voices on Putin's invasion of Ukraine             This week I looked at the Ukrainian women and children filing on the waiting buses, and I am so relieved for their sake that their refugee story is different.                 It wasn’t all bad. I did witness some heartwarming moments in 2015. People on the highway connecting Hungary to Austria stopped with strollers, food, and water for the refugees. Apologizing for the behavior of their government saying, “We are not all like that.” And at makeshift gathering points local efforts did eventually combine with those of larger charities to provide basic shelter. But none of it compares to what I am witnessing here in Ukraine and Poland.                  At every refugee relocation center and border crossing, there are mountains of clothes, stuffed animals, strollers, and so much more. An entire system and army of volunteers working together to help fleeing Ukrainians in need.                  I remember when then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would take in one million Syrians. The refugees I was with in Hungary began weeping with joy; finally feeling welcome and no longer treated like unwanted garbage. But ultimately as the months dragged on, Europe’s bigger solution was to cut a deal with Turkey to close the migrant route, freezing those on the road in limbo.                 Seven years later, many of them are still in the same camps and makeshift centers, their lives stagnant. Some children born in the camps have never known a real home. Many are likely unaware Syrians are still in these makeshift camps.             I juxtapose those memories with what is happening across the world today, with so many nations declaring all Ukrainian refugees welcome. I see Western nations offering these refugees yearslong residencies, work permits and free transit into other countries.                  I see how Western and other powers express outrage over Ukraine, the very same nations that, at best, offered lip service when it came to Syria and those that just kept their mouth shut. I see country after country, western and non, unified in pressuring Russia, slapping harsher sanctions than ever before. I see credit card companies denying use in Russia, airlines stopping services and products being boycotted.                  No matter where they are from, the refugees’ emotions are so similar: the inability to comprehend how their reality became so suddenly and violently altered, and the survivors’ guilt that ravages those who fled, even if to save their children, even if rationally it was the only choice.                 Each war is its own, its outlines drawn by powers larger than the individual, and by the greed and cruelty of geopolitics. But the pain of humanity caught up in the tug-of-war remains the same. The agony of realizing that not only is home no longer safe – it may no longer exist at all.

Some of those comparisons went overboard, causing outrage in the Arab world.","Mar 4, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Abbas Al Lawati,International,"Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index              Latest Market News              Hot Stocks              The Middle East found itself dragged into coverage of the conflict in Ukraine  over the past week as journalists descended on the country to cover the biggest European war in decades.                   Western war reporters, more used to being deployed in Middle East conflict zones, were quick to make comparisons. Some of those comparisons went overboard, causing outrage in the Arab world.                  “This isn’t a place, with all due respect, you know, like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades,” said CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D’Agata, referring to Ukraine. “You know, this is a relatively civilized, relatively European… city.” He later apologized.                  Other news outlets poured sympathy on Ukrainian victims, with interviewees and correspondents pointing out that, unlike Middle Eastern refugees, Ukrainian victims were “white,” “Christian,” “middle class,” “blonde” and “blue eyed.”                  In a matter of days, hashtags, and even t-shirts, featuring the phrase “civilized” surfaced in the Middle East in protest.                   The media coverage prompted the New York-based Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association to issue a statement condemning the “pervasive mentality in Western journalism of normalizing tragedy” in places like the Middle East.                  Its president Hoda Osman, who has reported for several Western media outlets, including France24, ABC News and CBS News, said the contrast between coverage of Western victims versus Middle Eastern ones demonstrates a dehumanization of the latter.                  We asked her why she feels this is happening and what can be done about it.      Western news outlets have many more minority journalists than they used to. Has that diversity trickled down to coverage?              There’s no doubt that having more minority journalists would lead to better coverage, whether it’s through catching misinformation, bias and racism, booking interviews with knowledgeable people who understand the nuances, offering background and context or helping with something as simple as correct translations and pronunciations.                   Over the past 16 years, we’ve seen the number of journalists of Arab and Middle Eastern descent working in the Western media grow significantly. There’s also more diversity in the type of media outlets [Middle Easterners] are a part of, from local TV stations and newspapers to occupying senior positions at national and international news outlets. But we still need more. Simply being in the room makes a difference and results in improved reporting.         Is the level of bias that you see in the Western press unprecedented? What’s the difference this time?              What is sad this time is that the [offending] comments came so casually, spontaneously, and as a result, revealed existing bias, something we would expect a journalist covering an international event to be above.                  Sadly, we were not shocked. The remarks got some attention thanks to social media, but we knew this kind of bias and racism exists.         How seriously do you think news outlets are taking these claims of bias?               I think public pressure will have some impact. I also expect that many organizations truly want to do the right thing.                  We have called on newsrooms to train correspondents on the cultural and political nuances of regions they’re reporting on, and not rely on American- or Euro-centric biases.       Do you think now that Western journalists have covered a European war they will be more sympathetic to victims of Middle Eastern wars?               To be honest, I don’t think it even matters whether or not they do. We are just asking journalists to be journalists and do a good job of reporting without inserting their own biases into the story and making unnecessary comparisons.        The transcript has been edited for length and clarity Saudi Arabia ready to mediate between all parties on Russia-Ukraine               Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received a phone from Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday and offered to mediate talks between Moscow and Kyiv.      Iran says it can reach top oil output two months after nuclear deal              If a nuclear deal is reached, Iran will be able to ramp up its oil production to max capacity in less than two months, Oil Minister Javad Owji was quoted as saying on Thursday.      Up to 20,000 Ukrainian tourists stuck in Egypt, awaiting return to Europe               As many as 20,000 Ukrainian tourists are stranded in Egypt as the Ukrainian embassy in Cairo arranges to fly them to Europe. They are mainly residing by the Red Sea resorts, said Ukrainian diplomat Yevhen Zhupeyev in a news conference in Cairo.       As part of our commitment to safeguarding the #ArabianLeopard, today, on #ArabianLeopardDay, the 10th of February, let's together build and share awareness for the plight of these Critically Endangered majestic cats.             Human intervention has led to the number of Arabian leopards in Saudi Arabia to dwindle to less than 200. The kingdom is now trying to change that.                  Saudi Arabia last month launched an awareness campaign to shed light on the critically endangered feline, as authorities work with conservationists to safeguard the remaining leopards.                  The smallest member of the leopard family, Arabian leopards arrived in the northern Arabian mountains almost 500,000 years ago, the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) says on its website.                  The Saudi city of AlUla is one of the oldest cities in the Arabian Peninsula and has become a hub for the kingdom’s heritage.                  Humans are the main cause driving the animals towards extinction, said the commission.                   “The expanded human presence has reduced and fragmented the Arabian leopards’ habitat,” the RCU wrote in an awareness brochure, adding that conflict between communities raising livestock in the area and the leopards’ attempts to prey on the herders’ animals lead to humans either attacking or even hunting the leopards.                   In an effort to boost awareness, Saudi Arabia marked its first ‘Arabian Leopard Day’ on February 10, where it lit up landmarks with photos of the endangered cats with the hashtag #ArabianLeopardDay. In 2019, it launched a global fund to finance conservation projects, and last September saw the birth of a rare female cub in a captive-breeding program in the city of Taif.                  Arabian leopards emerged from Africa and hold symbolism for the peninsula’s population. The commission says there may be less than 50 adult leopards left in the country. There are also few remaining in Oman and Yemen, with the last sighting in Saudi Arabia dating as far back as 2014.                  Conservation projects have also been underway in Oman since 2014, where a leopard community has taken refuge in the mountains of Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve.                  In Yemen, dire conditions resulting from ongoing war have led to neglect, with posts on social media showing the wild cats either dead or captured.      Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed.” These were the words of Ukraine’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze, during a recent BBC interview about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.                 It wasn’t so much what he said, it was more what was implied; that not all lives have equal value. And that idea – the belief that some races are superior to others – is a fundamental principle of racism. It’s alarming to me that Sakvarelidze was left unchallenged during his interview.                   As a Black, African woman without the benefit of blue eyes or blonde hair, it’s been equally emotional to see the number of racist and ignorant comments in the coverage on Ukraine that have passed unchallenged by the interviewers and media platforms that have aired them. CBS, Aljazeera, France’s BFM TV and ITV have all reported the invasion in ways that illustrate deep bias, informed by a belief system that screams of an old-world, White-led, order.                  ITV News correspondent Lucy Watson on ITV reporting back to the studio summed up the collective hypocrisy and underlying narrative that the Ukrainian war has exposed when she said: “The unthinkable has happened…this is not a developing, third-world nation; this is Europe!”     We can't ignore the darker sides of global unity on war in Ukraine             According to the narrative she believes, “unthinkable things” happen only in “third world nations” (now an outdated and derogatory term, someone should tell her), and that narrative is perpetuated by the type of stories she and many like her, have heard about the continent.                  In Africa, it’s the stories of conflict in Ethiopia, insurgency in Mozambique, election violence in Uganda, and the recent coups in Mali, Chad, Guinea, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Guinea Bissau. But it’s clear that far too many are not paying attention to them because the people in these stories are not rich or from the Global North.                  It’s the reason why the ‘unthinkable things’ that happen in places like Africa are typically reported in terms of issues, numbers and trends – rather than the people, the emotions and the lives destroyed. In Africa our stories tend to offer simplistic analysis that lacks context and nuance, and prioritizes headline-grabbing proclamations, like this one from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about an “an epidemic of coup d’états” in response to the six coups in five out of 54 African countries over an 18-month period.                    These examples have shown us that global media is complicit in perpetuating racist narratives, by not encouraging diversity in its newsrooms and giving an unrestricted platform to reporters and influential spokespeople with implicit biases that are left unchallenged. But rather than dwelling on this, I want to share some of the facts that should make us all rethink the traditional and stereotypical ways we dismiss non-White, non-rich countries and their people.                  The traditional world order is undergoing a dramatic shift, driven by Covid-19, China, Russia, and movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter. The new world order is providing an opportunity for the world to rethink the little they know about the rest of the world.                   By 2050, Nigeria will overtake the United States as the world’s third-most-populous country with a population of 400 million people. That’s one reason enough to pay attention. Africa’s population is growing rapidly and experts predict it will account for half the world’s people growth in the next two decades.              This means that more than a quarter of the world’s population will be on just one continent – Africa. The thought that the world will be overrun by Africans (no blue eyes or blonde hair here) will be an uncomfortable idea for some people, especially if they are unaware of the roughly 125,000 millionaires, 6,200 multimillionaires, 275 centimillionaires, and 22 billionaires that exist on the continent today.      As the granddaughter and daughter of Jews who escaped Kyiv, I cannot remain silent now             Indeed, a report by the University of Southern California in 2019, highlighted how poorly Africa is depicted in the US. It also revealed that Americans seldom see mentions of Africa or Africans on TV entertainment shows or in the news.                  When they do, the portrayals are often negative and stereotyped. According to the report, most mentions of Africa (43%) appeared on national or local news and tended to be ‘hard’ news stories which often fed the stereotype. After politics (32%), crime received the most mentions (16%), while business and the economy accounted for just 8% of news coverage.                   Over 60 research papers, reports, books, academic journals that we analyzed from the year 2000 written on Africa in the media told us that poverty, conflict, corruption, disease and poor leadership were the five frames through which most stories are told about Africa.                  This persistent portrayal of a single story is the reason why over the years, Africans have fought back with hashtags like #TheAfricaTheMediaNeverShowsYou  and #SomeoneTellCNN over a 2015 CNN report describing Kenya as a “hotbed of terror,” for which it later amended. And organizations like Africa No Filter, which set out to shift stereotypical narratives about Africa, were created.  It’s the reason why the Twittersphere erupted recently when journalist Alan Macleod put together his greatest hits of racist coverage of the Ukraine invasion – thank you, Alan!                  Contrary to what negative media portrayals might have you believe, Africa actually has some of the world’s fastest-growing economies. For example, to most of the world, Rwanda is synonymous with its 1994 genocide. But with an average GDP growth predicted of 6.7 between 2021-2025, it is in the top five of the fastest-growing economies alongside India. Rwanda has been able to attract foreign direct investment and is one of the easiest places to do business in Africa (after Mauritius) according to a World Bank index. This means Rwanda and countries like Seychelles, Mauritius, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Kenya are worth considering as potential destinations for investment, not just development dollars.      'He has decided to destroy the whole world': Six global voices on Putin's invasion of Ukraine             Don’t ignore the data that shows that there are more than 400 companies that earn annual revenues of $1 billion or more in Africa, or that the second fastest-growing tourism market in the world is right here in Africa.                   It’s also unlikely that many in the Global North will know any of this because it doesn’t fit the narrative both have been fed about non-white, ‘third world countries.’                 The fastest-growing developer community and tech start-up ecosystem in the world is in Africa. Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania are ranked in the top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. This means they have some of the highest grass-roots adoptions of cryptocurrencies in the world. In fact, Kenya has been ranked first in the world when it comes to peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. Given all this digital activity, it is hardly surprising that Africa is one of the fastest-growing markets in terms of venture capital activities and financial technology.                  Africa is also regarded as the world’s second-fastest-growing and profitable payments and banking market after Latin America, according to this McKinsey study.                 The reality is that much of what is happening in Africa today is unexpected. For example, six countries; Namibia, Cape Verde, Ghana, South Africa, Burkina Faso, and Botswana have a higher Press Freedom Index rating than the USA, according to Reporters Without Borders.                 But that doesn’t fit the persistent image of a broken continent where nothing works, and where its sad, dependent people lack agency to make a change. The truth is there is new dynamic energy and entrepreneurial spirit on the continent which is a story that is largely untold, and its evidenced by the low esteem with which those in the Global North hold us.

View more opinion articles on CNN.             Russia’s unjust invasion of Ukraine is a tragedy, and its stark consequences are being played out for the entire world. As events have unfolded, the media has rightly presented the conflict as a human rights catastrophe that inspires a unified global solidarity. But many Black and brown activists and observers, myself included, are also expressing this solidarity – while critiquing the apparent double standard and racial bias evident in both media coverage of and social media response to images of largely White Ukrainians engaged in violent resistance against Russian forces.                  Western coverage of the war has highlighted how scenes of death emanating from Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine are made all the more horrifying because, “They seem just like us.” One CBS news segment went viral, primarily for all the wrong reasons, after the reporter opined that  the “relatively civilized, relatively European” country of Ukraine was not where one expected to see such heartbreaking chaos.                  That correspondent, Charlie D’Agata, issued an apology, saying, “I spoke in a way I regret, and for that I am sorry,” noting his words were an attempt to convey that Ukraine – unlike other countries – hadn’t seen “this scale of war” in recent years.                   On the BBC, Ukraine’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor described the scenes of carnage in starkly racialized terms, explaining that, “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blond hair and blue eyes being killed.”  A commentator on Al-Jazeera opined that the Ukranian refugees were not mere exiles from the Middle East or North Africa: “They look like any European family you would live next door to.”                  On French television, the attacks on Ukraine have been depicted as an unimaginable assault on “a European city” unworthy of such a transgression. In Britain, The Daily Telegraph interpreted the Russian invasion as nothing less than an attack on “civilisation itself.” One reporter on UK television noted, “This is not a developing, third world nation; this is Europe!” as if to highlight the incongruence of events that, although apparently more routine when happening in the darker parts of the world, should not occur in areas where predominantly White populations reside.                  The cumulative sum of the coverage evokes patterns of racial bias that prioritize the lives, well-being and futures of White victims of war – too often at the expense of Black lives.                   The Arab and Middle East Journalists Association (AMEJA) released a statement condemning what it called “orientalist and racist” coverage, asserting that it’s been casting largely White victims of violence, death and suffering as more worthy of the world’s moral empathy and political assistance than people of color around the world experiencing similar crises.      Refugee tells CNN he was told they were 'not allowing Blacks' to board train             The racial framing of media coverage of the crisis in Ukraine also elides the very real plight faced by Africans and others in the war-ravaged nation.      Students, immigrants and others from Africa (or who are of African descent), India and Pakistan who have been trying to flee report being delayed, sent to the back of the line or outright rejected, primarily because of their skin color. Representatives from Kenya, Ghana and Gabon – three African nations who belong to the United Nations Security Council – have lodged formal complaints alleging racism at the border where Africans living in Ukraine have sought refuge.                  “The mistreatment of African peoples on Europe’s borders needs to cease immediately, whether to the Africans fleeing Ukraine or to those crossing the Mediterranean,” Martin Kimani, the Kenyan Ambassador to the UN, said Monday. Kimani’s words were echoed by the Ghanaian Deputy Ambassador to the UN, Carolyn Oppong-Ntiri who pleaded that humanitarian aid be directed equitably toward Africans affected by this crisis, “including medical care in line with the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality.”                  The “just like us” tenor of the coverage underscores the uncanny power of race to both implicitly and explicitly shape intellectual analysis, political calculations and moral judgements.                  It also betrays a poor sense of history. The idea that, in contrast to Iraq and Afghanistan, which are presumably used to ceaseless conflicts, Europe is a bastion of peace and civility is absurd. Any student of 20th-century global history, especially as it relates to the carnage of the First and Second World War, will appreciate just how wrongheaded such sentiment is.      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              The posture of surprise over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also ignores the complicity of recent American leadership – former President Trump’s sycophantic relationship to Vladimir Putin, which in certain instances marveled at the Russian leader’s autocratic tendencies as a sign of laudable strength.                   There is some hope to be found in the United Nations’ admission that racism has hindered access to care for African and non-White refugees. No problem can be solved without first being confronted.                  The global crisis of racism, inequity and anti-immigrant xenophobia might seem secondary to the violence of the conflict in Ukraine but in truth, they are inextricable concerns. Russia’s assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty reflects the growing strength of autocratic leaders, such as Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. Similarly, the treatment of African refugees in Ukraine in the context of war illustrates the xenophobia and racial intolerance that has fueled Brexit and aspects of the anti-globalization and nationalist movements that have flourished over the past decade.                 One of the most important lessons of Russia’s war against Ukraine is that the whole world continues to watch, respond to and take cues from not only American and Western power, but more tellingly, the power of our example. No single ethnic, racial or religious group has a greater capacity for civilization, personal dignity or citizenship than others. Now is the time to stand with all Ukrainians, immigrants and refugees seeking refuge from the storm of war.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

As the granddaughter and daughter of Jews who escaped Kyiv early enough to evade the barbaric Babyn Yar massacre in 1941, when more than 33,000 Jews were shot to death by Nazi forces, my DNA is ingrained with the call to protect the Jewish people.                  To think that 80 years later, Russian forces would strike the area of the Babyn Yar memorial site and desecrate the memories of the Jews who were murdered there, is sickening.                   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rightfully tweeted, “To the world: What is the point of saying never again for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar?”                 I will not stay silent and sit back as these atrocities play out before our eyes.

When my grandfather, a tank commander in the Red Army, received advance intelligence that the Jews in Kyiv would be massacred, he mobilized his military resources and smuggled my grandmother and father to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia, where they remained until 1945.      Oppose the Ukraine war without feeding racial stereotypes             They were fortunate to have a path toward survival carved out by my grandfather, who went on to lead a brigade to liberate Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust. And despite being a Jew, he became a national war hero and received the Order of Lenin in 1954.                  Now, with Russia seemingly targeting innocent civilians in Kharkiv’s central square, and the 40-mile long Russian convoy approaching Kyiv, the United Nations estimates that more than 800,000 refugees have already evacuated Ukraine since the outbreak of war. Many of these refugees are women and children torn apart from their husbands, fathers and brothers who remain in Ukraine, banded in their determination to protect their land and defend their democratic values.                  It seems history is repeating itself less than one century later, and the heartbreak I feel stems from the understanding that this unprovoked conflict, started by yet another dangerous man, will lead to so much unnecessary suffering.                  To remain indifferent is not an option. We all have a moral obligation to halt this tragic suffering through an outpouring of humanitarian aid to the innocent refugees and victims.                  It is also critical that we all become students of history – to expose evil, to shame the dark forces of bigotry and anti-Semitism that still persist, to call out Russian President Vladimir Putin for attacking civilians and to protect the innocent children in Ukraine who are caught in the crossfire of his disturbed ambitions.      The world condemns Putin's war             It is not lost on me that Putin has tried to rewrite history and justify this war with the unhinged assertion that he is trying to “denazify” Ukraine. To invade a nation led by a proud Jewish man – and then to strike, intentionally or not, the area of a Holocaust memorial site honoring the death of thousands upon thousands of Jews is as far from “denazification” as one could imagine.                  Zelensky is Jewish. His grandfather, who fought in the Soviet Union’s Red Army during World War II, lost three of his brothers to Nazis. And out of the dark ashes of the Holocaust, the Jewish President of Ukraine is leading the emergence of a global front united against Putin’s unjustified war.                  And despite Putin’s misinformation and propaganda campaigns, Ukrainians are taking to social media to capture the reality of the Russian invasion. I personally know how powerful social media can be.                  In October 2018, I launched my own watchdog organization to combat anti-Semitism. Three weeks later, an anti-Semite killed 11 innocent Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Because I already had a strong social media following, my nascent organization’s response to that massacre exploded on social media. Since then, I haven’t stopped leveraging the power of social media to expose and hold anti-Semites publicly accountable. In the last week, we’ve seen the power of TikTok and other social media platforms as Ukrainians capture what they’re seeing and experiencing on the ground.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              And for all of us around the world watching this horrific war unfold, amplifying the truth on social media is critical, but it is not enough. To meet the needs of Ukraine’s exploding humanitarian crisis, we must take action to protect the innocent children and civilians whose lives have been upended by war.                 As Zelensky pleaded to the European Union, “We have a desire to see our children alive. I think it’s a fair one.”                  The children of Ukraine and the Jewish orphans from Odessa need our help. Let us all show up for them.       © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

On the surface, the US commando raid in Syria that left ISIS chief Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi dead may look like a game-changer, but experts warn the resurgence of the group is likely to press on undeterred.                   “Thanks to the bravery of our troops, this horrible terrorist leader is no more,” declared US President Joe Biden, hours after the end of the operation that targeted Qurayshi in the Syrian rebel enclave of Idlib.                    Biden may have hoped for the same fanfare that greeted his predecessors when they took out ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before him. But ISIS experts were quick to throw cold water on claims of a significant blow to the group. Qurayshi is no Baghdadi, and a group that once commanded a piece of territory bigger than the United Kingdom is now a guerrilla insurgency with its leadership scattered.                   But the group that delivered genocide, mass execution and oppression has proven that it remains a formidable force. A United Nations report released Friday said the terror group is far from vanquished. In fact, it remains a potent force in Iraq and Syria, with a growing presence in Afghanistan and West Africa, according to the UN analysis.                 The report – compiled by UN experts on ISIS and al Qaeda before Qurayshi’s death and covering the last six months of 2021 – said ISIS may still have up to $50 million in its coffers.                   Even before his demise, according to the UN experts, ISIS had lost several important members of its senior echelon. And yet the group remains a threat. Instability in both Iraq and Syria “indicate that an eventual ISIL resurgence in the core region cannot be ruled out,” the report concludes, referring to the group by its alternate acronym.     Related articleISIS leader killed in US raid had dark past but spent years under the radar             In Iraq, ISIS stages attacks on an almost daily basis. In Lebanon, officials says it has found fertile recruiting ground in the city of Tripoli. And the United Nations says ISIS may still have $50 million in its coffers and up to 10,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq.                   Last week ISIS launched its biggest attack in three years when the group’s fighters attempted to free inmates from a prison in northeast Syria.  It lost the week-long standoff, and hundreds of ISIS inmates, including children, as well as scores of US-backed Kurdish fighters, died in the fighting.                  The uptick in ISIS violence has the region’s security officials on edge, precisely because the picture is murkier  than it was in ISIS’ heyday, when the group seized Mosul in 2014. Then, a US-led coalition, as well as Iran-backed Shia armed groups, fought years-long battles that ultimately led ISIS territory to vaporize. Now ISIS is virtually invisible. Its spread is detectable but appears to not have a single source.                    For that reason, the US raid – as dazzling as the optics may have been to some – raises more questions than it answers. What was the ISIS leader doing in Idlib, where the group’s ostensible rivals Hay’at Tahrir al Sham, a former al Qaeda affiliate, dominates? How was he able to command cells further afield in Syria and Iraq?                     Far from reassuring observers and security officials, the devil in the details of Thursday’s operation seems to confirm what experts have been saying for months: Qurayshi was the head of a snake, but it will require a lot more sophistication and international cooperation to exterminate the pit from which he came.

She is the co-founder of The Three Hijabis and a Labour councillor for Oxford city council. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.              French lawmakers last month voted to ban women and girls from wearing hijab while playing sports – showing the world once again that when it comes to further politicizing, targeting and policing European Muslim women, our clothing choices and bodies, France is in a league of its own.                 The French Senate voted 160 to 143 in favor of the ban on wearing the hijab and other “conspicuous religious symbols” in sports competitions. The amendment was proposed by the right-wing Les Républicains, which argued the hijab could risk the safety of athletes wearing it while playing sports.                 You really couldn’t make this up.                 In France, Muslim women using their agency, and exercising their human rights to wear what they choose to wear, is deemed a safety risk. France’s attempt to apparently liberate and save Muslim women from ourselves and our headscarves is a racist and colonial project dressed up as upholding the country’s secular values. The project heaps Islamophobic harm on Muslim women.                 Indeed, it is misogynistic and hateful to force women to remove hijab – as much as it is misogynistic and hateful to force women to wear hijab.                 The proposed ban is opposed by Emmanuel Macron’s government and French lawmakers expressed “regret” over the government’s “lack of will” to put a stop to what they describe as the “development of Islamism in sport,” CNN reported. It comes against the backdrop of a forthcoming presidential election in April, where France’s domestic politics continue to lurch further to the right, and many Muslim residents and communities of color are being subjected to divisive and toxic political rhetoric on Islam, immigration and race.                  In just two years, France is also hosting the Olympics, meant to bring nations together in a united show of inclusivity on the world stage. A divisive and discriminatory hijab ban only shines a further spotlight on how ill at ease France is with building a modern multiculturalism state.                  The proposed law will now be revised by the National Assembly, which is expected to have the final word. All of which means that, for now, Muslim women playing sports in hijab have been given extra time to do so with the bill prevented from being passed in its current state.      How mega clubs deal with sexual abuse allegations is bigger than sport              France is home to roughly 5.7 million Muslims and the largest Muslim population in Europe, according to the Pew Research Center. As of 2019, 31% of French Muslim women were wearing hijab, according to Statista, so this sports ban will have a profound impact on many women. Yet again, French lawmakers have chosen to continue on a dangerous collision course with the country’s Muslim population and especially French Muslim women.                 The attempts to ban Muslim women from wearing hijab while playing sports is viewed by many Muslim women and activists I’ve spoken to as taking a page straight out of the Afghan Taliban and Iranian regime’s playbook by denying women their own agency. This ban is viewed as being about much more than denying women the right to play sports, if that wasn’t outrageous enough.                  The sports hijab ban is about further dehumanizing, minimizing and erasing French Muslim women who choose to wear hijab. It makes Muslim women targets of state-sanctioned gendered Islamophobia and right-wing hate.                  I’m one of three British Muslim women campaigners and passionate football fans calling ourselves “The Three Hijabis.” Last summer, alongside Amna Abdullatif and Huda Jawad, I launched a viral petition calling on England’s Football Association, the British government and tech companies, to work on banning racists from football for life, following the abuse inflicted on three young Black England players after the Euro finals at Wembley against Italy.                  The campaign has garnered 1.2 million signatures. Within 48 hours of our petition launching, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stood in parliament committing his government to working on delivering our demands.                 Our campaign made headlines in the UK and received global media attention. However, if we were three French Muslim women, we likely would not have been permitted to enter the country’s mainstream public or political space in the same way – simply because we wear hijab.     This is what victory at the Beijing Games looks like              It’s a stark contrast I have experienced first-hand. In 2015, I presented a BBC documentary about what it means to be young, French and Muslim in France following the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in Paris. As part of the documentary, I went to the French parliament to interview Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, France’s youngest ever elected woman politician and the niece of far-right leader, Marion Le Pen.                 I was told I couldn’t enter the parliament building because of my hijab. I explained that I was a journalist, there to interview a politician. Yes, I’m a Muslim woman wearing hijab, but I’m also British – “I’m as British as fish and chips,” I told the receptionist in the hope she would understand that my hijab was irrelevant to how I do my job. The receptionist looked horrified and confused and then told me I could proceed for my interview.                  In Europe, there is a tried-and-tested winning formula for politicians hoping to appeal to voters on the right-wing fringes ahead of national elections. And that involves turning Muslim women and our clothing choices into a political football. Many a populist European politician in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Netherlands and Switzerland, and of course France, has used this tactic as a way of attracting voters. They delve into Muslim women’s wardrobes and pull out hijab, niqab and burqa as exhibits supposedly threatening the very fabric of western values and way of life.                 In France, we have of course been here before. Multiple times. In 2004, France banned the wearing of hijab in schools alongside Christian crosses and the yarmulkes, worn by observant Jews. The ban was imposed, so the state said, on the grounds that state institutions are supposed to be “religiously neutral.”     Then in 2010, France became the first country in Europe to impose a ban on full face veils, known as the niqab, in public spaces including public transport and parks, streets and administrative buildings. Women caught wearing a niqab in public space face a 150 euro fine and being arrested by the police.      French lawmakers have proposed a hijab ban in competitive sports. The impact on women could be devastating.              In 2016, authorities across 15 towns and municipalities across France banned the “burkini” – an all-in-one modest swimsuit that covers the whole body except the face. Again, the ban was imposed to supposedly uphold France’s secular values.                 And in May 2020, when France, like many countries across Europe and the world, made face masks mandatory in some settings like public transport to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus, France’s full face veil ban remained in place. Meaning, while French citizens were required to cover their faces by law, French Muslim women citizens covering their faces with the niqab continued to face the prospect of being fined and arrested by police.                 In 2018, the United Nations Human Rights Committee said France’s ban was a violation of religion and could impact Muslim women by “confining them to their homes, impeding their access to public services and marginalizing them.”                 When it comes to hijab and how Muslim women choose to dress, there is widespread cognitive dissonance in the French republic, illustrated once again in fine fashion by a recent Instagram post by Vogue France hailing actor Julia Fox’s arrival at Paris Men’s Fashion Week while wearing a Balenciaga trench coat, with a black headscarf, sunglasses and the caption: “Yes to the headscarf!”                 The post attracted widespread criticism from Muslim women and others pointing out the double standard of a white, wealthy, famous, American actress being praised for wearing a headscarf as a fashion choice – while a French Muslim woman choosing to wear a headscarf in her own country faces restrictions on her life choices and movements and possibly being fined and criminalized by the state. Vogue France later deleted the Instagram post.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              This is the hypocrisy that France must grapple with.

An apology followed, along with a two-week suspension – but the controversy has forced deeper questions about the history and evolution of race and identity in the US.                  Goldberg made her comments during a conversation about a Tennessee school board that removed Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel series “Maus,” about the horrors and trauma of the Holocaust, because of alleged concerns about “rough, objectionable language” and nudity.                 Swiftly, various groups pointed out as false the actor and comedian’s assertion that the genocide of 6 million Jews had nothing to do with race.                 “Racism was central to Nazi ideology. Jews were not defined by religion, but by race. Nazi racist beliefs fueled genocide and mass murder,” the US Holocaust Museum wrote in an apparent subtweet.                 The Auschwitz Memorial Twitter account directed Goldberg to a “seven-chapter online course” about the Holocaust.                 To better contextualize the events of the past week, I spoke with Emily Tamkin, who’s a senior editor at The New Statesman and the author of two books: 2020’s “The Influence of Soros: Politics, Power and the Struggle for an Open Society” and the forthcoming “Bad Jews: A History of American Jewish Politics and Identities.”                 The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.     When you heard Whoopi Goldberg’s comments, what were your thoughts?             My first reaction was that I think that she’s probably one of many people, specifically one of many Americans, who thinks this. And I say that because I think that the US has a very specific conception of race and racism. And people can, without ill intention, assume that that construct is held across time and space – that because this is what racism has always meant in the US, it’s necessarily been understood the same way elsewhere.                 But while racism is real and has real implications for people, it, like race, is shaped around society – and by society.                 I think that it’s important to recognize that her comments were coming from a place of ignorance, not hatred. That distinction matters, and I hope that we can keep it in mind in these discussions.     Why do many Americans appear to struggle to understand the relationship between antisemitism and racism? Does it have anything to do with the history of race here?             If you go back to the 1790 Naturalization Act, the criterion for naturalizing as a US citizen was Whiteness. I think that some people think that Jews “became White” in the postwar period and as we moved into the suburbs and through the GI Bill. Many American Jews did move into what we think of as mainstream American suburban life at that time. But most American Jews, for most of American history, have been legally coded as White.                 Now, there were exceptions. For example, there was a stipulation in the state of Maryland’s constitution until 1826 that said that Jews cannot hold public office. And there were instances of antisemitism throughout that period, particularly at the turn of the century, when more and more Jews from Eastern Europe started coming over and there was an influx of immigrants. But most American Jews have enjoyed Whiteness under the law.                 If you look at my great-grandparents, under the census around the turn of the century – the early 1900s – they were recorded as White. Also around that same time, there were many more Jewish immigrants coming in, and that was actually an issue, because the status of American Jews as White was challenged, because here came people who were far greater in number and further culturally removed, and they thought of themselves as ethnically distinct. And the US didn’t really have a framework to process them, because it thought in terms of Black and White.     Related article'It is really dizzying for our community': Growing antisemitism forcing Jewish Americans to be more vigilant             Now, interestingly, you had Jewish thinkers and some communal leaders at that time who were very intentional about defending Jews as White. Why? Because they understood that in the US, Whiteness brings with it rights and privileges. That remained true, by the way, even though in the ’20s, immigration legislation was passed that restricted immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe.                 That’s the US context. You had this one understanding of racism really shaped around White and Black, and people, many of whom came from somewhere else where the thinking was different, were being slotted into that. Meanwhile, an ocean away, you had Nazi Germany, where the construction was just different, where Adolf Hitler was writing very specifically about the “German race” and the necessity of racial purity and the superiority of “Aryan blood.” And, by the way, it wasn’t only Jews whom Hitler thought of as racially distinct. He also drew a distinction between Germans and Slavs. We might look at all that and say, “They’re all White people.” But, again, it was a different context, so the understanding of race was different.                 Recent discussions have raised the question of the Whiteness of Jews. What I’d say to that is, one, not all Jews are White, but also, in my day-to-day in the US, I go about as a White woman. If we were in Europe in the early 20th century, I would’ve been understood differently.     The Tennessee school district’s decision to pull Art Spiegelman’s “Maus” exists in the same environment in which laws are empowering school districts across the country to ban a variety of books related to identity and histories of oppression. What do you make of all this?             I think that it’s really important that the ban of this book is considered within this broader context. You have “Maus” being banned. You have the report out of Southlake, Texas, where a school leader said – a superintendent later apologized – that if you teach about the Holocaust, then you also need to teach “opposing” views. Which: I don’t even know what that means. You have Toni Morrison’s work being banned. You have LGBTQ books being challenged.                 To me, what stands out is that you have school board members and legislators and parents saying: “Well, we just don’t want our kids hearing this language at a young age.” And: “We want our kids to be proud of the US – to be proud of their history.” All of this made me remember that when I was around 9 years old, somebody drew a swastika on a bathroom stall at my school. I’m sure that my parents didn’t want me to encounter that when I was 9. I’m sure that your parents would’ve liked for you to encounter racism later in life than you did. I’m sure that the children who are working through their sexuality or whose parents are members of the LGBTQ community have questions and would like to have access to materials.                 I’m not equating being Jewish in the US with being Black in the US or with being gay in the US. I’m saying that there’s so little regard for anything that challenges the feelings of White Christian straight America – and so little regard for the feelings of any other parents or their children. I don’t think that that’s conducive to educating kids, and it’s certainly not conducive to teaching history, because what this discussion really gets at is the fact that these are complicated, messy issues, and that history is nuanced – but that learning it is what will help us grapple with the world around us today.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

He was an Iraqi religious scholar and was a driving force behind the group’s brutal persecution of Yazidis.,"Feb 4, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Tim Lister,International,"In the early hours of Thursday morning, the head of ISIS died during a US raid in northwest Syria just as the extremist group was in the midst of a revival.                  Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi killed himself and his family after igniting a bomb at the beginning of the operation, according to a senior Pentagon official.                  Qurayshi succeeded ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019 after his demise. When Qurayshi took over the organization, the vast swathes of territory the group controlled – an area larger than the size of the United Kingdom at its peak – had largely vaporized. Observers dubbed him a Caliph without a Caliphate. Yet he sought to reinvigorate the organization.                  In recent months, he oversaw a resurgence of ISIS in various parts of Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Iraq reported an uptick in violence linked to ISIS. In the Kurdish-controlled northeastern part of Syria, the group staged a lethal days-long attempted jail break in a bid to free ISIS members. Hundreds of inmates, including children, died. Scores of Kurdish fighters also perished in the clashes.                  In Lebanon, multiple regional and local reports have indicated that the group has been recruiting scores of  members from the northern city of Tripoli, one of the areas hardest hit by the country’s devastating economic crisis.                  Throughout it all, Qurayshi – who was known by several aliases – kept a low profile, much like his predecessor. The US Rewards for Justice program offered a reward of $10 million for information about him. His history in the organization is also murky. But snippets from interviews with ISIS prisoners paint a picture of a man with a dark past as a member of Baghdadi’s inner-most circle.                  Qurayshi became a “religious scholar” with al Qaeda in Iraq, before the group rebranded itself as the Islamic State. In 2014, he “helped drive and justify the abduction, slaughter, and trafficking of the Yazidi religious minority in northwest Iraq,” the Rewards for Justice notice says.                  Much of the Yazidi community lived in an area close to what some analysts believe was Qurayshi’s home town of Tal Afar in northern Iraq. In 2014, after ISIS had taken Tal Afar and Mosul, the group enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and children and murdered thousands of Yazidi men, in what the United Nations has called a genocide.                  The Commission for International Justice and Accountability, an NGO that investigates and gathers evidence of major international crimes such as terrorism, said Qurayshi was “one of the key architects of the Islamic State slave trade in Yazidi women and children.”                 “He personally enslaved and raped captive women,” said Nerma Jelacic, the group’s deputy director.                  Counter-terrorism expert Daniele Raineri has noted that he was “the deputy who managed to spend the years since 2010 almost totally under the radar.” But when others in the ISIS hierarchy were taken or died in battle, he became one of the group’s leading ideologues.                  In a 2018 interview with Saudi-owned al Arabiya, a senior ISIS detainee in Iraq, Ismael al Eithawi called Qurayshi “the most prominent of Baghdadi’s surrounding circle.”                  A 2018 internal ISIS document repeatedly describes Qurayshi as “the deputy” to Baghdadi. He died in an operation similar to that which killed Baghdadi. And it is yet unclear if the operation will stem the group’s resurgence or if the cycle of extremist violence will continue undeterred.                  ISIS has not acknowledged his death and it’s as yet unclear who may replace him. Few if any of Baghdadi’s inner circle are thought to be still at large.

At that moment, he quickly realized the atrocities his family survived were unknown to many.                 The other boy drew the symbol without knowing its meaning simply because it caught his eye, said Igel, who is now 41 years old.                 Decades after that encounter, Igel and many other Jewish people in America are reminded in 2022 that ignorance and intolerance continue fueling perceptions about their communities. In recent weeks, a hostage standoff in Texas, vandalism at two Chicago synagogues, flyers with anti-Semitic language being distributed in several states and even “The View” host Whoopi Goldberg’s comments on the Holocaust have made Jewish people more vigilant and highlighted a “growing crisis” in the United States, experts and Jewish advocates said.     Related articleAs a Holocaust survivor, I'm deeply saddened by Whoopi Goldberg's 'careless' words             “You see anti-Semitism coming at Jews from all sides,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). “It is really dizzying for our community, and it’s a growing crisis for the country.”                 Anti-Semitism persists nearly 80 years after an estimated six million Jewish people and five million others were killed as a result of the Nazis’ racist ideology during the Holocaust. Anti-Semitic incidents in the US have been on the rise for years, with 941 incidents in 2015 and 2024 incidents tracked in 2020 by the ADL.                 “These issues are happening in our houses of worship, and in the supermarkets where we shop and in the communities where we live,” said Greenblatt, adding that in-person incidents are only a portion of the hate, compared to the threats and harassment that happen online and is “a tremendous problem.”                 Although Greenblatt and others in the Jewish community have accepted Goldberg’s apology after she falsely declared on “The View” that the Holocaust was “not about race” this week, many still see it as a clear sign of the need for more education about the Holocaust.                 A 2020 survey of 11,000 Americans, commissioned by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, showed a “worrying lack of basic Holocaust knowledge” among adults under 40.                 More than half of respondents were not aware that six million Jews were killed, 48% could not name a concentration camp where Jews were taken during the Holocaust and 11% said they believed Jews caused it, according to the survey.                  Igel, who chairs the Florida Commissioner of Education’s Task Force on Holocaust Education and the board of The Florida Holocaust Museum, has made it one of his goals to fight for more education.                  “It’s on me, it’s on you because the survivors are no longer going to be here very soon,” he said.                 Igel’s grandparents were Polish farmers and got married the night Adolf Hitler invaded Poland. He says they would tell him stories about how various other farmers hid them and eventually helped them escape.                  “My grandfather had a thick accent you know, he would always say it was the worst in people but we always want you to know it was the best in people, too,” Igel said.                 For him, the Holocaust must be discussed and taught in schools because the “absence of these lessons leads to a lack of empathy.”                 Across the country, there are only 22 states that require some form of Holocaust education in K-12 schools, according to the US Holocaust Museum. The states’ mandates vary from annual Holocaust remembrance weeks to providing a manual to history and literature teachers that “emphasizes the causes and ramifications of the Holocaust and genocide.”                 But in recent months, there have been a number of controversies surrounding how the Holocaust is being taught and the materials used by teachers. In January, a Tennessee school board removed the graphic novel “Maus” by Art Spiegelman from the eighth-grade English language arts curriculum, citing “rough, objectionable language” and a drawing of a nude woman.      Related video'Maus' author reacts to his book being pulled from curriculum             “Maus,” which was initially serialized and then published in two volumes in 1986 and 1992, is a blend of historical fiction and memoir that follows Spiegelman’s Jewish parents in 1940s Poland, from their early experiences of anti-Semitism to their internment in Auschwitz. It depicts Jewish people as mice and Nazis as cats.                  Last year, a staff member at a Washington, DC, elementary school was investigated after allegedly telling third-grade students to reenact incidents from the Holocaust and a school administrator in Texas told teachers that if they have books about the Holocaust in their classroom libraries, they should also include books that present “opposing” views.             “It was the antisemitic, systematic murder of 6 million Jews and there is no legitimate ‘opposing’ perspective to that,” said Joel Schwitzer, regional director of the American Jewish Committee, Dallas.                 Security has become a concern for Jewish synagogues and the attack on worshippers at the Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas last month has led more Jewish leaders to seek help to keep their congregations safe.                 Evan R. Bernstein, the national director and CEO of Community Security Service, which trains volunteers to help secure synagogues and Jewish institutions, said he had been concerned that the Jewish community was not taking threats seriously because deadly shootings at synagogues in Poway, California, and Pittsburgh were no longer “top of mind.”                 A few weeks before the standoff in Texas, he says, some synagogues he had been in touch with did not appear to have an interest in taking “a deeper dive on security.”                 Since the standoff, the group has seen an increase in calls and has scheduled multiple trainings every night over the next month.                 “There’s been more and more investment in security in the different major cities and communities around the country but it needs to stay that way. I think there needs to be reminders and the reminder shouldn’t have to be a Colleyville,” Bernstein said.     Related articleJewish communities across the US are on heightened alert after the Texas standoff: 'Is our community under attack again?'             In the weeks since the standoff, a man was arrested after being accused of spray-painting swastikas on columns at Union Station, another man in Chicago is facing hate crime charges in connection with a series of antisemitic vandalism incidents at synagogues and Jewish schools, and  anti-Semitic flyers were distributed to homes in South Florida and at least five other states.                 While those incidents were not violent, Bernstein says, there’s been a continuation of the wave of anti-Semitism the country had seen in the years prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, which may have slowed down in-person incidents but continued being “rampant” online.                 For Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish community has been vigilant and resolute as they face anti-Semitism in various ways but only an interfaith and wider response is needed to stop hate and bigotry.                 “Just like I would say to you that racism is not simply an issue for Black Americans and it’s an issue for all Americans,” he said. “I would say anti-Semitism isn’t just a problem for the Jewish people. It’s an American problem that demands an American solution.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Riggs Kwong, 50, was off-duty when the incident occurred on January 16, according to a news release from the office of Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez.                 Kwong was charged with “third-degree assault as a hate crime, third-degree menacing as a hate crime, third-degree assault, third-degree menacing, second-degree aggravated harassment, falsely reporting an incident and improper use of colored or flashing lights,” according to the release.                  Kwong pleaded not guilty on Monday, the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office told CNN in an email. He has been released without bail and will return to court on March 22, the DA’s office said.                 Kwong was suspended from the NYPD following his arraignment, according to the department.                  He has been an officer with the NYPD for 18 years, according to his department profile.              CNN reached out to Kwong’s attorney, Thomas Tuffey, for comment but has not heard back.                 On January 16, Kwong blocked the victim from driving down Church Avenue, the DA statement said, citing an investigation. The victim then followed Kwong and drove in front of his car as he was turning onto a service road.                 Kwong then allegedly videotaped himself saying to the victim, “I’m trying to make a left here on the service road and this terrorist is terrorizing me, you’re upset because I didn’t let you make a U-turn, Mr. Mohammed … Al Qaeda, terrorist, ISIS…,” according to the press release.                  The victim exited his vehicle to take a picture of Kwong’s license plate and got back in his vehicle while Kwong continued to use racial slurs, according to the press release, and the victim once again exited his vehicle to slap the hood of Kwong’s vehicle.                  Kwong then exited his vehicle and allegedly spat in the victim’s face and the victim spat back. Kwong punched the victim several times, “causing him to fall to the ground and continued to punch him and use anti-Muslim language,” according to the press release.                  When the victim stood up, Kwong punched him again, causing him to fall and lose consciousness, the district attorney’s office alleges.                 Kwong called 911 and told the dispatcher, as well as NYPD officers who responded to the scene, that the victim threw the first punch, according to the press release.                  According to the Brooklyn DA’s office, video surveillance from the scene allegedly shows Kwong punching the victim “without the victim ever punching the defendant.”                 This case is being prosecuted by the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Hate Crimes Bureau.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Earlier this month, McMinn County, Tennessee, Board of Education removed the book from its eighth-grade English language arts curriculum, citing “rough, objectionable language” and a drawing of a nude woman.                 During the roundtable discussion, Goldberg said she was surprised that the nudity in “Maus” – and not the Holocaust itself – is what appeared to concern the school board, while co-host Joy Behar replied that the nudity concerns were likely “a canard to throw you off from the fact that they don’t like history that makes White people look bad.”                 “Well, this is White people doing it to White people, so y’all gonna fight amongst yourselves,” Goldberg said, referring to the Holocaust.                 While none of the co-hosts pushed back after that statement, the conversation then turned to how some are attempting to ban problematic parts of the nation’s history, particularly history dealing with race and racism, from being taught in schools.                 Goldberg responded: “If you’re going to do this, then let’s be truthful about it because the Holocaust isn’t about race.” She added that the Holocaust, which saw an estimated 6 million Jews and 5 million others killed as a result of the Nazis’ racist ideology, was about “man’s inhumanity to man” and said it involved “two White groups of people.”                 In a statement late Monday, Goldberg said she made an error with her comment.                 “On today’s show, I said the Holocaust “is not about race but about man’s inhumanity to man.” I should have said it is about both,” she wrote on Twitter.             “As Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League shared, “The Holocaust was about the Nazi’s systematic annihilation of the Jewish people – who they deemed to be an inferior race.” I stand corrected.”                 She added: “The Jewish people around the world have always had my support and that will never waiver. I’m sorry for the hurt I have caused.”                 While many Jewish people today are seen as White because of their skin tone, whether they should be characterized this way remains a subject of debate given that Jews across the world continue to face blatant anti-Semitism. In Nazi Germany, Jewish people were considered a “race” – the Nazis attributed many negative stereotypes about Jews to “an unchanging biologically determined heritage,” according to the US Holocaust Museum.                  During the show, when Goldberg again insisted that the Holocaust wasn’t about race, some of her co-hosts began challenging her statements.                 Behar responded that the Nazis considered Jews to be a different race, while Ana Navarro noted that the Holocaust was “about White supremacy” with the Nazis killing both Jewish and Roma people. Sara Haines added that the Nazis did not view Jews as White.                 Still, Goldberg continued to insist that the underlying issue was one of “how people treat each other” and the segment concluded shortly after.                 The segment captured the attention of the internet, with many Jewish leaders and institutions refuting Goldberg’s statements.                 “Racism was central to Nazi ideology,” the US Holocaust Museum wrote in a tweet shortly after Goldberg’s comments began circulating. “Jews were not defined by religion, but by race. Nazi racist beliefs fueled genocide and mass murder.”                 Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, also condemned Goldberg’s remarks and she used part of his comment in her statement of apology.                 “No @WhoopiGoldberg, the #Holocaust was about the Nazi’s systematic annihilation of the Jewish people – who they deemed to be an inferior race,” he said. “They dehumanized them and used this racist propaganda to justify slaughtering 6 million Jews. Holocaust distortion is dangerous.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Cohen, the top intelligence official at DHS.                  Online forums linked to domestic violent extremists have referenced Jewish targets tied to conspiracy theories about Covid-19, the outcome of the 2020 election and “even the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and resettlement of Afghans to the United States,” according to the letter obtained by CNN.                  The joint notice comes two days after the Colleyville, Texas, hostage standoff at Congregation Beth Israel, which the FBI is investigating as a terrorist incident.                  The investigation into Saturday’s incident is still in its “initial phases,” the officials said, adding that “while this appears to be an isolated incident, and there are currently no additional specific and credible threats associated with it, we will continue to monitor all reporting to ensure this incident is not a catalyst for similar attacks.”                   The officials pointed out that the US is in a period of “heightened threat,” which includes threats from domestic violent extremists and those inspired or motivated by foreign terrorists.                  The threat is exacerbated by a divided society and the global pandemic, according to the letter, which says that in some cases, social stressors and other personal factors have mixed with ideological issues, resulting in violence.                  “Foreign influence actors have also promoted narratives online intended to sow discord in the U.S. and foreign terrorist groups continue to encourage followers to conduct attacks and use social media to incite violence,” the letter notes.                  On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said DHS will work with Congress to increase funding so faith-based communities can upgrade their security and protect themselves against terrorism, hate crimes and targeted violence.                   Congregation Beth Israel was a recipient of DHS grant funding as part of the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, according to Mayorkas.                   Funding, which is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, can be used in several ways, such as enhancing physical security, installing cameras, hiring security guards and cybersecurity upgrades. Other grant funding goes toward prevention and response programs to equip communities to identify when individuals are moving down the path to violence.                  “This kind of threat did not begin when this attack started yesterday, and it will not end with the hostages free,” Mayorkas said during a media briefing.                  He said the “harsh reality” is that there continues to be a “rise in the language of hate and its connectivity to violence.”                  “We need to ensure that we not only protect our houses of worship and all places of assembly, but that we become aware of the signs that someone is going down a path toward violence,” Mayorkas told reporters.                   CNN reported last week that a year after the attack on the US Capitol, homeland security and law enforcement officials nationwide were bracing for potential “unprecedented” levels of violence in the year ahead.                  The country remains polarized, and many people are angry and frustrated about their individual selves or society’s conditions after two years of Covid-19 upheaval, turbulent economic conditions and government restrictions, sources and nongovernmental researchers told CNN.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Why is little being done to stop them?,"At a conference in India last month, a Hindu extremist dressed head-to-toe in the religion’s holy color, saffron, called on her supporters to kill Muslims and “protect” the country.","Jan 15, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Rhea Mogul,International,"At a conference in India last month, a Hindu extremist dressed head-to-toe in the religion’s holy color, saffron, called on her supporters to kill Muslims and “protect” the country.                  “If 100 of us become soldiers and are prepared to kill 2 million (Muslims), then we will win … protect India, and make it a Hindu nation,” said Pooja Shakun Pandey, a senior member of the right-wing Hindu Mahasabha political party, according to a video of the event.                  Her words and calls for violence from other religious leaders were met with a roar of applause from the large audience, a video from the three-day conference in the northern Indian city of Haridwar shows.                 But across India, people were outraged. Nearly a month on, many are still furious at the lack of government response or arrests over the comments, which they say highlights a worsening climate for the country’s Muslims.                  After mounting pressure, India’s top court intervened on Wednesday, asking for a response from state and federal authorities within 10 days.                 Pandey and several others are being investigated by local police for insulting religious beliefs, a charge that carries a possible sentence of up to four years in prison, Haridwar police officials told CNN.                 Neither Pandey, nor the others, have publicly commented about the outcry or investigations.                 Late Thursday, police in Uttarakhand state, where Haridwar is located, arrested a man who spoke at the event, senior Haridwar Police official Shekhar Suyal told CNN. It is unclear what the man said at the event. Police have not formally charged anyone with any crime.                  CNN has contacted India’s Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Hindu Mahasabha and Pandey, but has not received a response.     Related articleIn Hindu-nationalist India, Muslims risk being branded infiltrators in their own country             Analysts say the Hindu Mahasabha is at the tip of abroader trend in India which has seen an alarming rise in support for extremist Hindu nationalist groups since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power nearly eight years ago.                  Although these groups aren’t directly associated with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his own Hindu nationalist agenda, and the lack of repercussions for these groups’ previous vitriolic comments, has given them tacit support, making them even more brazen, analysts say.                   Analysts fear this rise poses a serious danger to minorities, especially Muslims – and worry it may only get worse as several Indian states head to the polls in the coming months.                  “What makes the Hindu Mahasabha dangerous,” said Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University near India’s capital, New Delhi, “is that they have been waiting for a moment like this in decades.”                 Founded in 1907 during British rule at a time of growing conflict between Muslims and Hindus in the country, the Hindu Mahasabha is one of India’s oldest political organizations.                 The group didn’t support British rule, but it didn’t back India’s freedom movement either, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was particularly tolerant of Muslims. Even now, some members of the group worship his assassin, Nathuram Godse.                 The Hindu Mahasabha’s vision, according to the group’s official website, is to declare India the “National Home of the Hindus.” The website says if it takes power, it will not hesitate to “force” the migration of India’s Muslims to neighboring Pakistan and vows to reform the country’s education system to align it with their version of Hinduism.                  With its controversial campaigns and ideology, Hindu Mahasabha has always been a marginal political force. The last time the group had a presence in Parliament was in 1991.      Related articleIndia is investigating a fake website that offered Muslim women for sale             But according to Verniers, their “strength is not to be measured in electoral terms.” And in the past eight years since Modi came to power, they appear to have expanded in numbers and influence based on the size and frequency of their meetings, he said.                 While the group does not publicly disclose how many members it has, Verniers said they are “comfortably in the tens of thousands.”                 Hindu Mahasabha targets rural communities in northern states, where there is a large BJP presence, encouraging them to vote for parties that align with their Hindu-nationalist ideology, including Modi’s BJP, Verniers said.                  Modi, in turn, has publicly honored the Hindu Mahasabha’s late leader, Veer Savarkar, for “his bravery” and “emphasis on social reform.”                  And as Hindu Mahasabha has grown in recent years, it has become more outspoken.                 In 2015, Sadhvi Deva Thakur, then a senior member of the group, caused widespread controversy when she told reporters Muslims and Christians should undergo forced sterilization to control their population growth. CNN has reached out to her for comment.                  Pandey, who spoke at the December conference in Haridwar,was arrested in February 2019 after a video showed her shooting an effigy of Gandhi, according to CNN affiliate CNN News-18.Photosuploaded to her official Facebook page last May show her worshipinga statue of Gandhi’s assassin. CNN has not been able to confirm whether she was formally charged over the February 2019 incident.                  Hindu Mahasabha isn’t the only right-wing Hindu nationalist group to espouse violent sentiment towardliberals and minorities – including India’s200 million Muslims, who make up 15% of the country’s 1.3 billion population.                 At last month’s conference, several speakers called on India’s Hindus to “defend” the religion with weapons. Another called for the “cleansing” of India’s minorities, according to video from the event.                  But according to Verniers, Hindu Mahasbha one of the largest right-wing political groups aiming to make India the land of the Hindus.                 And while the group’s campaigns and ideas are decades old, they’re more bold about them now.                  “The escalation of their hate speech is reflective of the state of affairs in India,” said Verniers. “But they are able to get away with it more.”                 The reason extremist groups appear to be on the rise is clear, according to experts: they have impunity and support.                  India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section which criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs.                  According to lawyer Vrinda Grover, any group inciting violence is barred under Indian law.                  “Police, states and the government are responsible to ensure (inciting violence) doesn’t happen,” she said. “But the state, through its inaction, is actually permitting these groups to function, while endangering Muslims who are the targets.”                  Pandey’s rant and some of the other calls for violence werethe “worst form of hate speech,” according to Verniers.                   “This is the first time I find myself using the term ‘genocide’ in Indian politics,” he said, referring to the comments made at last month’s conference. “They have tacit support in the form of government silence.”                 That’s because Modi also has a Hindu nationalist agenda, experts say.     Related articleIndian comedian Vir Das sparks explosive online debate with controversial tale of 'two Indias'             Modi swept to power in India in 2014, promising economic reform and development for the country.                  But starting from his first term as Prime Minister, minority groups and analysts say they began to see a significant shift in India’s ideology from a secular to a Hindu nationalist state.                 The BJP has its roots in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing-Hindu group that counts Modi among its members. Many RSS members are adherents of the Hindutva ideology that the Hindu Mahasabha preach – to make India the land of the Hindus.                  In 2018, India’s current Home Minister Amit Shah said Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers from Bangladesh were “termites” and promised to rid the nation of them.                  The BJP’s Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of the north Indian state Uttar Pradesh, known for his anti-Muslim views, once compared Muslim Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed, the alleged planner of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, according to the Press Trust of India.                 Between 2015 and 2018, vigilante groups killed dozens of people – many of whom were Muslims – for allegedly consuming or killing cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus, according to a report from Human Rights Watch.                  Modi publicly condemned some of the killings, but the violence continued, and in 2017, his government attempted to ban the sale and slaughter of cows –currently illegal in several Indian states – nationwide.                  Human Rights Watch said many of the alleged murders went unpunished in part due to delayed police investigations and “rhetoric” from ruling party politicians, which may have incited mob violence.                 In 2019, India’s Parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims. It led to extended protests and international condemnation.                 In December 2020, Uttar Pradesh enacted a controversial anti-conversion law, making it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                  Other states, including Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Assam, introduced similar laws, leading to widespread harassment and, in some cases, arrests for interfaith couples, Christian priests and pastors.                 All of this has only served to encourage extremist groups like theHindu Mahasabha, say experts.                  Zakia Soman, a women’s rights activist and co-founder of the Muslim group Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, said “a failure of governance” had given rise to more right-wing extremists.                  “Our community is realizing that we have become second-class citizens in our own country,” Soman said. “Minority bashing and hate is becoming regular and normalized. As the intensity increases, the venom and violence in their language also increases.”                  A 21-year-old Muslim student in Delhi, who chose to remain anonymous for fear of backlash from right-wing groups, said Muslims are filled with “a sense of fear” every time right-wing Hindu groups make hateful comments.                  “It gives us a sense that we don’t belong here,” he said.                 Despite police investigations and public outrage, legal action against those who spoke and were present at December’s event have been slow.                 In a letter submitted to Modi on Friday and seen by CNN, students and faculty of the prestigious Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore and Ahmedabad said his silence “emboldens” hate, adding there is “sense of fear” among minority groups in India.                  Some experts agree the government’s silence has only emboldened these groups further.                   “Hate speech precedes hate crimes,” Grover, the lawyer, said. “And we are witnessing a crescendo of hate crimes. These groups are rapidly spreading poison through society.”                  A 2019 US intelligence report warned that parliamentary elections in India increase the possibility of communal violence if Modi’s BJP “stresses Hindu nationalist themes.” It added that state leaders “might view a Hindu-nationalist campaign as a signal to incite low-level violence to animate their supporters.”                  The BJP – which rarely gives statements on the issue –says it does not discriminate against minorities, adding in a statement last March that it “treats all its citizens with equality” and “laws are applied without discrimination.”                  But analysts fear the BJP’s divisive politics will could lead to increased violence against minority groups in the lead up to pivotal state elections this year.                  And reported episodes of violence against Muslims have already increased ahead of this year’s state elections.                  In December, crowds of India’s Hindu-right confronted Muslims praying on the streets in the city of Gurugram, just outside of Delhi. They prevented Muslims from praying, while shouting slogans and carrying banners in protest.                  “It is an electoral strategy,” said Verniers, the political scientist. “Create religious tension, activate religious polarization and consolidate on the Hindu vote.”                  Grover, the lawyer, said criminal laws are “weaponized” in India, adding anyone who challenges those in power “face the wrath of the law.”                  “Muslim lives in India are demonized,” she said. “The Indian state is in serious crisis.”                    On January 1, Pandey held a live broadcast for her more than 1,500 Facebook followers. The subject was “Religious Parliament,” her post said.                 For the 21-year-old student, it is difficult to “expect any sense of justice” for Indian Muslims. He says even having a Muslim name is enough to make him feel unsafe.                  “It is really scary to carry the Muslim identity in India today.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Ilhan Omar’s legislation to create a special envoy to combat Islamophobia, a week after progressives introduced a separate resolution to strip Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of her committee assignments following her anti-Muslim comments calling the Minnesota Democrat a terrorist.                 The bill would address the rise in incidents of Islamophobia worldwide and still needs to pass the Senate before it could go to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.                  The legislation was previously sitting in the House Foreign Affairs Committee for months but was voted out of committee last week as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced increasing pressure from members of her own party to take aggressive action against Boebert for her racist remarks.                 Debate for the legislation was interrupted Tuesday night following objections made by Democrats against GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who insulted Omar during his remarks. Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor, who was serving as chair of the session, ruled that Perry’s comment “impugns the patriotism or loyalty of the member of the House” and ruled his remarks “not in order.” Debate continued shortly after Castor’s ruling.                 The Biden administration said in a statement it supported this legislation.                  “Religious freedom is a fundamental human right. This freedom is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is also part of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Our country’s commitment to defending freedom of religion and belief goes back centuries, and the Administration strongly believes that people of all faiths and backgrounds should be treated with equal dignity and respect around the world,” the statement said.                 The vote on the bill in the House comes after progressive Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced a resolution, cosigned by other progressives, that would strip the Colorado Republican of her committee assignments if passed.                 Last week, Pelosi dodged when she was asked if she supported that resolution and repeated her call for GOP leadership to punish members of their conference.                 The call to have Boebert removed from her committee assignments for her controversial comments is not made in isolation. Threatening violence is the reason why Democrats stripped Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona of their committee assignments earlier this year after incendiary comments or actions they made.                 Omar said last week she was “very confident” Pelosi would take “decisive action” against Boebert over the Colorado Republican’s anti-Muslim remarks.                 “I’ve had a conversation with the speaker and I’m very confident that she will take decisive action next week,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”     This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

The bill, led by Omar that CNN exclusively reported in July, is scheduled to get voted out of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on Thursday, Omar’s office told CNN, and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer’s office announced the bill will get a floor vote on Tuesday. The bill would still need to pass the Senate before it could go to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.                 “As the United Nations said this year, anti-Muslim hatred has reached ‘epidemic proportions’ and every country must take action,” Omar said in a statement to CNN.                 “I am excited for the opportunity to bring forth legislation to address this crisis alongside Rep.

Lauren Boebert of Colorado suggested to a crowd in September that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, whom she called “black-hearted” and “evil,” was a terrorist.                 In those same remarks, she said that she felt safe around Omar because the Democrat wasn’t wearing a backpack while they were in an elevator together.                  It’s another instance in which Boebert suggested Omar, who is Muslim and wears a hijab, was a terrorist. On Monday, the two lawmakers sent dueling statements about a phone call between the pair set up by Boebert after she apologized last week to “to anyone in the Muslim community I offended,” when similar comments surfaced on social media.                 The video of Boebert’s anti-Muslim comments, made in New York at a September Staten Island Conservative Party dinner, were posted on Facebook that month by an attendee running for borough president.      Related articleRep. Lauren Boebert suggested Rep. Ilhan Omar was terrorist in anti-Muslim remarks at event              “One of my I staffers, on his first day with me, got into an elevator in the Capitol. And in that elevator, we were joined by Ilhan Omar,” Boebert told the crowd in September. “It was just us three in there and I looked over and I said, well, lookey there, it’s the Jihad Squad.                 “She doesn’t have a backpack, she wasn’t dropping it and running so we’re good,” Boebert adds, through laughter and applause from the crowd which briefly makes her remarks somewhat inaudible.                 Additionally, at the September event, Boebert also disparaged Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Minnesota, another Muslim member of Congress.                  “Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. These are just black-hearted evil women,” Boebert said.                  Boebert’s remarks were also posted on Twitter in September by Mike DeCillis, a New York Democratic congressional candidate. They received little attention outside of a local press write up, which noted she called her “the jihad squad” and a “black-hearted evil” woman.                 On Monday, Boebert and Omar spoke on the phone, according to statements from both lawmakers.                   “I have reflected on my previous remarks, now as a strong Christian woman who values faith deeply I never want anything I say to offend someone’s religion,” Boebert said in a video posted to Instagram. Boebert said Omar asked her to publicly apologize which she would not do and instead challenged Omar to issue an apology of her own for some of the comments she has made in the past.                 In her statement, Omar said Boebert refused to apologize to her.                 “Instead of apologizing for her Islamophobic comments and fabricated lies, Rep. Boebert refused to publicly acknowledge her hurtful and dangerous comments,” she said. “She instead doubled down on her rhetoric and I decided to end the unproductive call.”                   A spokesperson for Omar called the elevator story “a fabrication.”                 In her statement blasting Boebert on Monday, Omar said Boebert had “a clear pattern for Islamophobic hate speech,” and cited the local press write up of the September event and comments where Boebert called Omar “a full-time propagandist for Hamas” and she said Omar was an “honorary member of Hamas” and that we have “terrorist sympathizers” in Congress.                 Omar on Monday blasted Boebert’s September comments in a message to CNN’s KFile.                 “It just gets worse,” Omar told CNN. “This is unhinged, and she continues to be emboldened by her party. This is their brand and it’s dangerous.”                 Similar comments surfaced last week on social media when the Twitter account PatriotTakes, a left-wing group that researches right-wing extremism and is associated with the liberal PAC MeidasTouch posted a video of Boebert at an event in Colorado on Nov. 20.              In the since-removed video posted on Facebook from an event that day, Boebert implied Omar had been mistaken for a terrorist in an elevator on Capitol Hill.

I see fret all over his face. And he’s reaching. The door is shutting. I can’t open it.”                 “What’s happening? I look to my left and there she is, Ilhan Omar, and I said, ‘Well she doesn’t have a backpack, we should be fine,’” Boebert continued.                 Last week, Boebert apologized to any offended in the Muslim community.                 “I apologize to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep Omar,” Boebert said in a statement posted on Twitter. “I have reached out to her office to speak with her directly.

Congress can’t be a place where hateful and dangerous Muslims tropes get no condemnation.”                 On Friday, Omar called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to take action against Boebert.                 “Normalizing this bigotry not only endangers my life but the lives of all Muslims,” Omar said in another tweet. “Anti-Muslim bigotry has no place in Congress.”                 Democratic leaders said Boebert should fully retract her comments, noting in a statement the congresswoman’s “language and behavior are far beneath the standard of integrity, dignity and decency with which the Constitution and our constituents require that we act in the House.”                 McCarthy said he spoke to Boebert on Friday in the wake of her comments and encouraged her to meet with Omar.                 “She has apologized for what she said and has reached out to Congresswoman Omar to meet next week,” McCarthy said in a statement. “I spoke with Leader Hoyer today to help facilitate that meeting so that Congress can get back to talking to each other and working on the challenges facing the American people.”                 McCarthy’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Boebert’s September comments.

Lauren Boebert of Colorado apologized to “anyone in the Muslim community I offended” on Twitter Friday after video surfaced of her making anti-Muslim comments last weekend about Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.                  In the video, posted last Saturday on Facebook from an event that day, Boebert implied Omar had been mistaken for a terrorist in an elevator on Capitol Hill.                  “So the other night on the House floor was not my first jihad squad moment,” Boebert told a crowd. “I was getting into an elevator with one of my staffers and he and I were leaving the Capitol, we’re going back to my office and we get in the elevator and I see a Capitol Police officer running hurriedly to the elevator. I see fret all over his face. And he’s reaching. The door is shutting. I can’t open it.”                  “What’s happening? I look to my left and there she is, Ilhan Omar, and I said, ‘Well she doesn’t have a backpack, we should be fine,’” Boebert continued. “So we only had one floor to go and I say, do I say it or do I not? And I look over and I say, ‘Look, the jihad squad decided to show up for work today.’ Don’t worry, it’s just her staffers on Twitter that talk for her. She’s not tough in person.”                 Boebert’s comments were flagged by the Twitter account PatriotTakes, a left-wing group that researches right-wing extremism and is associated with the liberal PAC MeidasTouch.                  CNN has reached out to Boebert and multiple members of the congresswoman’s office for comment but has not received a response.                  Boebert said Friday she had contacted Omar’s office.                 “I apologize to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep Omar,” Boebert said in a statement posted on Twitter.                  “I have reached out to her office to speak with her directly.

The Democratic leadership also called on McCarthy to act.                 “Leader McCarthy and the entire House Republican Leadership’s repeated failure to condemn inflammatory and bigoted rhetoric from members of their conference is outrageous,” they said. “We call on the Republican Leadership to address this priority with the Congresswoman and to finally take real action to confront racism.”     McCarthy said he spoke to Boebert on Friday in the wake of her comments and is encouraging she meet with Rep. Omar.                 “She has apologized for what she said and has reached out to Congresswoman Omar to meet next week,” McCarthy said in a statement. “I spoke with Leader Hoyer today to help facilitate that meeting so that Congress can get back to talking to each other and working on the challenges facing the American people.”CNN reached out to McCarthy’s office multiple times on Friday for a comment about Boebert, but they did not provide a statement to CNN until Saturday.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.             Michael Flynn, Donald Trump’s former National Security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and was later pardoned by Trump, wants to make it clear that in the United States, “If we are going to have one nation under God – which we must – we have to have one religion.”                 Of course, to Flynn, that one religion is Christianity. (After all, 75% of White evangelicals voted for Trump in the 2020 election, according to exit polls.)                  Flynn made these remarks in Texas on Saturday as part of the “ReAwaken America Tour,” a conservative conference that features other Trump supporters, like Roger Stone and the My Pillow CEO/election conspiracy peddler Mike Lindell. While speaking at the event, Flynn referenced a passage from the New Testament book of Matthew, saying, “You have to believe this, that God Almighty is, like, involved in this country, because this is it … This is the shining city on the hill.”                  That’s when Flynn triggered a wave of backlash with his suggestion America should have one singular religion. “One nation under God, and one religion under God,” he said. “I don’t care what your ecumenical service is or what you are.”                  Now imagine if a Muslim or Jewish American leader made the same comment that the United States should have one faith, and that it should be Islam or Judaism. The outrage from the right would be deafening. But with Flynn’s comments, there hasn’t been noticeable pushback from conservatives. In fact, it’s been the opposite. GOP Ohio Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who is Jewish, appears to see Flynn’s comments as being in step with his own “Judeo-Christian values”: “We Stand with General Flynn,” Mandel tweeted in response to the backlash. “America was not founded as a secular nation.” Politics does truly make strange bedfellows.       Related article'Patriot Purge' has a chilling method to its utter madness             In contrast, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is Muslim American, tweeted in response to Flynn’s comments, “These people hate the US Constitution.” I don’t know if Flynn and those who support his mindset “hate” the Constitution, but I am certain that they either don’t believe in or don’t understand our Constitution and the freedom of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment.                  This is the same Flynn who in 2016 repeatedly pushed debunked conspiracy theories that there was an effort to impose Islamic Sharia law on the rest of the country. “This Sharia law business, what’s happening right here in the state of Texas is unbelievable,” Flynn said at a San Antonio event that year hosted by ACT! for America, an anti-Muslim hate group per the Anti-Defamation League. At another 2016 speech in Texas, as CNN detailed, Flynn again falsely claimed there are Muslims who want to dominate America by imposing Islamic law: “I want people to understand that there are different laws that are not our laws that others try to impose,” he said.                  As a Muslim, let me be clear that there aren’t any Muslims – then or now – trying to impose any of our religious beliefs onto the law of the United States. This was simply part of the right-wing demonization of Muslims because it played well with the GOP base. It’s the same reason why, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump lied on NBC saying Muslims “don’t want the laws that we have. They want Sharia law.”      Related articleIt didn't go well for Texas at the Supreme Court             Beyond despicably demonizing other faiths, these examples show an idea of “freedom of religion” that ironically revolves around imposing one’s beliefs upon the rest of us. Several on the right have been showing us that for years. For example, when Mike Huckabee ran for president in 2008, he bluntly said the US Constitution should be amended “so it’s in God’s standard” – phrasing he later clarified after critics caught wind of the quote. And during his 2012 presidential run, Rick Santorum declared “our civil laws have to comport with a higher law: God’s law.” These Republicans were telling all who would listen that their goal was turning their religious beliefs into American law.                 And we now have Republicans doing just that with their religion-based oppression of women’s reproductive rights. The most visible example is the Texas GOP’s anti-abortion law, which has garnered headlines for empowering private citizens to behave as vigilantes with the ability to sue anyone involved in securing an abortion beyond about six weeks of pregnancy. When Texas’ Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the legislation, he explained the rationale behind it as being faith-based: “Our creator endowed us with the right to life, and yet millions of children lose their right to life every year because of abortion,” he said. “In Texas, we work to save those lives and that’s exactly what the Texas Legislature did this session.”                  That’s the same reasoning behind the Arkansas ban on nearly all abortions except to save the life of the mother. When the state’s GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed it, he declared the law was predicated upon his “sincere and long-held pro-life convictions.” (As with the Texas law, Arkansas’ ban has faced legal challenges for its obvious violation of Roe v. Wade.)     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             These laws are based on the religious belief held by some that life begins at conception. Having the freedom to personally follow one’s faith is what our nation is predicated upon. Turning those religious beliefs into laws every American then must follow, however, is not. In fact, it’s un-American, given that our First Amendment states “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.”                 No one should be surprised by Flynn’s comments. He’s simply repeating what some in the GOP have long championed: The idea that “freedom of religion” is imposing their religious beliefs upon the rest of us. It’s no wonder, then, why many on Twitter reacted to Flynn’s comments with the phrase “American Taliban.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The pages from Islam’s holy book were seen scattered on the floor. In Islam, the Quran is considered sacred and cannot be placed on the floor or on any dirty surface.                 Players who recognized the religious text posted photos of the scene on Twitter, with one gamer demanding the game’s developers and publishers “remove the pages immediately.”                 “Call of Duty is made for everyone. There was insensitive content to the Muslim community mistakenly included last week, and has since been removed from the game,” an Activision spokesperson said in a statement to CNN on Friday.                  “It should never have appeared as it did in game. We deeply apologize. We are taking immediate steps internally to address the situation to prevent such occurrences in the future.”      Activision Blizzard publishes Call of Duty, one of the best-selling game franchises in the United States for over a decade.                 “Sometimes the whole point of a diverse team isn’t just for gender balance, sometimes it’s at least one person pointing out hey maybe putting an entire cultures holy scriptures onto the floor to be stepped as you kill people is super insensitive?” Anisa Sanusi, a Muslim video game developer based in London, wrote on Twitter. “Leave the Quran out of it.”                 In Call of Duty: Vanguard, which is set in World War II, players “experience influential battles” of the war as they fight in Europe, the Pacific and North Africa, according to the game’s website.             The pages of the Quran appear during zombie mode during the Der Anfang campaign, a survival mode in the game in which players face a wave of zombie soldiers, according to players who posted the screenshots on social media.     Related articleIraq's bloodiest battle will be a video game             “I understand the effort it takes to make a video game world feel real and believable, however for a piece of set dressing, they could have literally used any other blurb of writing,” Sanusi told CNN. “There was absolutely no reason to bring in the Quran into this.”                 Sanusi, 31, said she found the game’s inclusion of the Quran “disrespectful.”                 “There is a bare-level minimum of respect expected when it comes to how you treat and portray a religion with 2 billion followers on the planet,” she said.                 “When dealing with portraying a culture that is not your own, it’s important to have sensitivity measures to avoid instances of cultural appropriation, or in this case, an unintentionally offensive outcome.”                 This is not the first time Call of Duty has attracted negative criticism from Muslim players for insensitive content.                 In 2012, developers of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 had to remove a multiplayer map that showed Islamic religious texts including the word “Allah,” which is Arabic for God, in a bathroom, according to Fortune.                 Rami Ismail, a Muslim Dutch-Egyptian game developer, said he is “annoyed and exhausted” with the constant misrepresentation of Islam in the gaming industry.                 “Games have used Muslim lands as war zones and Muslim people as targets for decades – it is tiring to see additional disrespect towards our people,” Ismail told CNN. “Things like this just really shouldn’t happen.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

State Sen.-elect Ed Durr met with Muslim community leaders in the state on Wednesday, according to Selaedin Maksut, the executive director of the state’s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, who told CNN that the conversation with Durr “went very well.”                  “To be honest, I think it went very well, we got exactly what we came for,” Maksut said. “He committed to renouncing that hate speech and not engaging in it moving forward.”                 Maksut was joined by local Muslim leaders when he met with Durr Wednesday evening. They shared stories of how it felt to grow up Muslim in America, and how Durr’s words have impacted them, Maksut said.                  Maksut said Durr apologized sincerely and committed to standing against Islamophobia and other forms of hate.                 Durr ousted New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney last week, winning the powerful Democrat’s seat in state Senate District 3. Wednesday’s meeting came as Durr was under fire for old tweets that were uncovered by news outlets, including CNN, including one from 2019 in which he referred to the Prophet Muhammad as a “pedophile” and Islam as “a false religion” and “a cult of hate.”     Related articleRepublican Ed Durr will defeat New Jersey's Senate president, CNN projects             Durr told local reporters after Wednesday’s meeting that his discussion with Muslim leaders was “very open” and said he believes progress was made.                 “It’s very easy to hate somebody that you don’t know, but if you know them personally, and you talk to them, it’s very hard to hate them, don’t you think?” he said. “As I reiterated to the group inside … I stand against Islamophobia and all forms of hate and I do commit to that. And I look forward to working with the Muslim community.”                 Durr also said he was given a copy of the Quran, which he was seen holding when he spoke to reporters Wednesday evening.                 Maksut said that while the election took him by surprise, he now looks forward to working with Durr on legislation that impacts the Muslim community.                 “Now we have a connection with him so we look forward to working with him on things that will impact the Muslim community,” Maksut said. “We’re going to hold him to that commitment.”                 CNN obtained cached and archived copies of tweets in which Durr indicates support for QAnon and expresses Islamophobia. CNN contacted Durr and Twitter for comment.                 Durr apologized for his Islamophobic comments in a statement to CNN affiliate KYW. “I’m a passionate guy and I sometimes say things in the heat of the moment. If I said things in the past that hurt anybody’s feelings, I sincerely apologize. I support everybody’s right to worship in any manner they choose and to worship the God of their choice. I support all people and I support everybody’s rights. That’s what I am here to do, work for the people and support their rights.”                 He expressed a number of controversial views on his Twitter account.                  In one tweet from the summer of 2020, he wrote to another Twitter user using the hashtag “WWG1WGA,” a well-known QAnon phrase that means, “Where we go one, we go all.”                 Durr also expressed xenophobic ideas, tweeting in 2018 that New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, should “stop pushing #sanctuary state & inviting #illegals to our state.” He added the hashtags “#BuildTheWall,” “#NoIllegals” and “#MAGA.” CNN also unearthed a tweet from Durr at the state’s first lady, Tammy Murphy, calling Covid-19 the “China virus” and blaming the “influx of #IllegalAliens” for “the return of diseases.”                 Durr’s Twitter account has since been deleted.

By the end of the two hour-plus marathon session, the justices did not seem to be ready to make a major statement about the scope of the government’s ability to claim a “state secret privilege,” which permits the government under some circumstances to block the release of information in a lawsuit that could harm national security interests.                  Several of the justices seemed to be looking for ways to rein in a lower court opinion that went against the government and to send the whole issue back to the lower courts for further review. Such a move would dodge a major opinion that could shape the future of domestic surveillance, exploring the government’s stated needs for secrecy against arguments made by critics who believe the privilege is sometimes used to conceal abuses and thwart accountability in the courts.     Related articleSupreme Court seems poised to expand Second Amendment rights and strike down NY handgun law             The dispute stems from a lawsuit brought by Yassir Fazaga and two other Muslim men, who say an undercover informant for the FBI infiltrated a mosque in Orange County, California, in 2006 and spent more than a year collecting names, phone numbers, emails and other information culled from the community as a part of a counterterrorism investigation. According to court papers, the FBI told informant that they wanted to “get as many files on this community as possible.”                  The informant attended classes at the mosque, gathered information related to charitable giving and attended Muslim fundraising events, all the while going to daily prayers. Most of his interactions were recorded using devices provided by the FBI.                 After his identity was ultimately revealed, Fazaga brought suit.                   A district court ruled in favor of the government and dismissed the claims under the so-called state secret privilege. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed the decision holding that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act – a law aimed electronic communications – provides for procedures for challenging unlawful electronic surveillance in early stages of litigation and takes priority over the states secret privilege.                 The US government then filed an appeal with the Supreme Court.                 Ahilan Arulanantham, a lawyer for the men (two US citizens and one lawful permanent resident), told the justices Monday that his clients should be able to have their day in court after the government violated the Constitution’s protection of freedom of religion.                   Arulanantham said the appeals court was right to permit the case to proceed because FISA allows the review of the lawfulness of the surveillance and at least – at the threshold – displaces a claim based on “state secrets.” He said that the “state secrets” privilege authorizes the exclusion of evidence but not the use of secret evidence to entirely dismiss a case.                  Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler told the justices that the federal appeals court decision holding that FISA displaced the state secrets privilege would seriously undermine the executive branch’s ability to protect the nation’s secrets. He said the privilege is “critical in safeguarding” national security.                 Justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum expressed skepticism at times of the ruling by the 9th Circuit, suggesting they would order the court to wipe away the opinion and start anew.                 Chief Justice John Roberts said that he didn’t think the intent of Congress was to pass the FISA law in order to block the government from being able to assert the privilege. He said such an interpretation would be akin to trying to “bury and elephant in a mouse hole.                 Justice Brett Kavanaugh and others suggested they could instruct the lower court to revisit the particulars of the case at hand and leave a broader opinion concerning the scope of the “state secret” privilege for another day.                 “I feel like we’d be doing a drive-by in this case on a massively important issue if we get into that,” he said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

View more opinion articles on CNN.             When Muhammad Ali died in 2016, he was accorded the equivalent of a state funeral, complete with a eulogy that featured President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton. During the last three decades of his life, from lighting the Olympic torch in Atlanta in 1996 until his death, Ali became a virtually sanctified figure, embodying the movements for civil and human rights that he came to symbolize in America and around the world.                 As “Muhammad Ali,” a new four-part documentary series made by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon explains, it didn’t start out this way. The film’s cumulative power, for both a historian familiar with the period and for people less familiar with this history, is its ability to unpeel hidden layers of a story that has become American folklore.                 “Muhammad Ali” offers the most fulsome portrait of the iconic sports star to date, showing him to be a man full of paradoxes. A freedom fighter who abandoned one of his early mentors, Malcolm X, in favor of a group that would take advantage of him for over a decade. A Black nationalist and pan-Africanist who warmly shared the stage with the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, whose legendary corruption and record of human rights violations seemed antithetical to Ali’s human rights advocacy. A family man whose multiple marriages were marked by infidelity.      Related videoWhy Ken Burns took on 'the greatest athlete of the 20th century'             The film successfully illuminates how the highs and lows of Muhammad Ali’s life personify much of the political conflict and racial upheaval that marked American life – and the larger world – in the 1960s. The mythology of Ali that emerged in the 1990s onward tends to sanitize this legacy, making the icon a more comfortable exemplar of American exceptionalism by smoothing his rough edges (and America’s, too). This documentary’s greatness lies in how it reminds a new generation of audiences that Muhammad Ali’s athletic excellence and political rebellion mutually defined not only his time but also our own era of racial and political reckoning.                  “Muhammad Ali” expertly locates the roots of the age of Black Lives Matter in the political storms of the 1960s. The film’s depictions of that era’s racial segregation, police brutality and cultural antipathy for Black folk feel achingly familiar to contemporary audiences.                   Ali’s audacity – telling reporters (and many White Americans) in 1964 after becoming world heavyweight champion, “I don’t have to be what you want me to be, I’m free to be who I want” – disrupted an unspoken racial compact for Black athletes and reimagined the boundaries of the possible in ways that anticipated our present moment.                    Born and raised in the violently segregated city of Louisville, Kentucky, of the 1940s and 1950s, Cassius Marcellus Clay came of age in a historical milieu indelibly shaped by race. Clay was only six months younger than Emmett Till, whose 1955 lynching in Mississippi sent shockwaves throughout the nation, including Clay’s hometown.                   The young Clay found a safe haven in boxing, where he displayed keen observational abilities to go along with the fastest hands in the history of heavyweight boxing; by 1960, at the age of 18, he had won an Olympic gold medal in Rome. At first, reporters loved the handsome, brash and cocky young fighter whose quotable lines – like “I’m so mean, I make medicine sick” – made for good copy.                   Until they didn’t.                   One of the many pleasures of Ali documentary is watching Clay’s evolution into Muhammad Ali. Clay had purposefully stayed out of the civil rights struggles that were increasingly making headlines during the early 1960s – better to protect his sponsors, “the Louisville Syndicate,” the White power brokers bankrolling his early career. Yet he yearned for a personal dignity that he quickly realized could not be bought.                   Clay found inspiration in the Nation of Islam; an encounter with a Nation of Islam member selling the newspaper, “Muhammad Speaks,” in Miami, where he trained for fights, piqued his curiosity about becoming a Muslim. Attending religious services at Miami’s Temple No. 29 Mosque, where ministers preached that God was Black, showed Clay an alternate reality to the institutions of White supremacy normalized in his youth. Clay flourished, hearing a message of Black political and cultural self-determination that dovetailed with his own aspirations for enjoying a kind of personal dignity perpetually denied to African Americans.                    The film provides a potent explanation to why Clay became so attracted to the Nation of Islam. Rather than abandon the Black world he grew up in for anticipated riches, Clay sought dignity for himself and others. As a budding NOI devotee, Clay met Malcolm X, the group’s national representative, who would become one his most important friends and mentors. Clay and Malcolm grew attracted to each other’s hidden depths, rarely visible to the general public.                   “Muhammad Ali” slows down the story of the young champion boxer’s rise enough for us to see the risks – some would say reckless – the young Clay took in shaping his personal and professional destiny. Drawn to a religious group characterized by some mainstream journalists as “Black supremacists” held the potential to destroy Clay’s boxing career, but he refused to back down, maintaining his religious faith as a protective shield against racist insults and threats.                  The film also explores Ali’s eventual rejection of Malcolm X in detail, offering one example of the way in which the champ’s charisma and bravado at times concealed a gift for self-preservation that could be ruthless.                   While guiding Ali’s evolution in his identity as a Black Muslim, Malcolm X was falling out with the leader of the National of Islam, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm broke with Muhammad in early 1964, announcing his plans to form his own organization. In May 1964 Ali toured Africa on a trip initially orchestrated by Malcolm, with whom he briefly reunited with in Accra, Ghana. Malcolm tried to greet him; with harsh words, Ali turned away. Their friendship ended there, to Ali’s later regret, especially since Malcolm was killed the following year in a political assassination while giving a speech in New York.                 As the film shows, Ali became, by his trip to Africa, a global symbol of Black pride. He embraced the NOI’s racial separatism not out of weakness but from a position of strength. He basked in his growing celebrity, meeting with African leaders, wading through tremendous crowds and deepening his ties to a global Islamic community.                   Ali’s personal belief in Islam dovetailed with political convictions about the need to confront White supremacy, no matter the cost. “Muhammad Ali” illustrates how even as his significance to Black communities in the United States and abroad grew, Ali’s charisma, bravado and humor curdled in the eyes of millions of White Americans as he strayed further from their idea of what a Black male athlete should be. Ali’s refusal to fight in, or approve of, the Vietnam War turned him into a despised figure in mainstream America and burnished his stature as a countercultural icon.                   Denied status as a conscientious objector, hounded by a boxing commission’s refusal to let him fight domestically, Ali fought overseas throughout 1966 before being stripped of his boxing license and heavyweight championship the next year, for refusing to be drafted into the army.       Sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for resisting the draft in 1967, Ali became an itinerant Black Power spokesperson, with the NOI distancing themselves from the former champ as he faced stiff political headwinds. In so doing, Ali became a model for Black resistance to systemic racism domestically and American imperialism abroad.                   The fighter once so quick he could evade the blows of all of his opponents now discovered that he could take a punch, figuratively and literally. In the 1970s Ali engaged in a series of brutal matches, fighting Joe Frazier three times, and regaining the heavyweight championship in an upset victory over George Foreman in the “Rumble in the Jungle” in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo).                   Ali’s professional redemption paralleled the rise of anti-Vietnam War sentiment in America. His popularity within the Black community spread into the mainstream and he became a kind of Rorschach test for the nation. His professional rivalry with Joe Frazier re-captivated the imagination of the predominantly White sports world. The film documents how Ali vilified Frazier as “ugly” and “dumb,” a man whose only admirer was conservative President Richard Nixon. In these and other instances the viewer gets detailed portraits of Ali’s cruelty, casual at times, in service of his own ambition.                 In defeat Ali became a figure who earned admiration and empathy. Losing to Frazier, as he did in front of millions on television and multiple celebrities in “The Fight of the Century” in 1971, humanized him in the eyes of White Americans and amplified the love Black folks held for him. He made disastrous financial decisions, supporting a gigantic entourage, giving money away to strangers and allowing the Nation of Islam to control his finances, as detailed in journalist Jonathan Eig’s superb recent biography, “Ali: A Life.” The film also documents Ali’s insatiable womanizing and the emotional trauma this inflicted on his wives and family                  Part of the heartbreak of Ali’s story is his seemingly endless appetite for punishment and suffering. A promise to retire following his 1975 “Thrilla in Manila” – his final battle against Joe Frazier – faded until his last fight in 1981, a sad beating at the hands of the unremarkable Trevor Berbick, which ended his boxing career for good. He emerged from his boxing career with a slower gait, halting speech and the symptoms of the Parkinson’s diagnosis that would come in the 1980s.

For many Americans who came of age after Ali’s boxing career was long over, the image they know of the icon is of a trembling man, lighting the Olympic torch in Atlanta in 1996. Now this film brings to life for those viewers the Ali who in his prime rejected an American Dream rooted in racial animus against Black people, who proudly adopted a Muslim name and projected an unapologetic pro-Blackness. His principled anti-war stance fulfilled Malcolm X’s prediction that the young boxing champion from Louisville would become a symbol for millions of the world’s dispossessed. Ali became an avatar of social and political change, not when he made it look easy in the ring, but when things got harder.                   Ali’s personal and political odyssey was an American epic, one that “Muhammad Ali” allows us all to experience.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

And you don’t even know it.”                    Between 1960 and 1981, Ali fought 61 professional heavyweight bouts in a glittering career that made him a global icon, but arguably his biggest fights were outside of the ring. His remarkable life story is once again in the spotlight, the subject of “Muhammad Ali” – an expansive, four-part, eight-hour documentary by the renowned filmmaker Ken Burns, airing on PBS.                 “He intersects with all of the things that not only were the most important issues of that day, but of our day as well,” Burns told CNN Sport, “He’s so much bigger than boxing. Sports and the role of sports and society, Black athletes and race and religion and faith and politics and war. There isn’t a button that he doesn’t push, either deliberately or accidentally – and he’s so amazing.”                 But the crux of Burns’ narrative is that he wasn’t always revered, in fact, for many years in the United States, Muhammad Ali was dismissed, feared and even despised.                 The latter-day image of Ali is that he was flamboyant, loquacious and audacious. A larger than life character who was beloved.                 “The biggest misconception about Muhammad Ali is that everybody loved him,” explains ESPN’s Howard Bryant, who is featured in the film. He told CNN Sport, “One of the greatest misconceptions about Ali is that White people loved him from the start. They didn’t. That he belonged to everyone from the start. He didn’t.”                 One of Ali’s daughters, Rasheda, told CNN Sport that her father’s life was far from the fairytale that today’s generation might assume it to be. “His life was in danger. He had death threats placed upon him because a lot of people didn’t like him,” she says.                 “They didn’t respect him. They thought he was unpatriotic. There was a lot of racism at that time.”                  From his humble beginnings in Louisville, Kentucky, Burns charts the rise of a promising – if unvarnished – athlete, who was inspired by the civil rights movement of the time.                 Born Cassius Clay in 1942, Ali was almost the same age as Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black boy who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955. According to the film, Ali was said to be haunted by the image of Till’s mutilated corpse, which his mother allowed to be photographed in an open casket at his funeral.                 After winning the Olympic gold medal in 1960 and turning professional later that year, Ali often listened to Louis Farrakhan’s 1961 song, “A White Man’s Heaven is a Black Man’s Hell,” but he knew to tread carefully on race because offending his group of all-White sponsors in Louisville might have damaged his chances of landing a title fight.                 Throughout the 60s, though, “Gaseous Cassius” began to find his voice, and not just to torment his opponents ahead of their fights. The late Alex Poinsett of Ebony Magazine described him as “a blast furnace of race pride, a pride scorched with the memories of a million little burns.” Additionally, his alignment with Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. ensured that he was viewed with suspicion by the White establishment in America.     READ: Long before Colin Kaepernick knelt, a Black female athlete defied the National Anthem             But after beating Sonny Liston to become world heavyweight champion in 1964, he saw no further reason to compromise his beliefs, telling the media, “I don’t have to be what you want me to be. I’m free to be what I want and to think what I want to think.” He soon changed his name to Cassius X, and would later change it again to Muhammad Ali and joined The Nation of Islam.                 As the new world heavyweight champion, Ali embarked on a five-week tour of Africa and the Middle East and quickly realized the power of his status, but he struggled to find acceptance at home.                 “The press is constantly trying to paint him as something other than what he actually is,” explained the civil rights leader Malcolm X at the time. “He is trying his best to live a clean life and project a clean image. He doesn’t smoke, he doesn’t drink. In fact, if he was White, they would be referring to him as the all-American boy.”                 In countless film clips and newspaper clippings, Burns’ film reveals a stubborn refusal by many people and organizations to acknowledge Ali by his name. “He’d been Muhammad Ali for ten years, [but] they still called him Clay,” Howard Bryant told CNN. “They were sending their own political message: ‘I am refusing to acknowledge you.’ And that is a powerful attack in and of itself: ‘I am not going to acknowledge your own existence.’”                 Little Ali ever did, though, was quite as divisive as his refusal to fight in the Vietnam War.                 Initially classed 1-Y and disqualified from military service because his writing and spelling skills were sub-standard – “I just said I was the greatest, I never said I was the smartest,” Ali joked – he was then reclassified 1-A and therefore eligible for the draft. Ali poured scorn on the reversal, “Without any test, without checking to see if I’m any wiser,” and he opposed the war on religious and moral grounds, he said in the film.                    Ali was now fighting battles on multiple fronts. On February 6th, 1967, he’d tormented Ernie Terrell in the ring because his opponent had refused to recognize his name. Ali’s performance was described by sports writers as “mean and malicious” and “a barbarous display of cruelty.”                 But two months later, Ali refused to step forward when his name was called at his scheduled induction into the US military, and according to the film, within hours the New York State Boxing Commission had stripped him of his license, and he was banned from boxing for three years.                 He was later sentenced to five-years in prison and a $10,000 fine for dodging the draft.                 Ali was unrepentant, “Why should me, and so-called other negroes, go 10,000 miles away from home here in America to drop bombs and bullets on other innocent Brown people?” Ali said that he was prepared to go in front of a firing squad if his punishment required it, “I’m prepared to die,” he says in the film.     Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features             In the prime of his career, Ali lost more than three-and-a-half years in the ring, and he resorted to speaking tours on college campuses to make ends meet. He couldn’t box, but he was still fighting.                 “He used his tongue to lacerate racism and White supremacy and oppression in America,” said Todd Boyd, professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts.                 “He became more militant, not less. He became more assertive, not less. He became more confrontational, not less.”                 Ali was addressing Black Panther rallies and anti-war hippies, uniting disparate groups around a common cause.                 When he finally got his boxing license back in 1970, Ali was able to expose the racism in America and the folly of the war. NAACP lawyers discovered that the New York State Athletic Commission had licensed 244  boxers who were guilty of crimes far worse than conscientious objection: manslaughter, second degree murder and armed robbery among them.                 “We were shocked at the numbers and the range of criminal offenses,” said lawyer Michael Meltsner, “It confirmed our sense that Ali had had been singled out for treatment because of his identity because of his affiliation with the Nation of Islam and because he was a prominent black figure.”     READ: Jack Johnson - The Black boxer who sparked race riots after world heavyweight win             As the anti-war protests grew, Black American men, many who had begun to see themselves as cannon fodder in Vietnam, had slowly become disenchanted and the war was now becoming more universally unpopular in the United States.                  “Even the people who disliked him the most at some level had to admit Vietnam was a failure,” Bryant told CNN Sport. “And if Vietnam was a failure, then how you treated him had to be addressed.”                 Many of his former detractors now cheered Ali on the comeback trail; against Joe Frazier in 1971 – the first time ever that two unbeaten boxers had fought for the heavyweight title – he made more money in one night at New York’s famed Madison Square Garden than the baseball star Hank Aaron had made in his entire career, according to the film.                 But he’d lost some of his speed and had to learn how to take a punch, a strength that would one day become his greatest weakness.                    For the first time in his career, Ali lost a fight – a unanimous judge’s decision – after 15 rounds of brutal boxing in the so-called ‘Fight of the Century.’     READ: ‘The Fight of the Century’ - A divided US nation 50 years on             But, three months later, he got an unexpected victory. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction against him: a shopkeeper ran after him in the street to break the news. In a film clip that was only discovered late in the editing process, Ken Burns says that Ali demonstrated an extraordinary awareness of his place in American history.                 Asked how he felt about the court’s decision, Ali told a reporter, “Well, I don’t know who’ll be assassinated tonight, I don’t know who’ll be enslaved or mistreated or deprived of some other justice or equality. All I can talk about is my case. And I’m thankful that the courts recognized my beliefs and my sincerity in this case.”                 “He’s thinking about way back for 350 years of the ill-treatment of Black people,” Burns explained to CNN Sport, “He’s thinking about Emmett Till and looking ahead to names he couldn’t have known but knew in his heart would be there like Rodney King, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. He has this presence, and you realize, my God, he is here for something bigger than himself.”                  Two of Ali’s four wives are profiled in the documentary and the producers didn’t shy away from some of the less flattering aspects of his life – his philandering and his cruelty to some of his opponents. “Our superficial media culture today presumes that heroes are perfect,” says Burns, “In fact, the Greeks have told us for millennia that a hero is not perfect.                 “He’s a serial womanizer, unfaithful to at least his first three wives and he treats Joe Frazier and several other opponents with a kind of disdain and Jim Crow language that’s inexcusable to my mind.”                 However, Burns points out that the women in his life still regard Ali with affection: “You see in their eyes the pain of that infidelity, but the love is still there, there’s a kind of forgiveness and understanding that they had a chance to accompany, for a time, an extraordinary human being.”                 “Ali could have $30,000 dollars in his pocket one afternoon and he’d come back with nothing,” said his second wife Khalilah, describing his extreme generosity to those less fortunate than himself. “He just loved to give if somebody was hurting, he loved to help the pain. I think he’ll go to paradise because of that, because he did give a lot to charity!”                 His daughter Rasheda described her father to CNN Sport as a gentle soul, a “teddy bear” at home. “My dad was very strong and powerful,” she said, “But my dad was very sensitive. He cried when he would read passages of the Quran, when he would be spiritually connected. He didn’t like going to funerals, it made him really sad.”     READ: Muhammad Ali’s grandson marks professional boxing debut with a victory             “He was such a generous human being,” adds Burns. “In fact, on his gravestone it says, ‘Service to others is the price you pay for your room in heaven.’ And I’ve got to assume he’s got a deluxe suite there.”                 Ali continued boxing in the 1970s, winning two of the most iconic fights of all time, ‘The Rumble in the Jungle’ against George Foreman in Zaire and the ‘Thrilla in Manila,’ a third fight against Joe Frazier.                 He was the first to win the world championship three different times and according to the film, earned $50 million, more than all the heavyweight champions combined before him, but the catalog of his ill-advised later fights is painful to watch, depicted in visceral detail on-screen.                 In 1980, Larry Holmes landed 340 punches to Ali’s 42, a one-sided fight that left the winner Holmes in tears and stunned the witnesses who were watching from ringside. “It was like watching a train wreck,” said the American journalist Dave Kindred, “Like watching a friend get run over by a truck. As emotional a night as I’ve ever had as a sportswriter.”                 Ali fought one more time. It was another one-sided bout against Trevor Berbick in 1981 – three years later he was diagnosed with the disease that would define the rest of his life.                  As Parkinson’s disease ate away at his central nervous system, the once quick-footed, fast-talking athlete was now in obvious decline. For a while, Ali was reluctant to admit it, but even he recoiled when he saw a clip of himself on The Today Show. “That man looked like he was dying,” he said.                 Perhaps the movie should have ended in 1974, when the underdog Ali outwitted and outboxed Foreman in Zaire. Instead, the denouement is a very different kind of comeback.  Ali had been largely forgotten until 1996, when he appeared unexpectedly in Atlanta, shaking but defiant, to light the Olympic flame.                 Bryant believes this was the moment that America undeniably fell in love with him: “Because he couldn’t talk [back]. He was safe.” Speaking in the film, Kindred agreed, “He can’t hurt us anymore, he can’t make us mad anymore. The game that we asked him to play to entertain us has left him looking like this. For every reason that we disliked him, now we love him because he was right.”                 “You can’t deny this American story,” concludes Bryant. “The thing with these public figures, especially the athletes, is that they are wallpaper for our lives. As they grow, we grow. You start looking and you reflect on your own life and at some point, you have to say, ‘Maybe, he wasn’t the problem. Maybe, I was.’”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

View more opinion on CNN.             Who could have predicted that in the two decades following the 9/11 attacks, the United States would wage various kinds of military operations in seven Muslim countries – in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen –  at the cost of at least $6 trillion and more than 7,000 American lives?                  In addition, tens of thousands of soldiers from countries allied to the United States died, as did hundreds of thousands of ordinary Afghans, Iraqis, Libyans, Pakistanis, Somalis, Syrians and Yemenis who were also killed during the so-called “war on terror.”                  All of this carnage was traceable back to Osama bin Laden’s decision to launch the 9/11 attacks.                  Al-Qaeda’s leader is one of the few people of whom it can truly be said that he changed the course of history. Just as an account of Nazism would be nonsensical without reference to the persona and worldview of Adolf Hitler, or a history of France after the revolution of 1789 would make no sense without an understanding of the goals and personality of Napoleon Bonaparte, so too our understanding of al-Qaeda and the ideology and violence it spawned would be incoherent without reference to bin Laden.                 This is an unapologetically old-school view of how history is actually made, which posits certain individuals are able to ride the tide of human events and shape them in new and unexpected ways.      Related articleWhat 9/11 tells us about unifying America             Of course, that is not to deny the importance of circumstance. Hitler could not have become Hitler without two hugely significant events: Germany’s defeat in World War I and the Great Depression. Nor could Napoleon have become Napoleon without the opportunities presented to him by the chaos of post-revolutionary France.                  But it’s impossible to understand World War II and the Holocaust without understanding Hitler’s ambitions and ideology, just as it’s impossible to understand why the largest army hitherto assembled in Europe marched into Moscow in September 1812 just weeks before the onset of the brutal Russian winter without understanding the vast ambitions of Napoleon.                 Bin Laden also came of age at a time of important historical changes. As a young man, he lived through a period of great ideological ferment in the Muslim world. During the 1970s, the early promises of socialism and Arab nationalism had delivered little in the way of prosperity or peace in the Middle East, and a new interest in religion gripped the region, a period of Islamic awakening that peaked in 1979 — the first year of a new century on the Muslim calendar — with three seismic events.                 First was the overthrow of the Shah of Iran by the cleric Ayatollah Khomeini, which showed the world that a US-backed dictator could be toppled by religious revolutionaries.                  Second was the armed takeover of Islam’s holy of holies, the mosque in Mecca, by Sunni militants. The assault on Mecca pushed the Saudi royal family to take a more conservative religious line at home and to finance the export of conservative Wahhabi clerics and mosques around the Muslim world (in part also to combat the rise of the new militant Shia regime in Iran).                  Finally, the “infidel” Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan precipitated a global movement of Muslims who traveled to Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan to help combat the Soviets. It was a thrilling time to be a deeply committed Muslim, as the 22-year-old bin Laden already was.                  In 1987, bin Laden set up a base — “Al Qaeda” in Arabic- — in Jaji in eastern Afghanistan, where he and a small group of followers fought the Soviets. From that base was forged a new group, al-Qaeda, and also a new doctrine of globalized jihadist terrorism, culminating in the 9/11 attacks, which reshaped the greater Middle East and also the United States itself in unexpected ways.      Related articleThe raging new Donald Trump campaign starts up where he left off             Bin Laden pushed forward with the 9/11 attacks despite internal opposition within al-Qaeda. In July 2001, Saif al-Adel, a senior al-Qaeda military commander, and Abu Hafs the Mauritanian, the group’s religious adviser, told bin Laden they opposed attacking the United States because they feared the likely American response and were worried the operation would anger the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, who were then hosting them in the country.                 Abu Hafs the Mauritanian was also concerned killing American civilians could not be justified on religious grounds.                 However, bin Laden ruled over al-Qaeda like a medieval monarch, and leaders of the group who were skeptical about the looming attacks in the United States were forced to go along with them.                 Bin Laden had a strategy for the 9/11 attacks that went beyond simply murdering as many American civilians as possible. He firmly believed the attacks would result in the withdrawal of American forces from the entire Middle East, which would then lead to the collapse of the US-supported Arab regimes that bin Laden despised.                 It was a strategy that made little sense, as the United States would surely follow its own interests and was hardly likely to abandon its substantial role in the Middle East. But bin Laden truly believed that the US was weak, just as the former Soviet Union had been, and could only absorb a few blows.                   He drew inspiration from other terrorist groups that had successfully attacked American targets, such as Lebanese Hezbollah, which had bombed the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 241 American Marines, sailors and soldiers. Within a few months of the attack, the United States pulled out all of its troops from Lebanon. The Marine barracks bombing was very much on bin Laden’s mind as he plotted attacks he believed would result in the United States removing its troops from its bases in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia.                  Perhaps the most profound change in the United States brought about by the 9/11 attacks was to greatly expand the military power of the US presidency. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), which Congress passed days after the 9/11 attacks, allowed President George W. Bush to “use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, or harbored such organizations or persons.”      Related articleWe're not villains or victims -- we're people seeking a better life             This authorization sanctioned “forever wars” that lasted for two decades after 9/11. Three presidents as different from each other as presidents Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump used the same authorization to carry out hundreds of drone strikes against groups such as ISIS, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Shabaab and the Pakistani Taliban. Few of these strikes had any connection to the perpetrators of 9/11.                  The AUMF was also used to justify various types of US military operations in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. And, of course, 9/11 fueled the flawed rationale for Bush to invade and occupy Iraq in 2003.                 This result was exactly the opposite of bin Laden’s aim with the 9/11 attacks, which was to push the United States out of the greater Middle East, so its client regimes in the region would fall. Instead, new American bases proliferated throughout the region – in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda lost the best base it ever had in Afghanistan. Rather than ending American influence in the Muslim world, the 9/11 attacks greatly amplified it.                  Bin Laden later put a post-facto gloss on the strategic failure of 9/11 by dressing it up as a great success and claiming the attacks were a fiendishly clever plot to embroil the US in costly wars in the Middle East. Three years after 9/11, bin Laden released a videotape in which he asserted, “We are continuing this policy of bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy.”                  There was no evidence it was really bin Laden’s plan in the run-up to the 9/11 attacks, although it is true the investment of American blood and treasure in the wars in the greater Middle East likely weakened the United States.                 Bin Laden’s 9/11 attacks also had unpredictable, long-term effects on US politics. Real estate impresario Donald Trump launched his political career with the lie that President Barack Obama wasn’t an American and was secretly a Muslim. This lie was especially potent in the context of 9/11, one of the hinge events of American history that touched off a surge of anti-Muslim prejudice. During his presidential campaign, Trump often claimed he had seen “thousands” of Arabs cheering the 9/11 attacks from their rooftops in New Jersey. This was false, but it played well with Trump’s base.     Related articleHe's on the FBI's most-wanted list and is now a key member of the Taliban's new government             Trump’s presidential campaign also took place during a wave of mass casualty jihadist terrorist attacks in the West. On November 13, 2015, ISIS terrorists killed 130 people in Paris. Within seven months of the Paris attacks, ISIS-inspired terrorists killed 14 people at an office in San Bernardino, California, and 49 people at an Orlando nightclub. As a result, in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, just over half of Americans said they were “very” or “somewhat” worried they, or a member of their family, would be victims of terrorism. This was the largest number to feel this way since just after 9/11.                  Sensing a real political opportunity, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslim immigration to the States and asserted that many Muslims have “great hatred towards Americans.” Polling in early 2016 showed half of all Americans supported banning Muslims traveling to the United States. Other polls showed terrorism as a top-two issue for Americans, with Trump holding a slight advantage over his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, on the issue.                 For al-Qaeda, 9/11 was a great tactical victory. The group inflicted more direct damage on the United States in one morning than the Soviet Union had during the Cold War. But ultimately, it was a strategic failure for the organization, just as Pearl Harbor was for Imperial Japan. A longtime associate of bin Laden’s estimated as a result of the US campaign against al-Qaeda after 9/11, 1,600 of the 1,900 Arab fighters then living in Afghanistan were killed or captured. And almost a decade after 9/11, bin Laden himself was killed by US Navy SEALs raiding his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.                   But now al-Qaeda has been given a new lease on life by President Joe Biden’s ill-considered and hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan and the speedy takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban.

Yet Islam continues to be largely misunderstood by many, which has given way to Islamophobia and even violence against Muslims.                 While Islamophobia existed long before 9/11, a dislike for Islam and Muslims became more deliberately weaponized in the service of war and politics in the post-9/11 world, says Dalia Mogahed, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU).                  Mogahed and others say that post 9/11 Islamophobia has manifested in different ways around the world, including the adoption of the Muslim travel ban – one of former President Trump’s signature policies; the persecution of the Uyghur people in China since at least 2017; and the mass murder of the Rohingya in Myanmar.                 Twenty years after 9/11, ignorance about Islam and an “othering” of its adherents continue to be driven by tropes. Here are the most common:                 Islam started in the Middle East, but has since spread all over the world. From the Rohingya in Myanmar, to the Uyghurs in China, and Bosniaks in the Balkans, Muslims are an extremely diverse community and do not come from a single region.                 Although many people use the terms “Muslim” and “Arab” interchangeably, it is not accurate to do so.                 “Arabs are actually a minority of the Muslim population, both globally and in United States,” Mogahed told CNN. “They make up 20% of the world’s Muslims.”                 Muslims are not a monolith, and are of all different races, skin tones, ethnicities and speak different languages.                 Patriarchy and the oppression of women are issues that exist in all communities, not just Muslim ones.                 “This is a common one we get, and it speaks to the ignorance and lack of context about Islam,” said Zainab Chaudry, spokeswoman for the national headquarters of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). “Islam granted women rights to an education, property ownership, inheritance, and divorce.”     Related article'Those people are not me'             “One of the key points to keep in mind is that culture often gets conflated with religion,” Chaudry said. “Islam actually encourages women to keep their autonomy and agency.”                 While interpretation of religion can result in the oppression of women, it’s usually rooted in other issues as well, Mogahed said.                 “It is a problem of egos, power, and self-interest and happens in spite of Islam, not because of it,” she said.                 The hijab is a veil covering the hair that some Muslim women wear in order to practice modesty.                 “The reality is that according to survey research, about half of Muslim women in the US wear it and half do not, it’s an even split,” said Mogahed of the ISPU’s findings.                  While some governments, like those of Saudi Arabia and Iran, have made the hijab mandatory for women in public spaces, Islam itself forbids compulsion of any sort.                 “It should be a personal decision for each woman,” Chaudry said. “It alone is not an accurate indicator of piety.”                 Claims that Islam encourages violence against non-Muslims are usually the result of people isolating verses from the religious texts that grant Muslims the right to defend themselves.                 “Cherry-picking verses from any religious text, including the Quran, and isolating them from their broader context and misapplying them to justify or condone any kind of violence is inappropriate and deeply harmful,” said Chaudry.     Related article'Innocent Until Proven Muslim': How Islamophobia lingers in post-9/11 era             In fact the Quran is very clear about violence. Chapter 5, Verse 32 states: “Whosoever kills an innocent human being, it shall be as if he has killed all mankind, and whosoever saves the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind.”                 Members of all faiths have carried out violence, Chaudry said. It has more to do with the individual than it does the religion.                  “People who regurgitate the myth that Islam is violent haven’t studied the religion,” she said.                  In the West, the term “jihad” is often used interchangeably with “holy war.” But that’s not what it means.                 Jihad is an Arabic term meaning “to strive” or “to struggle.” In the context of Islam, it means to work toward becoming a better Muslim.                  There are two types of jihad, inner and outer, with the former being known as the “greater jihad,” and can encompass anything from not giving into temptations or making a greater effort to pray.                  Outer jihad, or “lesser jihad,” can refer to a military struggle, but more commonly refers to actions like being kind to others or being a good representative of the faith.                 Mogahed points out that the term “holy war” originated from The Crusades, a series of wars initiated by the Christian church, and does not originate in Arabic or the Muslim tradition at all.                 “And war is not and can never be holy,” she added.                 Allah is the Arabic word for “God,” not a special and specific god that Muslims worship.                  “Muslims worship the god of Abraham, the same god Christians and Jews worship,” Mogahed said. “Christian Arabic speakers call God ‘Allah’ as well.”                 Jesus is a prophet in Islam, just as Muhammad is. The notion that Muslims do not believe in Jesus is one rooted in the “othering” of the religious group.                 “Muslims believe in all of the prophets mentioned in the old and new testaments [of the bible],” Mogahed said. “Muslims see Muhammad as the final prophet, rather than the first and only, like many incorrectly believe.”                 As a matter of fact, there’s an entire chapter dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the Quran, Chaudry said.                  “Jesus has a really prominent role in Islam, and he is beloved to Muslims just as Muhammad is,” she said.                 Sharia has become a bit of a dirty word in the West, and is sometimes interpreted as incompatible with democracy. That couldn’t be further from the truth, Chaudry said.                 “Sharia is a set of guidelines that are taken from the Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammad that are designed to help Muslims live a moral and ethical way of life,” said Chaudry. “People have developed misconceptions about it because of misinformation shared through media, pop culture, and anti-sharia bills that contribute to hysteria.”                 As a matter of fact, part of Sharia is that Muslims must abide by the law of the land in which they reside, said Chaudry, which debunks the notion that Muslims want to bring the guidelines to the West.                 Even Muslim-majority countries don’t fully adopt or follow sharia, but rather a hybrid of laws left behind by European colonialism and sharia, added Chaudry.                 The collective blame of the Muslim community following the actions of terrorists is “immoral,” Mogahed says.                 “It’s unethical and bigoted to blame an entire group for the actions of individuals,” she said. “It says that unless and until we condemn acts of terrorism, then by default, we are guilty.”                 “The idea that Muslims have to do that or it’s fair game to assume we agree with terrorism is unacceptable.”                 The endorsement of any and all Islamophobic tropes is dangerous not only for Muslims, but for everyone.                 “Endorsing these tropes is linked to approval of war, violence against civilians and anti-Muslim policies,” she said. “Fear kills freedom, so Islamophobia is bad for democracy, not just Muslims.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

He hadn’t engaged in illegal activity. But his innocence didn’t matter, he said, because he was Muslim.     Muhammad Tanvir, who was living lawfully in the US, said that, in 2007, FBI agents approached him and asked him to consider working as an informant against Muslims. Tanvir refused, but the FBI continued to pressure him over the next several years, eventually placing his name on the no-fly list, he said. Being on the list limited his ability to travel domestically, and made it impossible to travel abroad. He quit his job as a long-haul trucker because he couldn’t fly, and alleged that after he bought a ticket to visit his ailing mother in Pakistan, he wasn’t allowed to board.                 Tanvir’s experience wasn’t unique. In 2013, he and two other men – Jameel Algibhah and Naveed Shinwari – filed suit, saying that the FBI had placed them on the no-fly list to coerce them into acting as informants.                 In December 2020, in a unanimous decision, the US Supreme Court held that, under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, federal officials may be liable in their individual capacities if they violate a person’s religious rights. The high court also said that the three men were entitled to seek damages.                 Very definitely, the outcome was a victory for the plaintiffs. Yet the decision had a dark undertow. It served as a reminder that, in crucial ways, the social and political fallout from September 11, 2001, can still inflict great harm, even 20 years on.                 After all, it was in the weeks following the terrorist attacks – a tragedy that claimed almost 3,000 lives – that the US government dramatically expanded its use of the no- fly list, a move that attracted criticism. The backlash came from progressive quarters, and was aimed at the fact that the list disproportionately targeted innocent people even for appearing to be Arab or Muslim.                 It was here, in the aftermath of 9/11, that the US saw the start of an era of heightened Islamophobia, as well as the launch of the war on terror and the invasion of Afghanistan. To discuss how Islamophobia has congealed – been institutionalized – in the two decades since 9/11, I spoke with Dr. Maha Hilal, author of the forthcoming book, “Innocent Until Proven Muslim: Islamophobia, the War on Terror and the Muslim Experience Since 9/11.”                 The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.     Islamophobia certainly existed in the US long before 9/11. But could you explain how the war on terror became a turning point in this history?             I always go back to George W. Bush’s speech on September 20, which was the first time he used the phrase “war on terror.” And in that speech, he set the boundaries of the war on terror that he would conceive with his administration. He essentially talked about how the US must respond to this terrorist violence, and how there was really no choice but to do it with violence. The main targets were obviously the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and he mentioned that this wouldn’t be a war against Islam, that basically there are some good Muslims.                 If you were an average Muslim, you might’ve thought on hearing the speech: “OK, this isn’t targeting all of us. It’s really just targeting the quote-unquote bad Muslims.” But in acquiescing the Muslim population and in making them believe that this wasn’t a large-scale targeting of Muslims, the Bush administration actually made it easier to move forward with many of the policies that it developed, especially in the earlier years.                 And we know that institutionalized Islamophobia was at the very core of the war on terror from the onset, from the signing of the AUMF (the Authorization for Use of Military Force), to the war in Afghanistan, to the memorandum that gave the CIA the authority to detain suspects.                 We know this not because of explicit policy language but because of whom these policies targeted. Part of what I talk about in my book is the way that target populations are socially constructed, and these constructions are embedded in policy design and implementation. So, usually what happens is that people view at least some policies as neutral on their face, which then means that they can’t be Islamophobic. However, when it comes to whom these policies are targeting, it’s been either exclusively or disproportionately Muslims.     Something that too often seems to be missing from conversations on 9/11 is the fact that it hit different parts of the Arab and Muslim American communities differently. Could you talk about that?             That’s the tricky thing about Islamophobia, because Muslims are an extremely diverse population. When I talk about my definition of Islamophobia, I believe that it’s rooted in anti-religious animus, but then there are intersecting identities that make different Muslims’ experiences of Islamophobia different.                 I’ve talked with Black Muslims, and one thing I’ve heard repeatedly is that they don’t know if they’re being targeted because they’re Muslim or Black or both. Or with countering violent extremism, the US government heavily targeted the Somali population. So, I think that there are all these different manners in which we have to consider Islamophobia.     What do people get wrong about the post-9/11 landscape for Arab and Muslim Americans?             The way I think about the war on terror is that, in the beginning, it targeted non-citizens. My analysis of that is that the idea that US citizenship provides certain rights wasn’t something that the US government wanted to go after immediately, even though it did in part. The war was more robustly targeted at non-citizens.                 But then, eventually, we saw the proliferation of policies targeting citizens, because once you successfully merge Muslims as one collective monolith – which wasn’t that hard to do, since that had been a construction for a long time – the citizenship piece just dissolves. It doesn’t matter if you’re American if you’re also Muslim, because the Muslim identity trumps the American identity in terms of what rights you’re afforded.     Are you concerned that what’s happening in Afghanistan – especially the framing of the situation – will have a negative impact on Afghan refugees in the US?             Absolutely. But the narrative on Afghanistan has been problematic from the beginning of the war. Donald Rumsfeld said in 2001: “We did not start this war. So understand, responsibility for every single casualty in this war – whether they’re innocent Afghans or innocent Americans – rests at the feet of al-Qaeda and the Taliban.”                 This is troubling because the US de facto assumes that violence is the only legitimate and justifiable intervention. In my book, I talk about how there were lots of narratives that described 9/11 as a break with history. The strategic role of that was to say that history starts now. But why does history start now? No, it started when empire began.                 In regard to Afghanistan, the US has often put itself in the position of, first of all, trying to get rid of all the terrorists, which is impossible if you’ve decided that history started in 2001, because you’ll never actually get to the root of the problem. And second, it’s always that Afghans need the US’s help. What I think is problematic about the way President Joe Biden has been talking about Afghanistan is that he keeps saying that this wasn’t a nation-building project. But the original goal in going to Afghanistan was to capture Osama bin Laden, who was killed in Pakistan in 2011. So, what, exactly, was the US doing for the last 10 years?                 And there’s so much paternalism, which has pretty much been the approach to all countries, particularly Muslim countries, that have been targeted by the US under the guise of the war on terror. It’s essentially: We need to help you figure out that terrorism isn’t the way to go. But that eliminates the possibility of discussing the discrimination that Muslims face and the state violence that the US commits.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Every Muslim in America has a story to tell. Here are some of them.","Sep 10, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Alaa Elassar,International,"(CNN) — Many Muslims in the United States point to September 11, 2001, as the day their relationship with the country changed.                 Islamophobia had always existed, but the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia seemingly made it worse – much worse.                 Muslims of all stripes – citizens, immigrants and refugees – faced backlash. Many were ostracized and harassed, some physically assaulted and even killed. Charged rhetoric, successive wars and attacks further inflamed the situation.                 Feeling condemned for crimes they didn’t commit, some Muslims changed their names and clothing to conceal their identities, while others clung even tighter to their faith. A few became outspoken advocates for the community.                  Every Muslim in America has a story to tell. Here are some of them.                 Ruwa Romman, 28, is a Palestinian American community organizerand policy analystliving in Duluth, Georgia.                 When the terrorists attacked, she was 8 years old and had just recently immigrated to the US with her parents. But the dream she had of building a new life in America quickly turned into a nightmare.                 “I remember the hallways and the day seemed darker even though I remember it was sunny outside,” Romman told CNN about her experience in school that day. “I don’t think I fully understood what was happening since I barely spoke English.”                 Still, she recalls the long list of insults hurled at her as a child: “terrorist” and “sand n****r.” Some even asked if she was related to Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda mastermind behind the attacks.                 Romman says she can’t remember a single day in elementary school when the bullying stopped. High school wasn’t much better – with one teacher pulling her out of class to ask if her family belongs to a terrorist group.                 Outside of school, a close friend’s family banned her from their home because she was Muslim and “dangerous,” she said. Airport travel required numerous bag checks – sometimes three times during a single trip.                  The bullying and harassment set Romman on a path to educate and advocate for her community, even at a young age.                 “I felt this sense of duty to never respond to every terrible comment made to me and instead try to educate people,” Romman said. “Looking back at my younger self, I’m so angry and sad for her. I didn’t have to do any of that. I was a kid trying to grow up and figure out my life. All of a sudden I’d become an ambassador for a billion people around the world.”                 “I remember trying so hard to get people to just see me as a person,” she added. “I stubbornly ignored the reality in front of me that my community was being systemically targeted from airports to universities to mosques. It wasn’t until I was around 18 that I began to learn about government entrapment, surveillance of students in Muslim Student Associations, and so much more.”                 In 2016, Romman joined the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, as their communications director. She’s since become a community organizer, policy analyst and consultant working on related issues.                  Romman says advocating for US Muslims and the issues they face is daunting, but sees hope in every small victory.                 “We will continue to be politically engaged and unapologetically so.” Romman said. “Muslims are no longer willing to carry that burden. None of us committed 9/11. Why should we carry that burden?”                 Qasim Rashid, 39, is a Pakistani American human rights lawyer living in Stafford, Virginia.                 He remembers standing with coworkers in front of the office TV watching the World Trade Center collapse. Like the others, he was shocked by the news, but then he overheard a colleague whisper “rag heads” and fear set in.                 “I moved here when I was four, so this was the only home I knew,” Rashid told CNN. “I’m American through and through in every sense of the word. But I was 19, Muslim, and I had a beard, and suddenly people couldn’t see me as American.”                 Random police stops became his norm. Racial slurs that once felt so jarring eventually became predictable. And anytime Rashid met someone new, he braced for when they would inevitably bring up 9/11.                 “Whether I liked it or not, just by existing I was suddenly representing 1.6 billion Muslims,” Rashid said. “I knew if I didn’t take an active role in writing my narrative, my story, someone else is going to do it for me and it’s not going to be true.”                 He channeled his desire for truth and justice into studying law, and now works as a human rights lawyer representing Muslims, among other marginalized communities.                 “There have been immense atrocities and horrific violence committed against Muslims because of 9/11. We saw things like the Patriot Act, the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay and the indefinite detention of people without due process of law,” Rashid said.                 “I knew I had to do something to create the kind of country I thought America should be; one based on justice and compassion,” he added. “Becoming a lawyer was an acknowledgment that this country has noble values of equal justice and protection and a constitution worth fighting for.”                 Much of Rashid’s work has centered on issues of immigration, asylum and women’s rights.                  Fighting for justice in the court system hasn’t been easy, he said, but he’s heartened by the next generation, which has become increasingly vocal about rights issues and intolerant of hate.                 As for young Muslims, he offers these words of advice: “Be fierce and be courageous in your identity. You don’t need to be ashamed or shy about it. Embrace it fully and confidently, and do so while leading with justice and creating an inclusive world for all voices.”                 Nakibur Rahman, 44, is a Bangladeshi American university professor living in Fayetteville, North Carolina.                  He immigrated to the US just weeks before 9/11 – young, confident and inspired to make his dreams come true. But everything changed that fateful morning, and the future didn’t seem so bright anymore.                 “What came to my mind immediately was my friends and family in New York, one who worked in the towers,” Rahman told CNN. “It was a very traumatic moment for me, and I hadn’t even had the time to think about what this could mean for my community.”                 His loved ones were found safe, but the fear and panic he felt remain with him to this day.                 “If I close my eyes, it’s like I’m watching a movie,” Rahman said. “I can see exactly what happened from the moment I woke up to the moment I saw the attack on TV. After that, it was like my life stopped and I couldn’t remember anything.”                 Rahman said he was fortunate to receive loads of support from his community in Maine, where he was in graduate school at the time. Still, he thought twice about doing or saying anything that could be misconstrued as suspicious.                 “I was lucky to be surrounded by kindness, but something would always bring me back to reality,” he said. “I was constantly reminded of the same question: Am I going to be subject to backlash because a Muslim group committed this? It made me sad and very careful.”                 His fears were bolstered by frequent news reports of hate crimes targeting Muslims. He said it led to a terrifying realization for the Muslim community that ultimately brought them together.                 “The Muslim community learned that the things we cherish most in this country, the First Amendment, liberty, and pursuit of happiness could be taken away from us in a second,” Rahman said. “We came together because of that.”                 For decades, Muslims have lived in the shadow of 9/11, but Rahman believes the future won’t be as dark.                 “Muslim organizations we see today that are flourishing were born after 9/11, when we realized that if we don’t start helping ourselves, be active in the community, tell our sides of the story, no one else is going to do it for us,” he said. “And we refuse to be made the scapegoats forever.”                 Ashanti Jabri, 27, is a data analyst and martial artist living in Atlanta.                 Jabri says he always felt like an outsider in the South. Being both Black and Muslim, he was taught to be wary of racism and Islamophobia from a very young age. But Jabri didn’t really understand what that meant until the morning of the attacks.                 He was outside playing with his brother and some neighborhood kids when the news broke.                 “It was an absolutely beautiful day, there was nothing around me but laughter, before my dad screamed our names and we ran to the house,” Jabri said. “He took us into our parents’ room, and my mom was sitting on the bed crying and CNN was playing in the background. It was extraordinarily scary.”                 His parents explained what happened, before telling their children that even though they hadn’t done anything wrong, their lives would be forever changed.                 Jabri was told that he was no longer allowed to play or be outside alone. For a year, his mother took off her hijab and his father stopped wearing a kufi, a traditional cap worn by some Muslim men.                 “For our safety, we had to live very under the radar,” he said. “As a child, I was just terrified all the time of anyone realizing I was Muslim and thinking I was a bad person. I felt like I didn’t know who I was anymore because of the way the world saw Muslims. Was I the enemy?”                 Jabri struggled with his identity for years. He debated dropping his middle name, Omar, because it sounded Muslim. At times he tried to hide his religion, and often questioned if it was his responsibility to fight back against Islamophobia.                 “It was like I felt the need to constantly denounce those acts and ideologies, to remind people ‘Those people are not me. I am not that kind of Muslim’,” Jabri said. “I was constantly analyzing myself and what I had to say instead of dealing with the issues 9/11 caused me as a Muslim.”                 Jabri said his whole life was marked by incessant reminders of 9/11, including harassment from community members and law enforcement. His mother was verbally and physically assaulted, and he was once questioned by the FBI after a trip abroad.                 “Every day after 9/11 was a very constant reminder that I was living in a place that wasn’t comfortable with me existing as me,” Jabri said. “Being a Black man as well as a Muslim in America, it felt like people only saw me as a threat. My very essence intimidated people and I didn’t know how to live with that.”                 Jabri still feels “abandoned, hurt, and criminalized” for being himself, but says he’s now more confident in his identity and does not harbor animosity.                 “I’m just grateful to be part of a community that’s so strong and resilient to survive that kind of backlash,” he said.                 “We have seen the best out of Muslims after 9/11,” Jabri added. “We went from our communities being near obscurity to hearing our wonderful voices in journalism, sports, politics, arts, business, and activism. So many voices have been given a chance to be heard and show what Islam is really about.”                 Nadia Ahmad, 41, is a Pakistani-Indian American professor living in Altamonte Springs, Florida.                 Ahmad was buried in a pile of books and LSAT practice tests when her sister called to tell her the US was under attack and authorities believed Muslim extremists were to blame.                 “I flung the books from my lap and started pacing around the house, thinking what would happen,” Ahmad told CNN. “I had that same feeling when Donald Trump was elected President in 2016. What will happen to us?”                 Her heart broke for all the innocent people who died. She also knew the backlash against Muslims would be harsh, and wondered if her law career was over before it could even start.                 It wasn’t long before news of hate crimes targeting Muslims began to make national headlines. Some Muslim women who typically wore the hijab removed their headscarves, but Ahmad refused.                 She described her hijab as a “shield” and the source of her courage.                  “I didn’t care if I stuck out like a sore thumb,” Ahmad said. “I remember a few days later when I went back to my LSAT class and stopped at a nearby gas station, a man yelled at me, ‘Go back to your country.’ I stared back at him and his pathetic existence and walked away.”                 Almost immediately, Ahmad began organizing within her community to educate and advocate for Muslims.                 “I don’t think I paused to process what had happened on 9/11, because I was too busy responding. I couldn’t grieve, because I felt under siege,” Ahmad said. “Everything changed suddenly. The ground beneath our feet was shifting. At the same time, there was no way as an American-born, Berkeley-educated Muslim woman I would cower in this situation.”                 She organized local meetings that brought the Muslim community, government officials and law enforcement together to tackle such issues as civil rights protections and hate crime reporting. When the US declared its “War on Terror” and invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, she helped organize anti-war rallies in Orlando that were attended by thousands. She was even invited to speak at Church Center for the United Nations about women’s rights and wartime violence.                 All the while, Ahmad silently battled depression, anxiety, and paranoia that she attributes to the backlash she faced after 9/11.                 Now, as a law professor, she aims to inspire young people to continue fighting for Muslim rights in the US.                 “Muslims now are stronger as a community,” she said. “While in many ways we are so powerless and silenced, we have fought back against stereotypes. We have added our own narratives.”                 Aneelah Afzali, 44, is an Afghan American community organizer in Seattle.                 Before coming to the US, her family fled as refugees from Afghanistan to Germany to escape an invasion by the former Soviet Union.                 In America, they hoped to build a new and promising future for themselves. But the journey toward a better life away from war and injustice wasn’t going to be easy.                 On the morning of the attacks, Afzali was glued to the TV in her dorm room, watching in horror as the World Trade Center’s towers fell. “I had difficulty breathing, and a sickening feeling grew in my belly – about those killed, about what this would mean for our country and the world,” she said.                 Then came worries that her family, friends and community were also at risk.                 “Here I was, grieving like other Americans for those killed and their family and loved ones – but unlike other Americans, I knew Muslims could not simply grieve,” said Afzali. “Even though Muslims were killed in the attacks, and Muslims were part of the frontline workers risking their lives to try to save so many in New York and beyond, Muslims were still being demonized and collectively blamed. And that broke my heart.”                 Afzali said she felt “disgusted, angry and sad” that the perpetrators claimed Islam as their religion.                 As hate crimes targeting Muslims increased, so did her anxiety. She was especially concerned for her parents, who owned a small market and gas station. When her father hung an American flag at the store, she wondered if it was enough to protect them from bigots.                 After graduating from law school, Afzali worked for two firms and ran the legal department at a healthcare IT company. She did her best to educate those around her about Islam and American Muslims, but always felt she could do more.                 In 2013, after what Afzali calls a “spiritual transformation,” she left her legal career andfounded the American Muslim Empowerment Network (AMEN), a grassroots organization dedicated to educating Americans on Islam and building coalitions to fight Islamophobia. AMEN has trained more than 5,000 people on related issues.                  Despite the group’s success, Afzali worries that recent events in Afghanistan could spark a new wave of bigotry and violence against Muslims in the US.                 “I fear the narrative may shift again because we often see the wholly inappropriate conflation of the brutal behavior of groups like the Taliban with the teachings of Islam, which drives Islamophobia,” she said. “And with the looming Afghan refugee crisis, we may also experience an increase in xenophobia as well.”                 The hope, she says, is that Americans will take all the positive things they’ve learned about Muslims since 9/11 and use it to work toward unity and justice.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

In the anthology “It’s Not About The Burqa,” editor Mariam Khan highlights the importance of centering Muslim women in this discussion, writing that they are “more than burqas, more than hijabs, and more than society has allowed us to be until now.”                 “We are not asking for permission any more. We are taking up space.”                  As Muslim women find themselves marginalized by society, Khan speaks to the way that they must forge their own narratives and create visibility in spaces that weren’t built for them.                  That’s exactly what parkour athlete Sara Mudallal is doing.                  By practicing the sport, Mudallal hopes she can encourage more women to enter what she describes as a “male dominated” field.                  “It’s kind of intimidating for women to sometimes come in and hang out and things like that. But now, recently, more women have been showing up, so it’s been more comfortable for women to come in and practice,” 26-year-old Mudallal tells CNN Sport.                  “It starts with one and you have to stand up for that, and then you bring more people in.”                 In most of the parkour jams she attends – where parkour practitioners congregate and train together – she says she’s often the only hijabi athlete.                  “I still am like the only person who wears the hijab, of course […] we still have a long way to go with that for women to feel confident in themselves,” she says.                  But Mudallal is used to standing out.                 She grew up in Los Angeles, where she was athlete of the year in high school – and garnered the same title in middle school three years in a row.                  “I’m very well-rounded. Like I can play soccer, I can play basketball, I can play football. I can play tennis. Except golf – I don’t know how to play golf,” she muses.                  When she was 12, her mother enrolled her in karate classes, where she went on to earn a first and second degree black belt.                  At the beginning of 2015, Mudallal decided to start wearing a headscarf. That same year, a friend introduced her to parkour.                  Having gained significant lower body strength and core balance from karate, she says she was built for the sport.                  “My legs were already pretty strong,” Mudallal says. “In terms of taking a bad landing … I was safe.”                 “I’ve always loved climbing and jumping on things and didn’t really know that was a sport, didn’t really know it was a technique.”                 As a beginner, Mudallal says she was welcomed into the parkour and freerunning community with open arms.                  “I do not feel that people did not want me in the group,” she says. “I didn’t give them that chance to make me feel that way. It’s about personality, it’s about how strong you are. If you are shy doing anything because of what you’re wearing, you have to check yourself with that, then why are you wearing it, you know?                 “I didn’t really care, if I was wearing or not wearing [a headscarf], my interests are still the same. And I really wanted to do parkour, so I went in regardless of what I look like on the outside.”                 While sport has always given Mudallal the space to express herself, Iranian parkour coach and former national gymnast Fatemeh Akrami has memories of feeling hampered as a young athlete.                  Growing up as a shy child, Akrami’s mother signed her up for local gymnastics classes when she was six, in the hopes of bringing her out of her shell.                  “I was a super shy girl, I didn’t even say hi to strangers. I was hiding behind my mother’s back because I was so shy,” the 27-year-old Tehran native tells CNN Sport.                  Despite her initial apprehension, Akrami quickly excelled. She says she won her first medal at a national competition when she was 12 and joined the national team a year later. Akrami went on to clinch two gold medals and one silver at the Islamic Solidarity Games in Iran in 2007.                  But while Akrami was enjoying success in the spotlight, she was struggling behind the scenes.                  She says that due to international gymnastics dress code rules at the time, she wasn’t able to compete on a global stage in accordance with Iran’s mandatory hijab law, which was enacted by the Islamic Republic in 1983.                 Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the country hasn’t dispatched a single female athlete to participate in the Olympics in swimming, wrestling or gymnastics – including at this year’s Tokyo Games.                  “It’s even harder for the girls in Iran,” Akrami says. “You train like an Olympian, but you never get there, so it’s hard to keep yourself motivated.”                 “I think like in ten years I didn’t attend a funeral, a wedding, a birthday party, none of them,” she adds.                  Dealing with the pressure of competing in any high intensity sport is challenging, but Akrami says that juggling the demands of training while attending school was doubly exhausting.                   “Gymnastics is a very hard sport. You have to put a lot of effort because you have to be mentally and physically prepared to be in a competitive level,” she says. “We were experiencing a lot of pressure.”                 “In the weekdays, I used to go to school from 7:00 a.m. until 1p.m. And then from the school, my mother used to pick me up and then [go] straight to the gym until 10:00 p.m,” she adds. “So in the Friday, which was the weekend […] there was no rest. So we had to train from 9:00 in the morning until 9:00 in the evening.                 “Training hard gives you mental pressure because you get tired, you have school, you have homework, you have training. Like sometimes, the training don’t go well, you don’t get the skill right. It takes too long, sometimes you get injured.                 “I don’t remember sleeping at night without having pain.”                 After Akrami left her career as a professional gymnast at the age of 18, she was looking for a fresh start.                  She had just begun university, when one of her peers encouraged her to try out parkour.                  “It was like, ‘OK, what’s next?,’” Akrami says. “I always needed something more because gymnastics is a very exciting sport and […] every day you need the adrenaline rush.                 “He stopped in a park and told me, ‘Do you want to try some of the parkour skills?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, let’s give it a try. I think in the first thirty minutes, I got five or six […] skills of parkour, and I myself was super, super surprised.”                 While Akrami used to feel restricted by gymnastics, she says parkour gives her “self-confidence.”                 “In gymnastics, everything is so disciplined, you have to do everything just as they say. No more, no less. But in parkour, you can do any move with your body,” she says. “The philosophy of parkour is all about the freedom.”                 “You can do parkour wherever you want, whenever you want and with any dress you want. Like there’s no dress code. I can compete in a competition with my Islamic dress and that’s fine.                 “And you can do all the skills with your own body, with your own style, so it gives you a lot of choices. That’s the feeling of freedom that parkour gives.”                 Mudallal adds, “What’s cool about parkour is that every single person moves differently.”                 “It makes me feel free. It makes me feel like possibilities are endless, and I can do anything,” Mudallal says. “I fell in love with it as soon as I started.”                 Since Mudallal started practicing parkour, she has gone from strength to strength.                 Since posting videos of her freerunning adventures on social media, she has amassed over 35,000 followers.                  In July 2021, she attended the Red Bull Art of Motion competition in Greece – widely considered one of the highest-profile freerunning events in the sport.                  “It’s like for the first time, I felt like, ‘Oh, my God, like this is fate.’ Like this is being handed to me on a platter and I’m not going to say no to moving forward,” Mudallal says.                  “I just decided to, like, move forward with it and practice more and take it seriously more, but take it seriously in a way where I would still love it and not be dragged to go do parkour because it’s like my job. No, I want to do it because I love doing it,” she adds.                  In 2018, Mudallal also became the first hijabi athlete to appear on the assault course TV show American Ninja Warrior.                  “It was definitely something,” she says. “First time experiencing a game show […] understanding how TV and Hollywood […] how all that works.”                 “In terms of the hijab aspect, yes, that’s like my title. I am the first hijabi to go on American Ninja Warrior, but it’s like I was literally walking like any other person,” she adds. “They mentioned it on TV, but it wasn’t very focused on that.”                 Even though Mudallal is best known for being a hijabi parkour athlete, she says that being known by a singular label can feel reductive.                  “It’s a title I’ve had for a very long time. And moving forward, I don’t want to be only known as that because anybody could be a hijabi parkour athlete, but are they good at what they’re doing?” she says. “I want to show I’m definitely more than that.                 “It’s not up to people that wear hijab who play those sports to break them [stereotypes]. But it’s good to build that awareness that, ‘Hey, sit down, you know, like, stop creating that stereotype.’                 “I hope one day […] people will see me past the hijab.”                 Mudallal says that for some Muslim girls, making the decision to step outside one’s comfort zone can be met with hostility from people both inside and outside their community.                  Six years into her parkour journey, she says she still receives critical comments from people on social media.                 “In terms of what people say, I’m very past that, very past that. Because imagine if, like, I did stop parkour, I did listen [to] what people say – I’m the one who’s going to be miserable, like they’re just going to keep moving on with their life,” Mudallal says.                  “My word of advice to everyone who wants to move forward with this is stop asking, ‘Should I move forward?’ Do it. It’s a simple thing to say, but it’s a hard thing to do.                 “Everyone else is going to move forward, but someone’s always going to be stopping you for some reason. So you have to move past that. You have to get over that wall.”                 Akrami’s message to young Muslim girls? “Don’t let anything stop you.”                 “Go for it. Try and you’re going to accomplish it. I accept the fact that it might be harder a little bit, but it’s not impossible.”                 Luckily, both athletes can fall back on the support of their families.                  Mudallal says, “What I’ve noticed is […] sometimes in terms of culture, it’s like Arab fathers are very restrictive of what they want their daughters doing. And what’s different about my father is that because I’m the oldest child, he was always, ‘Sara, you’re going to grow up and you’re going to be independent, you’re going to grow your own business, you know, you’re going to make your own money.’                 “My mom is the same thing, you know, ‘You got to be strong, got to put your foot down, be confident.’ From where I am today, they’re just always, always, always supporting me.”                 Reminiscing about her gymnastics career, Akrami says she “gave up so many times.”                 “We never were a very rich family, but they gave me all I needed, all I wanted […] financially, mentally, […] so that was why I could stand all the pressure,” she adds. “They are super proud of where I am today.”                 Mudallal hopes that by sharing her story, she can encourage people to appreciate the depth and nuance of her journey and create space for more young Muslim women to step into the parkour industry.                  “I hope to see more girls like me pursue it,” she says. “The importance of me doing parkour. It’s just an expression of […] what I preach, of my movement. What I’ve grown, what I’ve taken in, what I’m showing out.                 “Parkour is still fairly a male dominated sport. And for women in general, they are increasing for sure, year by year and […] actually making a statement.”                 Akrami also hopes to see more girls freerunning, which is why she became a parkour coach when she was about 20.                  “I was like, ‘OK, there are so many girls and they are so passionate about parkour. You have to teach them what you know,’” Akrami says.                  So far, she says she’s taught 100 girls how to parkour and given certified training to about 50 more to become parkour coaches themselves.                  “When they get this skill, it gives me a better feeling than when I do the skill,” Akrami says.  “Because when they feel things, when they feel the joy, when they get excited, like, ‘OK, I got the skills,’ they’re screaming and running.”                 By sharing her knowledge, she hopes she can teach her students life skills, such as resilience and determination.                  “I’m really happy to let them [students] know, at least, that they can do this. So many of them are like, ‘No, we cannot train. It is impossible to train in Iran, to train parkour in Iran.’ At least they realize that it’s possible, you just haven’t got there. But it’s possible,” Akrami says.                  “It’s amazing how when you start doing parkour, it gives you the vision that nothing is as hard as it looks, even in life,” she adds. “When you try it, when you succeed and you are like, ‘Wow, did I really do that? Did I really jump that far?’ Yes, you did it. It was looking super hard […] but you never know unless you try it.”                 Ultimately, parkour is rooted in a counterculture that gives people who can be sidelined by society a way to center their stories and make themselves as visible as possible.                  Like Mudallal, Akrami shares her videos of her parkour tricks online to “let other people in the other countries and other continents of the Earth, to let them know that we exist.”                 “It’s like very common, and it’s a very interesting sport that so many girls are so passionate to start and to do. And yeah, we exist, we train parkour, and parkour has no limits and has no borders.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

She is the author of several books, including “Against White Feminism: Notes of Disruption” (W.W. Norton, August 2021). The views expressed here are hers. View more opinion on CNN.             “Turn Turk Tim and Renounce Thy Faith/In words as well as actions/Is it worse to follow Mahomet than the Devil?” So wrote Benjamin Franklin in “Poor Richard’s Almanack” in 1741. Franklin’s maxim here, comparing the Prophet Muhammad to Satan, is but one example of early American Islamophobia.     According to scholars Peter Gottschalk and Gabriel Greenberg, one in five enslaved persons brought to the United States from Africa were believed to be Muslim, but Puritan leaders like Cotton Mather dismissed the existence of Muslims altogether. Historian Thomas Kidd quotes Mather’s smug claim, “We are afar off, in a Land, which never had (that I ever heard of) one Mahometan breathing in it.”                  The Islamophobia that exists in the US today, politically weaponized as a legitimate political view by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, weighs heavily on Muslim-American shoulders. My daughter, who was months old when the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon and the hijacking and crash of United 93 in Pennsylvania happened, dreads September 11 just like so many other American Muslim children. Every September since the attacks, it seems, bullying and teasing ensue in American schools.                  In this way, Muslim-American children are rendered suspect year after year, ensuring that they always bear the wounds of being unfairly demonized.                 But as the world acknowledges the 20th anniversary of the attacks, it’s crucial to understand that America did not start discriminating against Muslims after 9/11. The seeds of Islamophobia in this country were sown long ago and nourished for centuries, though they bore their most poisonous fruit after September 11, 2001.      Related articleIt's time for America to do some 'nation building' at home             Recognizing these early roots of American Islamophobia, rather than focusing on a singular event, is one important way to counter its further (and still growing) proliferation. According to the Pew Foundation, in 2017 a whopping 48% of American Muslims said they had personally experienced discrimination, despite the fact that they make up a paltry 1.1% of the total US population. In March 2021, Pew found that 78% of Americans say Muslims are likely to face discrimination in the US.                 It was in the last century that the US government also got into the act of singling out Muslims for mistreatment. In February 1987, the New York Times ran a story about a detailed memo originating from within the Immigration and Naturalization Service, then a division of the Department of Justice. It outlined a plan to apprehend, detain and deport large numbers of Iranians and Arabs living in the United States in case of a national emergency – not unlike the detainment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.                  The memo reflected then-President Ronald Reagan’s desire for a more aggressive approach to the growing threat of terrorism faced by Americans, evident in bombings and hijackings in the 1980s. The work was the product of a committee within the INS authorized by the DOJ. After the memo became public, according to Politico, the committee was terminated and the plan abandoned. In interviews later, also according to Politico, committee members defended the rationale for the memo but also insisted the plan was not seriously considered for implementation.                 Not long after the towers fell 20 years ago, Muslim non-citizens were indeed told to report to “special registration.” The National Security Entry-Exit System (NSEERS), which carried echoes of what the 1980s plan proposed, required all male visa-holders above the age of 16 coming from 24 Muslim-majority countries to submit to being photographed, finger-printed and interrogated, even if they had no connection whatsoever to any terrorist activity and had never been accused of any crime.      Related articleOn 9/11, my 'White card' was revoked According to a 2012 Penn State Law and Rights Working Group report, nearly 80,000 men were singled out and subjected to NSEERS because they largely came from countries that shared a religion with the 9/11 hijackers. The message to ordinary Americans was clear: Muslims were either terrorists or terror sympathizers.                 While he was evasive about the details, Trump often spoke of establishing what amounted to a Muslim registry. But Trump’s virulent Islamophobia was never unique.                 I know people who were harassed and questioned by agents of the FBI. Right-wing media stoked Americans’ fears, while the NYPD racially targeted Muslims as part of their “Muslim Surveillance Program.” The program was the target of several lawsuits, which settled without the NYPD’s admission of wrongdoing; then-mayor Michael Bloomberg’s failure to apologize for the program cast a shadow over his 2020 presidential run.                 In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the West and the United States committed what essayist Pankaj Mishra has termed “intellectual suicide.” The much-touted Enlightenment values of tolerance, cosmopolitanism and a public sphere open to all were rejected with a resounding thud.      Related articleADL head: On NY Islamic center, we were wrong, plain and simple               The American military’s occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan only worsened the problem. The US’s handling of those conflicts made it even easier for everyday Americans to point fingers at American Muslims as the enemy within. Popular culture has helped to harden these fears. The apprehension of Islamic terrorists in shows like “24” and “Quantico” and movies like “Zero Dark Thirty” further engrossed Americans in an armchair version of the War on Terror.                  Twenty years after 9/11, many American Muslims are still forced to live an apologetic existence, one where being pulled off planes for simply “traveling while Muslim” and speaking Arabic has remained all too common. Despite the defeat of Trump and the installation of a Democratic administration in the White House that is avowedly committed to civil rights, Islamophobia still undergirds what defines a terrorist act.                  That’s largely because the provision of the Patriot Act (enacted after the 9/11 attacks and intended to shore up US national security and itself a product of pervasive anti-Muslim fear) that criminalizes support for terrorist organizations cannot be applied domestically without running afoul of the First Amendment and other complications involved in labeling domestic groups as terrorist organizations. What counts as “terrorism” legally is primarily limited to foreign threats. As such, White supremacists and other domestic radicals and terrorists, while noted by the FBI and others as a far greater threat than foreign terrorist elements, too often evade scrutiny and are not labeled or charged as terrorists. Not only does this make our country less safe, but it also helps – in tandem with cultural representations like the ones above – to perpetuate stereotypes about Muslims as terrorists.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             Muslim Americans, meanwhile, still have little recourse in a political environment where they are regarded by many as perpetual foreigners, even as White extremists radicalize in greater numbers, flexing themselves in moments like the insurrection at the US Capitol. All Americans should know this and be ashamed of this.                  Over 250 years may have passed since Benjamin Franklin’s racist sarcasm, but too many American Muslims who have known no country other than the United States still face pressure to “renounce thy Faith” to be considered truly American. Reckoning with post-9/11 Islamophobia alone won’t address that history – and unless we do that, the future for American Muslims remains uncertain.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Because I am Muslim,” she said.                 In early July, the 32-year-old pilot and proud feminist was among more than 80 Muslim women – journalists, writers and influencers – whose photos were posted on a mock app called Sulli Deals, a derogatory term for Muslim women typically used by right-wing Hindu men.                   Users were offered a chance to “buy” the women like commodities in an auction – and while the women weren’t actually for sale, they say it left them scared, traumatized and angry.     I don’t use my surname in Uber and Ola. I have a religion neutral first name.Am I hiding my Muslim identity?Yes…you bet I am.             Two months later, the site has been taken down by US-based platform GitHub, but the women are still angry none its creators have been detained or arrested. They say the lack of action highlights the discrimination Muslim women face in Hindu-dominated India, where outspoken advocates of women’s rights are singled out for attack on social media.                 They say they won’t be silenced.                 Khan’s complaint is one of at least four filed with Indian police by victims, opposition lawmakers and activists. Praveen Duggal, a senior official for Delhi police, confirmed India’s cyber cell unit is investigating the complaints, but said he could not share any further details because it was a “sealed matter.”                 India has laws targeting cyber crime, but it doesn’t have a specific legislation against cyber bullying, despite a surge in abuse directed at Indian women.                  Khan and other feminist activists say they are being targeted by men hiding behind handles on social media, who are attempting to intimidate them – and Indian authorities aren’t doing enough to stop it.                  Besides their religion, one thing the women share is their strong view on gender rights in India.                 By most global measures, the country performs poorly on gender equality. Fewer than a quarter of Indian women are in the labor market, and even then they earn about 20% of a man’s wage, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap 2021 report.                  Violence against women remains a problem, with more than one in four women abused or controlled by her partner during her lifetime, the report added.      “Men are threatened by women who are assertive in our country.”Hana Mohsin KhanPilot             No explicit threats of violence were made against the women on the Sulli Deals app, but they say the publication of their Twitter handles with photos copied from their social media accounts was an invitation for abuse.                 Khan has 15,000 followers on Twitter and regularly receives hateful comments – primarily from men. She said the volume increased after her photo appeared on the app.                   “Men are threatened by women who are assertive in our country,” she said. “And vocal, outspoken Muslim women are the biggest level of threat in their eyes.”                 Of India’s 580 million women, approximately 6.5% are Muslim, according to the most recent government census conducted in 2011.                 After the “auction” photos went viral on social media, 21 of the women joined a WhatsApp group one of them created for mutual support, including poet Nabiya Khan.                 Nabiya Khan regularly posts her prose to Twitter to amplify the voices of marginalized people in India, which she believes caught the attention of the Sulli Deals trolls.                 “Men think sexual violence is a valid punishment (for being an outspoken woman),” said Nabiya Khan, who is no relation to Hana Mohsin Khan.     When i say Muslims, i am speaking for myself here. We might be tired but we will never give up.             She has also lodged a complaint with police but says she hasn’t heard anything.                 “I was expecting that my complaint would be met with dignity but seeing that no step has been taken in the direction of justice, it just makes me angry,” she said.                  The women say the online abuse is indicative of the mood towards Muslims in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014.                 In recent years, reports of anti-Muslim hate crimes have increased and several BJP-ruled states have passed legislation that critics say has contributed to a rise in religious polarization.              For example, in 2019, India’s parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims.                 Anti-Muslim bias is also present in the police force, according to a survey of about 12,000 police officers. The 2019 Status of Policing in India report found about half of the Indian police surveyed thought Muslims were “naturally prone” towards committing crime.                 Zakia Soman, a social activist and founder of the Indian Muslim Women’s Movement, said prejudice was also apparent online, where attacks against Muslim women had escalated in recent years.                  “You have paid bots on social media who target women, journalists or anyone who is dissenting in this country,” Soman said.     “If it is women from another community, it becomes bestial. You are talking about auctioning women like cattle.”Zakia SomanIndian Muslim Women’s Movement             “These conservative and radical (people) are obsessed with women’s sexuality. And if it is women from another community, it becomes bestial. You are talking about auctioning women like cattle. It shows a medieval mindset.”                 Cyber abuse is a major problem in India, particularly against women.                 According to a 2019 report from Amnesty International, Indian female politicians receive nearly twice as much abuse online compared to their counterparts in the US and the United Kingdom.                  The report examined the 7.1 million tweets that mentioned female politicians and found that nearly 1 million posts were abusive or problematic and included hateful and sexist abuse.                 In India, many cases also go unreported, according to cyber law expert Karnika Seth.                  “(After the victim) is pursued, they want closure. In many of these cases, the families and the victim want to wrap up the case, especially in cases of cyber stalking,” she said.

How Twitter became so toxic for India's women politicians             During an August 8 parliament session, India’s Minister of Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw said the internet’s rapid growth had caused a “rise in cyber crime across the world.”                  However, India doesn’t have a uniform law against cyber bullying and the number of cases of registered with police in India is low.                 Just seven cases of cyber bullying against women and children were registered in the country in 2017. That rose to 40 in 2018 and 45 in 2019, according to the National Crimes Record Bureau. It is unclear how many went to court, and if any convictions were made.                 Activists say the Indian penal system is confusing and exhausting to navigate, so many victims don’t bother to file a complaint. If they do, lawyers have to submit electronic evidence pulled from the accused’s device, which is difficult – if not impossible – to obtain, Seth said.                 And if a complaint does make it to court, it can also take years for a verdict.                 “There is such a huge backlog (for cyber crimes),” Seth said. “The police are not well equipped either.”                 It’s not the first time Muslim women have been targeted in fake online auctions.                  In May, an Indian YouTube account called “Liberal Doge” uploaded a video similar to the app, which appeared to “auction” Muslim Pakistani women, posting photographs without their consent, according to local media reports.                 The account has since been deleted by YouTube for violating its “strict policies” that prohibit hate speech, including content promoting violence or hatred based on gender and religion, a YouTube spokesperson told CNN.                 According to YouTube, three similar accounts were also removed. It is unclear if they were run by the same person. CNN was not able to independently verify the content of the channels.

On July 30, Priyanka Chaturvedi, a politician for the opposing Shiv Sena party, wrote to IT Minister Vaishnaw urging him to take action against Sulli Deals and Liberal Doge.                  In her letter, which she posted to Twitter, Chaturvedi pointed out that the “lack of stringent and efficient preventative laws and punishments” is a motivating factor for such crimes to continue in the future.                  “In a country where women are struggling with gender bias, these incidents yet again lay bare the protection and safety of women, especially in cyberspace,” the letter said. “It pains me to see that hardly any movement with regards to this case has been taken as of now despite the seriousness of it.”                 CNN contacted Vaishnaw’s office for comment but did not receive a response.       “Muslim women will not be suppressed into silence.”Nabiya KhanPoet             Hana Mohsin Khan and Nabiya Khan say the lack of action by authorities highlights the lack of available support in India for victims of online abuse.

And it is in this spirit that I have been reflecting on a stance ADL took 11 years ago when we opposed the location of the then-proposed Park51 Islamic Community Center & Mosque near Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan. Originally known as Cordoba House, and modeled after institutions such as the JCC in Manhattan, now known as the Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan, and the 92nd Street Y, the project planned to include community and cultural spaces with the goal of fostering interfaith dialogue and promoting peace and understanding. I believe the stance we took is one for which we owe the Muslim community an apology.                  Further, amidst ADL’s reflection, and approaching the 20th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, our nation’s sudden and disastrously planned withdrawal from Afghanistan is heartbreaking. For me personally, and ADL as a whole, this catastrophe made our Teshuvah all the more urgent.                  Today one can see how the Cordoba House could have helped to heal our country as we nursed the wounds from the horror of 9/11. As we near the 20th anniversary of that tragic day, the need for healing remains. Arguably, it has attained an increased urgency after the tumult of recent years and especially now as we prepare to welcome refugees from Afghanistan, including many who supported our troops and our ideals, and now flee the onslaught of the Taliban. Sadly, rather than heal, we have seen Islamophobia persist in ugly ways.                   As the leading anti-hate organization in the US, with experts tracking extremism of all sorts, ADL is committed to help our Muslim allies counter Islamophobia. Indeed, we have been doing so for many decades. And this is exactly why, as a dear Muslim friend told me recently, ADL’s stance on the Cordoba House project was “a punch in the gut to the Muslim community.” I hope that by righting this wrong, we can be better allies in the fight against the rise in anti-Muslim hate that is coming – and it is coming.     Related articleWe must keep our promises for the little girl huddled in a refugee camp. That girl was me             I say this, because as most Americans were praying for the Afghan people, generously donating funds and preparing to welcome some number of Afghan civilians into our great nation, some so-called “experts” began spreading alarmist and Islamophobic disinformation in shameless attempts to block these brutalized civilians from coming to the United States. Adding to the alarm, these insidious conspiracy theories are coming during a time that the FBI is reporting the highest level of hate crimes in over a decade.                  And that is likely just the opening chorus of anti-Muslim sentiment that I fear will swell in the weeks, months and years ahead.                  We’ve seen it before.                  We saw it in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The FBI tracked a massive spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2001, compared to 2000:  a jump from 28 incidents to 481. Muslims were profiled, attacked and killed, mosques were desecrated, slander flowed in the media and even members of the Sikh community were attacked simply because they wore turbans.                  And we saw it again in 2010, when a media storm rose up around Cordoba House. While the country was in many ways less polarized in 2010 than in our present moment, it was still a fraught time. A time when you could almost see the lines that divide us today being drawn.                  When Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf and Daisy Khan envisioned the creation of Cordoba House, they intended to foster better relations between the Islamic world and America, and to serve as a public rejection of extremism.      Related articleTrump adviser Stephen Miller warned of 'Iraqs and 'Stans' in the US while slow-walking the entry of Afghan allies             Sadly, it was portrayed very differently. Some polemicists immediately pounced. The media dubbed it the “Ground Zero Mosque,” an unfair name that instantly cast the project in a negative light. Mayor Michael Bloomberg argued for it. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich railed against it. The impassioned families of victims could be heard on both sides of the debate. Other public figures piled on, virtually climbing over each other to be heard. The tension reached a boiling point as local community boards repeatedly voted in favor of the project amidst continued protests and counter protests.                  Then ADL weighed in. Although before my tenure, I know that ADL struggled with the decision, trying to balance a genuine desire to support a noble endeavor but also to support the victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist attack who voiced opposition. And so, ADL decided not to oppose the project outright,  but instead tried to take a nuanced position, advocating for a location change that the organization felt would help lead to the type of reconciliation the project itself was meant to represent.                   There are likely other ways ADL’s voice could have improved rather than impaired the conversation.  For instance, as some of the organizers later reflected, more engagement early on with victims’ families could have gone a long way in achieving the ultimate goal of fostering reconciliation and peace. Daisy Kahn once explained how the goal of Cordoba House was to “repair the breach and be at the front and center to start the healing.” Perhaps ADL should have helped facilitate such a discussion.                  And yet, we chose to weigh in differently. And through deep reflection and conversation with many friends within the Muslim community, the real lesson is a simple one: we were wrong, plain and simple.                  Ultimately, the project as envisioned never came to be – with the development primarily becoming another familiar condominium tower.                   We can’t change the past. But we accept responsibility for our unwise stance on Cordoba House, apologize without caveat and commit to doing our utmost going forward to use our expertise to fight anti-Muslim bias as allies.      Related articleThe leader of the anti-Taliban resistance speaks out             As we see the signs of another surge in anti-Muslim hate, it is imperative that the collective we – civil society, the business community, elected officials and the American citizenry writ large – embrace the idea and intent of Cordoba House and work together to foster peace.                  We have seen Muslims demonized in recent years in ways that make the heart ache – from the early talk of a “Muslim registry” in days after the 2016 election to the travel ban imposed the following year on Muslim-majority countries to the unfounded conspiratorial claims of Muslims invading the US that still show up in the rantings of some prime-time cable news personalities. This is in addition to the all-too frequent use of slander and stereotypes of Islam on social media platforms. ADL’s most recent survey of online hate and harassment found that Muslim respondents regularly experience identity-based harassment. This kind of ugliness seems to be on a permanent loop.                 It’s clear that some of the wild charges lodged against Cordoba House – that it was organized by “radical Islamists” and “terrorist sympathizers”  – were part of this pattern. And we must not allow this pattern to continue, especially as Afghans seek refuge in the promise of America.                 This must start with the Biden administration stepping up to ensure Afghan refugees do not face burdensome roadblocks or are unjustly denied entry to our nation. This is why over 300 organizations, including ADL, signed a recent letter to President Joe Biden expressing “our support for a robust humanitarian response from the United States and our commitment to assist Afghans in danger” while also imploring the administration to “expand opportunities for Afghans to seek refuge.”      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             But the work doesn’t stop there. It is on all of us to fight back against the Islamophobic attempts to prevent refugees from gaining asylum. Again, we already see the disturbing “invasion” claim being thrown around again in direct reference to Afghan refugees. Some have tried to rationalize their hate by invoking the White supremacist “Great Replacement” theory. All of it is wrong.                  We are better than this. We actively can choose not only to reject hate, but to embrace those in need. ADL’s stance on Cordoba House was an error that pales alongside the abrupt abandonment of our Afghan allies, but all of us should draw upon our better angels and welcome those poor and huddled masses who today seek our support.

Thoughts and prayers. Promises of “never again.” They are not enough. Seven years after ISIS committed genocide against the Yazidi community, my ethno-religious minority, in Iraq, hundreds of thousands of people remain internally displaced and more than 2,800 women and children remain missing. Shelter, clean water, health care and education are luxuries, if available at all.                 Those of us who were there – who ran for our lives to the protection of Mount Sinjar, who heard the gunshots as men and older women were shot and dumped into mass graves, and who, like me, were sold into sexual slavery – cannot forget what happened or how the world ignored our cries for help.                  After escaping from my ISIS captors, I lived in a camp alongside hundreds of Yazidis. I felt the raw humiliation of residing in makeshift tents without privacy, work, or education. I saw these conditions erode our traditions, our way of life, and our communal ties. During that time, I imagined my life swallowed up by a statistic – becoming one of the millions of displaced people who live, on average, 10-20 years in a camp.     Related articleISIS Fast Facts             Today, much of my family still lives in that same cramped caravan. My niece has never known life outside the camp. When I visit family, the space between us is emptied by an overwhelming silence. We do not need to utter a single sound to communicate our shared sorrow. I can see the pain clearly in their eyes.                  The questions that nag at me day in and day out are: Why will the world not act? What do the Iraqi government and international community hope to gain from ignoring our homeland’s redevelopment, deprioritizing accountability and relegating Yazidis to life in displacement?                 Seven years later, the Yazidi community’s struggle for survival is still largely ignored. There have been no multilateral search and rescue efforts for the missing women and children. Around 80 mass graves lie unexhumed around Sinjar, the Yazidi homeland where ISIS carried out its genocide. Neither Iraqi national nor international courts have established proceedings to try ISIS criminals for genocide and sexual violence.     Related articleUN report warns ISIS is reasserting under new leader believed to be behind Yazidi genocide              Regardless of the rationale, the results are clear. ISIS has come one step closer to accomplishing its goal of preventing Yazidis from living in our homeland with dignity. Seeing this, other terrorist groups and oppressive regimes can only be encouraged to commit genocide and sexual violence, knowing that they will not be held accountable.                  Governments and international institutions take the easy way out time and time again. They formulate promises and claim to resolve territorial disputes. For instance, under the Sinjar Agreement, concluded in October, Iraq’s federal government and Kurdish regional authorities agreed to stabilize local governance and security. But they don’t follow through with steps as easy as appointing a local mayor.                 The United Nations collects evidence of the atrocities through its Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da’esh/ISIS (UNITAD), formed in 2018. But the UN stops short of referring the case to the International Criminal Court or establishing a court by treaty for prosecuting ISIS’ crimes against humanity. It funds short-term aid to displacement camps instead of investing in sustainably rebuilding Sinjar.

The Sinjar Agreement and UNITAD’s evidence collection would make significant differences in the daily lives of Yazidis if they were acted upon – if those in power cared enough to extend a helping hand.                 With every shortcut taken by national and international authorities, the road to recovery for my community becomes longer and more dangerous. Is seven years not long enough? There are no shortcuts available to Yazidis – no way to truncate our trauma. But still, we have not given up.                  We do not want your pity. We want the international community to take responsibility for protecting the basic rights of Yazidis by investing in Sinjar’s redevelopment and holding ISIS accountable.

A significant part of the current political and racial divides in the United States has been fueled by reports that America will become a majority-minority country within our lifetimes. Conspiratorial and racist so-called “replacement” theories have inspired White nationalists in American society, ranging from those bearing tiki torches in Charlottesville to Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the rioters at the US Capitol on January 6.                   In this context, the preliminary data from the new US Census – which reveals a declining White population – exposes ways in which America’s changing demographic landscape is stoking paranoia regarding the loss of White power, even as it also fuels ambitious hopes for the future of multiracial democracy.                   Headlines that tout a White population in decline further provoke existing fear, anxiety and anti-immigrant loathing. But at the same time, more Americans than ever are self-defining as multiracial, making headlines about the loss of White identity less of the proper focus than one about a 21st century multiracial democracy.

This map shows America’s changing landscape             Families like the one President Barack Obama grew up in, as the son of a Black Kenyan father and a White mother with Kansas roots whose sister was half Indonesian and whose maternal grandparents helped forge his identity, are not outliers; they are a growing branch on the national family tree. Framing this new Census data as the first decrease in the White population since 1790, as the Washington Post did, helps to fan the flames of racial and partisan rifts. Hispanic and Asian American young people driving national population growth augurs a future powered by citizens who reflect the diversity that is at the heart of our national story.                   Journalists report on facts, so it’s understandable that they would identify a large drop in the White population, reflected in data, as significant. Objectively speaking, it is.       Related articleThe Census shows the GOP base is shrinking fast. So why does its power seem secure?             Yet the trap of seeing the drop in White population as the only, or even the main, story of the Census data reinforces our own insistence on seeing these transformations through a cynical lens. Pitting White America against hordes of threatening “colored” people is part of a long, complex, and fraught history – one wherein changing definitions of “Whiteness” both expanded and restricted the boundaries of citizenship.                    This fear-driven narrative also has tremendous policy and historical implications. Republican-controlled state legislatures have used Census data in gerrymandering efforts to target Black voters and other voters of color. Their tactics have turned voter suppression from a blunt art into an exacting science that defies the spirit and intent of both the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.                   Narratives of White decline linked specifically to the Census arrived in the 21st century, shortly before America elected Obama, the nation’s first Black President. The reports helped to fuel White racial anxiety about maintaining racial, economic and cultural privileges that have become synonymous for many with American identity.                   The Obama presidency ignited a free for all in American politics that continues to this day. The rise of the Tea Party, Birther Movement, Donald Trump’s presidency and his “Make America Great Again” ethos all share deep-seated racial fears that have haunted the nation since its founding.       Related articleHistory shows we ignore Tucker Carlson at our peril             Over the past two decades, some Republicans have used forecast demographic changes related to the Census for partisan political advantage, helping to sustain and grow a whole ecosystem trafficking in racially intolerant appeals that have remade American politics. The rise of a right-wing public sphere we are now seeing – untethered to science, objective facts and past support for voting rights and racial justice – depends on a narrative that presents democracy as a zero-sum game, with historic White winners on the verge of being replaced by citizens and immigrants of color.      Concern over plunging White birthrates, both nationally and globally, center “replacement theory” conspiracies theories that view demographic shifts as fundamentally reordering power relations in a way that will lead to the end of Whiteness. Such nativistic fears traffic in racism against non-White groups and sexism by seeking to impose patriarchal control over women’s reproductive futures. And in the Age of Trump, racist narrative tropes about the nation’s future became more mainstream, trumpeted by right-wing media stars as an existential threat to White Americans.                  We have been here before. In the early 20th century, White nativists spread misinformation and racist conspiracy theories warning that the onslaught of immigrants and the threat of race-mixing would spell the end of what they proudly considered a White man’s republic. Anti-immigrant legislation, specifically 1924’s Johnson-Reed Act, instituted a quota system that made it virtually impossible for immigrants of color to enter the United States until the passage of 1965’s Hart-Celler Act, one of the cornerstones of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.      Related articleUS history holds a chilling warning about restricting votes             Toxic narratives of White decline are baked into this country’s history of institutional discrimination in ways that go back to the 19th century – and beyond anti-Black racism – as well. White nativism, buttressed by eugenics theories of scientific racism that classified non-White and non-Nordic races as inferior, discriminated against Irish, Italians and others during the 19th century. As the category of ethnic “Whiteness” shifted to include these previously marginalized European groups, however, the xenophobia and nativism never waned.                   The end of the Civil War and Black people’s hopes to compete in a free labor market against native-born and immigrant alike triggered further massive White anxiety, violence and racist policies that led directly to the Jim Crow system of legalized racial oppression that still impacts our democracy today.                  Today, contemporary right-wing media narratives frame America’s growing non-White population as a problem to be solved through gerrymandering, xenophobia and anti-democratic legislation that ensures White supremacy thrives for generations.                  And yet, America’s changing demographics tell a different, more inspiring story. Rather than a narrative of White decline, what if we saw in this data the increasing numbers of racially blended families and mixed-race children – and understood them as signs of a more racially diverse, economically just and culturally rich future?

If you’ve had your Covid shots, you may agree with Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama, who said recently: “Folks supposed to have common sense, but it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It’s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.”                 And it’s not just the masses who are letting us down but people close to us: our coworkers, friends, family members. You may be furious at what you see as the selfishness and ignorance and lack of civic responsibility in the people in your life who refuse to get the jab.                 And you’re not alone – social media is rife with posts that attempt to convince people to get vaccinated by explaining how wrongheaded they are. It’s human nature. You might be doing the same kind of browbeating yourself.                 But here’s a question: How’s that strategy working for you? After you lay into the anti-vaxxers and the vaccine-hesitant, are they thanking you for setting them straight and rushing to make appointments?                 Our guess is, that’s not what’s happening.                 Instead, those conversations get heated, things get said that can’t be unsaid and you both leave feeling angry, frustrated and resentful. In the moment, it can feel good to indulge our emotions and let them have it. But the cost is high: We damage the relationship and they don’t get vaccinated. Even when we present them with clear, seemingly convincing facts.                 There’s a well-documented phenomenon in psychology called the “backfire effect.” Giving people facts disproving their incorrect beliefs can actually reinforce those beliefs. Researchers have observed this phenomenon in the context of political misconceptions, voting preferences, the decision to vaccinate one’s children and whether to get a flu vaccine oneself. The more people are confronted with facts at odds with their opinions, the stronger they cling to those opinions.                 And if arguing with facts backfires, you know what backfires even more? Criticizing, blaming and shaming them for being thoughtless, selfish, stupid, ignorant or psychopathic. You can check this yourself: When was the last time you changed your behavior in response to someone blaming or shaming you?                 We want to say that we feel your pain. We’re both vaccinated. We’re disappointed that the Delta variant, combined with widespread vaccine hesitancy, is prolonging the pandemic and necessitating continued mask mandates and lockdowns to control its spread. And we’re mortified at the resulting unnecessary suffering and loss of life. We’re angry too.                 Like Gov. Ivey, we also feel the urge to convince them to change by giving them the facts, arguing with them and criticizing and shaming them for their selfish disregard for others.                 The truth is, we care deeply about the issue. And we also care deeply about our relationships. When the two collide, it feels like we have to choose. Do I risk getting a breakthrough infection by spending time in a confined space with my unvaccinated family member, or do I risk the relationship by refusing to be in her presence, or demand that she wear a mask, or try to convince her to do the right thing?                 How do we balance risk and relationship?                 We’d like to share a process that reduces risk through relationship. While it isn’t guaranteed to get the unvaccinated people in your life to drop everything and make an appointment for the shot, we think it will significantly increase your odds of success.     Related articleThe new seriousness of Amsterdam             Our approach hinges on your willingness to give up control; to acknowledge that the person you’re trying to change has autonomy and will make their own decision. Of course, what you’re giving up isn’t control; it’s the illusion of control. The person you’re talking to is always free to get vaccinated – or not. You don’t get to choose for them. That’s why you’re trying so hard to convince them.                 So when we can’t persuade with facts or criticism, what can we lead with instead?                 Two things: empathy and curiosity.                 When we demonstrate empathy, we show the other person that we believe they have valid needs and concerns. Even if we disagree with their position, we acknowledge that it makes sense to them.                 How do you show empathy to someone who doesn’t want to get the vaccine? Let’s make this real: Think about someone you want to convince. First, be OK with your own feelings. Are you furious at them? Disappointed? Terrified? Do you look down upon them?                 Feel those feelings, own them, and don’t beat yourself up for having them. Instead, have empathy for yourself. Your motivations are good. You want to reduce suffering, save lives and allow people to congregate freely again without fear of infection. You care deeply, and because of that you feel strongly about the topic.                 But now don’t act on those emotions either. Instead, extend your empathy to the other person. What do they care deeply about? Here’s what we’ve heard from the vaccine hesitant people in our lives:                 “I don’t want to put unknown chemicals in my body.”                 “I don’t trust pharmaceutical companies.”                 “I don’t want to be told what to do about my body.”                 “These vaccines have been rushed through without enough research, and they aren’t even fully approved by the FDA.”                 “My chances of getting harmed by the vaccine are much higher than my risk of dying of Covid.”                 I know you can argue with these statements. You might be doing it in your head right now. But can you empathize with them as well?                 Does it make sense that someone would want to avoid putting unknown chemicals in their body? Is it reasonable not to fully trust the pharmaceutical industry? It doesn’t take a lot of Googling to find lawsuits and settlements of billions of dollars involving harms, false claims and withheld information by drug companies. Isn’t it true that we have only short-term data on the effects and side effects of the vaccines, if only because the trials began less than two years ago?     Related articleIt's time to turn up pressure on unvaccinated             In practice, empathy is about validating the other person’s perspective without agreeing or disagreeing with them. It’s making true statements that show the other person that you understand them to their satisfaction. For example:                 “It sounds like you’re fearful of the possible side effects of the vaccine. And that makes sense.”                 “It seems like you don’t trust the pharmaceutical companies that are producing the vaccines. I understand that”                 “You’re worried that we don’t have long-term data on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines. I get that.”                 And then, encourage them to talk. That’s where curiosity comes in. Ask questions, not to trap them in logical inconsistencies, but because you are truly curious about their answers. How do they compare the relative risks of vaccines and Covid? What data are they looking at? What makes them doubt the safety of the vaccine? What have they seen and heard?                 Once they feel like you care about their opinion so you can learn from it – and them – rather than demolish it – or them – you’re in a real conversation. Now you can get to the important questions: What do they want? For themselves, for their loved ones, for their country, for the world? Chances are, this is where you can find common ground.                  We all want people to be well, to be free from harm, to be free from coercion. We all want the economy to flourish – even though we may have very different visions of what that entails. We all want to be respected.

And this virus is sort of pitting those values against each other, and I’m coming down more strongly on the side of health, and you appear to value freedom more. But I hear your concerns about your health as well. And actually, I’m in favor of vaccination because I think it will give us all more freedom.”                 That was the approach we used with one of our vaccine hesitant friends. After a conversation full of respectful questions and discussion, she told us, “You know, I think I’m going to get the vaccine.” Instead of trying to change her, we created an environment in which she felt safe enough to change on her own.                 We’re not guaranteeing that outcome. We don’t know how your conversations will go. But when you don’t have actual power over someone, it’s only through a caring and respectful relationship that you can influence them to change. If you want a loved one to get vaccinated, approach them with empathy and curiosity, to communicate your caring and respect. It’s your best shot at helping them get theirs.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.             Earlier this month, the Biden administration reaffirmed the United States’ recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara, a disputed region on the northwest coast of Africa. The United Nations calls Western Sahara a “non-self-governing territory”; I call it home. My home is under occupation and my people, the Sahrawis, are under attack, and the US position on Western Sahara legitimizes this occupation and will be used as license for further attacks. I know this because I have lived it.                  As an outspoken advocate for self-determination in Western Sahara, I have long been a target for the occupying Moroccan government. I have been beaten, tortured, and abducted by Moroccan police while engaged in peaceful protests; after a particularly violent assault in 2007, I lost my right eye.              Because I refuse to be silenced, Morocco stepped up its efforts against me late last year. On November 19, while driving to my home in Boujdour, I was stopped at a police and military checkpoint. The authorities forced me into a police car and took me to a nearby police station, where I was interrogated, sexually assaulted, and told to go home and not to speak to anyone. I arrived home soon thereafter to find it surrounded by 21 police vehicles and numerous officers, who physically pushed me into the house. I have been forcibly confined to the house ever since.      Related articleTrump deal with Morocco is yet another headache for Biden team             My de facto house arrest, which is now in its ninth month, has absolutely no legal basis – I have never been shown a court order authorizing my detention or informed of any criminal charges against me.                  The Moroccan government has told Amnesty International that I’m not under house arrest and denied a statement by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights Defenders that included details of the assaults, saying that the rapporteur’s statement “interferes with the ongoing debates in the framework of the 47th Session of the Human Rights Council” and “do not fit at all with the framework of dialogue and mutual respect” it expected at the UN. Meanwhile, the occupying Moroccan forces appear determined to not just detain me unlawfully, but to harass, torture, and perhaps even kill me.                  Moroccan police, military, and other security agents maintain a constant presence outside the house and prevent anyone from leaving or coming in, even to bring food. They cut the electricity in mid-April. Police throw a toxic, foul-smelling liquid into the house on a near-daily basis, making it difficult to breathe. They frequently (and explicitly) threaten to kill me.                  Moroccan authorities have also repeatedly raided the home and brutally assaulted me, my sister, my brother, and my mother. In May, during one such raid, Moroccan agents raped my sister and I – in a barbaric message, they penetrated my sister using the broomstick that we use to wave the Western Sahara flag. Despite all this, I continue to wave the Western Sahara flag from my rooftop every day – an act of resistance that may end up costing me my life.      Related articleWestern Sahara independence leader declares the end of a 29-year-old ceasefire with Morocco             Unfortunately, my story is just one of many. Morocco’s repression of the Sahrawi people, and Sahrawi human rights defenders in particular, is well documented. The Sahrawis have struggled under Moroccan occupation since 1975, and this repression will continue until the occupation is ended. And while the United Nations Security Council supports giving the people of Western Sahara the chance to determine their own future through a referendum, Morocco has refused to allow the referendum to take place, depriving us of the chance to exercise our right to self-determination.                  My situation is desperate. On Wednesday, my international legal team submitted my case to the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, urging it to find I am being detained illegally and to demand my immediate release. However, in order to secure justice for me and the Sahrawi people, I also need help from the US.                  First, the Biden administration should immediately acknowledge Morocco’s occupation for what it is – an occupation – and stop recognizing Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. This recognition – originally announced by President Donald Trump via tweet in December 2020 – runs contrary to decades of established US policy on Western Sahara.                  When President Biden took over, we who are fighting for self-determination hoped that he might fix this. However, as recently as July 1, the State Department reiterated that there is no change in the administration’s policy. The Biden administration has claimed that human rights are central to its foreign policy – this is difficult to believe while it sides with Morocco in its occupation of Western Sahara and its repression of the Sahrawi people.                  Second, as part of its reengagement with the United Nations Human Rights Council, the US should press forcefully for a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. The U.N. General Assembly reaffirmed the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara as far back as 1966, when it was still referred to as “Spanish Sahara,” and the U.N. Security Council unanimously established a mission to coordinate a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara in 1991.             The US, for its part, has consistently voted in favor of Security Council resolutions seeking a referendum on self-determination. Since President Biden has advocated for a return to a rule-based international order, the US should take the lead to ensure that the long-promised referendum is finally held and the results are honored.                  And third, the U.S. should make the protection of human rights in occupied Western Sahara and self-determination for the Sahrawi people key issues in its bilateral relationship with Morocco. For example, the readout from a recent call between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita shows that while Blinken encouraged Morocco to reaffirm its commitment to human rights, the readout omitted any mention of Western Sahara or the right of its people to self-determination.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             For any productive change to occur, Morocco needs to know that its powerful allies care about both.                  I cannot find the words to describe the endless suffering that I personally, and the Sahrawi people more generally, have endured under this violent occupation. But we remain strong, our will unshaken, and we will persevere with our peaceful resistance.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Durrni allegedly pulled on the woman’s hijab, told her to take it off, and then punched her in the arm. When she didn’t remove the hijab, Durrni allegedly punched the man in the back.                 An hour after that attack, Durrni allegedly followed a 64-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman in Queens and made anti-Muslim slurs before punching the woman in the face and head several times, according to the NYPD.

And on July 25, Durrni allegedly bumped a 38-year-old woman wearing clothes traditionally worn by Muslim women into the street and yelled anti-Muslim slurs. Durrni allegedly pulled out a knife when the woman tried to call 911 on her cell phone.                 If convicted, Durrni could be sentenced to up to eight years in prison.

CAIR, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, typically publishes an annual report tracking hate crimes and bias incidents. The organization decided to release a mid-year “snapshot report” because of a spike in May and June, Robert McCaw, CAIR’s government affairs director, told CNN.                 The report, published Wednesday, highlights 38 of the hundreds of anti-Muslim bias incidents documented by the organization this year, CAIR said in a news release. The incidents include hate crimes, harassment, school bullying, discrimination and hate speech.                 The report is based on incidents directly reported to CAIR’s national office and chapters across the United States, as well as the media.     Related articleA NYC mosque was vandalized with anti-Palestinian graffiti             “This report serves as a reminder of the severe nature of Islamophobia and what needs to be done to combat it in the United States and around the world,” Huzaifa Shahbaz, CAIR’s national research and advocacy coordinator, told CNN.                  CAIR documented a spike in anti-Muslim incidents in May and June, including four at mosques in May alone. Those cases involved vandalism, harassment towards women who wear hijab or headscarf and an attempted stabbing, Shahbaz said.                 The spike coincided with renewed violence in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians.                 Between May 10 and 20, Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire killed at least 248 people in Gaza, including 66 children, according to the health ministry there. Twelve people in Israel, including two children, died as a result of Palestinian militant fire from Gaza, according to the Israel Defense Forces and Israel’s emergency service.                  Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire that began on May 21, but it has been fraught with tension and violence.                 Anti-Semitic incidents also increased across the United States during the same time, Jewish groups reported. CAIR has condemned those incidents.                 Although the report primarily focused on the US, it also included a section highlighting incidents in Canada, where CAIR said there has been a notable increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes.      Related articleA driver slams into a Muslim family, killing four people             Among them was the June 6 truck ramming attack that killed four members of a Muslim family in London, Ontario.

The report concluded with a series of recommendations “to reverse this disturbing trend” of increased anti-Muslim crimes and bias incidents. Among them is a call for President Joe Biden to condemn incidents when they occur, and aggressive federal prosecution when local law enforcement fails to act.                 “It’s time for our elected officials to speak up and out against anti-Muslim bias in the US, as well as the global phenomenon of Islamophobia that threats Muslims not only in the US but around the world,” McCaw said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

A report to the Security Council by the UN monitoring team charged with tracking worldwide jihadi threats, published Thursday, warns that these groups pose a growing threat in much of Africa. And both are entrenched in Afghanistan, from where al Qaeda plotted the 9/11 attacks.                  The UN report suggests a consistent pattern. Wherever pressure on jihadi terror groups is absent or negligible, they thrive. In Afghanistan, where the United States says it will complete its military withdrawal by August 31, the UN warns of a potential “further deterioration” in the security situation. In Somalia, the report says, US military withdrawal and the partial drawdown of the African Union Mission has left Somali special forces “struggling to contain” the al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab.                  In Mali, where France is winding down its counterterrorism mission, the report says that al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists have consolidated their influence and are “increasingly claiming populated areas.” In Mozambique, the report says, “the absence of significant counter-terrorist measures” have transformed the ISIS affiliate in central Africa into a “major threat.”     Related articleAl Qaeda promises 'war on all fronts' against America as Biden pulls out of Afghanistan             Jihadi terror attacks have declined in Europe and North America – but the UN experts expect this is temporary because terrorist violence has been “artificially suppressed by limitations in travelling, meeting, fundraising and identifying viable targets” during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, they believe the risk of online radicalization increased during the lockdowns.                  “One of the things that we highlight in the report that’s just come out is the possibility that the relaxation of lockdowns might mean that some pre-planned attacks can then take place,” Edmund Fitton-Brown, coordinator of the UN monitoring team told CNN.                 The report makes for sobering reading at a time when the United States and its allies – exhausted by the pandemic and keen to focus on economic recovery and standing up to China and Russia, have all but called an end to the 20-year ‘war on terror.’ As one leading analyst recently put it: “We might be done with jihadis, but they are not done with us.”                 The report warns that Africa is now “the region most affected by terrorism” – with al Qaeda and ISIS-aligned groups inflicting higher casualties there than anywhere else. In many areas, these groups are gaining support, threatening more territory, getting better weapons and raising more money.                 The UN monitors single out Somalia – which is beset by turmoil and getting less international military support than previously. They warn that Al-Shabaab may fill the vacuum as “strategic support” to Somali government forces declines. The threat the group poses further afield is underlined by a recent US indictment against an alleged Kenyan operative who “directed by senior Al-Shabaab leaders, obtained pilot training in the Philippines in preparation for seeking to hijack a commercial aircraft and crash it into a building in the United States.”                 Al-Shabaab is one of several terror affiliates to increase its use of drones for reconnaissance and has the ability to threaten low-flying aircraft in a region that depends on humanitarian flights to sustain vulnerable populations, the UN report says.                   Much of West Africa and the Sahel has in recent years been embroiled in jihadi violence. Last month Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari acknowledged the country was still grappling with a serious insurgency despite setbacks suffered by Boko Haram, whose leader Abubakar Shekau reportedly died during an attack by the regional ISIS affiliate (ISWAP) in May.                 The UN monitors say that while Boko Haram is “significantly weakened,” ISWAP may get stronger in the Lake Chad region and try to extend its operations towards the major Nigerian city of Maiduguri.     Related articleUN sounds warning over threat posed by emboldened Taliban, still closely tied to al Qaeda             The human toll of these insurgencies is stunning. In June, the United Nations Development Program estimated that Nigeria’s conflict with Islamist insurgencies through the end of 2020 had resulted in nearly 350,000 deaths, with 314,000 of those from indirect causes such as displacement and poverty.                 The UN monitors report that this year ISIS-affiliated terrorists have already killed hundreds of civilians in a series of attacks in Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger. And al Qaeda-affiliated groups in the Sahel are making a concerted push towards the Atlantic coastline – with Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, Benin, Ghana and Togo among countries at significant risk.                 On the other side of Africa, part of northern Mozambique is beyond government control. In March, the local ISIS affiliate briefly occupied the town of Palma – a critical hub in the country’s drive to develop its natural gas potential. The group collected between $1 million and $2 million from the looting of local banks, the UN report says, and is well positioned for future raids in the area.                 The threat from ISIS remains far from extinguished in Iraq and Syria, with the group bankrolled by estimated reserves of $25 million to $50 million. ISIS has “reasserted itself somewhat in Iraq” this year in the face of “constant counter-terrorism pressure,” the report says. Just this week, ISIS claimed a bombing in Baghdad which killed at least 30 people. The UN monitors say that according to member states, ISIS still has the “intent and capability to sustain a long-term insurgency in the Syrian desert” that borders Iraq.                  Elsewhere in Syria, the report states that “groups aligned with [al Qaeda] continue to dominate the Idlib area,” where terrorist fighters number more than 10,000. It says member states are concerned that jihadi fighters may relocate from that region to Afghanistan should the environment there become more hospitable.                  With the Taliban making rapid gains across Afghanistan, there is widespread concern the group will seize control of the country and allow it to once again become a platform for international terror. According to the UN report, al Qaeda is present in at least 15 Afghan provinces, and operates “under Taliban protection from Kandahar, Helmand and Nimruz Provinces.”      Related articleRockets land near Afghanistan's presidential palace during Eid prayers             In a CNN interview this week, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen said the group had made a commitment “not to allow any individual or group or entity to use … Afghanistan against the United States, its allies and other countries” and said terrorists will have “no place” in an Afghanistan under Taliban rule.                 But Fitton-Brown says the Taliban “have not broken their relationship with al Qaeda. They haven’t taken any steps against al Qaeda that they could not easily reverse and quickly reverse.”                  The Taliban’s offensive across Afghanistan “doesn’t give the international community much confidence that they are moving towards a real commitment to a stable negotiated and ultimately peaceful settlement in Afghanistan,” he says.                 There’s also concern that ISIS has a solid foothold in Afghanistan, with one member state reporting it currently has between 500 and 1,500 fighters. Despite being weakened in parts of eastern Afghanistan, the UN experts warn that ISIS’s regional affiliate “has moved into other provinces” and “strengthened its positions in and around Kabul, where it conducts most of its attacks.”                 As for the leadership of these terror groups, it’s a time of transition and uncertainty. The UN report notes that Amir Muhammad al-Mawla, who took over as leader of ISIS more than 18 months ago,  “remains reluctant to communicate directly with supporters.” It says ISIS’ “command and control over its provinces has loosened,” referring to its international affiliates.                 With al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri “assessed by Member States to be alive but unwell,” the UN report says it is uncertain where the group’s likely next leader would be based. Member States report that al Zawahiri’s “probable successor” is the veteran Egyptian terrorist Saif al Adel, who “is currently located in the Islamic Republic of Iran.”                   The UN monitors say that were he to get the top job, it’s unclear that Adel would go to Afghanistan. They add that “some Member States point to his history of living and operating in Africa and assess that he might choose to base himself there.”                 Two decades on from 9/11, the ability of al Qaeda and ISIS to threaten the West is currently lower than it has been. But the UN report shows that the danger posed by international jihadi groups has metastasized, and that they are entrenched in under-governed areas just as Western powers are preoccupied with other issues.                  “It’s important not to take our eye off counterterrorism and particularly important not to stop improving international counterterrorism cooperation,” says Fitton-Brown.                 Well over a generation ago, the international jihadi movement was energized by the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan. It is now celebrating the end of the United States’ military presence – and likely anticipating a new influx of recruits to propel the next generation of jihad – in Afghanistan and far beyond.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Ilhan Omar is leading a group of Democratic lawmakers in calling on Secretary of State Antony Blinken to create a special envoy to combat Islamophobia, as instances of anti-Muslim hate crimes continue to rise worldwide.","Jul 21, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Annie Grayer,International,"Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar is leading a group of Democratic lawmakers in calling on Secretary of State Antony Blinken to create a special envoy to combat Islamophobia, as instances of anti-Muslim hate crimes continue to rise worldwide.                 Omar, one of three Muslims serving in Congress, is sending a letter to Blinken to make the case for why the United States needs to play a heightened role in monitoring Islamophobic incidents around the world. The group also calls on Blinken to include state sponsored Islamophobic violence in next year’s annual human rights reports. The group is looking for Blinken to establish a special envoy that mirrors what the Department of State created to investigate and fight anti-Semitism.                  “As part of our commitment to international religious freedom and human rights, we must recognize Islamophobia as a pattern that is repeating in nearly every corner of the globe,” the lawmakers write in the letter. “It is past time for the United States to stand firmly in favor of religious freedom for all, and to give the global problem of Islamophobia the attention and prioritization it deserves.”                 Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, is co-leading the letter with Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and joined by 23 other Democrats including Reps. Karen Bass of California, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Adam Smith of Washington and Sara Jacobs of California.                  The group points to state actors and a rising number of individuals connected to larger White supremacist networks as perpetrators of Islamophobia. The letter to Blinken cites a 2021 annual report from the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) that found three countries, China, India and Burma, had “patterns of mistreatment and human rights violations against either their entire Muslim populations or particular sects of Muslims.”                 The request from lawmakers to Blinken comes just as the Council on American-Islamic Relations came out with a report that found an uptick in anti-Muslim hate crimes, particularly coinciding with the heightened conflict between Israel and Gaza in May. A source familiar with the letter sent to Blinken told CNN that the findings from CAIR’s report played a significant role in getting lawmakers to make this request now.                 Omar cited an uptick in “Anti-Muslim hate” as part of her reasoning calling for the position.                 “This year has seen over 500 incidents of hate in the U.S. — and those are just the ones that have been reported,” Omar said in a statement, and referenced a terror attack in Canada last month that killed four members of a Muslim family.                   “In countries around the world — from China to India to Myanmar — Muslim communities are being discriminated against,” the congresswoman added. “We must all stand united against this horrific rise in hate.”                 Omar’s push to establish a special envoy comes just a month after the Minnesota Democrat came under fire for tweeting, “We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban,” when describing her line of questioning to Secretary Blinken about having accountability in a hearing.                 A group of Jewish Democrats immediately jumped to criticize Omar’s comments, arguing that “equating the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban is as offensive as it is misguided.”                 Omar later clarified her comments as backlash emerged, stating that in her conversation with Blinken she asked about ongoing International Criminal Court investigations and “to be clear: the conversation was about accountability for specific incidents regarding those ICC cases, not a moral comparison between Hamas and the Taliban and the U.S. and Israel.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Children and women were among the dead and wounded, according to health and security officials. The attacker detonated his explosive vest in the Wahailat outdoor market in Sadr City, a predominantly Muslim Shia neighborhood in the east of Baghdad.                 Police officials said a number of shops and stores were also damaged in the blast.                  The market, like many other public places, had been packed with shoppers preparing to celebrate the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. Videos published on social media show women holding their babies and screaming as they flee the scene.       ISIS claimed responsibility hours after the blast happened, saying in a statement that it had been carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest. The terror group provided no evidence to support the claim.                   In a statement on Monday, the Iraqi military said the explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device (IED). However, two police officers said they have yet to determine the cause of the blast, as the investigation is still underway.                  Ali Yassin, a resident in Sadr City, said he has lost hope that Iraq will be a safe place for his four children to grow up.                  “Not a day goes by in Iraq without a tragic incident,” Yassin told CNN. “Why can’t we live like the rest of the countries? Why can’t we enjoy peace like the rest of the world?”                  “If I am financially capable, I would leave Iraq along with my family at once,” Yassin added.                  Top Iraqi government officials, including the Iraqi President and Iraqi Prime Minister, condemned the “terrorist attack” and vowed to bring perpetrators to justice.                  “We will not be calm unless we uproot the hateful and cowardly terrorism, and it is certain that the will of the Iraqis is beyond their criminality and villainy,” President Barham Salih said in a statement released by his office on Monday.                   Col. Wayne Marotto, the military spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, the global coalition to defeat what remains of the ISIS caliphate, offered its condolences for the victims’ families in a tweet on Monday.                 “This horrific attack right before Eid Al-Adha is a terrible reminder of the violence Iraqi children continue to face,” said Sheema Sen Gupta, the UNICEF Representative in Iraq, in a statement on Monday.                  “On the eve of Eid Al-Adha and as Iraqis mourn this sad moment, UNICEF calls for all actors in Iraq to work together towards a safer Iraq where children do not have to live in fear and where they enjoy their very basic activities and rights,” Gupta said.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The religious fault line between the two sides is only deepening, adding another explosive dimension to the volatile separation between red and blue America.                 Whites who identify as Christians composed a vastly larger share of the population in the counties Donald Trump won last fall than those captured by President Joe Biden, according to previously unpublished data provided to CNN by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute from a pathbreaking new study estimating religious affiliation at the county level.              What we’re seeing unfolding over the last four years, and coming into full flower now, the divides really are about American identity, much more than they are about a policy or even economics. Today we should probably replace ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ with ‘It’s American identity, stupid.’             Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO, Public Religion Research Institute                  While White Christians have fallen below a majority of the US population over the past decade, they still made up almost exactly two-thirds of the adults in the counties Trump carried – and an even higher percentage in the counties that provided him his largest margins, according to the new findings. By contrast, White Christians represent only about two-fifths of the population in the counties that voted for Biden – and an even smaller percentage in the counties that gave him his biggest margins.                 These new county-level findings fill in the picture that exit polls and other surveys have painted over recent years. On one side they show a GOP coalition still dominated by the White Christians who constituted a majority of the nation itself for most of our history; on the other is a Democratic coalition that has been fundamentally reshaped by America’s growing religious and racial diversity and is now split almost in thirds among White Christians, non-White Christians, and those who adhere to non-Christian faiths or no faith at all, according to the latest PRRI findings. Those latter two groups represent an absolute majority of the population in the counties Biden carried, PRRI found.                 The grounding of today’s partisan differences in such elemental components of social identity as religion – as well as race, education and age – helps explain why the balance of power has grown so difficult for either party to fundamentally shift, despite all the tumultuous events of recent years. It also explains why so many Americans consider the stakes in the political competition higher than ever. The PRRI results point toward a political competition that now revolves less around individual policy disputes than the larger question of whether America’s direction will be set by the predominantly White and Christian voters who have historically wielded the most power or by an emerging America defined by both religious and racial diversity.                  “What we’re seeing unfolding over the last four years, and coming into full flower now, the [political] divides really are about American identity, much more than they are about a policy or even economics,” says Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO of PRRI. “Today we should probably replace ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ with ‘It’s American identity, stupid.’ “                 Jones, like other analysts, believes a pervasive sense of loss and displacement in a diversifying country has solidified the strong affinity for Trump-style politics among many White Christians, especially White evangelical Protestants.                 “It really is hard to overstate how central to White Christians’ worldview is this idea of America as a White Christian nation,” says Jones, author of the book “White Too Long,” a history of the relationship between Christian churches and racial inequality. A poll of Trump supporters earlier this year by the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center underscores his point: Fully 87% of them agreed that “Christian faith is an essential part of American greatness.” That number rose to a near unanimous 97% among White evangelical Trump supporters.     Related articleQAnon is spreading amongst evangelicals. These pastors are trying to stop it             Both the Ethics and Public Policy Center polling and the Public Religion Research Institute’s annual “American Values Survey” document deep concern among Trump’s White Christian supporters, especially evangelicals, that social change of all sorts is eroding Christianity’s central position in American life. In the EPPC poll, 89% of all Trump supporters (and 94% of his evangelical backers) said that “Christianity is under attack in America today.” In the latest PRRI polling, three-fourths of White evangelicals agreed that immigrants are “invading” America and replacing its culture; just over 7 in 10 agreed that Whites now face as much discrimination as Blacks and that the values of Islam are incompatible with American values. Nearly 6 in 10 of them, in a recoil from changing gender roles, said that “society is becoming too soft and feminine.”                  This sense of siege, Jones said, has left many conservative Christian voters open to both Trump’s message of resisting social change and to wild conspiracy theories, such as his disproven claims about massive election fraud in 2020. In recent PRRI polling, roughly one-fourth of White evangelical Protestants expressed sympathy for the QAnon conspiracy theory and as many agreed that “true American patriots may have to resort to violence” to save the US.                 “I think as this central tentpole that has been holding up their worldview – America as a White Christian nation, their own private promised land – has fallen, just under the sheer weight of the changing country all around them, it has left them vulnerable to grasping at straws and believing in delusions,” Jones says.                 Behind this weakness for ungrounded political fantasy is an implacable demographic reality: White Christians have been relentlessly declining as a share of America’s population.                  Whites who identify as Christians composed a majority of Americans through almost all of US history. Even as late as 1968, when President Richard Nixon was first elected, Gallup polling found that 85% of Americans identified as White and Christian. (At that point about 60% of Americans identified as White Protestants and another roughly 25% as White Catholics.)                 That number has plummeted over the past half century as the nation has grown more diverse racially (reducing the White share of the population) and religiously (reducing the share of Christians). Different surveys plot the change at slightly varying speeds, but they all show the same trajectory, with the nation reaching a dramatic milestone sometime over the past decade. According to the annual General Social Survey by NORC at the University of Chicago, an independent research organization, White Christians fell below majority status in the country for the first time sometime between 2010 and 2012. Gallup, in figures it provided me, put the tipping point to minority status somewhere between 2016 and 2017. Though the Pew Research Center and PRRI did not conduct polls frequently enough to identify a precise tipping point, in surveys over the past decade both also found White Christians falling to well below half of the population.      Related articleOpinion: America is no longer as evangelical as it was -- and here's why             In the PRRI studies, White Christians reached a low point of 42% of the population in 2018. PRRI says the group has rebounded slightly since, to 44% of the population in the latest Census of American Religion, which it released last week. Gallup, though it places the share of White Christians slightly higher, hasn’t found a rebound: It shows their level stable at 47% since 2018. (Neither the General Social Survey nor Pew has numbers more recent than that.)                 The growth in PRRI’s data came primarily from an unexpected source: a slight increase in the share of Americans who identify as mainline Protestants, a faith that had seemed the most endangered over recent decades. White Catholics have also stabilized in the PRRI data, but the institute found the share of adults who identify as White evangelical Protestants, the bedrock group in the Republican coalition, continuing to slide; in PRRI’s data, evangelicals now comprise 14.5% of Americans, down from about 21% a decade ago. Jones says that while there is no conclusive proof in the data, there’s evidence to suggest that some White Protestants who once might have identified as evangelical have migrated toward more mainline Protestant denominations over unease with evangelical leaders’ unconditional identification with Trump.                 Notwithstanding their slight differences, all the major data sources agree on the broad trend of growing religious pluralism. The shrinking share of White Christians have been replaced partly by non-White Christians, who have grown from just under one-fourth of the population earlier in this century to slightly over one-fourth now. Even more important has been the rising number of Americans who don’t identify with any religious faith: They’ve increased from about 1 in 6 adults earlier in this century to nearly 1 in 4 now.                  These powerful currents have washed over both parties, but they have carried Republicans and Democrats to very different places. White Christians still make up 68% of adults who identify as Republicans, PRRI found, with White evangelical Christians (at 29%), the largest religious group in the party (if down from their numbers even in the GOP earlier this century). By contrast, White Christians now compose just 39% of those who identify as Democrats. Non-White Christians contribute about 1 in 3 Democrats, PRRI found, compared with only about 1 in 7 Republicans. The remaining Democrats (nearly 3 in 10) ascribe either to non-Christian faiths or no religion at all; those two groups represent roughly one-sixth of the GOP, only a little over half as much.                  In all, the two parties now present religious profiles that amount to snapshots through time. Today’s Republican coalition looks something like the religious profile in America overall about 25 years ago (the last time White Christians represented two-thirds of all Americans in the General Social Survey studies was around 1995); the Democratic coalition’s religious breakdown approximates what America itself might look like 10 or so years from now.                 Jones makes the same point from a slightly different vantage point: He notes that the religious composition of the Republican coalition now closely resembles the profile of Americans 65 and older, while the Democratic composition closely overlaps with the overall profile of adults younger than 30.                 The new county-level data from PRRI shows just how powerfully and pervasively these contrasts now shape the competition between the parties. In its latest report, PRRI made an unprecedented attempt to document American religious affiliation by county, drawing on 459,822 survey interviews with Americans across all 50 states that it conducted from 2013 to 2019.                 That report found sharp regional differences in religious affiliation, with all White Christians representing the largest share of the population across the Midwest and outer South, White evangelicals most plentiful in the deep South and unaffiliated, secular Americans most common in the Northeast and especially the West. At CNN’s request, PRRI research director Natalie Jackson crossed those findings with county-level results from the 2020 and 2016 presidential races. The results were striking.                 In 2020, White Christians made up 66% of the adult population in the nearly 2,600 counties Trump carried, many of them smaller and rural. In the nearly 550 counties that Biden carried (including 91 of the 100 largest), White Christians represented only 41% of the adult population. The difference was especially stark among White evangelical Christians: They composed 34% of the population in the Trump counties, compared with just 15% in the Biden counties. By contrast, non-White Christians represented almost 1 in 4 adults in the Biden counties, compared with about 1 in 10 in the Trump counties. Other Christians – a diverse group that includes Asian, Native American, mixed-race and Orthodox Christians as well as Jehovah’s Witnesses – constituted a comparably small share in each man’s counties (about 1 in 16). But those who subscribe to non-Christian faiths or no faith at all were a much bigger presence in the Biden counties (roughly 3 in 10) than Trump’s (about 2 in 10).                 This divergence was even greater in the counties that gave each side its biggest margins. In the nearly 1,100 counties Trump won by 50 percentage points or more, White Christians made up more than 70% of the population, PRRI found. Trump amassed his biggest margins, beating Biden by 80 percentage points or more, almost entirely in smaller rural counties – like Roberts, Borden, King and Armstrong counties in Texas or Hayes, McPherson and Grant in Nebraska – where White Christians represented about three-fourths or more of the population. By contrast, they made up fewer than one-third of all residents in the roughly 170 counties that Biden won by at least 30 percentage points; in Biden’s 20 best counties, most of them larger urban centers, White Christians constituted more than one-fourth of the population in just five.                 These county-level results confirm the religious divide evident in exit polls and other studies that analyzed the 2020 election results. In the recently released Pew Research Center “Validated Voters” study, for instance, Trump crushed by Biden by almost 70 percentage points among White evangelical Christians and posted solid (if reduced from 2016) margins of about 15 percentage points among both White mainline Protestants and White Catholics. Strong liberal social movements have persisted in both denominations for decades (particularly around issues of racial justice), but the fact that Biden, a White Catholic who positioned himself as a centrist, couldn’t push his vote with those groups much past 40% underscored how many barriers Democrats face with the bulk of their believers.                 Biden, in turn, dominated among secular voters and non-White Christians (though Trump apparently ran more competitively, as Republicans often do, among Hispanic Protestants, many of whom are evangelicals). Like polls in previous presidential elections, the Pew analysis also found that within each religious denomination Trump, as other Republican nominees before him, generally ran better with the voters who attended religious services most often, while Biden did better with those who attended less frequently, according to detailed results Pew provided me.                 Jones says it’s too early to tell if the recent stabilization in the White Christian share of the population represents a new plateau or merely a pause in their long decline. One key factor argues for the latter assessment: White Christians make up only a little more than 1 in 4 adults under 30 in PRRI’s data, compared with nearly 6 in 10 of those over 65. As the former continue to replace the latter in American society, that disparity suggests White Christians are more likely than not to continue shrinking through the 2020s. When measuring America by race and religion White Christians will likely remain the nation’s largest single group for years, but without the preponderant numbers that made them the clear first among equals in US life for earlier generations.                  How White Christians respond to that change in status will play a huge role in determining whether America’s political tensions continue to escalate. (The question is equally pertinent for Whites without college degrees, another core GOP group that also has, for the first time, fallen below a majority of the US population in this century.)                 As the new PRRI county data for 2016 and 2020 shows, a strong majority of White Christians have flocked to Trump’s promise to “make America great again” and implicitly restore a social order that placed them at its center. If that large a share of White Christians responded to such arguments when they still constituted a little over 40% of the population, there’s little reason to think that if their numbers shrink further fewer will be drawn to Trump-style messaging – even as he grows more overtly hostile to democracy.                  This process of contraction and radicalization is most apparent among White evangelicals, as evidenced by the conflict between relative moderates and militant conservatives in the Southern Baptist Convention.                  “My fear is that what’s going to happen is as the group shrinks it’s going to become more extreme and what’ll end up happening is that the moderating voices in that group will leave and then it becomes even more extreme,” says Jones.                  Such a “radicalization spiral” is very hard to break, he notes, and provides a huge pool of disaffected Whites willing to subvert democratic rules – or even resort to violence – if that’s what it takes to prevent a diverse and increasingly secular liberal coalition from, in their view, remaking American society.                  “It’s a crisis,” Jones says flatly. “There’s no other way to say it.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

But he decided to buck their advice,"As a child in Austria, Elie Rosen was told to keep his head down. But as he suffered amid rising anti-Semitism across Europe, he decided to stand up for his faith and his heritage.","Jul 8, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Antonia Mortensen,International,"Elie Rosen had never really listened as a child when his grandparents told him and his cousins to keep their heads down. He knew they had survived the Holocaust but he believed the world’s vow of “never again” and saw no reason for his generation of European Jews to fear.                  That changed when a man wielding a baseball bat came after him in front of his synagogue in Graz, Austria. The building had been repeatedly vandalized and while Rosen managed to reach his car and escape unharmed physically, he was shaken to his core.                  “After the attack, those warnings of my grandparents had kind of a flashback,” he told CNN. “This made me very, very sorry and brought tears to my heart and to my face,” he said.                  “Being physically attacked is a different dimension than being verbally attacked, which I am used to because anti-Semitism has risen in the last year.”                 Violence and oppression against Jews and their faith has been a constant in Europe, but recorded incidents of anti-Semitism have been on an alarming rise, partly fueled by lockdowns to stop the spread of coronavirus.                  In Rosen’s home of Austria, there has been the highest number of anti-Semitic attacks since the country started recording them 19 years ago.                  Benjamin Nägele, secretary general of Jewish Communities Austria, said its figures showed a 6.4% rise in reports of anti-Semitic incidents in 2020, even though he says many people do not report every time someone uses a slur against them.                  “We’ve seen a worrying trend not only in Austria, but throughout Europe when it comes to anti-Semitism, he said.                  Nägele said the verbal aggression comes first because it is so easy, especially online. “You can do it anonymously. You can do it a lot of times without fearing any prosecution,” he said. “And then you get encouraged to do it more, to be more aggressive, to actually add insult to injury and, at some point, get so radicalized that you then transfer it to the real world.”                 Katharina von Schnurbein, the European Commission’s anti-Semitism coordinator, said the issues were ancient but there had been a new impetus to some of the hate.                  “Anti-Semitic conspiracy myths have been there for centuries,” she told CNN. “Whenever there is a pandemic, they have come to the fore again. What we see is that, for example, during Covid, anti-Semitic tropes and conspiracy myths have increased significantly on social platforms.”                 As people marched in protest against strict lockdowns imposed by their leaders, the German RIAS organization, which tracks anti-Semitism, noted Jewish tropes among the placards.                  At one event in Bavaria, RIAS said, demonstrators held up a photomontage of people being forcibly vaccinated by people wearing uniforms bearing what looked like a Star of David and the word “Zion.”                  In another case in Berlin, a man appeared to accept the false conspiracy theory that the pandemic was caused by Jews, shouting at two identifiably Jewish pedestrians, “Are you not ashamed, what you did, you Jews?” RIAS reported.                  More than a quarter of the anti-Semitic incidents documented were related directly to the coronavirus, the group said in its annual report.                  The violence between Israel and Hamas in May this year again fueled anti-Jewish sentiment in Germany, RIAS found, with all Jews being targeted for the actions of Israel’s government and military.                  “Stop doing what Hitler did to you,” read one sign in English held up during a pro-Palestinian march in Berlin, the group said.                  Benjamin Ward, deputy director in Human Rights Watch’s Europe division, agreed that anti-Semitism was often cyclical and propelled by events in the Middle East. But he added, “If we look more broadly at the phenomenon of anti-Semitism in Europe, we see that it’s much older and also much wider. it’s really a European issue.”                 Across Europe, anti-Semitic attacks have been rising for years. France has seen numerous attacks – in 2012, three children and a teacher were gunned down at a Jewish school in Toulouse; in 2015, four people were shot dead and others held hostage in a kosher supermarket in Paris; in 2018, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor was killed when she was stabbed 11 times and then had her Paris apartment set on fire.                  Jewish cemeteries from France to Poland are regularly desecrated, and nine out of 10 European Jews believe that anti-Semitism is on the rise, according to a survey by the European Commission.                 In Brussels, Rabbi Albert Guigui is one of those responding by trying to hide his very identity, to look less Jewish.                  “Of course, I wear a yarmulke at home, but outside I prefer to cover my head less conspicuously,” he said, talking of the baseball cap he dons most days. “It’s not healthy to live in an atmosphere of fear and where you feel hunted.”                 As those with living memory of the Holocaust pass away, Guigui worries more hate will come.      Related articleNot just neo-Nazis with tiki torches: Why Jewish students say they also fear cloaked anti-Semitism             “There is concern precisely because there is no longer that barrier of memory,” he said. “Before, people couldn’t openly express their anti-Semitism because the memory of the Holocaust was there to remind people where such words lead. Now there’s been a liberation of the very speech that generates acts.”                 Back in Austria, Karoline Edtstadler, the country’s minister for the EU, said the government was worried because although it was trying to tackle the upsurge in anti-Jewish hate, the numbers of incidents online and in real life kept rising.                  “The positive thing, of course, is we have to foster Jewish life,” she said.                  That’s the new tactic of Rosen, who’s bucking the advice of his grandparents and choosing to stand tall as a member of Austria’s Jewish community, that now stands at about 15,000 people, a fraction of the 220,000 Jews estimated to have lived in Austria before the rise of Hitler.                  He says his grandparents’ approach of keeping a low profile after the Holocaust, or Shoah, was understandable but misguided, and it was time to show and introduce others to Jewish life and traditions.                 “The post-Shoah society of Jews often thought that being silent, not being too loud, would lead to a higher acceptance of Jews in the main society,” he explained, before saying that clearly did not work.                  “I will tell my son or young Jewish people to proud of being Jewish and not to be silent.”       Correction: In a previous version of this story, a photo caption misidentified the memorial to a Berlin synagogue looted in the Nazi era.

The Klan,” airing tonight at 9 p.m. ET/PT. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama from 1997-2001. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.             In the years after I prosecuted and secured convictions for two of the Klansmen responsible for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, I traversed the country giving presentations about the case and the contributing factors that led to that fateful day in 1963.                 That September, Ku Klux Klansmen planted a bomb in a prominent Black church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four young girls and injuring at least 14 other churchgoers. It would take 14 years before one of the men responsible was tried and convicted, and 20 more before I became the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama and took on the reopened case.                 As part of my prosecution, my team and I carefully studied the events leading up to the bombing – which dated back nine years to 1954 – and presented our findings to the jury.     Related articleWhat Jim Crow looks like in 2021             Perhaps one of the most important contributing factors was this: Words matter. That is, the rhetoric employed by our public officials and community leaders can have real-life consequences. In the case of my home state of Alabama, people like 1960s public safety commissioner Bull Connor and Governor George Wallace strategically used dog-whistle rhetoric that fed a White backlash to the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. Their hateful speech essentially gave the green light to racial violence. There was no question among the Ku Klux Klan and other White supremacists that Connor, who had control over Birmingham’s police and fire departments, and other public officials were sympathetic to their cause.                 It’s no surprise, then, that the Klansmen who were responsible for the 1963 church bombing believed they had cover from the very top. The Klan at large felt invincible, because at the time the Klan’s reach extended throughout government and law enforcement from the local level on up. And that historically deep-seated influence, combined with the challenges of systemic racism and implicit bias, remained a dangerous combination long after the 1960s.      Related videoHow the KKK's failures became lessons for White power             In the case of Michael Donald’s lynching in 1981, as examined in the new CNN Original Series “The People V. The Klan,” the local police in Mobile, Alabama, did not engage in such overt, vocal racism. But the broader Black community still had plenty of reason to mistrust. Throughout the early investigation, the department disregarded mounting evidence pointing to the Klan, instead floating theories that young Michael was caught up in drugs or other criminal activity that led to his brutal murder. The Mobile Police Department said they were trying to chase down every lead, but as the so-called “War on Drugs” began to mount in 1981, too many in law enforcement simply assumed that drugs were at the cause of every young Black man’s death. Of course, that wasn’t true – and we now know the Klan had targeted Michael as an act of retaliation after the case of a Black man accused of killing a White Birmingham police officer ended in a mistrial.                 While times had certainly changed between 1963 and 1981, racism remained stubbornly embedded within American communities and institutions, like Mobile and its police department. It continues to be one of the greatest challenges we face as we look to root out discrimination and disparate treatment within our criminal justice system.     Related articleBeulah Mae Donald's nightmare became a challenge to America              Today we find ourselves in similarly dangerous and yet unprecedented territory. In the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by violent extremists, we have seen troubling reports about those rioters’ connections to law enforcement and our military – positions of great responsibility and with the power to make life-and-death decisions on the job. While I do not believe there is some broader conspiracy among the police, our military and the myriad extremist groups in America to coordinate and advance racist ideologies, it’s clear that these views continue to find safe harbor within many of those institutions.                  Of the rioters arrested for the attack on the Capitol, at least 38 are current or former members of the U.S. military, according to an April CBS News accounting. At least five of those arrested were law enforcement officers at the time of the riot, and five more were former officers. Among those present, extremist groups including the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys to the Three Percenters and others are reported to have been driving forces organizing the mob. The Oath Keepers, notably, are a self-proclaimed organization of current and former law enforcement officials and military veterans.                  Though these extremists are a minority of our uniformed officers, the danger that they present from within our institutions is clear. The Capitol riot showed us a stark example of that most recently, shaking many Americans to their core. But this is a far greater systemic problem that has spanned generations in our country. It has taken different forms over time, but we are clearly still struggling to confront the influence of these hateful ideologies – as well as the infiltration of those who seek to advance them – within our public safety ranks and criminal justice system.                 Finally, let there be no doubt that the actions of those Capitol insurrectionists were prompted by similar dog-whistle style rhetoric from some of our nation’s top leaders. Once again, as we saw in the 1960s, hateful rhetoric prompted violent consequences.      Related articleAmerica desperately needs a Truth and Racial Healing Commission             The question then is, what can we do about this? How do you root out bad actors and hold institutions accountable?                 One solution starts within. Police and public safety officials need a clear, consistent set of guidelines and code of conduct to prohibit any support for or affiliation with extremist groups. To be effective, such rules must be upheld forcefully and discipline should be applied fairly, regardless of rank. Setting an example from within is key to rooting out racist behavior as well as discouraging those with extremist ties from seeking employment in departments to begin with.                  To date, disciplinary action appears to be inconsistent and lenient, given the authority officers are granted on the job. That lack of accountability sends a message again to extremists – however accurate it may be – that law enforcement continues to be friendly to their cause. We have to take steps to break that cycle. If we fail to meet this moment, I believe we will continue to see more attacks on democracy and on people of color by those who feel they still have cover from the top.                 But in the end, our public officials have to bear some responsibility for their rhetoric and choose their words carefully. Condemning violence after the fact is simply not enough and in many instances rings hollow.  Leaders must stand together, put partisanship aside, and do all they can to bridge divides, not make them wider.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/prabal-gurung-opinion-hyphenated/index.html,Prabal Gurung: Anti-Asian sentiment runs deeper than you think,"The Nepali American designer writes on the torrent of anti-Asian hate crimes, his continued fight for diversity in fashion and the need for Asian American communities to “be in every corner and exist in every space.”","Apr 7, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Prabal Gurung,International,"Editor’s Note: Prabal Gurung is a Nepali American fashion designer based in New York. All opinions expressed in this article belong to the author. The feature is part of CNN Style’s new series Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.             My 75-year-old Nepali mother, who lives in New York, goes for a walk every morning and every evening. I send her out in disguise: I bought her a blonde wig, and I tell her to wear it under a hat, glasses and mask. “Maybe then, they’ll leave her alone,” I think. I know it sounds crazy, but it’s my survival instinct kicking in.                 “I understand your concern and worry,” my mami, as I like to call her, told me the other day.                 “But I would rather get a walking stick or a cane, just in case something happens. I can fight back,” she assured me, adjusting her wig and hat.                  That’s just how she is: resilient, unafraid and a picture of grace under pressure. I admire her strength but continue to worry for her safety. I check in constantly so I know where she is at any given time.                  This is what it’s come to. A fear so constant that it’s crippling.              “By using terms like “China Virus” and “Kung Flu,” Trump gave the coronavirus a face, an Asian face, and for that, we have all suffered.”             Prabal Gurung                 Here’s where we’re at:                  A torrent of anti-Asian hate crimes have been committed, including the brutal assault of elderly Asian men and women in broad daylight. Among them is 65-year-old Vilma Kari, who just last week in New York, was told “F**k you, you don’t belong here, you Asian,” according to the criminal complaint, before being pushed to the ground and kicked repeatedly by her attacker. The shootings at three Atlanta-area spas have left six Asian women dead. Nearly 3,800 hate incidents have so far been reported to Stop AAPI Hate over the course of a year. It feels as if there’s an open season for violence against Asians.       Introducing CNN Style's Hyphenated series             By using terms like “China Virus” and “Kung Flu,” former US President Donald Trump gave the coronavirus a face, an Asian face, and for that, we have all suffered. While his damaging rhetoric has no doubt fueled these hate crimes, their roots are buried deep in underlying racist currents that have long impacted our communities in the United States.                    They can be found in every industry. For instance, when it comes to my world – fashion – the consequences of systemic racism play out daily. And not just in the form of microaggressions.                 As someone who has a platform, who has clout, I have always believed it’s my responsibility to speak out.                 Fashion at its purest, simplest form, is a reflection of the world we live in. It doesn’t operate in a vacuum but instead influences – and is influenced by – music, culture, social movements and politics.                  Whatever your views are, everyone engages with fashion at some level. For most of us, it’s one of the first decisions we make each morning. I believe in its greater purpose – as a tool of empowerment. But as much as fashion projects its power outwards, behind the scenes, it can be a very different story.                 I was born in Singapore, grew up in Nepal and lived in India, and in these countries, you’re faced with issues such as colorism, caste discrimination and hierarchal social structures. When I started my brand 12 years ago, I wanted it to show marginalized people that they are seen, and that they matter. But until recently, it’s been an uphill battle.              “I was advised to limit the diversity of my runways because clients wouldn’t be as receptive to non White models: “‘two Black women, two Asian women – OK that’s enough.’”             Prabal Gurung                 The question of who dictates style, or what we consider tasteful or chic, is still viewed through a colonial lens, shaped by centuries-old Eurocentric ideals. Unrealistic beauty standards are often elitist, discriminatory and ultimately, constructed to maintain a proximity to Whiteness that allows those in power to feel important and secure. Decision-makers are, predominantly, White.                 This plays out in a number of ways.                 Fashion inspired by minority cultures, or rooted in the heritage of a minority designer’s heritage, may be tokenized as “exotic” or “ethnic,” or disparaged in hushed tones as “tacky and garish.” Tone-deaf campaigns and racist garments are often created because there are no people of color in the room that feel empowered enough to stop them from going ahead.                 Early in my own career, I was advised to limit the diversity of my runways because clients wouldn’t be as receptive to non White models: “two Black women, two Asian women – OK that’s enough.”                 I also recall wanting to open a collection with Korean model Ji Hye Park, and it sparked such a big discussion with the brand’s other stakeholders. “Should we? Shouldn’t we? Is it cool? Does it make sense? Is this idea… luxury?”                  These kinds of conversations were initially shocking. But I became used to witnessing microaggressions or blatant discrimination against the few Asian people who, like myself and other people of color, were able to break into this industry. Yes, fashion continues to make strides in the right direction, but we still have miles to go. Today, I still see Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American and LGBTQ peers being tokenized by the industry, called upon to perform inclusivity.                 I’ve often been challenged about my “American-ness.” During a planning meeting for my label’s 10th anniversary collection in 2018, an investor asked me to express what I felt my brand stood for.                  I began explaining that American style had always been seen through a White lens. But as a first-generation Asian immigrant, as a minority, as a queer person of color, I wanted to redefine the country’s style because our experiences have been underrepresented. The way I look at this country is an amalgamation of different cultures, races, ethnicities, religions and sizes, and that should be celebrated.                 He, in turn, asked, “Well you don’t look American, how can you define American style?”                  It was clear to me what he meant by his statement: I wasn’t White, therefore I had no authority to shape the American ideal. And this despite being an American citizen who owns a business in this country – one who employs Americans and immigrants, embraces a “Made in America” production ethos and pays taxes. For some people it’s just never enough.                  I ended up turning that collection into a celebration of American identity and belonging, sending a diverse cast of models down the runway in denim, white short-sleeved shirts, rose prints and, during the finale, sashes bearing the question: “Who gets to be American?”     Why some Asian Americans are embracing heritage by dropping their anglicized names             While the show had a lot of positive feedback, and started a healthy dialogue about identity, there were some who felt it was too on the nose. This is how privilege works. It was a luxury to be in the position to say that it was “too much” or “too direct.” However, when it comes to fighting for basic human rights, it is never too much. It is never too loud.                   It’s clear that the road to a more equitable fashion industry is long. Until brands genuinely diversify their decision-makers and boards – not just with token hires, but with people actually willing to strike up difficult, uncomfortable conversations that challenge biases – it won’t change. And, let’s be honest, brands’ efforts to embrace Asian culture have been motivated by the spending power of countries like China, India and South Korea, not some moral awakening.                  But, cynicism aside, just like conversations brought about by the Black Lives Matter protests, the Stop Asian Hate movement is inviting renewed scrutiny of fashion’s role in perpetuating racism and discrimination – from runways and collections to workplace culture.             “We need to be in every corner and exist in every space.”             Prabal Gurung                 Asian Americans in the industry should recognize that we have an important role to play. As a whole, more than 60% of the global population lives in Asia, according to the United Nations. Asians are the world’s biggest consumers of clothing, and we manufacture most of it too. Yet, told that our voices don’t matter, we’ve mostly played supporting roles, quietly and submissively catering to the needs of businesses.                 It’s not enough. It’s time to speak out and step up.                  Take this time to donate, build your skills by participating in harassment intervention training, and support existing social justice organizations and initiatives such as Stop AAPI Hate and Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC. Familiarize yourself with non-profit organizations like Gold House and Define American who are shaping culture, forming solidarity through intersectionality and creating impactful, sustainable long-term solutions for challenges facing our communities.                 The solidarity protests over the past few weeks have been extremely heartwarming. I have demonstrated alongside my peers, activists, community leaders and regular New Yorkers, telling our truths and, between other minorities and marginalized groups, finding support and common ground.                  We need to be in every corner and exist in every space. The more that our stories are told, the more that our faces, our experiences and our humanity will not only be normalized but embraced.                   We must claim our rightful seats at the table, and then use those positions to empower other marginalized groups. Visibility is key, and we must craft our own narratives and tell our own stories.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/03/us/arab-americans-covid-19-impact/index.html,"The whitewashing of Arab Americans impacted by Covid-19 is a catastrophic public health issue, experts say","Arab Americans are forced to tick “White” or “other” on the Census and medical paperwork, which means that public health data collected on the community is largely anecdotal.","Apr 3, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Mirna Alsharif,International,"To learn more about the changing demographics of the US, watch “United Shades of America” Sunday at 10 p.m. ET/PT.             Dr. Raed Al-Naser was on the front lines at Sharp Grossmont Hospital in San Diego when patients first started coming in with symptoms of Covid-19.                 “The hospital was packed and the ICU was at full capacity,” the ICU pulmonologist told CNN. “And I saw a disproportionate number of Arab Americans in the ICU.”                 This realization, and a lack of public health data on the Arab American community, motivated Al-Naser to conduct his own research based on the patients he was seeing at Grossmont Hospital and his own private practice.                 “There is a large Arab American community nearby in East San Diego, specifically in El Cajon county,” Al-Naser said. “And because there is no identifier for the group, they’re all being counted as White Covid-19 patients and no one was noticing how the virus was specifically affecting this population.”                 Based on the standards set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), there are seven categories for data on race and ethnicity: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic or Latino, according to the 2020 Census program memorandum. As a result, Arab Americans are forced to tick “White” or “other” on the Census and medical paperwork, which means that public health data collected on the community is largely anecdotal, according to experts like Al-Naser.                 Arab Americans trace their origins to the Middle East and North Africa, which is traditionally comprised of 22 Arabic-speaking countries. They are not a monolith and can be White, Black and brown. Los Angeles and New York City have the largest populations of Arab American residents in the country based on data from the 2015-2019 ACS Ancestry survey. Both areas have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected minority and immigrant populations.                  Through his research, Al-Naser found that around 15% of Covid-19 patients classified as White were actually Arab American. Also, about 30 to 35% of Covid-19 patients in the ICU classified as White were Arab American.                 “The Arab American community is a historically understudied group because it has no identifiers, so Covid-19 exposed the invisibility of the group rather than created it,” he said. “It’s key to identify people at risk or else they’ll go unnoticed and the disparity will deepen.”                 Dr. Nadia Abuelezam, epidemiologist and assistant professor at Boston College’s Connell School of Nursing, has studied health disparities among the Arab American community throughout her career.                 “There are a lot of disparities in the community and they’re not well known because of the whitewashing that’s happening,” Abuelezam said. “The lack of identifiers limit our ability to use national data sets and receive funding to understand Arab and Middle Eastern American health results.”                 According to a study Abuelezam published in 2020, “there are a number of reasons why Arab Americans may be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, complications, and death, including exposure to xenophobia and stigma, pre-existing conditions,” like diabetes and hypertension, “multigenerational homes,” lack of social support for new immigrants, and poor adoption of prevention behavior,” which includes vaccine hesitancy.                 New York resident Mohamed Madboly, 26, is all too familiar with this as a first-generation Arab American.                 Last year, Madboly, his diabetic father and his mother, who has hypertension, all became infected with Covid-19.                  “I feel like America is intentionally neglecting Arab identities,” said Madboly about the lack of data on the community. “We’re blinded from our own statistics. This makes it very difficult for experts to draw accurate conclusions to help our community not only improve but get better. Especially in a time like now, where we need it more than ever.”                 Although public health data on the community is limited, prior samplings and independent studies show that Arab Americans’ health outcomes and needs are distinctly different from the outcomes of White non-Hispanics, according to Abuelezam’s study.                  A hospital-based study in Michigan found that Arab Americans have a higher prevalence of preexisting conditions like diabetes and hypertension than in White communities. Researchers also found in a study on Arab Americans in California that 55.2% of the respondents were overweight or obese, another condition that can mean increased risk and severity of Covid-19 and death.                 Also, Arab American homes are more likely to be multigenerational than non-Arab homes, which can “lead to greater transmission risk within households to older individuals, increasing vulnerability to infection,” according to Abuelezam’s study.                 There is also a lot of vaccine hesitancy within the community, which is corroborated by national data for flu and pneumonia vaccines, according to a study from the National Library of Medicine published in 2014.                 Research done by Al-Naser in East San Diego also found that most of his Arab American patients were socioeconomically underprivileged and had less access to insurance than his Black and Hispanic patients.                 So, not only is asking Arab Americans, like Madboly and his parents, to identify as White inaccurate, but it can also skew Covid-19 data, according to Abuelezam and Al-Naser.                 Advocacy groups, such as the Arab American Institute (AAI) and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), have been pushing for a Middle East and North Africa (MENA) categorization, which is a geographic designation that includes ethnic and racial options, to be adopted by the OMB for decades.                 Although the Census Bureau does not include identifiers for the community, it estimated MENA Americans at 3.1 million in the 2015 census.                 “It’s definitely an undercount,” Maya Berry, executive director of the AAI, told CNN. “The Census is about providing an accurate count of the community, so that its members can participate fully in our democracy. The limited publicly available data has always been used against the community.”                 Samer Khalaf, president of the ADC, which estimates Arab Americans at the 4.5 million range, agrees.                 “It’s an underserved community when it comes to social programs and mental health programs, because we can’t get the proper finances and resources to help the community,” Khalaf said. “And it’s not different with Covid. How can we tell how hard-hit the community is? How do we advocate for a proper allocation of resources, like the vaccine, in these communities if we can’t show what our concentrations are?”                 Advocacy groups expected the adoption of a MENA category in 2015 and 2017, according to Khalaf, but the OMB abandoned the motion upon the emergence of the Trump administration.                 CNN has reached out to the OMB for comment.                  The Biden-Harris administration drafted a “plan for partnership” with the Arab American community prior to its election pledging to “support the creation of a new Middle East North Africa (MENA) category, which was recommended by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017, so that Arab Americans can be more fairly counted and their needs studied and considered alongside other minorities.”                 “The Trump Administration politicized the 2020 Census, putting marginalized communities at risk of a drastic undercount, and abandoned the addition of a MENA category on the Census,” reads the Biden-Harris partnership plan.                 Khalaf is cautiously optimistic that the Biden-Harris administration could be open to adopting a correct categorization for the community. But he emphasized that this should have never been a partisan issue.                 “With the Biden administration, at least now we have a cabinet that will listen, said Khalaf. “Whether or not they act upon it is a different story.”       Nadeem Muaddi and Priya Krishnakumar contributed to this story.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.             There are some obvious lessons we should draw from the Jan. 6 insurrection to ensure the United States never sees another attack like that. The first is that all involved, perhaps including Donald Trump for inciting the mob, must be brought to justice to serve as a deterrent to any others who might contemplate similar violence to overturn an election. Another is that the words of political figures and their media allies who appear to be advocating insurrection must be loudly denounced.                    In the past few days, we’ve seen the Michigan GOP state chair invoke the specter of violence against those not loyal to Trump and conservative Trump media allies saying on Newsmax that they wished the military would step in and take over from President Joe Biden. Before the attack on the Capitol this type of language was wrong. Today it feels like a dangerous continuation of the type of incitement that led to the Jan. 6 attack.                 Michigan GOP chair Ron Weiser made his comments at a Republican club meeting on Thursday, where he was asked how to remove from office two of the state’s Republican members of Congress, Reps. Fred Upton and Peter Meijer, who were among the 10 Republicans who voted with Democrats in February to impeach Trump for incitement of insurrection. Weiser responded, “Other than assassination, I have no other way other than voting out. OK?”                   There’s absolutely no place for using the word “assassination” by any American pollical leader as a tactic to remove political figures you disagree with – even if, as Weiser claims, the comments were taken out of context. Weiser’s comment is especially irresponsible given that Meijer publicly shared in January that he’d bought body armor after death threats against Republicans who’d voted to charge Trump.      Related articleThe fried-egg school of politics             Weiser wasn’t done with being vile. He also referred to the three statewide female Democratic officials, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, as “the three witches” and said his “job now is to soften up those three witches,” so come the 2022 election, “they are ready for the burning at the stake.”                 This is not just sexist, but violent imagery that is even more dangerous given that we learned last October Gov. Whitmer had been the target of a plot by right wing militia groups to kidnap and possibly kill her. Fourteen people were charged in the conspiracy, with Whitmer, in response, drawing a straight line to Trump – who had frequently publicly attacked her and called to “liberate” Michigan – for his refusal “to condemn White supremacists and hate groups like these two Michigan militia groups.”                 Meanwhile, over on the very pro-Trump network Newsmax, the network’s weekend co-hosts, Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known as “Diamond and Silk,” appeared on another show where they made a jaw-dropping call for the US military to remove President Biden from office. After the two shared their view that Biden has “a cognitive problem” because he tripped while climbing the stairs of Air Force One, Hardaway added, “Listen, I wish that the military would step in and take over.” She later demanded that the people currently in charge of our nation need to “go somewhere, sit down, and allow the military to take over from here.”     Related articleTrump's big lie could backfire in Georgia              Yes, on American television, hosts called for a military coup to overturn our democracy, remove the US President and have the military run the nation.                 I called and emailed Newsmax to see if, as a network, it supported or denounced their hosts’ call to overthrow our democratically elected government and replace it with military rule. They have not yet responded.                 Michigan GOP Chair Weiser, who also serves on the University of Michigan’s board of regents, at first refused to apologize for his words, instead remarking he should have “picked his words more carefully.” Then, in typical Trumpian fashion, he attacked the media and “leftists” for overhyping the issue.                 Weiser finally offered what The Detroit Free Press dubbed “an apology of sorts” on Saturday, after mounting pressure from elected officials and University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel, who slammed Weiser’s comments as being “particularly abhorrent” after the Jan. 6 attack “directed at elected officials, our democratic institutions, and the individuals who guard them.”     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             “I apologize to those I offended for the flippant analogy about three women who are elected officials and for the off-hand comments about two other leaders,” said Weiser, adding, (to his credit) “in an increasingly vitriolic political environment, we should all do better to treat each other with respect, myself included.”                 These are not normal times. We must swiftly and in one voice denounce political leaders or media pundits who suggest violence or call for a military coup. If not, a Jan. 6-style attack could happen again – and next time these un-American, anti-democratic forces may prevail.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/influencers-pandemic-travel-social-media-scli-gbr-intl-cmd/index.html,"As young people itch to leave lockdown, British health leaders face a new challenge: Influencers","When 21-year-old Daanish Hussain escaped London for Dubai over the New Year, he did what he does almost every day – reached for his phone, and documented his journey for his 550,000 followers on TikTok.","Mar 23, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Rob Picheta,International,"When 21-year-old Daanish Hussain escaped London for Dubai over the New Year, he did what he does almost every day – reached for his phone, and documented his journey for his 550,000 followers on TikTok.                 His video montage – which showed him swapping gray skies for sunshine in the United Arab Emirates – would draw the envy of many Brits, who have been banned from all but essential international travel for months.                  But he was far from alone. In recent months, as the UK has sat frozen in lockdown, countless social media stars have posted content from beaches, shopping malls and hotels in Dubai and other favorite hotspots – many staying in the city despite its own restrictions beginning last month.             “I noticed that a lot of influencers went away – like, a lot of influencers,” Hussain told CNN, admitting he has seen some anger in the comments on his travel videos.                  The travels of British influencers haven’t escaped the attention of the UK’s insatiable tabloids – screenshots of their foreign parties have been plastered underneath unflattering headlines for weeks.                 And influencers don’t need to leave home to draw a backlash. Last month, a leading official at the National Health Service (NHS) was forced to urge people not to follow the advice of Gwyneth Paltrow, who wrote on her blog that she eased the effects of long Covid with a variety of superfoods like kombucha and kimchi.                 But as young people become restless in lockdown, and as the vaccine rollout moves towards millennials, concern is growing from both inside and outside the influencing industry that their laissez-faire approach is rubbing off on followers.                 “One of the reasons marketers use celebrities in their campaigns is because they know it has an impact because consumers, particularly young people, want to emulate their behaviours,” Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told CNN on email. “Social media influencers are today’s celebrities. They should recognise the responsibility that comes with that and work to promote public health, not undermine it.                 “Influencers have got this huge pull – it’s in their very name, they influence,” added Keith Herman, whose company Trending Travel uses a network of influencers to promote locations around the world. “You’ve got to be careful how you use them.”                 The NHS’s dismissal of Paltrow’s suggestions for dealing with Covid-19 was unexpected, and gave a glimpse at the exasperation among health leaders that young people are seeing the pandemic through the eyes of their online idols.                 “Like the virus, misinformation carries across borders and it mutates and it evolves,” Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said after the actress suggested a particular diet had helped with the “brain fog” she experienced after having Covid-19.                  “We need to take long Covid seriously and apply serious science. All influencers who use social media have a duty of responsibility and a duty of care around that.”     How Dubai is paying the price for letting in tourists             The UK’s Home Secretary Priti Patel had similarly railed against stars taking flights to sunnier locations. “We see plenty of influencers on social media showing off where they are in the world – mainly sunny places,” she said in Parliament, emphasizing that people should simply not be traveling.”                 But if British media outlets are any indication, the admonishment has not filtered through the influencer community.                 “NO SHAME: Brit influencers STILL promoting parties and moan people are ‘quick to judge’,” The Sun reported last month – one of a flurry of critical stories. A number of former stars of the popular British reality television show “Love Island” have been heavily criticized by some followers for posting poolside pictures from the city, while one fitness influencer caused a viral backlash after telling ITV she left lockdown for Dubai because her “job is to motivate people.”             A glance at the comments on any influencer currently relaxing abroad shows that not everyone feels the same way. “Hard at work! Hope you’re enjoying the pandemic,” one user wrote under a recent image from former reality TV star James Lock, showing him jet skiing in Dubai. Similar posts from influencers often see a flurry of messages in which fans say they will unfollow the star.                 Hussain, who became one of Britain’s TikTok stars last year under his handle “its_danzy,” insisted the outrage is misplaced. “Some people don’t realize that social media’s a job,” he told CNN.                 As for his own reasons to travel, Hussain said he “had to go for business reasons,” but also “we were in a lockdown and it was for my birthday.” He added: “And I knew it would be good for content as well. People love different countries and that.”                 The university student is under no illusions that his sudden platform carries weight, including when his content runs counter to official advice. “People kind of look at you as a role model … when you have people value your point and value whatever you say, in a sense, I think that does kind of have an influence.”     A post shared by Danzy (@its_danzy)             And he admitted that he regretted, “to an extent,” posting about his travels. “You’re kind of telling people to do what the law’s telling you not to do.                 “But if I was there for a business reason, or for influencing reasons … I wouldn’t say that you should go as well,” he added. “If an influencer doesn’t do what they have to do, they’re not going to make money.”                 Others have been less relaxed.                  Herman, whose Trending Travel uses a network of influencers to promote locations around the world, said he has taken the costly decision to tell stars not to post content from abroad.                 “We realized quite early on that every time anybody posted, they were getting absolutely slaughtered on a sensitive subject,” he said. “I think some of them are more naive than anything else … We just said to all of the influencers that we had out (in holiday destinations): please don’t post.”                 Elma Beganovich, an influencer with 700,000 Instagram followers who has capitalized on her social know-how to set up a marketing company, told CNN that online stars must stick to a crucial rule: “You can’t be tone deaf.                 “Springing champagne at the pool at some exotic resort … that’s just not going to be socially acceptable,” Beganovich told CNN. “It’s become distasteful to say, look how ostentatious I am, when you know so many people have lost jobs or they have their loved ones hospitalized.”                 Beganovich’s company, Amra & Elma, works with a host of influencers who have had to adjust their output during the pandemic, urging them to ditch the “you don’t belong here, we’re too exclusive for you” attitude that has become a feature of Instagram pages in recent years.                 And failing to move with that trend could have a significant financial impact, she said, in an influencer marketing industry that is expected to be worth $15 billion by 2022 according to research firm Insider Intelligence.                  “For influencers, followers are everything,” she said. “They may lose their contracts, or have them downsized or paused,” if brands consider their behavior out of touch.                 More pressingly, health experts are becoming concerned about the impact of carefree content at a time when most of the world is still agonizingly stuck under a Covid-19 cloud.                 Polls in the UK show that younger people are more likely to be opposed to lockdown than elders. And soon, the UK’s expansive vaccine rollout will reach those ages too. Research by the Office for National Statistics revealed this month that one in six adults under the age of 30 were hesitant about taking a coronavirus vaccine, compared to far smaller numbers of over-50s.                 “Celebrities and public figures influence public perceptions, attitudes, and behavior, which comes with great responsibility,” said Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London. “We would hope that all influencers and people in the public eye would make their comments science-based and their actions clearly within the rules,” he said.                   “We know from other public health topics that images or accounts of celebrities engaging in harmful behaviors does play a role in others believing that the behavior is acceptable or normal,” Linda Bauld, Bruce and John Usher Professor of Public Health at Edinburgh University, added. “There are a number of studies illustrating that celebrities smoking in films influences youth smoking, and that alcohol endorsements by influencers increase the risk of alcohol abuse in teenagers.                 “It is therefore plausible that if we see influencers flouting lock down rules in the press, it normalizes that type of behavior, making it more acceptable,” she said.     Influencers are using their clout and getting paid to promote Covid best practices for New Jersey             “There’s a lot of things that one could say are a bit flippant and irresponsible” online, added Heidi J Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, a research group at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine created to combat vaccine hesitancy.                  “The reality is (young people) have been less affected by this pandemic,” she added. “(And) They’ve got a lot of exposure to this misinformation.                 “We shouldn’t kid ourselves about the wave of hesitancy we’re going to see in different settings, and particularly with younger people,” she said.                 But if they do provide a challenge, influencers can also present an opportunity.                 The British government has sought to bring them on side. Last month it appointed Alex George, a contestant on the reality TV show “Love Island,” who returned to work as a frontline doctor during the Covid-19 crisis, to be a Mental Health Ambassador. And last year £63,000 ($88,000) was given to 42 influencers in exchange for them promoting its coronavirus Test and Trace program.                 “I think it’s a good thing – we’ll need a diversity of types of voices,” Larson said. “It’s important to have some credible and authoritative voices on social media.”                 Even travel companies like Herman’s are looking to use influencers in a new way, encouraging them to start posting about how Covid-secure hotels are once they re-start promotions.                 And Beganovich is predicting lasting changes in the influencing industry, with a new interest in content from health experts. “I’ve seen ER doctors who gain a lot of popularity through Instagram,” she said. “Even influencers are influenced.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Asian Americans, already traumatized by a rising tide of hate, violence and rhetoric, have been living in fear for months.                 The murders of eight people, including six Asian women, among them four South Koreans, further disoriented and horrified a community already unfairly stigmatized by racial association during a pandemic that originated in China. And they laid bare for the rest of the country the agony of yet another minority group left to question its place in America, at a time of rising attacks and harassment amid cresting White nationalism and domestic extremism.                 Many Asian Americans feel exposed by a torrent of dangerous and racially motivated rhetoric by national figures on a cultural crusade. Most prominently that includes ex-President Donald Trump, who presided over four years of rising racial tensions and often used division as a tool of personal power.                 Campaigners talk of a perfect storm of prejudice targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander community that stirred latent hatreds as Covid-19 first arrived in the US, and was exacerbated by Trump’s relish in flinging around terms like “China virus.”                 “There is a lot of fear in the community not just because of the hate crimes of the last year, which are the result of xenophobic messaging around the pandemic by the former President,” Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen, a Democrat, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Wednesday. “There is a lot of history of Asian American violence in this country – and many of our parents or grandparents and ancestors experienced that.”                  Anti-Asian hate crimes are up 150% during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.                 NBA veteran Jeremy Lin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night that while he had experienced bigotry when he was younger, it was now much more pronounced.                 “It feels very different. I think growing up, it was always something that might be a little more subtle or verbal. But I think what we are seeing right now is a lot of physical actual violence, lives being taken. A lot of Asian Americans who are looking over their shoulders when they go outside, when they go to the grocery story,” Lin said.                 “I think there is a lot of racially charged hatred right now that we’re seeing and feeling.”     Related articleAsian Americans were already living in fear. The Atlanta-area spa killings feel like a terrifying escalation for them              Vivien Tsou, national field director for the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, described a personal sense of dislocation and horror after Tuesday’s killings, that she said were deeply felt in her community.                 On a day when the new Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told lawmakers that domestic extremism was the greatest threat to the homeland, Tsou argued that Asian Americans did not face distinct peril but were targeted by the same forces of hate endured by Black Americans and that were evident in the insurrection against the US Capitol on January 6.                 “While the focus is on anti-Asian hate, it all stems from White supremacy and anyone can be a scapegoat at any moment,” Tsou said.                  “This is something that we need to face together and stand in solidarity,” she said, referring to other ethnic minority groups.                 More broadly, the ordeal of the Asian American community revealed another dimension of the much discussed national reckoning over race A flurry of current events – from the crisis on the southwestern border, to Republicans’ voter suppression efforts, to the disparities in Covid-19 vaccine availability – all revolve to some extent around questions of ethnicity. And they are highlighting the particular pain of minority Americans that can never be felt and is rarely truly appreciated by those in the White majority.                 On Wednesday, a prospective juror in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer charged in the killing of George Floyd, was asked by a defense lawyer whether he had personal views that could shape his judgment.                 “Being a Black man in America, I experience racism every day,” the unidentified man said. He was later excused from service despite insisting he could deliver a fair verdict.                  The exchange didn’t just crystallize the question at the heart of a case with grave national implications – whether the US legal system can deliver justice to a dead Black man or whether an accused White police officer can get a fair trial in such emotive circumstances. It exposed the racism many Blacks, Asians and other minorities believe endemic that other Americans only see after tragedies or national outrages.                 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that the Asian American community needed the same consideration shown to Black Americans in the  aftermath of Floyd’s death amid a national outpouring over police violence.                 “In the same way African Americans across this country ask for support and we asked for people to stand with us over the summer, it’s important that people stand with our Asian brothers and sisters in the same way,” she said. “They are being targeted unfairly and in Atlanta, what we’ve seen – the worst has happened.”                 The extent to which Trump, who often refused to unequivocally condemn White supremacy, and his enablers are to blame for the rising racial prejudice is at the center of controversy in the wake of Tuesday’s attack.                 Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California told CNN on Wednesday that the hysteria whipped up by the ex-President – who at times referred to Covid-19 as “kung flu” has been disastrous for the community.                 “Since the start of the pandemic, he’s been calling this the China virus,” Chu told CNN’s Brooke Baldwin. “So, now we have had a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents.”                 The extent to which the plight of Asian Americans was caught up in Trump’s scorched earth strategy was revealed during a debate about a Democratic House resolution condemning violence against the community in September.                 A total of 164 Republicans voted against the measure, which some described as “woke culture on steroids.” Some members objected to drawing a parallel between the impact of the phrase “China virus” and the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II and historic discrimination against Chinese immigrants – both of which scarred America’s conscience and still resonates with many Asian Americans.                 The World Health Organization has advised against linking the virus directly to any region or ethnic group precisely because of the hate and harassment that has been endured by Asian Americans.                 But one of Trump’s top allies, Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, said in the debate that the measure was an example of “cancel culture” designed to prevent Americans talking truthfully about where the virus was first discovered.                 And even though Trump is no longer in office, much of the Republican Party can’t shake its relish for raising the specter of outsiders – often people of color – while hinting that they threaten majority White American culture.                 In a trip to the southern border this week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said that in addition to a stream of Central Americans, Yemenis, Iranians, Sri Lankans and “even” Chinese were crossing the frontier.     Related articleAsian Americans reported being targeted at least 500 times in the last two months               Increasing attacks on Asian Americans over the last year, including on elder members of the community, have left many scared to leave their homes or unwilling to venture beyond their immediate family networks. People have been verbally abused and accused of spreading Covid-19. Lin was called “coronavirus” on court. There have been especially troubling cases of xenophobic violence against elderly Asian Americans.                 “The Asian American community here is in shock,” Christopher Chan, the advisory chair of the Asian American Action Fund Georgia Chapter, told CNN on Wednesday. “We want attention drawn to this rising epidemic of hate crime, of crimes being committed against Asian Americans.”                 The specific motive behind the shooting spree in Georgia in which Robert Aaron Long, 21, has been charged, remains unclear according to police.                 But Bottoms said on CNN’s “The Situation Room” that it was hard to believe the alleged killer’s reported statement that he was acting on a motive rooted in sex addiction.                 “The fact that many of the victims were Asian … and that he targeted these Asian massage parlors. It’s very difficult to ignore that the Asian community has been targeted and it’s happening across the country,” the mayor said.                 Whether the rationale for the killing was racial or not, it does seem to have been motivated by some form of hate.                 “I know there has been a lot of questions about whether it is racially motivated,” Tsou said. “It is not just race, it is gender. These women were doing a day job to provide for their family. They were going out in a pandemic. This is another layer of fear that we have put upon our communities.”                 Community advocates say there has long been an issue of Asian women being objectified because they work in massage parlors or spas.                 Esther Kao, speaking on behalf of Red Canary Song, a New York collective that advocates for labor rights for (mostly Asian) massage parlor workers and sex workers, said women in the industry had faced a recent surge of racism.                 “But it’s not specific to the sex industry; Chinatown restaurants, workers have also gotten the same kind of threats, and also like lost income during this time,” Kao told CNN’s “Meanwhile in America” newsletter on Wednesday.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The objections, including a rebuke from the Guardian newspaper, come after the Society of Editors rejected allegations made by Prince Harry that racism had played a role in how the British press covered his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.                  The comments were made during an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in which the couple opened up about the challenges of life inside the royal family. The media coverage “was bringing out a part of people that was racist,” Meghan said.                 Society of Editors executive director Ian Murray said in a statement on Monday that it was “untrue” that sections of the UK press were bigoted. “It is not acceptable for the Duke and Duchess to make such claims without providing any supporting evidence,” he said, pointing to “universal supporting coverage” in the media of their marriage.      Related articleOne reason Meghan suffered racist UK coverage: The media is not diverse             The Society of Editors has 400 members, mostly working journalists, and runs the Press Awards, the premier annual awards event in British journalism. The event was formerly called the British Press Awards.                 “The UK media has never shied away from holding a spotlight up to those in positions of power, celebrity or influence,” Murray said in the statement. “If sometimes the questions asked are awkward and embarrassing, then so be it, but the press is most certainly not racist.”                 But several British journalists disputed that view.                 “We disagree with the Society of Editors statement on the Meghan and Harry interview,” the Guardian said in a statement posted to its corporate account on Twitter on Tuesday.                 “Every institution in the United Kingdom is currently examining its own position on vital issues of race and the treatment of people of colour. As I have said before, the media must do the same. It must be much more representative and more self-aware,” added editor-in-chief Katharine Viner.                 Journalists citeda range of evidence to support their claims that Meghan had received racist coverage, including comparisons of favorable coverage afforded Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, and statistics showing that UK newsrooms continue to struggle with diversity.                 But compelling evidence can also be found in headlines run by major tabloids. One Mail Online headline declared in 2016 that Meghan was “(almost) straight outta Compton.” Around the same time, The Daily Star ran a headline asking whether Harry would “marry into gangster royalty?”                 Sathnam Sanghera, a columnist at The Times newspaper and author of a recent book on how imperialism shaped Britain, said on Twitter that it “pains me to say that my industry has been in denial about its institutional racism.”     Related articlePiers Morgan blasted by co-host over Meghan: 'You continue to trash her'             HuffPost UK editor-in-chief Jess Brammar said on Twitter she disagreed with the Society’s assertion that it is “untrue that sections of UK press were bigoted.”                  And Anne Alexander, senior political producer for ITV’s “Good Morning Britain,” added that she was “still trying to process this ridiculous statement.”                 “How can you possibly say that no part of the media is bigoted?

In a letter posted online, journalists of color — including from The Guardian and Condé Nast — urged the Society of Editors to address bigotry and racism in UK media coverage, rather than pretend it doesn’t exist.     Related articleDoes the UK media have a racism problem? These journalists think so             Murray’s insistence that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had provided no “supporting evidence” to support claims of racist coverage showed a “willful ignorance” of the discriminatory treatment of Meghan by the British press, as well as of other people who do not identify as White, according to the letter.                 “We, the undersigned journalists of colour, working in UK media organisations, deplore and reject the statement issued by the Society of Editors, denying the existence of racism and bigotry in the UK press,”the journalists wrote.                 “The blanket refusal to accept there is any bigotry in the British press is laughable, does a disservice to journalists of colour and shows an institution and an industry in denial,” they added.                 The lettercited a range of evidence to support their claims, including a 2016 report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance which found that hate speech among traditional UK media, particularly tabloid newspapers, “continues to be a serious problem” and fuels prejudice.                  Compelling evidence can also be found in headlines run by major tabloids. One Mail Online headline declared in 2016 that Meghan was “(almost) straight outta Compton.” Around the same time, The Daily Star ran a headline asking whether Harry would “marry into gangster royalty?”                 On Wednesday, before Murray resigned, the Society of Editors issued what it described as a “clarification.”                  “Our statement on Meghan and Harry … did not reflect what we all know: that there is a lot of work to be done in the media to improve diversity and inclusion. We will reflect on the reaction our statement prompted and work towards being part of the solution,” the body, which runs the prestigious annual Press Awards, said in a statement.                 In another statement, Murray acknowledged that the organization’s initial remarks had been “heavily criticised.”                 “While I do not agree that the Society’s statement was in any way intended to defend racism, I accept it could have been much clearer in its condemnation of bigotry and has clearly caused upset,” he added.     Related articleOne reason Meghan suffered racist UK coverage: The media is not diverse             But the damage has already been done. ITV news anchor Charlene White on Wednesdayquit as host of the Press Awards. In a letter first reported by HuffPost UK, White told the Society of Editors that it should “look elsewhere” for a host.                 “Perhaps someone whose views align with yours: that the UK press is the one institution in the entire country who has a perfect record on race,” she added.                 The editors of The Guardian and Financial Times newspapers have also disputed the original statement from the Society of Editors.                  “There is work to be done across all sectors in the UK to call out and challenge racism,” FT editor Roula Khalaf said in a statement. “The media has a critical role to play, and editors must ensure that our newsrooms and coverage reflect the societies we live in,” she added.                 “Every institution in the United Kingdom is currently examining its own position on vital issues of race and the treatment of people of colour. As I have said before, the media must do the same. It must be much more representative and more self-aware,” added Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner.                 Reach Plc, which publishes the Mirror, the Express and The Daily Star, declined to comment on the Society of Editors statement. CNN Business has contacted the Daily Mail and The Sun’s publisher, News UK, for comment. Harry and Meghan said last April that they would no longer engage with major tabloids and have sued some newspapers.                 The British press remains overwhelmingly White compared to the overall racial and ethnic makeup of the United Kingdom.                 A report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in 2016 found that just 6% of journalists across UK newsrooms don’t identify as White, compared with about 13% of the general population. The same study found that while Black Britons make up 3% of the population, they account for just 0.2% of journalists.                 And according to a report last July from the Reuters Institute, none of Britain’s top 10 print, digital or broadcast outlets have a Black editor in chief.                 “The Society of Editors should have used the comments by the Sussexes to start an open and constructive discussion about the best way to prevent racist coverage in future, including through addressing lack of representation in the UK media, particularly at a senior level,” the letter from journalists of color said.                  “At a time when many industries and companies are engaged in a reckoning with race in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, we believe it would be a better use of the Society of Editors’ time to reflect on the lack of diversity,” it added.

The attack took place in Albu-Dour’s predominantly Sunni village in Salah al-Din province, about 84 miles north of the Iraqi capital. The area is under the control of Iraq’s Shia led paramilitary forces also known as the Popular Mobilization Units (PMUs).                  ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released Friday. The group said several ISIS militants carried out three separate attacks, including one where they “raided a house” in a village north of Baghdad and shot and killed six family members.                 They called some of those related to the people they killed “spies” who worked for the Popular Mobilization Units.                 ISIS released photos of the raid, including images of some of the victims. Iraqi security officials confirmed to CNN that they were indeed the victims.                 The terrorist group also killed a local police officer and a lawyer in two separate attacks in the same village, the Iraqi military statement said.                 Iraqi security officials said during the investigation they have “concluded that the perpetrators of the crime were elements of ISIS terrorist group who infiltrated the village on foot while wearing military uniform under the pretext of searching homes of the victims,” according to the statement.                 The attack occurred just days after Pope Francis’ historic visit to Iraq, on which he spread messages of peace and religious tolerance.     Related articlePope Francis condemns extremism as 'betrayal of religion'             Ammar al-Jaber, the governor of Salah al-Din, told CNN on Saturday that he requested for Iraqi Interior minister Othman Al-Ghanimi, who is visiting the area on Saturday, to allow local police to take full control of security in the area instead of the PMUs. Al-Ghanimi agreed to the measure, pending approval from the prime minister.                 Al-Jaber said paramilitary forces did a great job fighting ISIS between 2014 and 2017 but it’s now time for local police to take over the responsibility with the support of Iraqi army.                 In a statement on Friday, al-Jaber strongly condemned “the cowardly attack” and said the “security of citizens and the security of the province is a red line, and we will not allow Salah al-Din to be a hotbed for the repetition of such heinous crimes.”                 “The perpetrators of such accidents will receive their fair punishments, whoever they are and whatever their reasons, and investigations are underway at its highest levels,” the governor said.                 In December 2017, the Iraqi military declared it had “fully liberated” all of Iraq’s territory of “ISIS terrorist gangs” with the support of the US-led coalition and had retaken full control of the Iraqi Syrian border; however, ISIS militants are still able to stage sporadic deadly attacks in the country.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The 31-year-old was sentenced in December to five years and eight months in prison on what critics have described as politically motivated charges, but was released in February after serving more than 1,000 days behind bars. She was appealing for her sentence to be overturned and a five-year travel ban lifted.                 On her way into the appeals hearing Wednesday, Hathloul told reporters she hoped Riyadh’s Specialized Criminal Court would change her sentence – her first public comments since her arrest in 2018. The court, however, ruled that the original sentence should stand.                 “The judge denied the appeal and confirmed the sentence to five years and eight months in prison which includes 3 years of probation and 5 years of a travel ban during which Loujain cannot leave Saudi Arabia at any time,” according to a statement by her campaign.                   Hathloul was detained in May 2018 during a sweep that targeted other well-known opponents of the kingdom’s since-rescinded law barring women from driving. She had also challenged other legal restrictions on Saudi women enforced under the kingdom’s restrictive male guardianship system.      Related articleHow Biden can strike a blow against Saudi Arabia's human rights violations              She told her family she had been tortured and sexually abused in prison – allegations Riyadh has repeatedly denied – and her detention was condemned by the United Nations and international rights groups.                 Hathloul’s sentence, according to her campaign, includes restrictions signed by her that state she “cannot speak publicly about her case or reveal any details regarding prison nor celebrate her release on a public level.”                 In a statement in December, Hathloul’s family said she would remain on probation for three years, during which time she could be arrested for any perceived illegal activity.                 Her release in February came less than a week after the White House called on the kingdom to release political prisoners, including women’s rights activists. US President Joe Biden has vowed to pressure Saudi Arabia into improving its rights record, marking a departure from the Trump administration, which was reluctant to criticize the kingdom’s crackdown on dissent.                 The terrorism court convicted Hathloul on charges of harming national security, seeking to change the Saudi political system, and using her relations with foreign governments and rights groups to “pressure the Kingdom to change its laws and systems,” according to a charge sheet her family published in December.                 UN experts have called the charges against Hathloul “spurious.” In a six-page charge sheet for Hathloul’s case, seen by CNN, a section entitled “crimes committed” includes activism against the kingdom’s restrictive male guardianship laws, along with contact with foreign journalists and diplomats.     Related articleSaudi women empowerment 'a lie', say siblings of Loujain al-Hathloul a day after her release              The charges also relied on a series of alleged confessions, according to the documents, which state that Hathloul admitted to applying for a job at the UN along with confessing to being in contact with the human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.                 For much of her imprisonment, Hathloul detailed her hardships to her parents during their prison visits. Those allegations were later made public by three of her siblings who live outside the kingdom, and were corroborated by the court testimony of other female activists.                 Hathloul said she was sexually assaulted and tortured while in detention, including waterboarding, flogging and electrocution, according to multiple statements released by her family and supporters.                 Saudi authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of torture and sexual abuse in their prisons.                 According to her family, Hathloul has twice gone on hunger strike – in protest at her prison conditions, and because she was denied communication with her relatives.                 Hathloul’s sister, Lina al-Hathloul, who has been a driving force behind an international campaign for her release, shared a photo of her sister going into court on Wednesday and reacted to the ruling.                 “The international community should be outraged at this judgment and really take time to study their conscience as they continue to do business with Saudi Arabia,” Lina Al-Hathloul said Wednesday, according to the campaign.

Abdullah Alaoudh is Director of Research for the Gulf Region at DAWN, Visiting Professor at the Elliot School of International Affairs at George Washington and the son of prominent Saudi cleric and political prisoner Salman al-Awda. The views expressed here are their own. Read more opinion at CNN.             Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was released from prison earlier this month after serving 1001 days in prison for “crimes” that included contacting human rights groups and trying to change Saudi Arabia’s restrictive male guardianship laws. Loujain is by no means free, though. She is banned from traveling for five years and remains on a three-year probation, living under the constant threat of being jailed again.      Travel bans are not new in Saudi Arabia. But past rulers used them more sparingly. Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS)  took power, they have increasingly become a key instrument in his struggle to extinguish any semblance of dissent. MBS has not only gone after activists and dissidents, but also has prevented their families from leaving the country in order to bully and coerce them into keeping silent.      Nineteen members of the family of Saudi Muslim scholar and political prisoner Salman Al-Awda have been banned from travel outside Saudi Arabia, including six great-grandchildren, the youngest just a 1-year-old. MBS has also targeted royals, the rich and the powerful in an effort to intimidate, shake down and thwart any challenge to his power. The campaign against the Saudi power elite was launched in November 2017, when MBS’ security forces detained hundreds of the Kingdom’s richest royals and businessmen at the swanky and now infamous Ritz Carlton Hotel.  After enduring weeks of confinement that allegedly included torture and forking over assets under duress, the Ritz detainees were released – save for one who died in custody.  (A Saudi official told the New York Times that the allegations of abuse and torture are “absolutely untrue.”)                  The shakedown and intimidation continue, though, under the guise of the travel ban, a non-violent but still effective tool of oppression. Since the Ritz we estimate, based on our sources in Saudi Arabia, that hundreds of the rich and royal have been added to the banned list, along with their families.                  These bans violate Saudi domestic law, its own regional treaty obligations and international law. Saudi domestic law requires all bans to have “a specific period of time,” and the Arab Charter on Human Rights, to which Saudi Arabia is a party, forbids governments from “arbitrarily or illegally” depriving citizens of their right to leave the country. Moreover, customary international law, which binds all countries, requires any government issuing a travel ban to provide “precise criteria” for the ban and to afford the affected individual the opportunity to appeal it.      Related articleBiden is racing a ticking clock to fulfill this campaign promise             The Saudi government’s travel bans flout all of these domestic and international legal requirements, depriving citizens of the right to leave the country. Many of those placed on the banned list often only find out about it when they go to the airport or try to cross a border post, making it unclear exactly how many people have been affected. The ban also constitutes an integral part of the government’s apparatus of oppression, a first step along a continuum, which, depending on the whims of its unelected leaders, might well progress to detention or disappearance.     Sarah and Omar Aljabri, ages 21 and 22, the children of former intelligence official Saad Aljabri who fled the country to Canada, have made their way along that continuum, from travel ban to secret trial to detention in an undisclosed location. They are children being used as pawns to escalate pressure on their father, who last August filed a lawsuit in a Washington, DC district court alleging that MBS dispatched an assassination squad from Saudi Arabia to Canada to try to kill him just days after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed by members of the same group. (MBS has denied personal responsibility for Khashoggi’s killing and dismemberment in Turkey in 2018, but said he took “full responsibility” for the journalist’s murder because it was carried out by Saudi officials.)                  Others have been detained or disappeared altogether after being issued with a travel ban: Ahmed and Abdulmajeed Abdulaziz, two brothers of prominent Saudi activist Omar Abdulaziz, the rich and royals Faisal Bin Abdullah, Basma bint Saud and Mohammed bin Nayef, to name just a few that have been documented by Human Rights Watch. All of the travel-banned Saudis, along with exiled dissidents, live in a twilight of uncertainty and fear.                 The United States has an important stake in this clash between dissident and authoritarian forces in Saudi Arabia – a struggle that is also playing out on a larger scale across the Middle East and North Africa. Related articleThese are the women who crushed the Caliphate              At a minimum, the Biden administration – which says it wants to “recalibrate” its relationship with Saudi Arabia –  has an obligation to temper the worst excesses of a leader who has a penchant for sadistic abuses and wanton wars that have harmed and destabilized the region. MBS, is, after all, America’s liability as long as the US government provides him with billions in military weapons and political cover. Moreover, the US has a fundamental reason, both from a moral and self-interest standpoint, to provide support for the dissident and nascent democratic forces that are locked in an existential struggle with the forces of authoritarianism across the region, from Egypt to Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, UAE and Bahrain, Syria, Iraq and Turkey. Indeed, that struggle is taking place worldwide, and, as President Biden has declared, we are a party to it.                  To bolster the forces of democratic reform, the Biden administration should strike a blow against Saudi human rights violations not only in Yemen, but also in Saudi Arabia. The Biden administration has already put a temporary freeze on arms sales to Saudi Arabia; it should use this pause to implement targeted sanctions that would raise the costs of the travel ban to the Saudi government. Such a measure would signal to the Saudis and the world that the US stands firmly on the side of civil society and has turned the page on the Trump administration’s policy of embracing despots.                  The new administration could take a small but significant step by instituting a bar on entry into the US of Saudi leaders, a visa ban for those most responsible for the travel ban, starting with staff members at the Saudi Royal Court and the Interior Ministry.      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             Such a tailored sanction would raise the cost of the travel ban for the Saudis and might just convince MBS to back off and allow Saudis who want to leave to do so. A forceful US response to the Saudi ban would also help fortify the community of dissident Arab exiles who could well play a critical role in the future of the region, and it would position the US in the larger struggle exactly where we belong – on the side of dissidents, civil society and the rule of law.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, hate crimes have been on the rise.","Feb 15, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Ian Kumamoto,International,"Editor’s Note: Ian Kumamoto is a Brooklyn-based writer who is working on a memoir about mixed-race identity. Follow him on Twitter @IanKumamoto. The views expressed here are the author’s. Read more opinion on CNN.              To me, the Lunar New Year before 2020 signified the abundance and joy that came with a sense of community. Growing up in Texas, we would go to a family friend’s house, alongside other immigrant families, where everyone brought their household specialties.                  Mom would make her salmon fried rice and would place it among an enormous banquet of wonton soups, pork buns and fish bathed in soy sauce and ginger. Afterward, we would lay on a couch or doze off on our chairs before the adults would try and stuff red envelopes filled with money into our hands. When I moved to New York for college, I continued the tradition, albeit among festive strangers in the family-owned restaurants on Pell Street in Chinatown.                  Now, such gatherings feel like a distant memory and the sense of safety we had in each other’s presence far off. Last spring, I was walking out of a Target in downtown Brooklyn when a middle-aged woman followed me and said I was a “disgusting, dog-eating chink,” got into a car and drove off. A few weeks later, my college-aged downstairs neighbors implored me to “go back to California.” In both cases I stood and said nothing – I was flustered.                  I can pinpoint the moment I could no longer ignore the urge to articulate my racial experiences to almost one year ago, when I began to feel in physical danger. At that time, the hateful rhetoric around Chinese people became more open. An Asian woman was set on fire in Brooklyn and President Donald Trump called Covid-19 the “China virus.”                  Then, on Chinese New Year, the streets of Chinatown were the first to be deserted. Many assumed the outbreak would begin in the immigrant-run markets of Canal Street, Flushing or Sunset Park; natural assumptions, considering that from the beginning the virus was framed as uniquely Chinese.                   When friends tried to comfort me, few seemed to have the language for how to deal with the vitriol directed against me, which I figured came from a notion that Asians didn’t have it so bad. I knew this because up until that point, I thought the same thing. As actor Steven Yeun recently said in an interview with the New York Times Magazine, “I wonder if the Asian-American experience is what it’s like when you’re thinking about everyone else, but nobody else is thinking about you.”  If not being thought about was the worst thing I would go through, I figured I would survive.                 Except now, hate crimes against Asian-Americans have increased, an epidemic that is aided by that silence. In the first three months of the pandemic, reported bias incidents against our communities jumped to 2,120, according to the database Stop AAPI Hate. This year, attacks against Asians have been particularly violent and unsettling: a Filipino man was slashed across the face in the New York City subway. An 84 year-old Thai-American was killed in California in broad daylight. Several elderly Asian people in the Bay Area were pushed to the ground, as if for sport. In Portland, more than a dozen Asian-owned businesses have been vandalized. Few national outlets have covered any of it, further cementing our invisibility.                  The cost of not being seen has been high. Even though I was born in Mexico to a Chinese mother and a Mexican father, I have always looked more Asian. Although I am incredibly proud of my Mexican heritage, I often felt like other Latinx people did not regard me as one of their own. Despite the fact that Spanish is my first language, I would still get incredulous looks from others who were mesmerized that a Chinito could speak that language so well, which often led to uncomfortable comments that discouraged me from speaking my native tongue in public altogether.                  Once I arrived in the US 17 years ago, I realized that my classmates assumed I was an Asian-American, the label I would eventually adopt out of convenience. Still, it wasn’t long before I understood that the identity came with its own baggage, namely that I was good at math and was quiet – “I don’t want to sit next to Ian, he doesn’t even talk,” I remember a third-grade classmate telling the teacher, even though she had never met me.                  Being regarded as a background character seemed harmless enough, but it was only much later that I realized how much it affected every aspect of my personality: it deterred me from joining more creative pursuits, from forming authentic friendships in grade school and it made me believe that I was not allowed to feel things and talk about them.                 In high school, I learned through the Internet about the myth Americans had been taught about people who looked like me – that we were the “model minority.” The term was coined in the 1960s by a White sociologist writing for The New York Times Magazine. He was trying to make the case that Asians were what Black people could be, if only they tried harder. Implicit in this generalization was that we were obedient and that we would not stir trouble, unlike what White America viewed as those other pesky minorities – which would grow to include Latinx and other minority groups.                 Because I was not expected to speak out, I mostly avoided talking about how much racism hurt me. Whenever a professor confused me with the other Asian kid in class or a classmate mocked me by pulling their eyes back, I laughed it off, albeit awkwardly. I learned from other Asian-Americans that making fun of ourselves was not only the norm, but it was cool – calling it out would have relegated us to “uptight” status. But being the minority that was not allowed to have self-regard took a toll. It was like being in a purgatory where no one would take me seriously, even when I was no longer joking.                  “Are you sure you heard her right?” a friend asked me after the incident outside of Target.                  Our status as “good” minorities has always been a burden. But it has never felt as heavy as it does now, when we need the support of others and discover that we are unsure of how to speak about our own marginalization. If the task of our immigrant parents was to find a way to survive in the United States, then it is ours to speak into existence the things they left unsaid.                  We need to acknowledge that the model minority status has silenced us, pitted us against other oppressed people and convinced us that we are no good when we are, for whatever the reason of the moment may be, no longer palatable. Unless we change the narrative, we will continue to be the biggest victims to the myth of our exceptionalism.                 Today, Asian Americans are the fastest growing minority group and I see an opportunity to forge a new identity free from the constraints of White supremacy. Although this will likely be a dark time for us, as we confront increasing anti-Asian rhetoric, it might also be what was necessary for a reckoning that was decades in the making.

The following day, as she ate breakfast, her phone flashed again. This time it was news of another friend, Lloyd, dead at 58. The next day, another call. Her friend Haydon, 51, was in the hospital. He died the following day. In the space of just five days, Lloyd-Jones lost three loved ones to Covid-19.                   One month on, the social care manager, who lives in London, has become a one-woman publicity machine for members of the Black community, encouraging everyone she knows to get vaccinated, so she won’t have to say goodbye to another friend or family member.                      “I have been agonizing about writing this message but have decided that this is what I have to do as a 59-year-old Black woman,” read the message she sent to everyone in her WhatsApp contact book. “I now believe we must do something to halt the devastation and loss.                 “I have decided to have the Covid-19 vaccine,” she wrote. “This was one of the hardest decisions I have made in my life.”                   Lloyd-Jones’s uncle died from coronavirus four days after the UK locked down last March, and the twin sister of her friend Annette, called Paulette, also lost her life in 2020. The twins are buried together. Yet Lloyd-Jones is far from being the only member of Britain’s Black community or other ethnic minorities to feel unsure about taking a Covid-19 shot.                 A report released by the UK Household Longitudinal Study earlier this year found that 72% of Black British respondents said they were unlikely or very unlikely to get a coronavirus vaccine.                  According to the same survey, those from Britain’s Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities were also hesitant, with 42% saying they were unlikely or very unlikely to get vaccinated.                       The data the report was based on was carried out in November, prior to any vaccines being approved, and those numbers are likely to have dipped in recent weeks, as the shots are rolled out with few, if any, reports of serious side effects.                      But Black people and those from minority groups are still thought to be less willing to get vaccinated than their White counterparts – a factor which concerns health authorities and community leaders alike.                   According to data from OpenSAFELY – an electronic platform from the UK’s National Health Service that documents coronavirus vaccine uptake – Black people over 80 were around half as likely to be vaccinated as their White counterparts, as of January 27.                  From the outset, it has been clear that people from ethnic minority backgrounds have been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19.                         According to the latest report from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), from October, Black men in England and Wales had the highest rate of death involving Covid-19, which was 2.7 times higher than White men. Women of Black Caribbean background had a death rate that was twice that of White women in England and Wales. Additionally, the ONS found that all ethnic minority groups, other than Chinese, were dying from Covid-19 at a disproportionately higher rate than the White population.                  Kamlesh Khunti, an expert in Black and minority healthcare at the UK’s University of Leicester, believes that – despite higher death rates – vaccine hesitancy in Black, Asian and other minority communities was predictable.                  “We should have prepared for this, since we have seen low uptakes in flu vaccinations among minority communities,” he told CNN. “People are concerned about the contents of the vaccine because of religious and cultural concerns.”                  Khunti said part of the problem was a lack of deliberate effort to reach out to people from minorities: “We don’t see the messaging coming down to the channels that most ethnic minorities listen to, especially in the languages they speak.”                    Other experts say skepticism around vaccines is down to a lack of trust in medical and governmental institutions – the roots of which can be traced back to colonialism and slavery.                     “People can’t disentangle where we are, in terms of medicine today, from the experimentation on colonized and indigenous people,” said Dr. Annabel Sowemimo, founder of the organization Decolonising Contraception, and author of the upcoming book “Decolonising Healthcare.”                   “People think that these behaviors in minority communities are irrational or erratic, but amongst the community it is well known that these things have happened,” Sowemimo said.                 For 40 years, from 1932 until 1972, the US Public Health Service conducted tests on hundreds of Black men with syphilis in Alabama. The men, many of whom were faculty and staff from Tuskegee Institute, were deliberately untreated to assess the progress of the disease.      Related articleNew data shows many Black Americans remain hesitant to get Covid-19 vaccine             According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the study became unethical in the 1940s when penicillin was recognized as the recommended drug for syphilis treatment. Penicillin was not offered to the subjects of the decades-long study.                 Ever since this incident researchers must get informed consent from all persons taking part in studies.                  In another case, the US-based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer paid compensation to the families of 11 children who died, and dozens more who were harmed, in Kano State, Nigeria, after some were given an experimental anti-meningitis drug, Trovan, during trials in 1996.                 The suit alleged that the drug company did not obtain parental consent and did not explain that the proposed treatment was experimental. The Nigerian government said the drug caused deaths and deformities among children and had been used without approval from Nigerian regulatory agencies. Pfizer maintained that the trial was conducted with the approval of the Nigerian government and consent of the participants’ parents or guardians.                    And there has been at least one suggestion to experiment on Black people during the current pandemic too.                   In April 2020, two French doctors – Dr. Jean-Paul Mira, head of ICU services at the Cochin hospital in Paris, and Camille Locht, research director at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research – suggested during a TV debate that Covid-19 vaccines should be tested in Africa. The pair later apologized after WHO’s Director-General condemned the remarks, calling them a “hangover from a colonial mentality.”                  These historical and modern injustices have fueled mistrust among some in Britain’s Black and minority communities.                     A lack of trust in public health providers was shown in a report by the UK’s Joint Committee on Human Rights, which found that more than 60% of Black people in the UK do not believe their health is as equally protected by the country’s National Health Service (NHS) compared to White people. Women (78%) are much more likely than men (47%) to feel that their health was not equally protected by the NHS compared to the White population, according to the research.                       “Health inequalities have been ignored for a significant amount of time and that breeds resentment,” Sowemimo said. “It appears to members of minority communities that the only reason they want to address it now is because a failure to take the vaccine impacts everyone.”        Related articleLatinos are navigating barriers to Covid-19 vaccinations and experts say it comes down to access             The speed of the vaccination’s development has also fueled misinformation about the coronavirus vaccine.                    “We need to counter misinformation with the facts as we know them in the various ways of communication at our disposal,” Dr. Tom Kenyon, chief health officer at the Project HOPE organization, told CNN. “Eventually, the facts will prevail and increased vaccination uptake will result.”      The British government has offered local councils in England more than £23 million ($31 million) to help fight misinformation around vaccines and encourage those from high-risk communities to take the shot.                 But many believe that vaccine hesitancy must be fought by empowering local and community voices.                  “I have people that I know who are suffering,” Lloyd-Jones told CNN. “The fact is, if we want things to move on in terms of how the vaccine is seen and received, the more people from Black and minority communities take the vaccine, the more it will spur others on to do it.”                  In more than 100 mosques across the UK, imams are delivering sermons aiming to reassure worshippers about the safety and legitimacy of Covid-19 vaccines, part of an initiative from the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (Minab).                  In his mosque in Leeds, northern England, imam and Minab chair Qari Asim told CNN he is working to spread the message because he doesn’t want to lose another community member to the virus.                  “We all have to play our part in this pandemic … I have attended so many funeral prayers and I see the trauma, pain [and] suffering that all of us have gone through. Now we see light in the darkest of moments and that light is the vaccine,” he said.                  Asim believes that the messenger is just as important as the message. He told CNN that due to a lack of trust in public institutions among the Muslim community, the information needs to come from trusted local experts, such as faith leaders or doctors.                  The imam says that misinformation is common and has found it is often younger generations that urge older relatives not to get a shot.                  “Among young people it’s a serious concern that they don’t trust the vaccine,” Asim explained. “With the elder generations, sometimes we feel there is a language or a culture barrier and the only source of information they have is their own family members.”                  The Minab initiative uses experts from varied scientific fields – from nanochip experts to fertility experts – from within the Muslim community. They address everything from common concerns, such as vaccine side-effects, to conspiracy theories around the shot.                  “In this pandemic, what has really come to the fore is love, compassion and being there for each other, so as an imam I feel I need to be there for my community to help them make the right choice,” Asim said.                  Vaccine hesitancy is not unique to minority communities in Britain.     A survey released on February 4 by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases found that more than half of Black adults in the United States remain hesitant to get a Covid-19 shot. The research found that only 49% of Black adults plan to get the vaccine with 19% of those people saying they will get it right away and 31% preferring to wait.                   The survey, which was conducted in December 2020, showed that older Black adults and men are more willing to get the Covid-19 vaccine than respondents in other groups.                  For example, 68% of adults age 60 and older said they planned to get the shot, while only 38% of Black adults age 18-44 planned to take it. Many of the younger respondents expressed distrust in the health care system saying it treats people unfairly based on race and ethnic background, according to the survey findings.                  On both sides of the Atlantic, experts say that authorities must work with community leaders to help build confidence in coronavirus vaccines.                 The Right Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, Britain’s first Black female bishop and an ambassador for the Your Neighbour campaign, a UK Church response to the pandemic, believes better representation is one of the best ways to encourage vaccine uptake in Black, Asian and other minority communities.                    “If they can begin showing Black people and Black people of note, Muslim people of note, taking the vaccine – as well as the ongoing message that we can keep one another safe – that would go a long way,” Hudson-Wilkin said.                      “There also has to be some recognition that in the past things have not been right and there has been a level of distrust,” she added.                      “But, as a people, if we are not showing any sense of care and responsibility for our own well-being, why should anyone else? We need to play our part, that is why it’s imperative we see people like us taking the vaccine.”       Salma Abdelaziz and Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Hathloul, 31, was arrested in a May 2018 sweep that targeted well-known opponents of the kingdom’s since-rescinded law barring women from driving. She told her family she had been tortured and sexually abused in prison – allegations Riyadh repeatedly denied – and her detention was condemned by the United Nations and global human rights groups.                  Last December, Riyadh’s Specialized Criminal Court – a terror tribunal – sentenced Hathloul to five years and eight months in prison, including a two-year and 10-month suspension, according to a statement released by her family. With the time she had already served, the sentencing paved the way for Hathloul’s release on Wednesday.                    Hathloul will remain on probation for three years following her release, during which time she could be arrested for any perceived illegal activity, the family said in a statement in December. She will also be banned from traveling for five years, they said.                  Hathloul’s release comes less than a week after the White House called on the kingdom to release political prisoners, including women’s rights activists. President Joe Biden has vowed to pressure Saudi Arabia into improving its rights record, marking a departure from former President Donald Trump’s reluctance to criticize the kingdom’s ramped up crackdown on dissent in recent years.                   “We’re excited (about her release), but the fight for justice is not over yet,” Hathloul’s brother, Walid al-Hathloul, told CNN before the announcement. “We would have to work very hard to secure justice for Loujain, but we’re very delighted for this news.”                 The family has urged people to refrain from saying that Hathloul has been “freed.”                 “Any release that does not include an independent investigation of the charges, does not include lifting the travel ban, does not include dropping the charges, is not freedom,” said Walid al-Hathloul. “Therefore we’re far away from justice.”      Loujain is at home !!!!!! تم الافراج عن لجين pic.twitter.com/fqug9VK6Mj             The terrorism court convicted Hathloul on charges of harming national security, seeking to change the Saudi political system, and using her relations with foreign governments and rights groups to “pressure the Kingdom to change its laws and systems,” according to a charge sheet her family published earlier in December.                 UN experts called the charges “spurious.” In a six-page charge sheet for Hathloul’s case, seen by CNN, a section entitled “crimes committed” includes activism against the kingdom’s restrictive male guardianship laws, along with contact with foreign journalists and diplomats.                  The charges also relied on a series of alleged confessions, according to the documents, which state that Hathloul admitted to applying for a job at the UN along with confessing to being in contact with the human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.                  For much of her imprisonment, Hathloul detailed her hardships to her parents during their prison visits. Those allegations were later made public by three of her siblings who live outside the kingdom, and were corroborated by the court testimony of other female activists.                   Hathloul said she was sexually assaulted and tortured while in detention, including waterboarding, flogging and electrocution, according to multiple statements released by her family and supporters.                  Saudi authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of torture and sexual abuse in their prisons.                 According to her family, Hathloul has twice gone on hunger strike – in protest at her prison conditions, and because she was denied communication with her relatives.       The @LoujainHathloul at home after 1001 days in prison pic.twitter.com/SIm274rAEw             A 2019 American Bar Association Center for Human Rights report said that although the Saudi terrorism court was created in 2008 to prosecute terrorism detainees, its “caseload was quickly expanded from alleged violent extremists to include political dissidents, religious minorities and human rights activists.” The report concluded that the court “routinely convicts individuals of terrorism charges without any meaningful evidence.”                  Earlier this week, a Saudi appeals court rejected Hathloul’s torture claims, the family said on Twitter.                  US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the release of Hathloul “would be a very welcome development.”                 Speaking at a State Department briefing, Price said the department had seen reports of her release from prison and noted that they “have watched this case very closely.” He declined to say whether Secretary of State Tony Blinken pressed the Saudis to release her during his call with the Saudi Foreign Minister last week.                 “In every relationship, whether it is one with our closest allies, our closest partners, and with our closest security partners, we will never check our values, we will never check our principles at the door,” he said.                 French President Emmanuel Macron added in a tweet: “I welcome the release of Loujain al-Hathloul and share the relief of her family.”                 During her detention, Hathloul received multiple awards, including the 2019 PEN America award. Two other women’s rights activists who were arrested alongside Hathloul – Nassima al-Sada and Maya’a al-Zahrani – remain in detention, according Amnesty International. Sada is also a PEN America award recipient.                 Hathloul’s siblings, who have been a driving force behind an international campaign for her release, posted a photo of their sister at home on Wednesday. “Oh mother, oh mother, this is the most beautiful day of my life.

Sign up for The Good Stuff, a newsletter for the good in life. It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.              The Harvard Law Review has elected Hassaan Shahawy, a Los Angeles born and bred Egyptian American, as the first Muslim president in its 134-year history.                 Jennifer Heath, the program administrator and information systems manager at the publication, confirmed that Shahawy is the first Muslim president.                  Founded in 1887 by future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, the Harvard Law Review is a student-edited law journal with the largest circulation of any law journal worldwide, according to Harvard University.                   A second-year law student at Harvard Law School, Shahawy first served as a general editor for the law review for six months before he decided to run for president this past January.       Related articleAmanda Gorman's journey to the inauguration and Super Bowl came with the help of a unique group of mentors             “It’s very humbling of course, to have a Muslim elected in a positive way,” Shahawy said. He noted that while he felt the change was symbolic that “doesn’t make a big difference to many people’s daily lives…[or] the bad policies or laws that make their lives challenging.                  “It can serve as a small start or indication of new direction that might be arising in American public discourse, and the increasing importance of diversity.”                 While Shahawy says he has the upmost respect for previous individuals who have held the position, such as former U.S. President Barack Obama, he says he is “almost equally impressed by the list of people who haven’t had this position.”                 He said his classmates who work with individuals in historically underserved communities to prevent evictions or to provide legal representation for incarcerated people are “more inspiring to [him] than the roster of past presidents.”                  Shahawy’s term began on January 30. When not serving as president, Shahawy says he tries to make sure he’s involved in the community, particularly in criminal justice reform.                 He currently works at the MacArthur Justice Center providinglegal representation to incarcerated individuals in criminal appeal cases. Shahawy’s passion for criminal justice reform stems from his experience as anundergraduate at Harvard, where he visited and worked with incarcerated individuals in local jails in Boston who were working to earn college credit.      Related articleMeet the man who created Black History Month             After graduating Harvardin 2016, Shahaway was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and majored in Oriental Studies and specialized in Islamic Law at Oxford University. He said his interest in law stems not only from his activism experience, but also from his passion for legal history.                  Shahawy says his background “informs [his] perspective on approaching debates with a big picture approach and looking at things broadly and how other nations around the world today and throughout history have answered questions.”                  He wants to bring that experience to his role as president and hopes people can “learn from each others’ diverse perspectives to have members and editors from different backgrounds (who can) represent their communities,” and to “maintain and enhance (our) vibrant community.”                   In the future, Shahawy says, “I can see myself being a law professor, one foot in academia and one foot in practice.”                   Shahawy’s election follows another historic election in 2017, when ImeIme Umana was named the law journal’s first Black woman president.

Insults were exchanged in the heat of the moment, he admits, but Farouq, a teenager, thought nothing of the exchange until he was summoned to the police station and charged with blasphemy against God.                 When word got out about the nature of his arrest, an angry mob descended on Farouq’s family home forcing his mother to flee to a neighboring village, his lawyer said.                 Farouq, who was then 16, was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labor by a Sharia court, in Kano, northern Nigeria.      Related articleThe WhatsApp voice note that led to a death sentence             However, his conviction was overturned on appeal by the Kano State High Court on January 22 because Farouq did not have legal representation at his first trial, his counsel Kola Alapinni told CNN.                  “I’m delighted, I’m in a joyous mood. And I’m grateful to all those who helped and lent support for this outcome with the grace of Allah,” Farouq, now 17, told CNN in his first interview following his release.                  Alapinni was instrumental in Farouq’s release from prison.                  His Foundation for Religious Freedom discovered and got involved in Farouq’s case while working on an appeal for Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, who was sentenced to death for blasphemy at the Kano Upper Sharia Court.             “We found out they were convicted on the same day, by the same judge, in the same court, for blasphemy and we found out no one was talking about Omar, so we had to move quickly to file an appeal for him,” he said.                 “Blasphemy is not recognized by Nigerian law. It is inconsistent with the constitution of Nigeria.”                 Kano’s High Court stated that Farouq’s conviction as a minor “was done in error and … is hereby set aside and the Defendant is hereby discharged and acquitted.”                  Farouq says he feels aggrieved as that the Sharia court was “unjust” to him.                  Officials for the Sharia court have not commented on Farouq’s case, and efforts to reach them have been unsuccessful. CNN also contacted Kano state government for comment but has yet to receive a response.                 In all, Farouq spent more than five months locked up without access to family or lawyers.                  His family said they were not informed about the details of his case and did not even know what date his court hearing was held.                 “They were not fair to us,” his uncle Umar Aliyu told CNN. “When they took this boy to court, they didn’t tell us the court they took him to… and they refused to tell us the date slated for the judgment. They kept chasing us away. I went to the Hisbah office pleading with the interrogator, but he told me to leave his office. I left hurt and close to tears, extremely sad.”      Related articleThe WhatsApp voice note that led to a death sentence             The family also found out from media reports that Farouq had been convicted and sentenced, Aliyu said.                  Aliyu recalls being “enveloped with sadness,” every time he thought about his nephew locked up with no contact with his family.                  “Everyone… was disturbed very much, we were really sad. We just had to console each other, counseling some to take it as something ordained by Allah… telling them to be patient. This provided some emotional relief.                 “For the period he was in prison every time I thought about him, I became worried. Every time I thought about him sadness would envelop me.”                 Now that Farouq has been freed, he says he is determined to finish his education and has ambitions to enter politics to fight against the kind of injustice he faced.                  “I pray Allah will bless me to become governor or President to reform the Sharia and to end the injustice on my fellow citizens and myself since in some court cases the offense doesn’t warrant the harsh judgment handed down. This is deprivation of your right, oppression, and abuse,” he said.                 Although his conviction was overturned, Farouq’s life remains in danger from some fanatics who see his release as an affront, according to his lawyer.                  Alapinni told CNN how terrified Farouq was when he turned up to meet him outside the prison when he was released.                 “He himself knows he is in danger because when we tried to pick him from prison…you could see the fear in his face, he didn’t even want to follow us…everybody had told him that if he steps out of the prison walls he will be killed,” Alapinni said.                 “We now need to arrange safe passage for him. His life is in danger in Kano – it will never be the same,” he said.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.              Extremism has a knack for metastasizing and coming back to wreak havoc upon its hosts. Once a cohort or society builds a hateful mindset, the hatred takes on a life of its own. Extremist ideology not only hurts a society’s enemies, but also eventually attacks from within and harms the society from which it originated. I first started observing this phenomenon abroad – and it saddens but does not surprise me that we are starting to see it haunt American democracy too.                 Consider how the kingdom of Saudi Arabia disseminated the Wahhabi sect’s fundamentalist attitudes against Jews and Christians at home and abroad. It helped to fund the madrassas that fostered the extreme perspectives that eventually contributed to the September 11th terror attacks on New York and Washington. Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden did not just seek to destroy Americans – he wanted to destroy all things Western. The great irony is that his unbridled hatred had also prompted him to attack the Saudi kingdom, too. Bin Laden’s extremist hunger was such that even the Saudi Wahhabis who helped inculcate his all-consuming intolerance could no longer prove pious enough in his eyes. His efforts to overthrow the Saudi monarchy launched an opposition movement that got him expelled from the country.                 In Israel too, the government has taken limited action to shut down the behavior of the so-called “hilltop youth,” extremist settlers who deem themselves highly religious despite not respecting the rabbis of the settlement. The lack of concerted effort to prevent and stop the group’s rock throwing and vandalism of Palestinian villages gave these fired-up youth permission to spiral out of control, eventually leading them to attack the Israeli army, too.                  Or take the Beitar Jerusalem Israeli football club, notorious for its long history of not putting Arab players on the field. The club’s most fanatical supporters finally became so extreme in their intolerance that Beitar Jerusalem’s 2013 signing of two Russian League players who happened to be Muslim led to protests and anti-Arab chants against the very club that fueled the fans’ racist fire. Arsonists set fire to the club’s offices two days after the signing. More recently,  some of the fans targeted a Christian player from Niger simply because his name, Ali Mohamed, sounded Muslim.     Related articleThe Capitol attack was White supremacy, plain and simple             I recall a time in Germany, riding in a car with a German woman who was an authentic supporter of the OneVoice Movement I founded to foster Arab-Israeli understanding. She made a point of vehemently – and sincerely – condemning racism against Jews, but minutes later cursed out another driver and justified her tirade by casting slurs on Polish immigrants. She had superficially learned that the Holocaust was bad but had not internalized the dangers of bigotry against any group. If Polish people were not immune to her racism, to what other target would her hatred attach next?                  While Germany has done a better job than many other nations to take concerted actions (like making Holocaust denial illegal) to discourage anti-Semitism, it is also experiencing a surge in neo-Nazism, particularly against Turkish immigrants. All nations are challenged to address the intolerant mindset at the root of racism; otherwise that intolerance eventually resurfaces and comes back to haunt us.                 Here in the United States, there are Republican legislators and anchors on Fox News who have willingly participated in race-baiting and birtherism for years, even before President Trump hijacked the Republican Party. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has looked the other way for close to five years as Trump incites violence and sows mistrust in our system. And Wednesday morning, rather than lead with truth, Senator Ted Cruz gave contorted explanations for why he – along with several other Republican senators and 121 House Representatives – would indulge Trump’s fabricated and fraudulent fantasies by objecting to certify the election results. Then came the insurrection. Mobs of Trump supporters, hopped up on Trump’s conspiracy theory of a stolen election and encouraged to go to the Capitol by the President himself, stormed and vandalized our nation’s Capitol building.      Related articleHow Americans can hold Trump accountable if Congress won't             It was the disturbing culmination of a months-long series of attempts by Trump to bully state officials into “finding” votes that would help him win the 2020 presidential election, as almost all Republican “leaders” stood by with stunning silence – though elections officials in Georgia, headed by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, stood up for truth against pressure from Trump. To his credit, earlier on Wednesday, Mitch McConnell had sought to affirm that “the voters, the courts, and the States have all spoken” and that it was time for Trump to concede. But it was too little too late. McConnell himself  stood by while the seeds of extremism were planted, leading to – in his words – “the unhinged crowd,” or, in other words, the domestic terrorists who came for him and his fellow legislators.                 When thinking turns extreme, there is little room for nuance or aberration from the narrow mindset deemed acceptable. People become programmed to hear what they want to hear and tortured by cognitive dissonance when their own dogma does not stand to reason. When groups become so extreme in their thinking that they fail to realize the merits of an opinion from outside their “tribe” or when partisan fealty fuses into one’s identity, one’s values ultimately suffer.                  Trump and a small subgroup of his most radicalized and violent supporters, who include White supremacists and Neo-Nazis, are responsible for this dark chapter. Nothing can justify their sedition. But beyond this specific situation, it would be simplistic to believe that extreme ways of thinking reside exclusively within the right. All extremes are bound together by their intolerance for “the other.” The far-left’s tendency to call others out and automatically cast judgment harms all of society by stifling the critical thinking, nuanced debate, and exchange of differing ideas that lead to progress – the very progress for which progressives advocate. If  people feel “cancelled” or too intimidated to speak up, their repressed feelings are more likely to fester under the surface and emerge later in a more extreme form. The gap between both sides grows, leaving a vacuum of misunderstanding and division.

For society at large, independent thinking and even avoiding partisan fanaticism can be antidotes to unruly tribalism in the future. Embracing the middle space characterized by critical thinking and nuance gives us a pathway for avoiding absolutist and hateful thinking that preys on societies from both the outside and within.

But at the conclusion of an internal review that took more than two months, the Times said the episodes about Chaudhry fell apart under scrutiny.                 The Times said it “found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the ‘Caliphate’ podcast,” according to an editor’s note that was appended on Friday to the podcast’s page on the Times’ website.                  The Times kicked off its investigation after Canadian police charged Chaudhry in September with “Hoax-Terrorist activity” in relation to interviews published by “multiple media outlets,” according to a police news release.                 Despite the misrepresentations and lack of corroboration, The Times is not removing “Caliphate” from its website or podcast apps. In addition to the editors’ note posted online, The Times is affixing audio corrections to the episodes and releasing an episode about the corrections. The paper also published a fuller account on Friday on what it learned about Chaudhry. The four-byline story described him as “a fabulist who spun jihadist tales about killing for the Islamic State in Syria, Canadian and American intelligence and law enforcement officials contend.”                  The editors’ note said the Times “discovered significant falsehoods and other discrepancies” in Chaudhry’s story during the course of reporting and took steps to confirm his account. The Times decided to “proceed with the project” but to include an episode dedicated to the fact checking process and highlighting what they called “major discrepancies.”                 The Times’ media critic Ben Smith reported in October that there had been concerns about the podcast before its publication.                  “Caliphate” won the 2018 Peabody in the radio/podcast category, a prestigious journalism award. It also was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. These were marks of success for The Times’ growing investment in audio, led by the team behind its daily news podcast, “The Daily.”             Rukmini Callimachi, a Times correspondent who hosted the podcast, will remain at the paper and but will be reassigned.                 “She’s going to take on a new beat, and she and I are discussing possibilities,” said Dean Baquet, executive editor of The Times. “I think it’s hard to continue covering terrorism after what happened with this story.

Writing for an 8-0 court, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed in 1993 to prohibit the federal government from imposing substantial burdens on religious exercise without a compelling interest, allows the suits against the individual agents.                 “The question here,” Thomas wrote, “is whether that includes claims for money damages against Government officials in their individual capacities. We hold that it does.”     Related articleSamuel Alito's viral speech signals where conservative Supreme Court is headed             The unusual case featured strange bedfellows, pitting the Trump administration against supporters of religious liberty.                 Unlike other recent cases before the high court, the Trump administration weighed in against claims of religious freedom arguing that the law at issue was never meant to allow government officials to be sued for damages in their individual capacity. But supporters of the men, including the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, sought to broaden the reach of the law. The case comes as the federal government has cracked down on mass protests, the President has emphasized the importance of law and order, and some critics say there is a need for greater accountability from law enforcement.                 The dispute arose in 2013, when Muhammad Tanzir, Jameel Algibhah and Naveed Shinwari said they were asked by the FBI to become informants for the government in terrorism-related investigations. The men claim they declined – citing their religious beliefs – and their reluctance to spy on their community. They allege that they were retaliated against and put on the watchlist for people who are prohibited from boarding aircraft that originate from, terminate in, or pass over the United States. Even after they were removed from the list, their lawyers sought to sue the individual agents for damages citing the federal law.                 “An individual whose religious exercise has been substantially burdened by a federal official,” lawyer Ramzi Kassem of the City University of New York School of Law argued, “may sue that person in their individual capacity for damages.”                 A lower court ruled in their favor allowing the law suit to move forward. The Justice Department appealed the case to the Supreme Court.                 The  Justice Department told the justices that a decision allowing damage awards against the federal employees could chill their ability to do their job and “raise sensitive separation of powers concerns”  potentially preventing government officials from “devoting the time and effort required for the proper discharge of duties.”                 “Even well-intentioned federal employees would thus be forced to navigate a minefield of liability that would be difficult to predict or avoid,” Deputy Solicitor General Edwin S. Kneedler, said in court papers.                 “We are thrilled that the Supreme Court justices were unanimous in their agreement that our clients can seek repair for the harms that they experienced at the hands of these agents for refusing to spy on their Muslim communities,” said Diala Shamas, an attorney for the three men. “I hope that this serves as a reminder that religious protections apply equally to Muslim communities, who are all too often targeted by law enforcement for surveillance and harassment.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

But will tourists want to visit?,Five years of social reform driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have drastically loosened the conservative grip on Saudi society. CNN’s Nic Robertson says it could yet prove to be a magnet for tourism.,"Dec 5, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Nic Robertson,International,"I’ve been visiting Saudi Arabia for close to two decades and in that time I’ve experienced some incredible things.                  I’ve climbed the scarily steep and staggeringly beautiful mountains of the south. I’ve scuba dived the immaculate Red Sea coral reefs off Saudi’s western coast. I’ve driven rally cars over the dunes in the north. I’ve visited ancient wells. Spent freezing winter nights in the desert cooking food with red hot fire embers buried in the sand. And I’ve walked barefoot along the kingdom’s eastern shores on sweltering summer evenings.                 I’ve flown in flimsy microlights, soaring serenely above rich farmland. I’ve ridden tactical combat helicopters missions, skimming the desert floor and banking hard around sand dunes.                 Yet none of these has affected me as much as the moment I felt Saudi change.     New subterranean resort to be built below the Al-Ula desert in Saudi Arabia             It’s no exaggeration to say that the recent social upheaval in the country has been profound and fast.                 In 2018, I was in downtown Riyadh, chatting to people at a near-empty outdoor cafe in the early evening.                  The religious police, once widely feared and respected, arrived by car, stopped at the roadside and started telling people to go to prayers.                  Previously, this would’ve prompted an immediate reaction, with people obeying their commands.                  This time, no one moved.                 It was in that moment I connected with what Saudis had been feeling in the months since Mohammed bin Salman or MBS, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, stripped these morality guardians of their power.                 It was a sense of lightness, a freedom to make choices.                 That was two years ago. These days the religious police have mostly been consigned to desk duties. Decades of oppressive psychological pressure to conform to the conservative strictures of Islam have fallen away.                 And today, freedom is blossoming, albeit still controlled by the invisible lines of most Gulf states: enjoy, have fun but don’t get ahead of the leadership.                  Outdoor cafes along new festive looking pavements are abuzz with men and women out for fun, to meet, to shop, to chat, to relax.                 Mounira Al-Qwait, a 20-year-old fashion designer wearing a traditional black abaya she styled herself, told me what this means for her.                  “We have more fun now.. going outside for movies, going outside for the restaurants and meeting with friends,” she says, her eyes sparkling above a face-covering niqab.                  Nearby, fashionably dressed without a headscarf (an omission enough to get her pulled off the street a few years ago), is Tutu, a 42-year-old kindergarten teacher. She told me she loved the sense of “freedom” and “more energy.”                 “Now our lives as Saudis completely changed,” she says. “Actually from all the decisions taken by Mohammed bin Salman. All Saudis now is happy about all these changes.”                 I was in town this time covering the global economic powers’ G20 summit. Saudis were the hosts of the November 21-22 meeting – a massive responsibility and challenge.                 After it wrapped, I watched Finance Minister Mohammed al Jadaan lavish praise on his youthful team. The “wealth of the nation,” he concluded later.                 His offices in the new Digital City district of Riyadh – a futuristic complex of buildings interwoven with cascading water fountains and open, airy pedestrian spaces – feels more like Dubai than the dusty Riyadh of old.                 Here change is abundant. Women work in offices side by side with men, something that was illegal until a few years ago.                 Talia, 27, is one of them.                  Raised in Riyadh by her single mom, she graduated from universities in both London and Beirut before returning in 2017 when the reforms began. “It was like weekly, almost daily, like there’s new announcements on the news coming and it was so exciting,” she told me.                 Since then she’s worked with female CEOs and sees no limit to what women can achieve.                 “We have a youthful crown prince and the country is youthful – like 70% of the population is under 30 – so I felt like the reforms were being made by us for us, so there’s no way that we’re going to go back.”                 One of the chief reasons for the social upheaval in Saudi Arabia is MBS’s decision to challenge the clerics who’d given rise to the generations of orthodoxy, producing Osama Bin Laden, al Qaeda, and almost all of the September 11, 2001 attack hijackers.                 MBS’s father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud is the latest in a long, ossifying line of leadership that passed from the nation’s founder King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman al Saud to his increasingly aged sons.                 It took Abdulaziz 30 years to conquer the country’s four geographically distinct regions – Asir in the south, Al-Ahsa in the east, Hejaz in the west, and Najd in the center – and establish the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on September 23, 1932.                 It’s taken MBS fewer than five years to shake up the kingdom in a way his predecessors dared not, along the way arresting and detaining more 200 princes and businessmen he accused of corruption.                 His vision of changing Saudi Arabia by 2030 demands a diversified economy and empowerment of the young.                 Ministers describe him as a tough taskmaster who will listen but won’t tolerate dissent once a decision is taken, or any failure to deliver on reforms he wants.                 At Masmak Fort in Riyadh’s old quarter where in 1902 Abdulaziz began his campaign to build a kingdom under his control, a metal spear tip protruding from the ancient wooden gates is testament to the forcefulness of his historic actions.                 MBS’s vision is no less robust. Human rights activists have been jailed, dissenters including journalist Jamal Khashoggi brutally murdered, yet MBS has such support for what he has done that so far the young seem OK with it.                 “It’s an important [topic] that has been discussed all over the world,” Mohammed al-Ajwi, a 26-year-old accountant told me, referring to the killing of Khashoggi, which was eventually blamed by Saudi authorities on rogue operators within MBS’s inner circle. The crown prince has denied personal involvement in the killing, while US and other foreign intelligence agencies have assessed that he ordered it.                   But al-Ajwi adds: “The government already said what they have and it was a clear answer for us the people of Saudi Arabia. So it was a mistake by a few people. That’s it for us.”                 From Masmak Fort, a busy six-lane highway now runs to Digital City and a financial district where new eye-catching buildings are appearing all the time. When I first came to the kingdom in 2003, Riyadh had only two towers. Now there are dozens.      Can Saudi Arabia rebrand itself as a tourism hotspot?             Yet leave the city and, in the harsh deserts of the Nejd region that surrounds it, you can still find the Saudi Arabia of the past.                  White royal camels are tended on old farms. Beautiful lush grassed oases add intense doses of color. On rocky outcrops, ancient natural water cisterns vital for generations of herders are still in use.                 I’ve been lucky to see all of this thanks to my job, but it’s about to get easier for everyone.                  Last year, as part of his vision to diversify Saudi Arabia’s oil-dependent economy by 2030, MBS announced opening the kingdom’s doors to tourism.                 Unexpectedly, it had a remarkable boom this year.                 When the kingdom shuttered its borders because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Saudis went on vacation in their backyard. The country’s regions are so diverse, and the country so big, that it’s possible even for locals to feel they’re taking a break a long way from home.                  Away from Nejd, there’s coastal Hejaz, home to Islam’s holiest sites of Mecca and Medina, which were already cosmopolitan and relaxed due to the influx of centuries of pilgrims.                  Here, windows on upper floors of old homes jut into the street allowing cooling sea breezes to waft through rooms and inner courtyards, circulating over cool, refreshing pools.                 To sit inside one of these modest houses is a treat I’ll never forget, a chance to relax away from cares and troubles outside.                 To the south, Asir’s mountain peaks get snow in the winter, giving them an Alpine feel. In the summer they still offer a little respite from scorching deserts.                  In the east where pan-flat desert meets the Persian Gulf, date orchards proliferate above an even more valuable commodity, the kingdom’s oil.                 But the best treat to lure tourists is one I’ve yet to see – Hegra.                 The site, sometimes known as Mada’in Salih, or Al-Ḥijr  in the western Hejaz region was settled in the first century CE by Nabateans who carved great buildings into the rocks and left rock writings. It’s a site to rival Petra in neighboring Jordan, which was also built by Nabateans.                   While Petra draws thousands upon thousands of tourists a year, Hegra is still uncrowded.                  That could all soon change though.                  And if MBS’s promises hold longer than a shimmering desert mirage, as the kingdom’s young population fervently believe, the world will find much worth discovering.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The 21-year-old student was arrested on Wednesday in Uttar Pradesh, only days after the state enacted the law targeting “love jihad” – a term used by radical Hindu groups who accuse Muslim men of attempting to convert women of other faiths to Islam.                 Uttar Pradesh enacted the anti-conversion law, which makes “forced” or “fraudulent” religious conversions a non-bailable offense with a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison, on Saturday.                 According to the law, a marriage will be declared “null and void” if the conversion of the woman is solely for that purpose. Those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to top district authorities.      Related article'Love jihad': Indian states want to pass laws to prevent interfaith marriages. The move is unconstitutional and misogynistic             The same day the law came into effect, a man named Tikaram Rathone filed a report to police, alleging the male student was trying to coerce his 20-year-old Hindu daughter, who is married, to convert to Islam and marry him.                  Rathore alleged the man had developed a friendship with his daughter at school, and wanted to “coerce, coax and allure” her into converting.                  “Despite constant disapproval from me and my family, he (the accused) is putting pressure on us through abuse and death threats,” Rathore said in his complaint.                  Police in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district confirmed via Facebook that the man was arrested on Wednesday.                 Critics have called the law Islamophobic, unconstitutional, and regressive. Many are concerned it will lead to misuse and harassment, and that the law will make it increasingly difficult for interfaith couples to marry in the country.                 Other states – including Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, and Assam – have announced plans to follow Uttar Pradesh and introduce similar laws.                  All five states are governed by the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has faced accusations of perpetuating anti-Muslim sentiment.     Related articleNetflix faces boycott calls in India over 'A Suitable Boy' kissing scene             The BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has come under fire for similar laws before. Last year, the BJP-ruled state of Himachal Pradesh amended its anti-conversion law, prohibiting conversion by misrepresentation, force, fraud, undue influence, coercion, allurement or marriage. It also introduced non-bailable jail sentences for the offense.                 Critics of the BJP say religious polarization has increased since Modi swept into power in 2014. Hindu-Muslim marriages have long attracted controversy in India – but tensions have ratcheted up lately, with the concept of “love jihad” dominating headlines in recent months.                 In October, the popular jewelry brand Tanishq ran an advertisement featuring an interfaith couple – a Hindu woman and a Muslim man. After right-wing Indians accused them of promoting “love jihad” and trolled them heavily online, the company pulled the ad, saying it feared for the “well being” of its employees.                 In November, authorities accused Netflix of doing the same, after its TV series “A Suitable Boy” featured a scene in which a Hindu woman and a Muslim man share a kiss in front of a Hindu temple. Narottam Mishra, BJP member and home minister of Madhya Pradesh state, said the scene hurt “religious sentiments” and directed officials to look into legal action against the series’ producer and director.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.             Daily, being a woman in India feels like an achievement. If friends and relatives don’t concern themselves with who my significant other is, it seems the state does.                 Currently, marriage laws between India’s majority Hindu population and minority Muslims are being drafted in five states, all of which are led by the right-wing, Hindu nationalist, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).                 All of them seek to ban something that doesn’t actually exist: “love jihad,” an Islamophobic term referring to a purported phenomenon in which Muslim men marry women of other faiths — especially Hindu women — to convert them to Islam. Some right-wing Hindus claim that this alleged “conversion” results in a threat to women’s safety, citing tragedies like the reported murder of a Hindu woman last month by a young Muslim man as proof of “love jihad.” (In addition to murder, authorities have charged the young man with attempting to abduct the young woman to seek to compel her to marry him, The Indian Express reported; they noted he abducted her once before, in 2018.)     Related articleNetflix faces boycott calls in India over 'A Suitable Boy' kissing scene             In Uttar Pradesh, authorities have just brought charges under one of these laws for the first time, accusing a male college student of threatening to kidnap a young woman and of trying to force her to convert to Islam, The Times of India reports. Despite this case, as the push for these new laws unfolded, the Hindu-nationalist BJP had admitted in Parliament that no case of “love jihad” had ever been identified.                 As troubling as it is that an ethnonationalist conspiracy theory seems to have taken hold, the motivation behind it also ignores women as individuals, painting them as naive and incapable of thinking for themselves or making their own decisions.                 Since its independence, India has seen religious animosity between its Hindu and Muslim communities. Starting with its partition from Pakistan, an Islamic republic, however, India has maintained, constitutionally, that it is a secular democracy. The topic of “love jihad” was revived in the national conversation on Oct. 9 after Tanishq, a jewelry company, was accused of “glorifying” Hindu-Muslim marriages, and subsequently “love jihad,” in an ad. The ad was heavily trolled on social media, with right-wing Hindu fundamentalists promising to “boycott” the company. Eventually, the company pulled the ad, saying it feared for the “well being” of its employees.                 Since then, BJP state leaders have chimed in, proposing laws that would ban the practice of “love jihad,” mandating government permission for recent religious converts to marry.                 The government will “work to curb ‘love-jihad,’” said Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, on Oct. 31, adding, “We’ll make a law.” BJP politicians in the states of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam followed suit, pushing similar proposals.     On Nov. 24, the Uttar Pradesh government cleared an ordinance to check “unlawful conversions,” saying that, in “cases of forced mass conversions,” it would enforce a jail term of three to 10 years with a penalty of up to Rs. 50,000 ($675) for mass conversions, The Hindu reported; where women converted just for the purpose of marriage, marriages would be invalidated. “If a person wants to perform marriage after converting into any other religion, they will need to take permission from the district magistrate two months before marriage,” said state Cabinet Minister Siddharth Nath Singh.                 I cannot help but see a double standard at play here, given the real issues that surround marriage in India. Arranged marriages, which still dominate, work to ensure that inter-caste unions are prevented. Child marriage is illegal in India, with the marriageable age being 18, but the country has the highest total number of child brides globally, according to the civil-society partnership Girls Not Brides. Nearly 27% of women ages 20 to 24 reported having been married before their 18th birthday, according to a 2015-16 survey by the Indian government.     Related articleIndian jewelry brand pulls commercial featuring interfaith couple following backlash             And yet, “love jihad” laws are being pushed by a government seen by some as striving toward a “Hindu rashtra,” or Hindu nation-state.                 The right to marry is a part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, as affirmed by India’s Supreme Court in 2018. The right to marriage is also stated under the United Nations’ Universal Declaration on Human Rights, of which India is a signatory and which calls for a “free and full choice” in decisions on when and whom to marry.                 It’s 2020, and rather than shedding our oppressive, archaic ideas about marriages based on caste, or progressing toward giving everyone — including the LGBTQIA+ community — the right to marry, we’re degenerating as a nation. This is a country in which victim blaming is prevalent in cases of sexual violence and assault, and in which one minister now keen to pass laws on “love jihad” alleged that conspirators were fomenting the riots that unfolded after the rape and murder in September of a 19-year-old Dalit woman.     In February this year, the BJP’s own junior home minister, G. Kishan Reddy, said in Parliament: “The term ‘love jihad’ is not defined under law. Article 25 of the Constitution provides for freedom to freely profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health.” And while Indians, and Indian women, can find comfort in court rulings like the recent Allahabad High Court’s quashing of a formal complaint that accused a Muslim man of abducting and forcibly marrying a Hindu woman after converting her to Islam (the ruling categorically stated that “two adults are free to choose their partner”), this law, like others, first and foremost serves those on a quest to build a Hindu nation-state. It ignores India’s constitution.                  Violent crimes against women are concerning. Yet, when we talk about “love jihad” laws, we’re not talking about women’s safety — rather, we’re talking about taking away a woman’s right to choose her spouse. We’re talking about communalizing a marriage, distilling it into the faiths of the respective parties, rather than looking at two adults as individuals.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

The court instead referred the case to the Specialized Criminal Court for terrorism and national security cases, according to a statement from her family and supporters, sent to CNN.                 The case of another women’s rights activist, Samar Badawi, has also been referred to the special court. Three others – Nassima al-Sada, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahrani – remain in detention, according to human rights group Amnesty International.              “We remain deeply concerned by the continued detention of at least five women’s right activists in Saudi Arabia. We regret that the cases of Loujain Al-Hathloul and Samar Badawi have now been referred to the Special Criminal Court for terrorism and national security cases,” human rights ambassadors for the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Estonia, Luxembourg and Finland said in a statement.                 Hathloul, 31, was jailed in May 2018 during a sweep that targeted prominent opponents of the kingdom’s former law barring women from driving. The crackdown happened just weeks before the ban was lifted, casting doubt on a reform agenda put forward by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.                 The court she appeared in on Wednesday said it would investigate Hathloul’s allegations of torture in prison, according to the family’s statement. Saudi authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of torture and sexual abuse in their prisons. A new trial date hasn’t been announced yet.        Badawi had also campaigned against the driving ban and against the imprisonment of her former husband, rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair, as well as her brother, blogger Raif Badawi.                  “Peaceful activism, and advocating for women’s rights is not a crime. Human rights defenders can be a strong partner for governments in addressing concerns within society,” the ambassadors said.                 “We join the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Special Rapporteurs and Treaty Bodies in reiterating our call for the release of all political detainees, including the women’s rights activists.”                 CNN has reached out to the Saudi government for a response.      Related videoCNN reporter: Trump seemed like an outsider at G20 summit             In an interview with CNN’s Nic Robertson earlier this month, Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Jubeir said Hathloul’s case “was up to the courts” and that “she’s on trial for matters related to national security.”                 An Amnesty International representative for the Middle East, Lynn Maalouf, said the Specialized Criminal Court was “an institution used to silence dissent and notorious for issuing lengthy prison sentences following seriously flawed trials.”                 “This is yet another sign that Saudi Arabia’s claims of reform on human rights are a farce,” Maalouf said.              In a six-page charge sheet for Hathloul’s case, seen by CNN, a section entitled “crimes committed” included activism against the kingdom’s restrictive male guardianship laws, along with contact with foreign journalists and diplomats.                 Chairman of US House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff called on Saturday for Hathloul’s immediate release, saying on Twitter she had “endured torture and abuse for over 2 years while detained.”                  On Thursday, the US Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs said it was “concerned” by reports that the cases of Hathloul and Badawi had been transferred to the terrorism court.                  “Activism on behalf of (women’s) rights is not a crime. Also troubled by allegations of abuse against them & a lack of transparency/access to the trials,” the bureau’s press office wrote on Twitter.                  The statement from Hathloul’s family and supporters said she had started a second hunger strike on October 26 in protest of her prison conditions and because she was denied communication with her relatives.                 The statement said she was forced to halt her strike after two weeks as authorities woke her up multiple times during the night, causing her to feel exhausted.                 The statement said she looked “weak in court, that her body was shaking uncontrollably and that her voice was faint and shaky.”                  Her sister, Lina al-Hathloul, said that she and her family had received no updates on Hathloul since she began her hunger strike until Tuesday, the day before she was due to appear in court.                 “And during this time the Saudi government, instead of responding to our repeated inquiries on Loujain’s health, they have blocked our requests and denied us access to Loujain,” she said in the statement.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Aden, the first model to wear a hijab and burkini in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, posted a series of Instagram Stories describing the difficulties she has faced in the “toxic mess called fashion.” In the posts, she recounted skipping prayers, wearing clothes she wasn’t comfortable in and styling her hijab in ways she felt betrayed her values.     Halima Aden becomes first model to wear hijab and burkini in Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue             “They could call me tomorrow and not even for $10 million would I ever risk compromising my hijab ever again,” she wrote. Aden also pledged to never take part in runway shows or travel for fashion months again, adding that “that’s where all the bad energy came from.”                 Aden, who lived in a Kenyan refugee camp before moving to the United States, has broken numerous boundaries in her modeling career. She was the first hijab-wearing woman to appear on the cover of British Vogue and was part of Vogue Arabia’s first group hijabi cover.                 But her work, and the excitement of being labeled a trailblazer, caused her to lose sight of her beliefs, she said. Aden’s mother had long encouraged her to walk away – but it wasn’t until the Covid-19 pandemic, which prompted the model to stay home and take a break from the industry, that she “finally realized where I went wrong,” she wrote.                 Among the campaigns she expressed regret over was a photo shoot for American Eagle’s first-ever denim hijab. “Why did I allow them to put jeans on my head when at the time I had only ever worn skirts and long dresses?” she wrote, explaining that “I was just so desperate back then for any ‘representation’ that I lost touch with who I was.”     Halima Aden: Vogue hijabi cover star on growing up in a refugee camp             Aden also posted an image from a photo shoot for Glamour magazine in 2017 showing her with a green wrap under her hijab and feathers around her neck. “I went back to my hotel room and just sobbed after this shoot because deep down I knew this wasn’t it. But was too scared to speak up,” she wrote. “Also very common struggle when you are the FIRST to do something.”                 American Eagle and Glamour did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.                 She also pointed to numerous other photo shoots where, though her head was covered, the scarf didn’t cover her chest or was styled in a way that hid it from view. These photo shoots were “essentially erasing my hijab completely,” she said.                 Despite her regrets, Aden pointed to a number of photo shoots that she felt were carried out respectfully, like the Vogue Arabia cover shot alongside two other black hijab-wearing models, Ikram Abdi Omar and Amina Adan.                 And she isn’t walking away from fashion entirely, she said, but rather laying out conditions for those hoping to hire her.     Why mainstream brands are embracing modest fashion             “If my hijab can’t be this visible – I’m not showing up,” she wrote under a photo of her in a full unadorned hijab that covered her chest and shoulders. Under another photo, showing her full hijab, scarf and covered chest and shoulders, she wrote, “This is the standard moving forward if you want to work with me. Come correct or don’t come at all. Nothing less, nothing more.”                 “These spaces were always predominantly white,” she added. “So you are already at a disadvantage for simply being YOU in a workplace that never considered someone of your background. We can’t give up, but it’s good to remain mindful.”                 Her announcement was met with support and praise from celebrities including Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. “Proud of you for staying true to your integrity,” supermodel Naomi Campbell wrote under Aden’s most recent Instagram post. “You are true light and joy since knowing you. And I hope our paths will cross in another capacity, keep rising and shining.”                 Aden, who is Somali-American, was born and raised in Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp, before moving with her family to the US in 2004 at the age of 7. After a decade-long vetting process, her family resettled in St. Louis, Missouri.     Contestant Halima Aden wears hijab, burkini to inspire others             Until her family made its way to St. Cloud, Minnesota, Aden said she had difficulty adjusting to her new life in the US and longed for her home in Kakuma. However, her life changed in 2016 when she became the first contestant to wear a hijab and a burkini at the Miss Minnesota USA pageant. Aden went on to reach the semi-finals of the competition.                 “There are so many Muslim women that feel like they don’t fit society’s standard of beauty,” she told CNN in 2018. “I just wanted to tell them it’s OK to be different, being different is beautiful, too.”     Halima Aden did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/25/asia/china-foreign-religion-christianity-islam-intl-hnk/index.html,China mulls new rules on foreigners to ‘prohibit religious extremism’,Foreign religious groups and worshipers could be the latest targets of a growing crackdown on organized religion in China under President Xi Jinping.,"Nov 26, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,James Griffiths,International,"Foreign religious groups and worshipers could be the latest targets of a growing crackdown on organized religion in China under President Xi Jinping.                  Draft rules published this week by the Ministry of Justice call for new restrictions on how foreign worshipers operate in order to prevent the spreading of “religious extremism,” or use of religion “to undermine China’s national or ethnic unity.”                  The rules, currently open to public feedback but unlikely to change significantly from their current form, are just the latest move to control religious practice under Xi, who has repeatedly called for the “sinicization” of religion.                 Xi has overseen a major clampdown on Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the western region of Xinjiang, where some 2 million Uyghurs and other minorities have passed through “reeducation camps” according to rights groups, as well as campaigns targeting Christian groups and Tibetan Buddhists.                  Religion has always occupied a peculiar position in the People’s Republic of China. Officially an atheist state, the Communist government nonetheless licenses five official faiths, and effectively decides on matters such as the ordination of bishops and reincarnation.                  Those faiths – Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism – are supervised by official organizations such as the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement or the Buddhist Association of China, which are in turn overseen by the ruling Communist Party’s powerful United Front Work Department. Practice outside the bounds of these groups is strictly controlled, and underground churches, sects and even private religious study groups are periodically cracked down upon.                  For foreigners, there is generally more freedom, provided they avoid anything that smacks of proselytisation. Many faiths not officially recognized by the government – Mormonism, Judaism, Quakers – are able to operate in China, provided the only worshippers are foreign citizens.      Related articleThis US church with expansion in its DNA wants to open a temple in China              Sensitivity over foreign religious groups remains strong, however. In a 2018 white paper on religion, the Chinese government noted that certain faiths had “long been controlled and utilized by colonialists and imperialists.”                  Though the draft rules affirm China’s commitment to respecting “the freedom of religious belief of foreigners,” the list of potential new restrictions and requirements could make practicing that belief far more difficult.                  In particular, the draft rules include a list of activities that foreigners should not conduct within China, such as “interfering with or dominating the affairs of Chinese religious groups,” advocating “extremist religious thoughts,” using religion to conduct terrorist activities, or “interfering with the appointment or management of Chinese clergy members.”                  The last point appears aimed at the Vatican, with whom China has a longstanding dispute over the appointment of bishops by the official Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Beijing insists on having the final say on all bishop appointments in mainland China, while the Holy See maintains that only the Pope has such authority.                 The two sides struck a secretive and hugely controversial deal in 2018, which was extended for another two years this October, but talks on a more permanent arrangement appear to have stalled. In a book published this week, Pope Francis referred to Uyghurs as a “persecuted people” for the first time, a phrase that angered Beijing.                 “What Pope Francis said about the Uyghurs is totally groundless,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a regular briefing Tuesday. “There are 56 ethnic groups in China, and the Uyghur ethnic group is an equal member of the big family of the Chinese nation.”                 “The Chinese government has always treated the minority groups equally and protected their legitimate rights and interests,” Zhao added.                 Other parts of the draft rules seem to target Islamic groups, which have come under immense pressure in recent years, both in Xinjiang and across China, where there are an estimated 23 million known Muslims, according to the most recent census data.     In an article that explicitly linked the new rules with recent acts of Islamic extremism in Europe, the state-backed Global Times quoted a former top religious official as saying the proposed regulations show “China’s swift response to the growing global challenge – the threat of religious extremism to political stability, and the social panic and disorder caused by religious extremism.”                  Rian Thum, an expert on Islam in China at the University of Nottingham, said the rules reflect a “longstanding fear of foreign pollution, which has become more important in the current climate.”                  “I was struck by the repeated use of the phrase ‘China’s religious independence,’ which points to the nationalist desire to purify religions of ‘foreign’ influences,” he said. “The regulations look like an effort to seal off Chinese religious practitioners from their fellow believers outside the country. Even lectures by visiting religious figures would require a bureaucratic permissions process that would dissuade most visitors.”                  Under Xi’s push to “sinicize” religions in the country, places of worship have been stripped of overtly religious symbols and iconography, Muslim graveyards and mosques have been destroyed, and Xi’s image has been hung up in religious buildings. According to a recent analysis by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), around one in three mosques in Xinjiang have been demolished, mostly since 2017.      Speaking last week, a spokesman for the Xinjiang government said reports about the destruction of mosques and other religious sites were “completely untrue.”                  For all the government’s talk of sinicizing Islam, most Muslims in China practice a domestic version of the faith, said Alkan Akad, a China researcher at Amnesty International, in mosques that are often more Chinese in style than Islamic. Those Muslims who do have contact with groups overseas often face increased scrutiny over this, and some Uyghurs have ended up in reeducation camps after returning from Hajj or trips to Muslim countries.                  The flipside of sinicization is a move towards “de-Arabization” or “de-Saudification,” buzzwords that are used by Chinese officials in regard to fears of growing foreign influence over Islam in China.                  “The Chinese state has been quite concerned about the growing popularity of the Wahhabi ideology and close connections with Saudi Arabia, which has seemingly grown over the last decade or so,” Akad said.                  Darren Byler, a Xinjiang expert and post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Colorado, said that “Islam itself is already more or less criminalized in Xinjiang so I would guess that (the new rules are) more likely aimed at Hui practice in Eastern China. They have long had more direct association with Saudi and global piety movements like Tabligh Jama’at.”                  The Hui minority – most of whom are Chinese-speaking Muslims – have come under increasing pressure in recent months, as the government turns its attention to its largest Muslim group outside of Xinjiang.                  However, experts who spoke to CNN agreed that the main effect of the new rules will likely be on Christian groups, who, while never given free rein, have previously avoided the type of intense scrutiny Muslims are subjected to.                  “I believe it’s reasonable to assume that it mainly targets Christians, which have been regarded as a means of foreign infiltration particularly since the Opium War,” Akad said.      Related articleCan a religious group that wants to bring down China's Communist Party survive in Hong Kong?             Previously there has been broad tolerance for foreigners preaching to foreigners, provided they are officially licensed and ensure no Chinese citizens attend services. Some Christian groups are less scrupulous about this than others, and missionaries continue to operate illegally in China, Thum said.                  The new regulations could further tighten grey areas around foreign religious practice, issuing strict new requirements for applying to hold services, including describing the primary religious texts used, listing the nationality and visa status of all attendees, and obtaining a permit to use the building for such activities.                  After receiving such an application, the draft rules state, “the religious affairs department of the provincial people’s government shall solicit the religious affairs department of the county-level people’s government, the religious affairs department of the people’s government of the city divided into districts, and the province, autonomous region,” and shall make a decision “within 20 days.”                  Such red tape, and the potential punishments for avoiding it, could make it far more difficult for foreigners to hold services, and push them to use approved Bibles or Korans rather than foreign published texts.                  While specific punishments are not listed in the new proposal, there is a suggestion they could be severe, with talk of invoking “counter espionage” laws and other state security regulations against infractors.                  “The way the rules are written, and the way that Chinese laws tend to be interpreted by the security services, suggests that foreigners who engage in religious activities alongside Chinese citizens or even do research on those activities could be detained or harassed,” Thum said.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             The killing of al Qaeda deputy leader Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, which multiple current and former U.S. officials have attributed to a team of Israeli agents, according to the Associated Press, was a big blow to the top tier of America’s decades-long terrorist enemy. A long-standing member of al Qaeda’s senior leadership who had been in Iran since 2003, his death was yet another victory in a US-led counterterrorism campaign that in recent months has killed the group’s purported media chief in Afghanistan, according to an AP report, and a string of senior leaders based in Syria. Meanwhile, rumors persist that al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri may also have recently died from natural causes.                 “It is now possible to see the contours of how the war against al Qaeda ends.” So said Christopher Miller on Sept. 10, while the director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Fast forward two months and Miller is now acting Secretary of Defense and signaling that the US is in a “critical phase” in which “all wars must end.” These statements should be seen within the context of the outgoing Trump administration seeking to drive a last-minute agenda, but they reflect a wider American trend – not just of pulling back from foreign engagements, but of believing the threat posed by jihadist terrorism is at an all-time low.                 That is a dangerous sentiment, and it could allow a new form of terrorism to grow in the coming years.                 Two impressions are driving the sense that jihadists pose less of a threat today: First, a belief that the US homeland is now safer than it has ever been from a 9/11-style attack; and second, faith in “leadership decapitation” – killing leaders in the field – as the key to defeating terrorism. The first assessment may be true, but it is also misleading. The second comprehensively misunderstands the forces now driving jihadists worldwide.     Related articleAl Qaeda loses one of its most experienced leaders in mysterious murder in Tehran             For years now, al Qaeda has been undergoing a process of decentralization, whereby its original generation of leaders has grown more and more distant from their affiliates across the globe. Some of this is due to the effect of sustained pressure exerted by US aircraft, special forces and allied nations – all of which has forced terrorist leaders into hiding, where they become increasingly disconnected. It is also the simple consequence of having a profoundly uncharismatic leader in Zawahiri, whose propaganda is like listening to someone read a Victorian encyclopedia.                 As a result, in the last few years, al Qaeda affiliates have gained a great deal of autonomy to pursue their own agendas within their respective local environments. In so doing, jihadist terrorism has changed: The global has given way to the local, as affiliates in North Africa, the Sahel, Yemen and South Asia embed increasingly deeply into local conflict dynamics, building alliances with non-ideological actors and engaging extensively in local politics.     Related articleISIS exploiting coronavirus security gaps to relaunch insurgency, UN report warns             The demands of local agendas are complex and fluid, making strategic decisions a constant necessity and something distant leaders like Zawahiri have little if any influence over. Over time, as more decisions are made, al Qaeda’s leadership has become less and less relevant. In Syria, al Qaeda’s longtime affiliate originally known as Jabhat al Nusra traveled so far down this road it is no longer considered al Qaeda and is now managing a semi-technocratic governing body and publicly expressing a desire to engage with foreign governments.                 Though its territorial caliphate in Syria and Iraq is no more, ISIS is already engaged in a slow but methodical resurgence, taking advantage of Syrian regime weakness, US withdrawal away from rural positions in Iraq, and more. Further afield, ISIS’s wilayat (or provinces) appear to be competing with al Qaeda’s affiliates, using the exact same local playbook: exploit pre-existing local strife to establish a presence, embed itself within a local community, and exacerbate conflict for its own interests. Nowhere is that reality more clear than in Africa, where ISIS branches are intensively active in Mozambique, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Chad, Somalia and the Congo.                 While this localizing trend suggests jihadists are probably less interested in plotting large-scale terror attacks in Europe or the US, it would be naïve to put our foot on the brakes.     Related articleFrench military kills north African al Qaeda leader with US help             Jihadists are growing deeper roots in more countries around the world than ever before, and that should raise very serious concerns. We are seeing the emergence of more and more ungoverned spaces ripe for jihadist exploitation, and in developing countries, governments’ capacity to pre-empt or respond to jihadist challenges is declining.                 If today’s trajectory continues, it is likely that we will be staring at multiple jihadist statelets across the world within a matter of years. The longer these ungoverned vacuums remain, the more deeply jihadist actors will embed themselves in local settings and the smarter and more flexible they will become in responding to external challenges. The world will become increasingly unstable as our allies weaken, riven by a plethora of local conflicts, all or many of which could provide the means for the jihad to once again go global – but with greater resources than ever before.                 This possibility represents a consequential threat to US national security interests and cannot be allowed to come to fruition.     Related articleCaught between roadblocks, they were sitting ducks for Boko Haram massacre             The time has come for a smarter and more holistic approach to countering terrorism, one focused as much on the long-term as on the immediate. The US must continue to utilize its unmatched means to target senior jihadist operatives and those actively committed to the global agenda, but more emphasis should be paid to building the capacity of allies and partners worldwide so that they can one day deal with their own respective local challenges alone.                 We must also finally recognize that ideology is rarely if ever the sole or primary driver of terrorism, and indeed, ideologies cannot be defeated. Ungoverned spaces, autocratic rule, corruption, economic decline, disenfranchisement, and ethnic, sectarian or communal strife are all the principal drivers that allow terrorists to become more than a marginal fringe.                 If the world is to face this global threat with a global strategy, it will have to involve addressing all those issues. If they’re left to fester, a movement in the process of localizing could once again become a worldwide problem.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The speech was particularly notable because it comes at a fraught time on the heels of a divisive election, when Chief Justice John Roberts has sought to keep the court out of the political fray. Alito, instead, took on the restrictions of in-person worship services during the pandemic – an issue that is currently before the court – as well as Obergefell v. Hodges, the opinion that cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide. He also returned to the issue of the Second Amendment and touched on the possibility that Democrats may seek to restructure the size of the court.     Related articleSupreme Court appears to signal Obamacare will survive latest GOP challenge              His comments on religious liberty at times echoed those of President Donald Trump who pledged from the White House Rose Garden in 2017 that he would prevent the federal government from “bullying and even punishing Americans for following their religious beliefs.”                 In addressing Covid-19, Alito pointedly noted that he was not trying to diminish the severity of the pandemic, which he said has taken a heavy human toll, leaving “thousands dead, many more hospitalized,” nor was he commenting on whether the restrictions represent good public policy. “I am a judge, not a policy maker,” he said.                 But he said that he wanted to emphasize the impact of the restrictions on the rule of law and individual rights as officials have moved to combat the virus.                  “We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged,” he said, and added that the pandemic has resulted in “previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty.”                 Alito said that the Covid crisis has served as a “sort of constitutional stress test” that has highlighted “disturbing trends” that were present before the virus appeared. He pointed to emergency orders over the summer where the court sided with officials who sought to restrict the number of people who could worship in person and he lambasted his colleagues for ruling in favor of state and local officials even when he thought churches were being treated differently from other entities that had fewer restrictions.                 Earlier Thursday the court received yet another emergency petition on the issue, this time from the Roman Catholic diocese of Brooklyn seeking relief from an executive order from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.                 Alito’s discussion turned to recent religious liberty cases concerning the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns who didn’t want their health plans to provide contraceptives to their employees, as well as 2018 case concerning a baker who refused to make a cake to celebrate a couple’s wedding out of religious objections to same sex marriage.                 Alito said that “a great many Americans disagree, sometimes quite strongly” with the religious beliefs of the Little Sisters and the cake baker, “and of course they have a perfect right to do so.” But, he said, the cases raised another question.                 “The question we face” is whether our “society will be inclusive enough to tolerate people with unpopular beliefs.” And he wondered about those who believe they may be winning the cultural wars by taking a hard line of “you lost, live with it.”                 Taking such a hard line, Alito suggested, “seemed to work reasonably well in Germany and Japan after 1945,” he said and asked rhetorically, “is our country going to follow that course?”                 Returning to last summer’s cases concerning restrictions to in person worship services in Nevada and California during the pandemic, he said the restrictions “blatantly discriminated against houses of worship.”                 “In both cases the court allowed the discrimination to stand,” he said giving a justification that the court should defer to the judgment of the governors because “they have the responsibility to safeguard the public health.”                 He lambasted the governor of Nevada who, he said, had allowed fewer restrictions to casinos than houses of worship.                 “If you want to worship and you are the 51st person in line, sorry you are out of luck,” he said.                 “The state’s message is this: forget about worship and head for the slot machines or maybe a Cirque de Soleil show.”                 Alito also reiterated what he had written in 2015, when he dissented from the court’s decision to clear the way for same-sex marriage nationwide.                  “I could see,” he said, where the decision would lead for those who “cling to traditional views on marriage.”                 He reiterated that opponents of the ruling would risk being “labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers and schools.”                 “That is just what has come to pass,” he said. “One of the great challenges for the Supreme Court going forward will be to protect freedom of speech.”     Related articleJoe Biden's new chief of staff knows how to get a Supreme Court justice confirmed             And he saved particular anger for a Second Amendment case the court heard last term. In the end, the court dismissed the case because the law in question was changed after the justices agreed to hear the case.                 On Thursday, as he did in his dissent, Alito took special aim at a brief filed by five Democratic senators who had urged the court to dismiss the case and had warned that if it did not, the public would believe the court was motivated by politics. The senators said the “Supreme Court is not well” and floated the possibility that it might need to be “restructured.”                 On Thursday night, Alito blasted the brief.                 “This little episode, I’m afraid, might provide a foretaste about what the court will face in the future, and therefore I don’t think it can simply be brushed aside,” he said.                 Alito’s speech comes after Justice Amy Coney Barrett completed her first sitting on the court. Her nomination was championed by supporters of religious liberty, who believe she will join the court’s right flank on the issue.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Until the government does so, American Muslims should exercise caution and avoid travel to France.”                 Three people were stabbed to death at a church in Nice on Oct. 29, a brutal attack authorities say was carried out by an Islamist terrorist.                  The killings followed the murder of high school teacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded last month during a terror attack in a northern suburb of Paris.

But after the incident, French President Emmanuel Macron said that the country was under attack by “Islamist and terrorist madness.”                 France is home to 5 million Muslims, many of whom live in poorer areas, are marginalized in political circles, and socially separate from other French residents.

Leaders in countries including Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey urged Muslims to boycott French products after condemning Macron’s comments on Islam.                 “In the days since the horrific murder of educator Samuel Patty (sic) the French government has expanded its embrace of anti-Muslim bigotry by arresting numerous French Muslims with no apparent connection to the crime and moving to shut down various French Muslim organizations, including the country’s largest anti-Islamophobia group,” Mitchell, with CAIR, said.                 “Just as France did not collectively punish all French secularists for last week’s racist stabbing attack on Muslim women near the Eiffel Tower, France must stop collectively punishing all French Muslims for the crimes of individual religious extremists,” Mitchell added, referring to reports of two veiled Muslim women who were stabbed last month in an allegedly racist attack.                 The vast majority of France’s Muslims do not support Islamic extremism, but often face unfair stereotypes, according to experts.                  French Muslims say they face discrimination with a ban on religious veils and the anti-Muslim rhetoric by some political leaders.                  “It’s also worth noting that the French government has a long history of transforming anti-Muslim bigotry into government policy: kicking students who wear hijabs out of public school, barring public servants from wearing such signs of their faith, criminalizing religious face veils while requiring medical face masks, and arresting Muslim women for wearing full-body swimsuits, among other irrational policies that should end,” Mitchell said.

It’s the latest in a series of significant “How we got here” documentaries from producer Alex Gibney (just out with “Agents of Chaos”), here teaming with author Lawrence Wright.                 Wright – who wrote “The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,” chronicling the failures prior to the Sept. 11 attacks – helpfully fills in some of that history, describing the Middle East as having been “A part of the world that we didn’t care about, except for the oil” for decades.                 That changed with the strategic interest in Afghanistan’s Cold War fight against the then-Soviet Union, prompting former National Security Council counterterrorism advisor Richard Clarke to observe, “If we had just left Afghanistan alone, in 20/20 hindsight, I think things might have been better in the long run.”                 All that background is useful in understanding Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who had interviewed Osama bin Laden when he was battling the Soviet invasion and who earnestly yearned for reforms and greater freedom in the region.                 The exultation that surrounded the Arab Spring, however, gave way to disappointment when democratic impulses were crushed, altering his views and turning him into an outspoken critic of the current Saudi leadership.                 Director Rick Rowley gives voice to Khashoggi’s writings by having an actor read them, and documents the way that the US business community embraced Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a reformer while “drooling” over his billions, instilling a “sense of impunity” that allowed Khashoggi’s death to happen.                 “Kingdom of Silence” also includes former diplomat David Rundell, a former US diplomat and expert on Saudi Arabia who maintains that the grisly killing of the Washington Post contributor by operatives dispatched to Turkey isn’t reason enough to imperil US interests there. It’s the perfect encapsulation of decades of American policy, where support for democratic impulses has frequently run afoul of financial incentives and pragmatism.                 “I do my best to just be a journalist, and not become a revolutionary,” Khashoggi said, providing the documentary’s title by saying of advocacy for change in Saudi Arabia, “We are the kingdom of silence no longer.”                 Several of the killers were recently sentenced to prison, although an independent investigator called the verdicts issued by the Saudis “a parody of justice.”                 As “Kingdom of Silence” makes clear, the aftermath of Khashoggi’s death reflects that in dealings with Saudi Arabia, the golden rule still appears to apply, as in he who has the gold, and the oil, gets to make the rules.     “Kingdom of Silence” premieres Oct. 2 at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. It wil also be available free Oct. 1 on the Washington Post’s website. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/30/americas/canada-isis-hoax-chaudhry-intl/index.html,His confession about being an ISIS executioner enraged Canadians. Now police say he made it up,"Shehroze Chaudhry is accused of lying about being a foreign fighter for ISIS and in so doing, perpetrating a terrorist “hoax.”","Sep 30, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Paula Newton,International,"The details were gory and vivid, the emotion was raw, but Canadian police say 25-year-old Shehroze Chaudhry lied about being a foreign fighter for ISIS and in so doing, perpetrated a terrorist “hoax.”                  Last week, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police charged Chaudhry, a Toronto-area man, with “Hoax-Terrorist activity” in relation to interviews that were published by “multiple media outlets,” according to a police news release.                  The RCMP did not provide further details about their allegations, noting only in the news release that Chaudhry “claimed he travelled to Syria in 2016 to join the terrorist group ISIS and committed acts of terrorism.”                    Chaudhry declined to comment to CNN.                   “Hoaxes can generate fear within our communities and create the illusion there is a potential threat to Canadians, while we have determined otherwise. As a result, the RCMP takes these allegations very seriously, particularly when individuals, by their actions, cause the police to enter into investigations in which human and financial resources are invested and diverted from other ongoing priorities,” said Superintendent Christopher deGale, of the RCMP’s Ontario Division of the Integrated National Security Enforcement Team.                 RCMP did not outline what investigators knew about Chaudhry’s trips to Syria or if they could confirm that he had ever traveled there. Police also did not disclose whether they believe Chaudhry fabricated the entire story about being an ISIS member or whether it was specific details that Chaudhry disclosed in media interviews that constituted the “hoax.”                 Leaving Canada to participate in the activities of a terrorist group is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of 10 years.                  In a series of media interviews, most notably with the award-winning New York Times 2018 podcast “Caliphate,” Chaudhry – portrayed under the name Abu Huzayfah in interviews – talked in graphic terms about ISIS killings and violence and pledged allegiance to the ISIS cause of creating an Islamic caliphate.                 After the debut of “Caliphate,” Chaudhry also spoke to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, but gave different details about his level of involvement with ISIS, according to CBC.                  In a statement to CNN, the RCMP says it “can confirm that Shehroze Chaudhry is the same person as Abu Huzayfah from the New York Times podcast Caliphate.                 “The information aired in the Caliphate Podcast series was investigated, as were other avenues of information available to us, with the result of our investigation being the basis for the charge laid against Mr. Chaudhry,” says Sgt. Lucie Lapointe.                   You could still hear the shock in Amarnath Amarasingam’s voice as he discussed the bombshell charges against Chaudhry, a man he says he has spoken to almost every week for nearly 4 years for research and community reintegration efforts.                 “From everything we’ve talked about I’m a little blown away by the charge so I’m waiting to see what the RCMP says about the case and see if it survives in court somehow,” said Amarasingam, an assistant professor in the School of Religion at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario in an interview with CNN.                 In his work as a researcher and lecturer in extremist ideology, Amarasingam says he has spoken to dozens of ISIS fighters and while he says he cannot rule out that Chaudhry lied, he is stunned at the allegations that he faked the whole story.                 “He was incredibly detailed, incredibly plausible, and then the emotional aspect of it added to it. When someone is telling you a story, when you’re describing a murder that you committed or that you saw, if you haven’t experienced anything like that it’s really hard,” said Amarasingam, adding that he spoke to Chaudhry in the last few days but did not discuss the charges against him.                  In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, VP for Communications Danielle Rhoades Ha said the New York Times was reviewing the way it presented Huzayfah in the series.                 “While the uncertainty about Abu Huzayfah’s story was explored directly in episodes of Caliphate that featured him, his arrest and the allegations surrounding it have raised new and important questions about him and his motivations. We’re undertaking a fresh examination of his history and the way we presented him in our series. We will have more to say when we complete that effort.”                 In an earlier statement, the Times said uncertainty about Abu Huzayfah’s story was “central to every episode of Caliphate that featured him.”                 “Huzayfah’s account was checked against several other sources and documents – including his family, his teachers in Pakistan, flight records, university transcripts, passports, multiple American intelligence officials, an interview with another former ISIS member, geolocation of images and more. The concerns being raised now are concerns that our team examined in the podcast,” Rhoades Ha said.                 In defending its airing of “Caliphate,” the New York Times sad the series was “responsible journalism that helped listeners understand the power and pull of extremism.”                 Chaudhry publicly denied being a murderer in subsequent interviews. In a May 2018 CBC interview, he said that when he spoke to the New York Times he was “being childish.” He added in the CBC interview: “I was describing what I saw and basically, I was close enough to think it was me.”                 New York Times correspondent Rukmini Callimachi interviewed Chaudhry for “Caliphate.” She told the CBC in 2018 that she suspected Chaudhry changed his story when he realized he was under investigation in Canada. Callimachi added that as the publication date approached he threatened to say he “made it all up” if they refused to pull the story.                 When CNN reached out to Callimachi for comment, she referred us to the New York Times statement.                 In that statement, the news organization also pointed out that when it discovered that Chaudhry had “misled them about some details,” it then aired Chapter 6 of the series which the New York Times says documented the process to uncover his inconsistencies.                   But Chaudhry’s claims sparked concern in Canada and opposition leaders demanded action from the Trudeau government.                   In a parliamentary session shortly after “Caliphate” debuted, Canada’s public safety minister Ralph Goodale responded, “I am charged with the responsibility of keeping Canadians safe,” adding, “Discussing operational matters on the floor of the House of Commons is exactly the opposite of keeping Canadians safe.”                 Conservative politician Candice Bergen shot back: “Canadians deserve more answers from this government. Why aren’t they doing something about this despicable animal?” Bergen said.                 The RCMP has said little on what role Chaudhry’s media interviews played in its “extensive” investigation, asserting only that they raised “public safety concerns amongst Canadians.”                 Chaudhry is scheduled to appear in court in mid-November and the charge, if proven, carries a maximum prison sentence of 5 years.                 Amarasingam says Chaudhry has been trying to move on with his life and that he was enrolled in university full time and also has a job. He says when the New York Times podcast was released, Chaudhry did seem uncomfortable that his interview was central to many episodes of the podcast.                 “For the podcast he burst into tears when talking about the killing, and so it would require a certain level of mental distress, mental health issues to arouse the kind of emotions in yourself when talking about an entirely made up story,” said Amarasingam.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

Shams,International,"Editor’s Note: Mansoor T. Shams is a Muslim American US Marine Veteran, the founder of MuslimMarine.org and a public speaker. He also serves as a Term Member on the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Follow him on Twitter: @mansoortshams. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.             Like many of us, I vividly remember where I was and what I was doing on 9/11. Nearly one year earlier, I had made one of the toughest decisions any young 18-year-old American could ever make – I raised my hand to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic” and became part of America’s finest. I became a United States Marine.                 As footage of the Twin Towers started to roll in, I, like any other American, sat horrified, confused and frustrated. None of us Marines could figure out what was going on. But as the minutes and hours continued to pass, our base leadership on Camp Johnson in North Carolina decided to go into lockdown mode. I even recall one of our NCOs (non-commissioned officers) being asked to report to the armory to get his M16 rifle and stand guard at the base entrance. All nonessential entrance into the base was halted. No Marine could leave the base either. I’d only been in the Marine Corps for a year, and I had never witnessed anything like this.                 As the days went on, we would come to find out the attacks originated from Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan, the country I was born in. It was heart wrenching, painful to say the least. Deep down I began wondering why did it have to be the people with whom I shared a heritage, and, worse, the same faith. Why not someone else? Why not some other group? Why did the terrorists have to be people who claimed to follow my beautiful Islam? In hindsight it probably wasn’t the right sort of thinking.                 Although the Marine Corps is a unique breed of brotherhood which prides itself on certain core values like honor, courage and commitment, I started to experience a level of discrimination I could never have imagined.                  I had heard of stories of discrimination taking place in civilian America, but in the Marines? I wouldn’t have imagined it happening among the group that had become in many ways my brothers.     Related articleWhat the war on terror teaches us about Covid-19             I remember certain Marines giving me weird looks while some others, half jokingly and openly, even called me things like Taliban, terrorist and Osama bin Laden. In the beginning, I’d either try to ignore it or just laugh it off – but as time went on, I could feel things starting to get to me. I made complaints to my leadership, but they did little to intervene. Sadly, sometimes they were part of the problem.                   I even remember the time when my warrant officer denied my request to hold off on a physical fitness test (which included a three mile timed run, pull ups and maximum crunches in two minutes) until the end of the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from sunup to sundown every day for a month. The armed forces does make reasonable accommodations as needed, so I felt that the denial was part of the discrimination I was facing. Luckily, I passed my physical fitness test successfully without passing out.                    Adjusting to the Marine Corps way of life up until that point had been hard enough. Now, I was dealing with a new  environment that was more intimidating. Months later, I was moved to a different unit on base and able to start over, earning a Marine of the Quarter award and later a meritorious promotion to Corporal.                   To be absolutely clear, I’m not saying the Marine Corps is full of racist and bigots. I’m just saying, unfortunately, racism and bigotry also exists within the armed forces.                  As all the chaos was going on, I still somehow managed to remain true to who I was and the oath I had taken as a US Marine. I reached out to my leadership to make them aware of my unique background: my ability to speak the languages of Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi, my familiarity with cultures and traditions in that part of the world, and even my Muslim faith since Afghanistan is a Muslim majority country.                  In short, I was asking my leadership to use me in any way that could be helpful, even if that meant sending me into the heat of battle. I was ready to die for my country. This was my mindset. This was the level of love and dedication I had for America. In many ways, what I was doing was Islam in action, because love and service to country of residence is part of my Islamic faith as taught by the founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammad.                  Fast forward to today, if you aren’t tanned skinned, don’t don a black beard like I do or wear a hijab as many of my sisters in the Muslim community do, you likely won’t understand the Muslim experience.                  Nineteen years have passed since 9/11 and yet every time we commemorate the victims of 9/11 through various programs, there are certain groups, organizations, people (including politicians) who intently and cleverly work to make 9/11  about the Muslim faith.                   As hashtags like #NeverForget trend, it not only serves as a reminder to keep the memory of those 3,000 lives that were so viciously taken, but I’ve seen how for some it’s also a way to remind Americans the terrorists were Muslim. Just go through your social media and read some of the comments. You’ll see exactly what I’m talking about.                  It’s gotten to the point that some of us Muslims have to almost go into hiding on this day for fear of association and undeserved repercussion. Some of us feel as if we aren’t even allowed to grieve or honor those innocent lives lost.                 And sometimes it feels like we aren’t allowed to talk about what happened at all. Last year during an event, Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar received heat because she said that for “Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second class citizen. And frankly, I’m tired of it. And every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.” Omar went on to talk about Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which she said “recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”                 Instead of looking at her comments from the lens of an American she was berated.                  Of course President Donald Trump wasted little time in taking Omar’s comments out of context, falsely claiming that she praised al Qaeda.              Remember this was the same man who in 2017 issued a travel ban on countries, most of which are predominately Muslim  and said “I think Islam hates us” on live television when he was a presidential candidate.                  To be absolutely clear, I not only agree with Congresswoman Omar’s full statement in context, I particularly agree with the part  that seemed to rile many people across America: “some people did something.”              For far too long (almost two decades now), Muslims have had to bear dreadful discrimination, persecution, hate and bigotry because of the actions of 19 terrorists who claimed the peaceful religion of Islam. So yes, “some people did something” and it’s unfair to associate all Muslims with the atrocity.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             It’s the same sort of battle Black America faces today, if one black person does something wrong, thousands of African Americans are now automatically seen as criminal. And what about mass shootings in America? An overwhelming majority of mass shootings are conducted by young White men. Now imagine if I applied the same formula to all White Americans as some Americans apply to Muslims –  assuming every White person I saw was a mass shooter.                  I’m asking my fellow Americans who may still hold some sort of anti-Muslim discrimination in their hearts because of 9/11 to take a moment to think and to understand that Muslims were also among the victims of the attack.              Muslims have served and died for this nation since the days of George Washington.              In fact, there has never been an America without Muslims. So as you commemorate 9/11 this year, let’s honor those innocent lives lost, together, hand in hand, in solidarity as Americans. But whatever you do, please don’t bring our Muslim faith into it. Because if you do, you are not only disrespecting my honorable service to this nation but every Muslim American living or dead who has given their all (whether in uniform or without) to this America. I’m not asking for a special favor.  All I’m asking is see us Muslims as humans, as your fellow Americans without prejudice. That’s all.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Overall, Americans are now less likely than they were earlier this summer – when protests sparked by the death of George Floyd began – to say that racism is a big problem in society (67% said so then, 55% feel that way now). And while there has been some decline across party lines in that sentiment, the drop has come most sharply among Republicans. In June, 43% said racism was a big problem in society; now, just 22% say the same. Among Democrats, 84% feel that way, compared with 90% in June. Among independents, 57% say it’s a big problem vs. 63% in June.                  The partisan dynamic is similar in the poll’s findings about peaceful protests in response to incidents where African Americans have been harmed or killed by police. Overall, 72% call those protests justified, down from 84% in June, and the shift has again been steepest among Republicans (from 79% saying they were justified in June to 60% now).                  Fewer overall (24%) say that violent protests are justified in this situation, but that number holds largely steady compared with June (27%).                  The results come following a summer of President Donald Trump contending that Black Lives Matter is a “symbol of hate” and arguing that the protests are a portent of a violent future should Democratic nominee Joe Biden win the presidency.                  A majority, though, hold favorable views of the Black Lives Matter movement, 51% favorable vs. 38% unfavorable. That favorability rating far outpaces Trump’s own; an earlier release from the same poll showed 40% hold a favorable view of Trump, 56% unfavorable. Democrats largely view the Black Lives Matter movement favorably (83%), about half of independents agree (50%), and among Republicans, just 17% say they have a favorable view.                  Most Americans continue to say the President’s response to the protests has been harmful, and people are divided over whether federal government intervention is warranted when protests do turn violent.                  Overall, 58% call Trump’s response to the protests harmful, down from 65% who said the same in June. Again, the shift is largely among Republicans. Now, 72% of the President’s partisans say his response to the protests has been helpful, up from 62% in June. Among independents and Democrats those numbers are steady.                  Trump has repeatedly called for federal intervention in cities where protests have turned violent, and the poll finds an even split over that idea: 48% support it, 47% oppose it. Views on this are also sharply partisan (81% of Republicans support it, just 21% of Democrats agree), and split by race: most Whites support it (51%), while most people of color oppose it (53%).                 The President’s approval rating for handling race relations has improved somewhat, according to the poll, but that too is the result of a partisan shift. Among Republicans, approval has climbed from 73% to 83% since June. Among Democrats (1% now vs. 2% in June) and independents (26% approval now vs. 29% then), it hasn’t changed significantly.                  More generally, amid the coronavirus pandemic, racial strife and an economic struggle, Americans’ perceptions of how things are going in the country has shifted deeply negative (64% say things are going badly in the country, compared with 43% who felt that way in January). There’s still a broad partisan gap on this question, as there was in January, with 90% of Democrats saying things are going badly and 69% of Republicans saying they’re going well.                 But despite the overall negative sense of how things are going, the poll finds one optimistic note. Six in 10 Americans feel this summer’s protests will lead to real changes in the treatment of Blacks and other racial and ethnic minorities in America, with surprising agreement across demographic groups. 62% of Whites feel that way, as do 61% of people of color. Majorities of women (65%), men (56%), young people (57%), and seniors (64%) all see change as likely.                 The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS August 28 through September 1 among a random national sample of 1,106 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

MPower Change, in collaboration with grassroots organizations, launched the #MyMuslimVote campaign to promote a nationwide virtual registration drive. The group bills itself as the largest Muslim digital advocacy organization in the US, with more than 250,000 members.                 “The stakes in 2020 elections couldn’t be higher for our community,” MPower says on its website. “Join the #MyMuslimVote movement to engage, motivate, and mobilize tens of thousands of Muslim voters.”                  The group aims to register American Muslim voters through its website, which also provides resources for local activists to organize within their communities.                 Participating organizations have already reached out to nearly half a million registered Muslim voters, and are sending email and text message reminders to encourage American Muslims to vote in person or by mail, they said.                 American Muslims, along with other minority communities, could help vote President Donald Trump out of the White House and usher in Democratic contender Joe Biden, MPower Change Executive Director Linda Sarsour told CNN.      Related articleTrump's history of anti-Muslim rhetoric hits dangerous new low             “We must do everything we can as Muslims to alleviate harm,” Sarsour said. “I hope Muslims join me in voting this election because we can’t allow this administration to appoint more Supreme Court Justices or federal judges who can negatively impact our lives for generations to come.”                 The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) will also host virtual phone and text banks to assist in the effort.                 “If there was the full participation of Muslim voters in this election, we’d have the ability to tip the vote in Florida, Virginia, Ohio, Michigan and Connecticut. We need to make sure Muslims are inspired to vote for the candidates in front of us,” Robert McCaw, CAIR’s director of government affairs, told CNN.                 The Trump campaign in mid-August launched Muslim Voices for Trump. Also introduced at that time were similar coalitions for voters who identify as Indian, Hindu and Sikh.                  A Trump campaign site targeted to Muslim supporters includes a sign-up form, but no policy initiatives are listed.                  “Muslim Voices for Trump will energize and mobilize the Muslim community in re-electing President Donald J. Trump by sharing the many successes of the Trump Administration,” the site states. “Re-electing President Trump will ensure the protection of religious liberties, economic prosperity, and educational opportunities for Muslims in America.”                 Following Trump’s 2016 election, American Muslims experienced a spike in hate crimes, according to data from the FBI.                 More than 6,100 hate crimes were reported to the FBI in 2016, with anti-Islamic or anti-Muslim crimes increasing more than 19% over the previous year, an FBI report found. It was the biggest categorical rise overall.     Related articleHate crimes rose in 2016 - especially against Muslims and whites             Many American Muslim leaders attributed the spike to anti-Muslim rhetoric espoused by Trump and some of his close associates.                 Leaders point to Trump’s controversial comments on Syrian refugees and travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, among other statements and policies, as evidence of his anti-Muslim bias.                 “There is a fire in the stomach of every Muslim voter to make sure that their voices are heard, because we are very concerned about the rise in Islamophobia in America,” McCaw said.                 “In the face of rising anti-Muslim political rhetoric, it inspires Muslim communities to get out and make sure we are getting the candidates in office that best respect our votes and our concerns.”                 Biden’s election may not change the situation for American Muslims, but it is a step in a better direction, Sarsour said.                 “I don’t believe that the lives of our communities will drastically change under a Biden administration, but we can at least alleviate some of Trump’s harm and continue to build power and movements for the future,” she said.                 To that end, the #MyMuslimVote website allows for American Muslims to check their voter registration, register to vote, request a vote-by-mail ballot or find an in-person polling station.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The groups allege that Muslim detainees at the Krome detention facility in Miami have been forced to accept pork because the “religiously compliant or halal meals that ICE has served have been persistently rotten and expired.”                 Expired halal meals have been an issue for over two years, but the situation for the detainees at the facility was exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Muslim Advocates and Americans for Immigration Justice.     Related articleAmid Covid-19 pandemic, immigrant children and parents must be released from detention -- together             In one instance, the chaplain at Krome’s dismissed requests from the Muslim detainees for help, saying, “It is what it is,” Nimra Azmi, a staff attorney for Muslim Advocates, told CNN.                 There are approximately several dozen Muslim detainees at Krome who believe that it is religiously impermissible to consume pork, the groups said in a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement leadership and federal oversight agencies.                  In the past, detainees would choose their own meals in the cafeteria, and were therefore able to avoid pork if the halal meals were spoiled. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the facility has been serving pre-portioned and pre-plated meals. This change has meant that detainees either had to choose between a spoiled halal meal or a meal with pork, according to the letter.                  At least two to three times a week, the pre-plated meals include pork, the groups said.                  “The detainees are frustrated, rightfully so, that something as simple as being able to get meals that are edible for them and religiously compliant for them are not being attended to,” Azmi said. “I think that they particularly feel that they’re just being ignored, that ICE is being dismissive, that nobody cares.”                 Azmi said that she reviewed notes and letters from the detainees describing the conditions inside the facility.                 ICE is investigating the specific allegations raised in the letter, according to an agency official.                  A spokesperson for the agency told CNN that “ICE’s Performance Based National Detention Standards cover all aspects of detention, to include reasonable accommodation of religious dietary practices. Any claim that ICE denies reasonable and equitable opportunity for persons to observe their religious dietary practices is false.”                 ICE has previously been accused of infringing on religious liberties of its detainees.                  A lawsuit filed last year by the same groups, alleged that Muslim detainees at the Glades County Detention Center in Florida had prayers interfered with, were deprived religiously-compliant meals and were denied religious articles.                 “This sort of treatment is not just morally reprehensible, it’s against the law. Federal statutes provide heightened protections for religious exercise. This extends to immigrants and incarcerated individuals, who are especially vulnerable to neglect, mistreatment, and other abuses,” wrote Aleksandr Sverdlik of the Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief for the American Civil Liberties Union last year.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The assailant made his motives very clear and the NYPD needs to open a hate crime investigation.”                 CAIR-NY identified the victim as Tarek Elsayed, an 18-year-old Egyptian-American.                 The teen was attacked in Staten Island by a neighbor over a parking dispute, a police source told CNN.                 The man punctured Elsayed’s rear passenger tire and struck him with a baseball bat when he got out of his car to check the damage, CAIR-NY said in a statement.                 According to the organization, the attacker also threatened to kill Elsayed and his friends while they waited for the police, using several anti-Arab slurs and telling them to “go back to your country.”                  New York Police Department Det. Hubert Reyes told CNN there is no mention of racial epithets in the police report.                  Elsayed told CNN that he believes he told police about the epithets.                  “It hurt,” Elsayed said about the racial epithets. “It hurt hearing where I come from being used against me because he doesn’t like it.”                 Elsayed broke his arm and suffered injuries to the head, according to CAIR-NY.                  Police arrived and arrested the neighbor, Emilio Lopez. The 41-year-old man is charged with assault in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree and harassment, the NYPD said.                 CNN has reached out to Lopez’ attorney, Lance Lazzaro, for comment. Lopez’s next court appearance will be on November 16, in Richmond Criminal Court, according to court documents.                  CAIR-NY says it wants the attack investigated as a hate crime.                 “The NYPD and District Attorney have an obligation to consider all evidence during an investigation and when charging a suspect,” Mohamed told CNN. “Investigations and charges do not end once a suspect is arrested, and it is routine for prosecutors to add charges once more evidence becomes available to them. There is a plethora of evidence to support a hate crime investigation.” Clarification: This piece has been updated to clarify Elsayed is Arab-American.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Loomer is one of the most high-profile figures of this movement – and one of its most controversial. She has described Islam as a “cancer on humanity” and said that Muslim candidates should not be allowed to hold office in America. She has called herself a “proud Islamophobe.”             That behavior has led to Loomer being banned from Twitter, Facebook and Instagram – not to mention ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft. (She tweeted in 2018 that “someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver.”)                 And as of Wednesday morning, Loomer is the Republican nominee in Florida’s 21st District, which happens to include President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.                 She won a six-way primary for the right to face Rep. Lois Frankel (D) in the general election, raising more than $1 million thanks to support from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, pardoned Trump ally Roger Stone and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Loomer campaigned as the Trumpiest candidate in the field, touting her belief in the President’s “law and order” message. (Loomer is very unlikely to come to Congress; the 21st District is strongly Democrat.)                 Trump rewarded that support with a tweet touting Loomer’s win on Tuesday night.                  “Great going Laura,” he wrote. “You have a great chance against a Pelosi puppet!” He also retweeted several accounts congratulating Loomer on her victory, including that of Marjorie Taylor Greene, the GOP nominee in Georgia’s 14th district who has publicly supported the QAnon conspiracy theory and expressed a number of anti-Islamic views.                 CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski noted just how stunning a presidential endorsement for Loomer should be.                 “Remarkable to see a president endorse a candidate who said Muslims shouldn’t have be allowed to hold public office and called Islam ‘a cancer on humanity,’” he tweeted. “In a normal administration this would be a huge story but it will barely get mentioned.”                 Totally agree.                 But the story is about more than just a) Loomer winning or b) Trump embracing her.                 Loomer’s primary victory comes hard on Greene’s win in Georgia earlier this month – as well as victories in Oregon and Colorado by far-right candidates, many of whom embrace QAnon or similar unfounded conspiracy theories. Loomer’s win isn’t an anomaly. It’s part of the leading edge of the Republican Party’s transformation – or at least evolution – into an organization that includes provocateurs and conspiracy theorists among its ranks.     THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!             None of that should be surprising, given that the leader of the party is himself both a provocateur and a conspiracy theorist. Remember that the origins of Trump’s 2016 presidential candidacy were in his support for and promotion of a disproven conspiracy theory about Barack Obama not being born in the United States.                 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday that Trump hadn’t done a “deep dive” into the views Loomer and Greene hold before congratulating them.                 “The President routinely congratulates people who officially get the Republican nomination for Congress, so he does that as a matter of course,” McEnany said. “He hasn’t done a deep dive into the statements by these two particular women. I don’t know if he’s even seen that. But he supports the Muslim community, he supports the community of faith more broadly in this country.”                 Last week, Trump declined to answer whether he endorses QAnon. When McEnany was asked about that on Wednesday, she said she’d never heard it mentioned at the White House.                 “I’ve never heard of that. There’s a lot of media focus on that but certainly never heard of that from the President,” she said.                 Here’s the thing – Trump has not only given cover to the Loomers and Greenes of the world. He has, and continues to, actively encourage their candidacies and their views.                    Which, yes, is an existential threat to the identity of the broader Republican Party forged over a century and a half. Because if the GOP is willing to not just have Laura Loomer in its ranks but to embrace her – and her radical views – then what, exactly, differentiates it from the conspiracy theorists and anti-Islamic voices of the internet fever swamps?     © 2024 Cable News Network.

In England the latest wave of vitriol criticizes Muslims, blaming them for spreading Covid-19.","Aug 6, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Zamira Rahim,International,"Coronavirus conspiracy theorists have spread baseless rumors online – frequently targeting minorities – since the beginning of the pandemic. In England the latest wave of vitriol criticizes Muslims, blaming them for spreading Covid-19.                 Muslims were caught off guard last week, when the UK government suddenly announced local lockdowns in a slew of areas in northern England where cases have spiked. The announcement came just hours before Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest festivals in Islam.                  The affected areas included Greater Manchester, Burnley, Blackburn with Darwen, Bradford and Leicester – all places with a significant Islamic population according to the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB).                  The restrictions – published late last Thursday evening – banned people in the named areas from mixing with other households.                 Local politicians and Muslim leaders criticized the timing of the announcement.                 “The timing … it focused people’s minds [on Muslims],” Rabnawaz Akbar, a Labour Party councilor in Manchester, told CNN.                 The government “have done it on the eve of Eid,” leading people to think “it must be the Muslim community’s fault,” Akbar said. “You see how people would have come to the assumption. [The government] have done it without thinking but of course, they’re highlighting a particular demographic. And people are angry and now that anger is focused on a particular community.”                 A Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement to CNN: “Decisions on lockdowns are based solely on scientific advice and the latest data. Where there are local outbreaks, our priority will remain taking whatever steps are necessary to protect people.”                 Akbar also criticized Craig Whittaker, a Conservative MP who suggested that England’s ethnic minorities were not adhering to pandemic guidelines.                 “What I have seen in my constituency is that we have areas of our community … that are just not taking the pandemic seriously enough,” Whittaker said Friday, when asked about the local lockdowns during an interview with LBC radio.                 When asked if he was talking about the Muslim population, Whittaker replied: “Of course.”                 “If you look at the areas where we’ve seen rises and cases the vast majority – not, by any stretch of the imagination, all areas – but it is the BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] communities that are not taking it seriously enough,” he added.                 Whittaker’s comments were met with an outcry and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about them at a press briefing on Friday.                 The British leader did not condemn the MP, and said: “Well, I think it’s up to all of us in government to make sure that the message is being heard loud and clear by everybody across the country, and to make sure that everybody is complying with the guidance.”     Related articleThe UK's troubled coronavirus response becomes more complicated             This week, the Downing Street spokesperson told CNN: “At Friday’s press conference the Prime Minister apologized to all those who could not celebrate Eid in the way they had wished, and thanked the work of mosques and imams in getting the message out about the importance of following safety guidance.                 “And he set out in his Eid message that he is hugely grateful to the Muslim community for their efforts and sacrifices throughout this pandemic.”     Tell MAMA, a group which monitors anti-Muslim incidents in the UK, has called on Whittaker to apologize for his comments.                 “To single out one community this way is wholly wrong, stigmatizing and unbecoming of an MP,” the group said in a statement.                 Following the controversy, Whittaker said his evidence was based on data from local officials at Calderdale Council in West Yorkshire.                 “Calderdale Council has not only identified a causal correlation between the locations of a high concentration of our ethnic Asian residents and that of COVID 19 infections, but has also formed the opinion that behaviour in these areas needs to be addressed through engagement in order to reduce the infection rate in these communities,” Whittaker said in a statement on his website.                 “In an age where authenticity is a behaviour scarcely exhibited by public figures, I am glad that I have chosen open, honest and frank discussion over political expediency and … I make no apology for my comments,” he added.                 Tell MAMA director Iman Atta told CNN that far-right extremists had been blaming Muslims for the pandemic since the beginning of the UK’s lockdown in March.                 “In March, April, May, we saw a lot of conspiracy theories floating around,” she said. “The far right were sharing photos of Muslims congregating and flouting the rules at mosques which were, in reality, shut down and not functioning. The photos were from last year,” she said.                 “And they have spread rumors online about how BAME communities are the ones spreading the virus, so [people] should not be interacting with them.”                 Atta’s findings are echoed by those of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which represents several UK mosques and Muslim organizations.                 Earlier in the lockdown “there were theories spreading that Muslims would gather secretly during Ramadan, that mosques were secretly open – none of that was true and there was no evidence,” Zainab Gulamali, a spokesperson for the organization, told CNN.                 Gulamali added that she was disappointed that Johnson and his Conservative Party colleagues had failed to condemn Whittaker’s comments on BAME people.     Related articleThe UK has an Islamophobia problem. Muslims want to know what Boris Johnson is going to do about it             Johnson himself has repeatedly been accused of Islamophobia. He drew sharp rebukes from Muslim communities in 2018 over an article he wrote about Muslim women wearing burqas. The politician said women who wore the veil resembled “letter boxes” and “bank robbers.”                 He later offered a partial apology, saying: “In so far as my words have given offense over the last twenty or thirty years when I’ve been a journalist and people have taken those words out of my articles and escalated them, of course, I am sorry for the offense they have caused.”                 Crime figures suggest that the UK has become a more hostile place for Muslims in recent years. Despite accounting for less than 5% of the UK’s 66 million-strong population, 52% of religious hate crime offenses committed in England and Wales between 2017 and 2018 targeted Muslims.                 Much of the recent blame placed on Muslims appears to be driven by the fact that Covid-19 has hit the country’s ethnic minorities hard.                  According to Public Health England (PHE), those of Bangladeshi heritage who tested positive for coronavirus were twice as likely to die as their white counterparts. PHE found that the discrepancy was caused by a complex of range of factors, including the fact that BAME people were more likely to live in overcrowded and urban areas, and to work in jobs that put them at risk of catching Covid-19.                 In June, an academic paper considered by the government’s scientific advisers warned that an earlier local lockdown in the city of Leicester had caused a rise in racial tension. The city has a large British Asian population.                 “There is extensive racist commentary on social media,” the researchers wrote. “Videos have also been circulated on social media showing the South Asian community flouting social distancing in an attempt to stir conflict.”                 “We don’t want to sweep under the carpet the issues that [Muslim communities] do face,” Rabnawaz Akbar said.                 “A lot of people live in densely-populated terraced housing,” he said, explaining that many Muslims “live with their parents or their grandparents, so you have multigenerational households. A lot of people work in low income and frontline jobs – they’re taxi drivers or health care [workers] … they’re inevitably going to be at risk of catching the virus.”                 “But rather than blame them, the solution is that local and central government should work with the communities to take extra precautions,” he said.                  Muslims are far from alone in shouldering increased racial resentment during the Covid-19 crisis.                  Coronavirus has fueled xenophobia against those of East Asian descent worldwide, and lockdown measures have triggered an explosion of online anti-Semitic hate incidents.                  For many minorities the new threat of the pandemic has only intensified the age-old danger of bigotry.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

My quick answer: Never.,"Jul 18, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,John Blake,International,"I was talking to a Black friend this week about a recent string of anti-Semitic tweets from Black celebrities when he hit me with a question that caught me by surprise.                 “When did Jews become the enemy of Black people?”                 My quick answer: Never.                 You might not know that, however, if you’ve seen a string of anti-Semitic comments from entertainer Nick Cannon, NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson and former NBA player Stephen Jackson. All three later offered apologies for their comments, which evoked the anti-Semitic pronouncements of Minister Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam. The Southern Poverty Law Center has condemned both Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, calling their rhetoric “deeply racist” and “anti-Semitic.”                 The comments by Cannon and the two Jacksons caused a stir and puzzled some who wondered how people who have presumably been victims of racism could voice prejudice towards another minority group. Luminaries such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar wrote a column asking why there wasn’t more outrage over the remarks.                 These stories about supposed Black-Jewish tensions fit a pattern. They hibernate and then re-emerge every couple of years to feed a perception that there is pervasive anti-Semitism in the Black community or some historical “tension” between Black people and Jews.     Related videoStephen Jackson says he used the 'wrong words' in defending DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic posts             But that perception is bogus. No one should let the uninformed musings of a few Black celebrities convince us otherwise. Talk to many people who know the history of both groups and they will tell you the same.                 Ravi Perry, an activist and chairman of the political science department at Howard University, rejects the notion that there is a rising tide of anti-Semitism among Black people or some new tension between the two groups.                 “There is no more prejudice in the Black community around people of the Jewish faith or ethnicity than any other groups,” Perry says. “Just like Black people don’t commit more crimes than White people. Just like Black people aren’t more homophobic than Whites. Black people are not more anti-Semitic than other groups.”                  Here’s some history you won’t hear in any of those misinformed tweets.                  Blacks and Jews share a common history of oppression, said Edward Shapiro, a historian, in an essay, “Blacks and Jews Entangled.”                  “Jews have supposed that they, more than any other group, could and did empathize with the plight of blacks, and that blacks recognized this,” he wrote. “Jewish newspapers early in the twentieth century compared the black movement out of the South to the exodus from Egypt, noted that both blacks and Jews lived in ghettos, and described anti-black riots in the South as pogroms.”                 Contemporary polls suggest that some of that bond remains.     A 2018 survey by the PRRI polling firm said that while 28% of White mainline Protestant and 20% of White evangelical Protestants believe Jewish Americans experience a lot of discrimination, 44% of Black Protestants say Jewish people face a lot of discrimination.

But the survey also found that “a significant number (of African Americans) also draw comparisons to their overcoming struggles as a people and that of the ancient Israelites.”                 Why is this shared history so easily forgotten, even by educated folks?                 Part of the answer can be summed up in one name: Louis Farrakhan.                 You might assume Farrakhan has a large following in the Black community based on the attention he gets. But Farrakhan’s following has long been misunderstood or distorted. No matter how he portrays himself, he has not been widely accepted like an MLK or a Barack Obama. Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to con you.                 I covered Farrakhan at his peak popularity and attended rallies when he could fill a stadium. I sat in on an intimate, two-hour interview with him. And I wrote about the epic 1996 Million Man March.                  But here’s what some people forget. His anti-Semitism was never a huge part of his appeal to Black people. For some, sure. But for most it was his message about self-empowerment, and the way he denounced White racism.                 The media often misses this nuance when talking about the Nation and Farrakhan. There were churches that wouldn’t or couldn’t reach Black men in prison, or didn’t know how to reach young men. But the Nation did – and still does.                  Perry, the political scientist, says a lot of Black people tune out parts of Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, much like they do with other religious leaders.                 “To assume that every Black church member believes everything that their pastor says out of his mouth is ridiculous,” he says, “but that doesn’t mean they’re going to stop going to church.”                 That reasoning is not enough for some Jewish leaders.                 Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, says there is no rising tide of anti-Semitism in the Black community. He talks passionately about the history of Blacks and Jews working together for justice.                 “I have no doubt that there are some people who tune out the anti-Semitism and hatred and focus on other elements of what the Nation of Islam portends to speak about,” he said. “But picking and choosing is easy for people who are not impacted by the hate.”                 He says Jews need more Black people to stand up to Farrakhan.                  “Some folks in the Jewish community are asking themselves when do we know an apology is sincere after somebody makes an anti-Semitic statement?” he says. “It’s when individuals hold Farrakhan accountable for his hate. That will be a sign of progress.”                 Here might be another sign of progress.                 When people think about relations between Blacks and Jews, I hope one day more will think not of Nick Cannon or DeSean Jackson but of these three names: James Earl Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman.                 They were young men – one Black and two Jewish – who were murdered together in Mississippi in the summer of 1964 while trying to register Black people to vote.                 There is a soul-crushing photograph of their three bodies, twisted and tangled together where they were buried in a deserted earthen dam. They died for one another, and with one another.                 That photo may no longer command the news cycle, but no ill-considered comments on social media should ever eclipse what it represents.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Aishah, who asked to be identified only by her first name out of fear for her safety, is being represented by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MN), which filed a charge to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights on Monday.                 The 19-year-old, who wears a hijab, a headscarf worn by Muslim women, told CNN she felt singled out for her religious beliefs after seeing “ISIS” – the acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a terrorist group known for its radical beliefs and violence – on her cup. It’s unclear if ISIS was written in all caps on the cup.                 “The moment I saw it, I was overwhelmed with a lot of emotions,” Aishah said. “I felt belittled and so humiliated. This is a word that shatters the Muslim reputation all over the world. I cannot believe that in this day and age, something like this can be considered acceptable. It isn’t okay.”                 The incident occurred on July 1, at the St. Paul-Midway Target Starbucks, Aishah said. She said she also was wearing a face mask, because of the ongoing pandemic, but said she repeated her name to the barista. She didn’t spell it out.                 “When she asked for my name, I slowly repeated it multiple times,” she said. “There is absolutely no way she could have heard it as ISIS. Aishah is not an unknown name and I repeated it multiple times.”                 The employee claimed to Aishah at the time that she had not heard the name correctly, according to the discrimination charge, a copy of which was obtained by CNN.     Related articleA Muslim woman says her headscarf was forcibly removed from her head for a booking photo after being arrested at a Black Lives Matter protest             After requesting to speak to the barista’s supervisor, Aishah told CNN her “concerns were dismissed” and that she was given a new drink and a $25 Starbucks gift card before being escorted from the premises by security officers, according to the charge.                 The supervisor told Aishah that mistakes sometimes happen with customers’ names, the charge states.                 CAIR-MN is calling for the firing of the two Target Starbucks employees involved in the incident.                 Aishah said she immediately filed a formal complaint to Target and has yet to receive a response. Target did not immediately respond to CNN’s request regarding Aishah’s formal complaint.                 However, in an email statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Target said the retailer wants “everyone who shops with us to feel welcomed, valued and respected and we strictly prohibit discrimination and harassment in any form. We are very sorry for this guest’s experience at our store and immediately apologized to her when she made our store leaders aware of the situation.”                 “We have investigated the matter and believe that it was not a deliberate act but an unfortunate mistake that could have been avoided with a simple clarification,” the spokesperson said. “We’re taking appropriate actions with the team member, including additional training, to ensure this does not occur again.”                 Starbucks declined to comment on the incident. A spokesperson for Starbucks told CNN by phone that this Starbucks is located inside a Target, meaning it is entirely run and operated by Target.                 Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-MN, said labeling someone who is Muslim as “ISIS” is “perhaps the most Islamophobic statement you can make towards a Muslim.”                  “The statement that came out from Target is just unfortunate,” Hussein told CNN. “Now we know this is a bigger issue than a simple misunderstanding, because the entire corporation is apologizing for Islamophobia without taking action.”                 Hussein said CAIR-MN has also asked Target “to launch another thorough investigation that involves Aishah and to train their employees on Islamophobia and bigotry.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Hisham al-Hashimi, 47, appeared frequently on local and foreign media outlets as an analyst, especially during Iraq’s battle against ISIS.                 He was also an expert voice on Iraqi politics and Shiite extremist groups and had served as an adviser to previous Iraqi governments                 Al-Hashimi died in Ibn Al-Nafees Hospital in Baghdad after he was seriously wounded during the attack, Maan said.                 The motive behind his assassination is so far unclear, but similar targeted killings were frequent during the height of Iraq’s sectarian war.                 Al-Hashimi was a vocal critic of Iraq’s political elite and discussed corruption in the country on his social media accounts. He appeared to have tweeted moments before he was killed, in a post about the sectarian and ethnic divisions in Iraqi politics.                 News of his death shocked many in the Middle East and beyond.                 The European Union’s Ambassador to Iraq Martin Huth tweeted: “Together with his family and friends, we mourn the death of Dr Husham Al-Hashimi. The perpetrators of this heinous crime must be brought to justice!”                 The UK’s Ambassador to Iraq Stephen Hickey tweeted “Devastated and deeply saddened by the news of the killing of Husham Al Hashimi. Iraq has lost one of its very best- a thoughtful and brave man. These attacks cannot continue. The government – supported by the international community – must hold the perpetrators to account.”     Devastated and deeply saddened by the news of the killing of Husham Al Hashimi.

Islamophobia is a pernicious disease. It does not belong in the halls of government,” Biden’s statement reads. “As President, I will appoint individuals who represent the values of our nation and respect all racial, ethnic and religious communities.”                 Retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, who was nominated to become the under secretary of defense for policy, has a history of making Islamophobic and inflammatory remarks against prominent Democratic politicians, CNN’s KFile reported in June. Tata is a frequent guest on Fox News and ardent defender of President Donald Trump.      Related articleTop Pentagon nominee pushed conspiracy theories that former CIA director tried to overthrow Trump and even have him assassinated             In several tweets from 2018, Tata said that Islam was the “most oppressive violent religion I know of” and claimed former President Barack Obama was a “terrorist leader” who did more to harm the US “and help Islamic countries than any president in history.” Following the publication of KFile’s initial story, Tata deleted several of his tweets, screenshots of which were captured by KFile. In one radio appearance, Tata also speculated that the Iran deal was born out of Obama’s “Islamic roots” in an attempt “to help Iranians and the greater Islamic state crush Israel.”                 Tata also spread conspiracy theories that former CIA director John Brennan tried to overthrow Trump and even have him assassinated.                 If confirmed by the Senate, Tata would become the third highest official in the Pentagon overseeing the Defense Department’s policy shop, including its national security and defense strategy, nuclear deterrence and missile defense policy, and security cooperation plans and policies.                  CNN obtained a letter Tata sent to the top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee apologizing for his past Islamophobic tweets.                   “I deeply regret comments I made on social media several years ago,” he wrote, adding that his “tweets were completely out of character.”                 The White House has stood by Tata.                 “Anthony Tata, the President’s exceptionally qualified nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, is a distinguished public servant whose career has provided him with planning, policy, and operational experience both at home and abroad,” White House spokesman Judd Deere told CNN in an email. “His education, background, and record has earned him bi-partisan praise, and this attempt by the media to slander his reputation is disgusting. The White House stands by the President’s qualified nominee.”                 Mark Kevin Lloyd, who was appointed to be a religious freedom adviser to USAID, shared a post in June 2016 calling Islam “a barbaric cult,” according to a 2016 Associated Press report. Lloyd also perpetuated a conspiracy theory and said Obama was aiding the Iranian nuclear program as part of his ” ‘final solution’ to the Israel problem,” a phrase that evoked the Holocaust, AP reported. Lloyd declined to talk to AP at the time, citing his nondisclosure agreement with the Trump campaign. He was working as a Virginia field director for the Trump presidential campaign at the time.                  On Monday, several Democrats in the House of Representatives sent a letter to USAID urging the agency to rescind its appointment of Lloyd.                  “Far from an isolated incident of poor judgement, Mr. Lloyd’s behavior openly and frequently displays his contempt for a religion that counts nearly two billion followers, and constitutes the second largest religion in the world,” the letter reads. It was signed by the first two Muslim women in Congress, Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, as well as Reps. Joaquin Castro of Texas, Adriano Espaillat of New York, David Trone of Maryland and Al Green of Texas.                  “He does not represent the values of our country, and he should not be in a position to betray our nation’s constitutional promise of religious freedom,” the letter reads.

As demonstrations and debates about Britain’s colonial legacy sweep the country, 58% of Black Britons said they think Johnson’s party is “institutionally racist.” A substantial minority of White people, 39%, said they believed the same.                 The findings highlight a major challenge for Johnson, who has been accused of making racist comments in past newspaper articles, as he battles to retain public confidence in his administration amid the coronavirus pandemic and burgeoning Black Lives Matter protests.                 Ministers have repeatedly urged people not to attend public protests, citing a ban on large gatherings enacted to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and have also condemned the forced removal of a statue of a slave trader in the southwest of England city of Bristol. Johnson also said through his spokesperson earlier this month that he “does not agree that this is a racist country,” leading to allegations that he does not grasp the scale of racism in Britain.                 The results of CNN’s poll are released on the third national Windrush Day, which was established to commemorate the men and women from the Caribbean who arrived in Britain to help rebuild the country in the years that followed World War II.                  Some members of this Windrush generation – named after the ship that brought one of the earliest groups of Caribbean migrants to the UK in 1948 – were wrongly deported from the UK when they could not provide paperwork that proved their right to remain, resulting in a political scandal in 2018. The then Prime Minister, Theresa May, when she was Home Secretary between 2010 and 2016, described the measures as designed to create a “hostile environment” for people who were in the UK illegally.                 In CNN’s poll, 55% of Black people said they did not have faith in the UK government to prevent a similar scandal from occurring again, while 38% said they did. The figures were virtually reversed for White Britons – 55% trusted the government to avoid another scandal, while 39% did not.                 A Home Office spokesperson told CNN that the department is “considering the findings of the Windrush Lessons Learned review because we want to begin a new chapter.”  Home Secretary Priti Patel is likely to give a formal response to that review before the summer.                 “The Home Secretary has been clear that the mistreatment of the Windrush generation by successive governments was completely unacceptable and she will right those wrongs,” the Home Office added. “12,000 people now have documentation proving their statements and we are making more compensation payments week on week.”                 The Conservative Party has long battled allegations of racism, which have flared up on several occasions in its postwar history. A deeply anti-immigrant polemic known as the “Rivers of Blood” speech by the Conservative MP Enoch Powell in 1968, race riots in the 1980s under the prime ministership of Margaret Thatcher, and the more recent Windrush fiasco have all dented the party’s image among Black and minority ethnic groups.                  A spokesperson for the party told CNN: “We’re proud to be a party that champions and supports opportunity for all, of all races, religions and backgrounds. Prejudice and discrimination have no place in the Conservative Party and we will never stand by when it comes to abuse of any kind.”     Related articleTens of thousands of Britons have died from coronavirus. But Boris Johnson is stoking a culture war.             Last week, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a commission to examine racial inequalities in the UK. But the reported involvement of a Downing Street aide in setting up the commission has too proved controversial; critics say Munira Mirza is unsuited to the task because she has previously denied that widespread racism exists in the UK, writing in 2017 that she believed institutional racism was “a myth.” Downing Street has said the membership of the commission had yet to be decided.                 Johnson’s own views on race and religion have also dogged him. In a newspaper column in 2018, he described Muslim women who wear face veils as resembling “letterboxes” and “bankrobbers.” In 2002 he called people from the British Commonwealth “flag-waving piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles.” Johnson has said the quotes have been taken out of context.                  Savanta ComRes surveyed 1,535 British adults for CNN earlier this month about their views towards race relations in the UK. The findings, which laid bare public perceptions towards racism in several aspects of British life, make difficult reading for both of the country’s major parties.                 Around a third of both Black and White respondents said they believed the opposition Labour Party to be institutionally racist. The party has been dogged by frequent allegations of anti-Semitism within its ranks, which peaked during the period under its previous leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Labour’s new leader, Keir Starmer, has pledged to stamp out anti-Semitism in the party.                 Although the poll did not ask specifically about anti-Semitism, the broader findings on racism demonstrates the scale of the challenge Starmer faces. A Labour spokesperson said Starmer had “set out steps to rebuild trust and confidence in Labour on the issue of racism,” including “a number of internal measures aimed at ensuring the party embodies the values it stands for.”                 Thousands have protested against racial inequality in the UK throughout June, in a wave of activism prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in the United States on May 25.                  The demonstrations have sparked a national conversation about Britain’s colonial legacy, much of which has centered around the question of whether statues of slave traders should remain standing in British cities. © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/white-christians-racism-robert-jones/index.html,This is a moment of reckoning on race for White Christians,"In a new book, Robert P. Jones says the theology developed in many churches in America blinds White Christians to racial injustice.","Jun 20, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Daniel Burke,International,"Growing up in the South, Robert P. Jones attended Southern Baptist churches, Sunday schools, even a Southern Baptist college.                  But it was only in seminary, in his mid-20s, that Jones says he learned the full truth about Southern Baptists’ white supremacist roots. The denomination was founded to defend slavery and did not formally rebuke its past until 1995, when Southern Baptists voted to apologize for their history of racism.                 Jones was a social scientist before he realized how stubbornly racist ideas can persist in White churches.                  “White Christian churches have not just been complacent; they have not only been complicit,” he writes in his book, “White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity,” publishing next month.                 “Rather, as the dominant cultural power in America, they have been responsible for constructing and sustaining a project to protect White supremacy and resist Black equality,” he writes. “This project has framed the entire American story.”                 In the book Jones, CEO and founder of Public Religion Research Institute, blends church history, memoir and contemporary public opinion surveys. Together, they make a clear and compelling case for why White American Christians need to reckon with their past.                   But American Christianity’s past is only part of the problem.                  In survey after survey, said Jones, contemporary white Christians repeatedly deny that structural racism is a problem, that shootings of unarmed Blacks are not isolated incidents, or even that African Americans still face racism and discrimination.                  White non-Christians, on the other hand, more often agree with Blacks about racial discrimination, according to public opinion surveys.                   So what gives? Why would White Christians be more reluctant to see racism than their non-Christian counterparts?                  If that’s the question that animates “White Too Long,” the answer will be challenging, if not deeply unsettling for many White Christians.                  CNN spoke to Jones recently about why so many White Christians turn a blind eye to racism, how white supremacy took hold of American culture and what Christians can do now to make amends.     What prompted you to write this book?              Whenever we asked questions about race or African Americans there was a huge gap between Whites who are Christian and those who are not. Whites who are not Christian were always closer to the attitudes of African Americans.                  Seeing that pattern over and over made me realize that something deeper is going on. And coupled with my own experience of growing up in the South and this current moment, I realized that these issues are not being dealt with well. Most White Christians try to ignore them.      To that point, it seems like more White evangelicals than we’ve seen in the past are speaking out against the recent killings of Black Americans by the police and vigilantes. Joel Osteen, who is often studiously apolitical, marched in a Black Lives Matter protest. Some evangelicals are even mentioning systemic racism, which they’ve been slow to acknowledge in the past. What do you make of their responses?              One measure of authenticity for White Christians is whether they link reconciliation with justice and repair. It’s easy for a White Christain leader to jump in a march and put his arm around an African-American pastor. But will we see Joel Osteen preach a sermon calling for White Christians to reflect on the ugly parts of our history? Are pastors going to help White Christians free their faith from privileged claims of whiteness?                  One of the challenges, historically, has been that the Christian theology developed in White churches intentionally blinds White Christians to racial injustice. White Christians are nearly twice as likely as non-religious Americans to say police shootings of unarmed black men are isolated incidents. That is a moral and theological problem.     We’ve heard some Christian leaders denounce racism in clear moral terms, but that doesn’t seem to filter down to the pews, according to surveys. And that’s a problem not only for White evangelicals but Catholics and others, right?              Yes, that’s true not only for evangelicals but Catholics and the more liberal mainline Protestant leaders. They’ve put out a number of statements and press releases, but historically they have not landed at the parish or congregational level. And that’s where theology gets built: at the local level.                  The hymns sung, the scripture passages preached, how people understand salvation, none of that has been deconstructed. It was all built for a world in which White Christians needed to shield their institutions and beliefs from claims of injustice by African Americans.                  You can see that in the way Black Catholics were forced to sit in the back of the church and receive Communion last, and in the way the Southern and Northern branches of Methodism realigned after the Civil War but still didn’t admit Black churches as equal members.      Why have so many White Christians been so slow to recognize the racism in their past, as well as the racism that continues in America?              As long as White supremacy has a hold on our culture, it’s pretty comfortable for White Christian churches to say their theology is about personal salvation and personal lives. Theology has been constricted to be only about personal piety, disconnected from claims of social justice. Everything outside of salvation has been labeled “politics.”                  It’s a self-protective move. If you read sermons in Mississippi in the 1950s and 1960s you would have no idea that there was a Civil Rights movement. It was a lulling of white consciences to sleep.      But what about now, this moment?              I see the last four years as a moment of reckoning for White Christians. The election of President Trump, who has put White supremacy front and center, has brought these issues from just barely below the surface into plain view. Charlottesville changed things. Charleston changed things. Dylan Roof was a confirmed Lutheran, who, in his journal while imprisoned has been drawing crosses and white Jesus and is completely unrepentant.                 White Christians have inherited a worldview that has Christians on top of other religions, men over women, Whites over Blacks. There is a top-down authoritarian structure to it.      What, if anything, can change that?             In the book, I write about two Baptist churches in Macon, Georgia, one White and one Black, who have built trust and a partnership in a way that allowed White Christians to be challenged about their assumptions.

Retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, a frequent guest on Fox News and ardent defender of President Donald Trump, was nominated to become the under secretary of defense for policy.                  If confirmed by the Senate, Tata would become the third highest official in the Pentagon overseeing the Defense Department’s policy shop, including its national security and defense strategy, nuclear deterrence and missile defense policy, and security cooperation plans and policies. The policy chief also closely advises the secretary of defense on national security and supports the Department of Defense’s program and budget decisions.                  In several tweets from 2018, Tata said that Islam was the “most oppressive violent religion I know of” and claimed Obama was a “terrorist leader” who did more to harm the US “and help Islamic countries than any president in history.” Following the publication of this story, Tata deleted several of his tweets, screenshots of which were captured by CNN’s KFile.                 Tata, in one radio appearance, speculated the Iran deal was born out of Obama’s “Islamic roots” in an attempt “to help Iranians and the greater Islamic state crush Israel.”                 Tata also lashed out at prominent Democratic politicians and the media on Twitter, such as California Reps. Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, who he said “have always been the same violent extremists.” In another tweet, Tata called Waters a “vicious race baiting racist.” He used a hashtag in a different tweet that insinuated CNN anchor Don Lemon was on “the liberal plantation.”                  The White House’s nomination of Tata on Thursday comes after the February ouster of Pentagon policy chief John Rood, who warned against withholding military aid to Ukraine last year, as the White House moves to install loyalists and prominent Trump defenders across the administration.                  Tata is a regular defender of the President and his policy decisions, including Trump’s intervention in the war crimes case of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher that forced Navy Secretary Richard Spencer to resign.                  Tata did not respond to a request for comment. A Pentagon spokeswoman referred questions about Tata to the White House. Spokespeople for the White House did not respond to requests for comment.                  The retired general currently works as a senior adviser in the Department of Defense, and previously served for 28 years in the Army before retiring in 2009. An Army investigation conducted in 2007 found he committed adultery with at least two women – a crime under military law – and falsified a legal document, according to The News and Observer. The Army declined to penalize Tata, and Tata provided his military records to the News and Observer, which showed glowing reviews from his tenure.                  After his tenure in the Army, Tata worked as the chief operating officer for District of Columbia Public School district from 2009 to 2011 and later as the superintendent of Wake County’s public schools in North Carolina from 2011 to 2012. Later, he served as North Carolina’s transportation secretary. Tata is also the author of a dozen military adventure books and is best known for his “Threat” series.                  In 2018, Tata falsely said Obama was a “Muslim” and a “terrorist” while on Twitter, writing “Obama normalized Islam for America.”                  After a Twitter user wrote to him that “Obama was not a terrorist sympathizer,” Tata replied, “No he was just a terrorist leader,” adding in another tweet, “He gave $150B to #1 state sponsor of terror so they could destroy Israel.”                 The Obama administration did not give $150 billion to Iran. The deal, which was approved by six countries and the European Union, gave Iran access to its own frozen assets and it’s unclear how much those assets were worth.                  In another Twitter engagement, Tata reiterated that Obama was a terrorist because of his dealings with Iran, noting that the only joke was that it was considered a conspiracy theory.                  “I was joking! Of course it’s not a conspiracy theory. He did more to harm US vital interests and help Islamic countries than any president in history. The Iran deal alone is more than enough evidence of his drive to subvert US national interests to Islam and a globalist agenda,” Tata wrote.                  In a follow-up tweet, Tata wrote Obama “is a Muslim who got other countries involved via corporate greed to support a regime (Mullahs) that sponsors anti West hatred and violence using money US unfroze or gave. He made no secret of his belief that a weaker America made for a stronger world.” After a user said there was no evidence that Obama was a Muslim, Tata replied, “Other than him saying he is, no.”                 Obama has written extensively about his Christian faith and has never claimed to be a Muslim.                 Tata made similar comments about Obama while appearing on radio programs in 2017 and 2018.                 During a radio appearance from 2018, Tata called Obama an anti-Semite who wanted to give Iran money so the country could fund terrorist organizations, and that unlike Obama, Trump wanted to defeat ISIS.                  “The reason Obama did that was he wanted nothing to impact his Iran nuclear deal because what he wanted was Iran to be flushed with cash so that they could support Hezbollah and Hamas and their fight against Israel because Obama is an anti-Semite,” said Tata. “That was all of the machinations of the Obama administration and he gave birth to ISIS and he also allowed what weapons of mass destruction to use in the Middle East. And so President Trump is simply allowing us to defeat ISIS now which Obama did not want to happen.”                 In a radio appearance from March 2017, Tata said Obama “really disliked Israel” and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and speculated that the Iran deal was born “sorta from [Obama’s] Islamic roots to help Iranians and the greater Islamic state crush Israel.”                 “I think President Obama really disliked Israel and [I] know he disliked Netanyahu. I think this was in part, you know, sorta from his Islamic roots to help the Iranians and the greater Islamic state crush Israel,” said Tata on the radio show. “If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s probably a duck. And so that was what Obama did. He propped up our enemies and the Islamic world, and he undercut Netanyahu in Israel.”                  In addition to disparaging Obama, Tata also criticized Democratic politicians who have vocally criticized Trump, including Waters and Pelosi in June 2018, after Waters called for people to confront and harass Trump Cabinet members in response to families being separated at the southern border.                 Tata wrote that Waters and Pelosi, the Financial Services Committee chairwoman and House speaker, respectively, “have always been the same violent extremists” and that Trump threatened their election prospects.                  In another tweet from June 2018, Tata called Waters a “vicious race baiting racist who made her chops by fanning the flames of LA Riots after the Rodney King incident. Doubtful she’ll change from what has always worked for her and made her a multimillionaire. Media is scared to touch that third rail so she’ll keep on going.”                  Tata also used a racist hashtag against CNN’s Lemon. In April 2018, Tata tweeted his support for then-Fox News personalities Diamond and Silk as they demanded a retraction from Lemon after he played clips of the duo testifying in front of Congress.                  “Have to love #northcarolina ladies @DiamondandSilk calling out @donlemon #liberalplantation #MAGA,” tweeted Tata.     This story has been updated to reflect that Tata deleted several of his tweets after the publication of this report.   CNN’s Ryan Browne contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/health/vicarious-racism-wellness/index.html,Vicarious racism: You don’t have to be the target to be harmed,"Police brutality on video, flame and riots on our smartphones. You don’t have to be the victim of racism to be harmed by it, experts say.","May 31, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Sandee LaMotte,International,"Watching the unsettling video of George Floyd crying out for his mother while gasping for air made Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, “relive her son’s death.”             Put in a choke hold by a New York City police officer in 2014, Garner’s cry of “I can’t breathe,” became a symbol of the Black Lives Matter protest movement.                 Six years later, flame and smoke fill the night skies in cities across America as protestors demand justice for Floyd, the unarmed and handcuffed black man in Minneapolis who died after gasping “I can’t breathe” as a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck.     More recent video shows as many as three officers may have held him down.                 “No matter what he did, he wasn’t doing anything to threaten them, so why would they kill that young man? Just like they killed my son,” Carr told CNN on Wednesday.                 “I don’t condone violence, but I understand it,” said Carr days later, speaking out about the fires, looting and destruction happening in cities like Atlanta, Denver, Milwaukee and Minneapolis. Protests, some peaceful, others violent, have spread to at least 30 cities nationwide.                 “When something like this happens you just combust, everything just comes out,” Carr said.                 Angry demonstrators point to Floyd’s death as yet another example of brutal, systemic racism that has led to the recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home, and Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February.                  Witnessing acts of racism via video, radio or social media can produce fear, anger and outrage, but even those who don’t take to the streets can experience significant emotional distress.                 Experts call it “vicarious racism.” You don’t have to be the victim to be harmed.                 “I think of it as like a secondhand racism, similar to secondhand smoke,” said Chicago pediatrician Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the minority health, equity and inclusion committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics.                  “Even though you’re not the one to smoke or in this case to directly experience racism, you still might experience the negative health impacts,” she said.     Studies show that race-related stress is a significantly more powerful risk factor for poor mental health than stressful life events. It can contribute to anxiety disorders and depression. It can also impact heart rate, raise blood pressure and create chronically elevated levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, which can in turn lead to cardiovascular disorders and diseases.                 “Some people think only black and brown folks who see themselves as potential victims will identify and experience health impacts,” Heard-Garris said.                  “But we have data that shows despite color, if a person is exposed to racism, it hurts them too. It really actually hurts all of us.”                 There’s no doubt that African American and Latino families carry the biggest burden from systemic racism and police brutality.                  Black Americans are nearly three times more likely than are white Americans to be killed by police and five times more likely than white Americans to be killed unarmed, according to the Mapping Police Violence database, which has tracked police killings in the USA since 2013.     A study last year found nearly 40,000 of 103,710 black Americans – more than one-third –had been exposed to one or more police killings of unarmed black Americans in their state of residence in a three-month period prior to the survey. Feelings of stress, depression and problems with emotions increasedwith each additional killing.                 A 2018 Pew Research Center report found nearly four in 10 Latinos say they have been called offensive names or experienced discrimination or unfair treatment because they are Hispanic. Feelings of racial discrimination can lead to higher levels of psychological distress, suicidal thoughts, anxiety and depression, according to the American Psychological Association.                  Heard-Garris studies the impact of vicarious racism on health, especially children’s health. She says observing racism in the media or hearing about it from friends may transmit trauma to children as they imagine their parents, siblings or even themselves in place of the target.                 She published a systematic analysis of some 1,300 studies and found kids that experienced vicarious racism were more likely to have low self-esteem, use illicit substances, and suffer with anxiety and depressive symptoms.     Related articleHow do I make sure I'm not raising a white racist child?             “The biggest kind of health impacts are the behavioral health issues,” Heard-Garris said. “Some kids will show aggression and other negative behaviors. Others will go within and be socially withdrawn, be distant from others and not seek help when they really need it.”                 Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP’s statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health, points to images on social media that show young children at the protests happening around the country holding up signs “fearing they may be next.”                 “It’s going to have an impact on any child’s physical and emotion health,” Dougé said. “So we need to turn it off and really engage with our kids and make sure that they’re okay.”                 The same applies to adults who’ve seen agonizing images such as George Floyd’s arrest and death, and now feel fear, frustration or rage.                 “We also need to tune in to our own emotions as adults and check that we’re OK,” Dougé said. “And if we’re not OK, then we got to ask for help. We’ve got to get help to deal with the trauma and emotional impact of these images.”                 But adults also have a responsibility to stop the cycle of racism and violence, said Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website “Raising Equity” provides videos and resources on how people can cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids.                 “Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,” Banks said. “And if a person hasn’t done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.”                 It’s time to speak up and call racism what it is, Dougé said.                 “If as a human being, you understand that another human being debased, dehumanized and not treated like you are just because of the color of their skin, I think it’s important to feel something. I think is important to acknowledge privilege,” Dougé said.                 “I think it’s important to ask what am I not doing by being silent that perpetuates this? How do we open the door so that everyone sits at the table? That’s only done when each of us understands that we have the power to do that.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/world/religion-medicine-coronavirus-wellness-levin/index.html,When religion is dangerous for your health,"Scholar Jeff Levin says religion can heal and harm people, and we’re seeing both aspects play out during the pandemic.","May 1, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Daniel Burke,International,"The coronavirus pandemic has brought out the best and worst aspects of religion.                  Faith has inspired countless acts of generosity and goodwill while helping believers get through an extraordinarily scary and difficult time.                  But some believers, from Christians to Hasidic Jews, have flouted social-distancing guidelines, insisting that God will protect their congregation. And as in previous pandemics, some have gone looking for scapegoats to explain why God would allow such immense suffering.                 Jeff Levin, an epidemiologist and observant Jew who comes from a long line of esteemed rabbis, has studied – and lived at – the intersection of medicine and religion for decades.                  The Baylor University professor’s new book, “Religion and Medicine: A History of the Encounter Between Humanity’s Two Greatest Institutions,” is a comprehensive and fascinating look at the complex relationship between spirituality and healing.                  CNN spoke to Levin this week about how religion can both heal and harm, and how we’re seeing both aspects play out during the pandemic.      CNN: The way you write about the relationship between religion and medicine – how close they were at first and how far apart they seem now – made me think of a bitter divorce.             Levin: That’s a really good analogy. You can’t really tell the history of medicine without the history of religion and vice versa. Concerns about the healing of people go back to the origins of religion, and religions have been involved in the training of healers of both body and mind. As this relationship has evolved, we’ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly.      How are we seeing that relationship play out during this pandemic?              Faith is a positive force when it motivates people to think outside of themselves and be of service. When it makes people strike out at others and look for demons to blame, it’s doing a great disservice. Honestly, we have seen both. There are terrible messages from the pulpit warning about Chinese immigrants and, on the other side, some people are acting incredibly compassionately and ethically.      You point out that Jews were scapegoated during the Black Plague in Europe. We’re seeing some of that happen now with Asian Americans. Why is this idea so persistent?             People need to lash out, to have someone to blame when they feel that God has abandoned them. They think it must be someone else’s fault. I’m disappointed that more clergy and pastors aren’t speaking out about what’s going on. Some are making statements, but this to me is a social-justice teaching moment for people of faith. In any community where this kind of bigotry is going on it’s incumbent on the pastors to say something. If some of their congregants don’t like it, tough sh*t. At a certain point, you have to be bold.      At the same time, surveys point to an uptick in people’s reliance on their religion. It seems like faith is playing some sort of therapeutic role for many of us right now.             Yes, people are shut in their homes and looking for something to do, to feel better and not be in a reactive state all the time. And religion, in the broadest sense, can help people attain positive states of well-being. Religion is having this applied function that maybe is not always at the forefront of how people engage spirituality. The usual way is to think about it once a week and try to be a good person. Now it seems more vital, more personal, more urgent.      I wonder how long that will last. With past pandemics, did people’s reliance on religion wane as the contagion was contained?              I’ve read stuff saying that this pandemic will lead to a religious renaissance or another great awakening. On the other hand, I am cynical that there will be some scandal or a naked selfie and people will leave all this behind and be back to the same old mindlessness. Looking at past pandemics, like the Spanish Flu outbreak in 1918, once it was over it was really out of sight, out of mind. It wasn’t really talked about. And 100 million people lost their lives!      How did religious people respond to the Spanish Flu? Was there a surge in spirituality?             Absolutely. I think you could draw a direct line between that outbreak, combined with World War I, and the rebirth of modern millennialism. That is, an obsession with the Tribulation and Rapture that was not very visible before that. The beginning of End Times ministries came out of that outbreak and has remained in the public consciousness.      Some governors have labeled houses of worship essential services, others have not. Are they essential, in your opinion?             Well, on the one hand, I do believe that religious services are “essential,” in an existential sense. But this is an exceptional time that we are in and there are life-and-death considerations involved. So it seems prudent to be extra careful, lest our religious gatherings become vectors to propagate transmission of a pathogenic and virulent virus. Zoom and other platforms can work just fine for now in keeping communities of faith linked together virtually. Pastors who are violating restriction orders are possibly endangering the most vulnerable of their congregants. Do they really think that a loving God wants them to do something so foolish?     You write about Jesus’ healing ministry in your book. I wonder if some of the conservative resistance to medicine might be rooted in the idea that Jesus will heal them, too, so they don’t need vaccinations or doctors?             It’s fascinating to me that people would think that seeking medical care is somehow disobedient to God. Almost like it’s blasphemous. It’s bizarre. For Jews, one of the ways that God heals is by providing men and women of science who can help keep us well. I don’t think there’s anything implicit within Christianity to not seek medical care because of Jesus. I have heard during this outbreak some people say, “Jesus is my vaccine.” Well, OK, I can be respectful of that, but at the same time you need to not congregate with hundreds of people in a room.      What do you make of the Pew Center study that showed pretty wide gaps between Christians and atheists/agnostics in their approach to triage – specifically, who should get ventilators?             The Pew findings are provocative and ring true to me. I find them unsurprising, but as a religious believer I also find them troubling. (In the study, most religious people said ventilators in short supply should go to patients who need them most in the moment; while most non-religious people said they should go to patients with the highest chance of recovery.)                  In my opinion, utilitarian calculus doesn’t have a place in this kind of decision-making. We are morally beholden to respond to people in need when they present themselves to us, without attempting to parse which life is more or less valuable or worthy. There’s a very slippery slope from there to the totalitarian impulse to value some lives over others for reasons of political calculation.      Who has a bigger role determining morality in the medical field right now, religion or science?             I think it’s the goal of many secular scientists and organizations to push religious considerations completely out of the picture when it comes to determining what is or isn’t morally acceptable. This is a dangerous gambit. Without a gold standard of behavior, in the end anything goes. Sanctity of life can give way to political expediency or some other fashion.                  This isn’t a right-vs.-left thing; it’s about how we go about deciding what we should do and why and whether there are any eternal values that should govern these decisions. This conflict especially presents itself to us now in bioethics, where harsh and impersonal technological advances are driving the bus and leaving humanity and compassion out of the doctor-patient relationship.      Religion can heal, as the studies in your book show. It seems equally evident, though, that religion can kill, too.              Of course. Throughout history, personal faith and religious institutions have been a great force for good, motivating selfless behavior and compassion and magnificent works of service to others. At the same time, religious institutions and leaders have been sources of divisiveness and hate, and religious movements have existed throughout history which have targeted outsiders for destruction. Thousands of studies by now have shown that expressions of religious faith or spirituality are associated, on average, with all kinds of benefits for our well-being — less depression, less anxiety, even longevity in some studies. And sociologists and psychologists and economists and political scientists have documented the other ways that religion or faith has impacted humanity for the good.                  But at the same time, so many people have been harmed by religion. Emotionally abused, disfellowshipped or rejected, unfairly judged, left feeling diminished rather than uplifted. It’s hard to convince some people that religion is intrinsically a positive force when they experience themselves or their loved ones being abused or tortured or even killed in the name of religion. Honestly, religion isn’t a single unitary thing, and it’s not all good or all bad. It’s better thought of as a domain or dimension of life – a vessel that can be filled up with goodness that can nurture and comfort and even heal but can also be filled with sludge and sickness that can do vile things to people and ruin lives.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Naseerudin, 44, had gone to pick up some vegetables from his friend’s house in Humnabad, in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, when he says an officer stopped him on his scooter.                  Other vehicles were on the road, Naseerudin says – he believes he was stopped because of his religion.                 “I am an Imam, so I look and dress very Muslim. I also have a long beard,” he says. “The cop started hitting me and saying that it is because of me and my community that this disease is spreading.”                 Nagesh D L, police superintendent of Bidar district where Humnabad is located, says the officer has been suspended while an inquiry was conducted into the incident. Naseerudin says he called the police from hospital to make a statement, but Nagesh claims they did not receive any complaint.     Related article'They brought batons inside the mosque': Victims recount Delhi's worst sectarian violence in decades             Naseerudin is not alone. As fears of a widespread coronavirus outbreak mount in India, some of the country’s Muslims, who make up roughly 200 million of the country’s 1.3 billion population, have been targeted in Islamophobic attacks on the streets and online, and accused of spreading the virus.                 In the capital, New Delhi, for example, volunteers distributing ration kits to Muslim families say they face harassment from police and are scared to go out. In Punjab, Muslim milk producers say they have been threatened by villagers, their houses have been raided by police, and people are scared to buy their produce.                 At the center of the recent Islamophobia is a gathering of a conservative Muslim missionary group in New Delhi in mid-March, and led to a large, highly publicized cluster of coronavirus cases.                 While these incidents have been mostly isolated, the virus fears are only amplifying existing prejudices, playing into growing Hindu nationalism which in recent years has seen India’s Muslim societies increasingly marginalized.                 Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was reelected in a landslide victory last year, many Indian Muslims say his emphasis on empowering India’s Hindu majority has left them feeling like second-class citizens in their own country.                  Under Modi, the majority-Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir has been stripped of its autonomous status, nearly two million people in India’s northeast Assam state, which shares a long border with Muslim-majority Bangladesh, were left off a controversial new National Register of Citizens, which critics feared could be used to justify religious discrimination against Muslims there, and a divisive new law has been enacted which gives Indian citizenship to asylum seekers from three neighboring countries – but not if they are Muslim.                 In February, that same law, which critics say is an example of the government’s Hindu nationalist agenda, sparked deadly clashes in the capital.                  It was in that environment that a Muslim group’s gathering became a focus of India’s coronavirus outbreak.                 Between March 13 and 15, the group called Tablighi Jamaat, which focuses on encouraging Muslims to return to practicing the religion as the Prophet Muhammad did, met in New Delhi.                 Thousands of members had traveled from across India and abroad to the event at the Nizamuddin Markaz mosque – the group’s global headquarters – in central Delhi.                 After the event, delegates – who had dispersed – began to fall sick with Covid-19 and Indian officials embarked on a widespread effort to trace, identify and test attendees and their families. As of Saturday, 4,291 cases had been linked to the gathering, across 23 states and union territories, according to health authorities. That amounted, as of April 20, to nearly a quarter of all Covid-19 cases reported so far in India.                 While the meeting was held before the official nationwide lockdown on March 25, the Indian Ministry of Health had advised all states on March 6 to avoid mass gatherings.                  A day after Modi announced a citizens’ curfew on March 22, Tablighi Jamaat followers were still in their headquarters. Event organizers said in a statement that when the curfew was put in place, the event was “discontinued immediately.”                 “Due to the sudden cancelation of rail services across the country on March 21, a large group of visitors who had to depart by way of rail got stuck in the Markaz premises,” organizers said.                   The Delhi police are even weighing criminal charges against the group, which has denied it broke any law. The event organizers also say that they acted within medical guidelines by not allowing its stranded visitors to roam the streets.                 Other gatherings had also gone ahead in this time period – both sessions of Parliament, for example, were on until March 23.                 Even after the lockdown was announced, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath traveled to Ayodhya and participated in a Hindu ritual, reportedly surrounded by at least 20 people. Speaking to local media, Adityanath’s media advisor Mrityunjay Kumar said the meeting was held early in the morning when most people were asleep and that there were around 10 people present.                 After the cluster of coronavirus cases from the Tablighi Jamaat meeting emerged, some members of Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) officials began equating the meeting to terrorism.                 On Twitter, the head of the BJP’s information and technology unit, Amit Malviya, called the gathering part of an “Islamic insurrection.” Sangeet Som, a state-level BJP lawmaker, reportedly said the meeting was “corona terrorism,” and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, BJP minister for minority affairs accused the event organizers on Twitter and local television of a“Talibani crime.”                 The lawyer for the head of the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi, Maulana Mohd. Saad, declined to comment on the issue.                 Sanjay Kapoor, political commentator and editor of independent political magazine Hardnews said questions should be asked about why the attendees were not checked at the airports when arriving for the event, despite the government saying it was screening those coming from countries affected by coronavirus.                 “I think there was a certain amount of laziness or complicity through the state. All these people came through immigration and surely if they were infected, why weren’t they checked especially when the government has been saying it’s been tracking people coming into India from early March,” he said.                 In the days after the Delhi mosque cluster was reported by the Indian media, a series of Islamophobic hashtags gained traction on social media, including #CoronaJihad, #CrushTablighiSpitters and #BioJihad.                 Rumors, misinformation and videos claiming Muslims were deliberately spreading Covid-19 were widely shared, fanning already inflamed religious tensions in the country.     Related articleUnder India's caste system, Dalits are considered untouchable. The coronavirus is intensifying that slur             “We have observed a deliberate pattern to delegitimize the community,” Alt News, an Indian nonprofit fact-checking website, said. “All these videos have been used to call for a boycott of the community, especially the lower economic sections of the society such as vegetable and fruit vendors. This act of communalizing a pandemic is disturbing as well as dangerous.”                 Wajahat Habibullah, former chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities who remains a vocal leader on minority rights, said: “It is shameful that the safety of the Muslim community has been compromised during Covid-19.                  “We should all work together to combat the disease, instead we are targeting a certain community,” he said.                  Offline, Muslims across India with no connection to the gathering in New Delhi say they were targeted as India’s response to the virus ramped up.                 Mohammed Shukrdeen, a milk producer belonging to the Gujjar community in the state of Punjab, almost 200 miles from where the event took place, said that his entire community was impacted by rumors following the Tablighi Jamaat event, in two ways.                 “First, no one wanted to buy milk from us, and second, local authorities would raid our houses to see if anyone of us had either visited the Jamaat in Delhi or if we were hiding others who had come,” Shukrdeen, who says he had no connection to the gathering, said. “The villagers threatened the dairy where we sell milk and the dairy stopped buying our milk. This meant a huge loss for us.”                 Shukrdeen couldn’t take the emotional and financial stress and says he went to speak to the village heads about the ostracization of his community. A video he recorded of the meeting was picked up online and police then intervened to help. Shukrdeen said they reached an agreement that the milk sold by the Muslim community would be bought by the dairy and that they will be allowed to continue their business.                 Still, the damage to their finances and reputation was done.

Mohammed Sakeb, 28, organizes a campaign that distributes ration kits to Muslim families, especially those affected by recent inter-communal riots in north-east New Delhi.                  Sakeb said he and his volunteers often face harassment when they go out despite having passes allowing them to travel, deliver food and serve marginalized communities during the lockdown.                 “The other day a 25-year-old volunteer was distributing rations to the worst affected Muslim families. The police stopped him, didn’t ask any questions and then started hitting him. He had to run away,” he said.                 CNN was unable to reach the police for comment.                 Sakeb said most of his volunteers areafraid to go out now. “Those of us who dress with our skull caps and have long beards, we instantly get targeted,” he said.                  Experiences from people like those interviewed by CNN have been widely reported in Indian media.                  The Organization of Islamic Cooperation in a statement expressed “deep concern” about “rising anti-Muslim sentiments and Islamophobia within political and media circles and on mainstream and social media platforms.”                 The Minority Affairs Minister Naqvi said that everybody’s “cultural, social, religious” rights were “completely safe and secure.”                 “As far as India is concerned and the Indian government or Indian Constitution is concerned, we are completely committed for the socio-economic, educational and religious rights and upliftment for every section of society including minorities and Muslims,” he said.                 Naqvi called the harassment and attacks isolated cases and said, “the people who are doing all these things is not correct.”                 Responding to whether calling the Jamaat gathering a “Talibani crime” would inflame tensions, Naqvi said: “Talibani crimes means it’s a serious criminal negligence and the peoples who … like the Talibanis, who never follow the rules.”                 In a post on LinkedIn on Sunday, Modi said Covid-19 presented a “common challenge.”                 “Covid-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking,” he said. “Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together.”                 Several Indian state leaders have condemned the spread of misinformation that’s targeting the Muslim community though many have stopped short of condemning the violence.

The two later met, and Dillon said Rashid’s act of kindness has forced him to examine his biases.","Mar 18, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Scottie Andrew,International,"Qasim Rashid has spent much of his life fighting for and defending human rights, first as a lawyer, then as a spokesman for the the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA.                  Oscar “Oz” Dillon held anti-Muslim views and often targeted his ire at Rashid, who’s running for Congress in Dillon’s district.                  The two were never supposed to find common ground, let alone form a friendship.                  But a small act of kindness led the two to meet – and forced Dillon to examine his bias.                  “He has opened my eyes to a whole new world about Islam,” Dillon told CNN.                  Rashid is running for Virginia’s District 1 seat in Congress as a Democrat, a public position that’s opened him up to heaps of Islamophobia.     Related articleA man is accused of sending a Twitter threat to lynch a Muslim state senate candidate. He's now been charged             At times, the comments have been dangerous: In December, a man was convicted for threatening to lynch Rashid when he was a candidate for state senate.                  But he’s still active on social media, defending his policy positions and engaging with hundreds of thousands of followers. He criticizes President Donald Trump and his conservative opponents.                  It’s where he met Dillon. Dillon had tweeted critical, often offensive comments at Rashid since his first campaign for state senate.                  In response to a recent tweet from Rashid about education funding, the 66-year-old sent a tweet with an offensive meme about Islam.                 Rashid told CNN the meme was “highly offensive, deeply hurtful and frankly dangerous.”                 He doesn’t usually indulge offensive comments on Twitter, but Dillon’s tweet stung. He was about to reply with links to teach Dillon why his misconceptions about Islam were incorrect.                  But when he clicked on Dillon’s profile and saw a GoFundMe link in his bio, he took a different approach.                 “Idk who [Dillon] is but he tweeted a deeply hurtful & false attack on me for my faith,” Rashid tweeted. “My faith instead teaches me to serve all humanity—so Ive [sic] donated $55 to his GoFundMe to help him & his family cover crushing medical debt.”                 He asked his 290,000 followers to do the same.                  Dillon told CNN that he’s held anti-Muslim views since the 9/11 attacks, so he was shocked that the Muslim candidate had treated him with such kindness.                  “The vitriol I put against him during his campaign last year … that he would research me and reach out to me, it absolutely flabbergasted me,” he said.                  Dillon started the GoFundMe to cover his wife’s medical bills. She had a double pulmonary embolism in 2018, and while he said she’s improved, she still uses a walker to get around the house and isn’t a candidate for surgery because of her condition.                 Dillon sent the GoFundMe link to his conservative delegates and none of them donated.                  “Not a one came back to me,” he said. “But Qasim, who I derided, poked fun at and was horribly humiliated and humbled by, is reaching out. He took the time to look into why I was doing this and who I am.”                 After Rashid shared Dillon’s GoFundMe page, hundreds of his supporters poured donations into relieving Dillon’s medical debt.                  It stunned him.                  He immediately emailed Rashid apologizing for his comments and thanking the candidate for his donation. He asked if Rashid would meet him at his home so he could plant a campaign sign in his yard.                  So they met, first at Dillon’s home, then over coffee. Dillon admitted how little he understood about Islam and how much of what he believed was incorrect.                  “We’ve come to understand each other, speaking with a sense of stability,” Rashid said. “He wanted to be supportive however he could.”                  With Rashid’s help, Dillon raised over $22,000 on GoFundMe, more than his goal. He’ll use the funds for a new wheelchair for his wife and donate the rest to St. Jude and the American Heart Association.                 Dillon still tweets his political opinions loudly. But he’s stopped sending anti-Muslim tweets. He’s considering voting for Rashid, something unthinkable just last month.                  “I think of Qasim as a patriot,” Dillon said. “What is a patriot? Someone who does for the good of the community.”                  Rashid said Dillon is committed to improving and learning more about his biases. He never expected his digital act of good would lead them to meet and discuss their differences.                  “You can’t expect marginalized communities or people of color to educate all the time,” he said. “It’s exhausting. But I don’t see it as additional work. I see it as the work I signed up to do.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The Gender Social Norms Index, which measures how social beliefs affect gender equality, was released by the United Nations Development Programme on Thursday.

It also found that 28 percent of men and women believe that men are justified to beat their wives.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/politics/fact-check-bloomberg-nypd-muslim-surveillance/index.html,Fact check: Bloomberg falsely claims NYPD only entered mosques when invited in,"Facts First: Mosques and other Islamic organizations were surveilled without consent during the Bloomberg mayoralty that began in 2002, including with secret informants and undercover officers.","Feb 25, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Daniel Dale,International,"Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg was challenged late last year about the New York Police Department’s widespread surveillance of Muslims when he was mayor of New York City.                  He responded dishonestly.                 In an exchange filmed in December but tweeted out only last week, Bloomberg told Sarah Pearson, a Milwaukee activist and organizer who is also a supporter of rival candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, that he is a strong supporter of the Muslim community and its rights. He also claimed: “We only went into mosques when they asked us to come in.”                 When Pearson pressed him further on the surveillance, Bloomberg said the police “only went in when the mosque or the imam asked … period. End of story.”     Facts First: Mosques and other Islamic organizations were surveilled without being asked or notified during the Bloomberg mayoralty that began in 2002, including with secret informants and undercover officers. Muslim leaders in New York City and in New Jersey, where the NYPD also conducted surveillance, say Bloomberg’s claim that the police went into mosques only when invited in is categorically false. Adam Goldman, a journalist who won the Pulitzer Prize as part of an Associated Press team that exposed the surveillance program, says the same. At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN’s home for Facts First.             “That statement is totally false. The NYPD surveillance of the Muslim community was warrantless and it was covert in nature,” said Imam Al-Hajj Talib Abdur-Rashid of New York’s Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood, who is a former president of the Islamic Leadership Council of New York.                 “The statement that the former mayor is making is completely untrue,” said Imam W. Deen Shareef, convener of the Council of Imams in New Jersey. “None of the mosques and none of the organizations, for that matter – none of the schools that were placed under the surveillance – were contacted, and none of the leaders within the Muslim community here in New Jersey had any knowledge whatsoever of the New York Police Department having any interest in looking for or investigating or questioning anyone about whatever it is they were looking for.”                 Bloomberg’s campaign did not respond to requests for an explanation of his remarks. The NYPD declined to comment.                 As the Associated Press reported in its series of Pulitzer-winning articles in 2011, the Bloomberg-era NYPD surveilled mosques in various uninvited ways for years after 9/11 – from creating a network of mosque informants to sending in undercover officers to mounting surveillance cameras on nearby light poles to shooting photos of people arriving to pray and collecting their license plate numbers.                  Bloomberg’s claim “is so plainly, demonstrably untrue that it would be almost laughable had it not been for the devastating effects that unwarranted NYPD surveillance had on American Muslim communities in New York City and beyond,” said Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at the City University of New York who directs the CLEAR (Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility) project that represented the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits against the surveillance program.                 It is possible that Bloomberg, who took office about three-and-a-half months after 9/11, was referring to occasions on which police leaders and officers were invited into mosques for meetings or gatherings. Before the Associated Press broke the news about the surveillance program in 2011, “imams and mosques throughout the city were really very open and welcoming to NYPD,” said Abdur-Rashid.                 But Bloomberg had been asked specifically about surveillance. Though loud music was playing in the background as he spoke with Pearson at the opening of a campaign office in Milwaukee, he made clear that he heard that this is what she was talking about.                 And the NYPD secretly surveilled even mosques and imams who had invited the NYPD in for other reasons. For example, the Associated Press reported, Sheikh Reda Shata, formerly of a mosque in Brooklyn, invited NYPD officers for breakfast, threw parties for officers leaving the precinct and dined with Bloomberg at the mayor’s official mansion. But Shata, who had no criminal past, was being watched by an undercover officer and informant, and his mosque was being watched too.                   “The book details an extensive clandestine effort to monitor many mosques across the city using informants and undercover officers,” said Goldman, now a reporter with The New York Times, who co-authored the book “Enemies Within”about the surveillance program.                  Pearson said her exchange with Bloomberg took place on December 21, 2019. She said she tweeted the two video clips of the exchange last Wednesday because of a hashtag that has been circulating, #AskBloomberg, which encouraged the moderators at Bloomberg’s first Democratic debate to ask him tough questions.                 “I had held back because I didn’t want my questioning of his record to be viewed as something I was doing simply because I support another candidate,” she said.                 Goldman said the surveillance program began in 2002, the year Bloomberg took office, after the NYPD hired a veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency as its first deputy commissioner for intelligence.                 The surveillance extended far beyond mosques, touching thousands of innocent Muslim residents in other locations. According to the Associated Press reporting, the NYPD eavesdropped in cafes, sending plainclothes officers to query people about their views on political and international issues. The NYPD placed undercover officers at Muslim student associations. And the NYPD recorded mundane details of the daily lives of Muslims, such as where they played chess or where they shopped for groceries.                 It is possible that there is a case in which an imam did make some sort of private request to the NYPD. But Bloomberg’s suggestion that surveillance happened exclusively with the permission of imams is clearly inaccurate.                 Under Bloomberg’s successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York City settled three lawsuits over the surveillance program. The city agreed to tighten guidelines for investigations related to political or religious activity protected by the First Amendment, which a judge had weakened in 2003. It also agreed to significantly greater oversight of such investigations through the appointment of a “civilian representative,” who is empowered to tell the court at any time if police are violating the guidelines.                  The New York City Council also took action against Bloomberg’s wishes during the final months of his mayoralty in 2013. In response to complaints about both the surveillance of Muslims and the policy of “stop and frisk,” which disproportionately targeted black and Latino residents, the council voted to appoint an inspector general to serve as a watchdog over NYPD activities – overriding Bloomberg’s veto.                  As with stop and frisk, Bloomberg defended the surveillance of Muslims as mayor; he said in 2012, “We have to keep this country safe.” But while he has been apologizing for stop and frisk since November 2019, the month he launched his presidential campaign, he has not issued apologies for the surveillance program.                 Bloomberg’s campaign did not respond when asked if he would apologize or has any regrets over the program.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The wide-ranging report, compiled by the UN Monitoring Team that tracks the global jihadi terror threat, refers to the group by its alternate name stating the “Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), following its loss of territory, has begun to reassert itself in both the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, mounting increasingly bold insurgent attacks, calling and planning for the breakout of ISIL fighters in detention facilities and exploiting weaknesses in the security environment of both countries.”                  It has been clear for some time that one reason for ISIS’s resilience is its deep pockets, with overheads reduced now the group no longer administers a large state. The report said that according to one of the more conservative assessments by UN member states, ISIS still has $100 million in reserves.      Related articlePentagon report says ISIS is 're-surging in Syria' following Trump's troop withdrawal             “The period from July to September 2019 saw an acceleration of the reconstitution of ISIS as a covert network in the Syrian Arab Republic, mirroring what had happened in Iraq since 2017. Freed of the responsibility of defending territory, there was a notable increase in attacks in previously quiet areas held by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic around the country,” the report stated.                  The report noted: “The borders between Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic remain inadequately secured, allowing some movement of fighters between both jurisdictions. Recent developments east of the Euphrates have led to an increase of ISIL activity in Dayr al-Zawr and Hasakah Governorates and a spike in attacks targeting the United States led coalition and local non-State armed groups.”                  The report, which is based on information from UN member states, revealed that several of those states assess the new leader of ISIS is Amir Muhammad Said Abdal Rahman al-Mawla, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s deputy. It cautions the information has not yet been confirmed.                  For months mystery surrounded the real identity of ISIS’s new leader. A few days after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a US raid in Syria in October, ISIS named its new ‘caliph’ as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, a jihadi alias not then known among counter-terrorism analysts. In its announcement the terrorist group provided no meaningful detail that might provide clues about his real identity.                  After Baghdadi was killed and before ISIS named its new leader, CNN reported that some analysts believed al-Mawla would likely take over the leadership of the group.     Related articleInside the dramatic US military raid that killed ISIS leader Baghdadi              The finding that ISIS is regenerating under a new leader challenges the narrative emanating from the White House. Earlier this month President Donald Trump stated, “Three months ago, after destroying 100% of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims and all who stood in his way.”                 But the UN findings parallel the assessment of senior US counter-terrorism officials. “No one thinks that just with the demise of the physical caliphate that Daesh is finished, ” Jim Jeffrey, the US Special Representative for Syria and the Coalition to Defeat ISIS stated in a press conference last week, using an alternative name for ISIS. Jeffrey added that there were somewhere between 14,000-18,000 ISIS fighters “active between Syria and Iraq.”                   “They have shown in the past some reconstitution in Iraq, particularly in the area of Diyala and Kirkuk provinces. And to the south of the Euphrates, in areas where the Syrian regime should be responsible but largely is not, they’ve been quite active. So we are concerned,” he stated.                 The coalition’s ability to maintain pressure on ISIS has been complicated by the fallout from the January 3 US drone strike at Baghdad international airport which killed the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani and a leading Tehran-backed Iraqi militia commander. In his news conference last week, Ambassador Jeffrey stated that “Coalition operations have been primarily on pause in Iraq as we focus on force protection.” because of concern over potential reprisal attacks by pro-Tehran militias.      Related articleBaghdadi's successor likely to be Iraqi religious scholar             “Over time, obviously, there is a possibility of a degradation of the effort against Daesh if we’re not able to do the things that we were doing so effectively up until a few weeks ago,” Jeffrey added.                    The UN report makes clear Trump’s decision last autumn to draw down forces in Syria has created a greater risk of jail breaks by the thousands of ISIS fighters currently detained by Kurdish forces in northern Syria.                   “The reduction of forces of the United States of America has raised concerns among Member States regarding the ability of security forces currently active in the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic to maintain adequate control over a restive population of detained ISIL fighters, as well as family members.”                  The report estimated 10,000 male fighters remain in these facilities, including 2,000 foreign terrorist fighters and warns female detainees are playing a leading role in radicalizing those detained in the facilities. The report stated “the current improvised holding arrangement are a recipe for radicalization and despair, especially in the case of minors.”                 On October 22, during the tumultuous period which followed the Turkish incursion into Kurdish controlled areas of northern Syria and the US announcing it was drawing down troops in the area, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told CNN, “Of the 11,000 or so detainees that were in prisons in northeast Syria, we’ve only had reports of a little bit more than a hundred that have escaped.”                  According to the UN report, the number of escapees ended up being higher. “Member States estimate that several hundred individuals associated with ISIL, including fighters, escaped from their accommodations in October, although it is not clear how many were redetained, how many remained at large and whether there was any significant change to the associated threat.”                 If al-Mawla is one and the same as “al-Qurashi” and is the new leader of ISIS, he is likely to become one of the world’s most wanted men. In August the US State Department’s Rewards for Justice program offered a reward of up to $5 million for al-Mawla’s capture, describing him as a “potential successor” to Baghdadi, while listing an alias as “Hajji Abdallah.”                 This assessment persisted after Baghdadi’s demise. The day before ISIS announced their new leader in late October, Russell Travers, the acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center, testified that Hajji Abdallah was a potential successor.                  The State Department listing further stated that Mawla/Hajji Abdallah, “was a religious scholar in ISIS’s predecessor organization, al-Qa’ida in Iraq (AQI), and steadily rose through the ranks to assume a senior leadership role for ISIS. As one of ISIS’s most senior ideologues, Hajji Abdallah helped drive and justify the abduction, slaughter, and trafficking of the Yazidi religious minority in northwest Iraq and is believed to oversee some of the group’s global terrorist operations.”                 Much of the Yazidi community lived in Sinjar which is close to what some analysts believe was Mawla’s hometown of Tal Afar in northern Iraq. In 2014, after ISIS had taken Tal Afar and Mosul, the group enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and children and murdered thousands of Yazidi men, in what the United Nations has called a genocide.     Related articleHow Trump's decision unfolded to kill a top Iranian general             The 2019 “testimony” of a former ISIS operative which was archived by the researcher Aymenn al-Tamimi points to Mawla/Hajji Abdallah’s involvement in ISIS’s oppression of the Yazidis.                  “The attack was carried out on the city of Sinjar and it was conquered … and the Yezidis were brought together and it was said to them: ‘All the men who convert to Islam will be spared from killing, and the women will spared from being taken captive’ … And the one who gave them the pact is al-Hajj Abdullah.”                  The former ISIS operative even included a footnote making clear “al-Hajj Abdullah” was Baghdadi’s deputy. Tamimi also points to an internal ISIS document from 2018 in which a member of the group writes to Mawla about an ideological dispute. The letter (which for the record used the alias al-Hajj Abdullah) repeatedly described him as “the deputy” to Baghdadi.                 As CNN has previously reported, there are suggestions Mawla is of Turkmen origin. If he is, that may have complicated his path to the top job. Iraqi Arabs have for the most part dominated ISIS’s leadership ranks. There were also other hurdles Mawla faced. It is widely believed among jihadis that any “Caliph” must have certain credentials.                 One is that he must be descended from the Prophet Mohammed’s Quraysh tribe. Another is the requirement to have significant knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence. His track record as a “religious scholar” within the terrorist group may allow Mawla to persuade jihadis of his theological pedigree – but it’s unclear that he has Quraysh lineage.                 According to the UN report, Mawla’s “Turkmen ethnicity led some Member States to assess that he might only be a temporary choice until the group finds a more legitimate “emir,” a direct descendant from the Quraysh Hashemite tribe who could therefore command the full support of the remote provinces.”     Related articlePompeo stonewalls as evidence emerges of possible surveillance of ex-Ukraine ambassador             This brings up the possibility that ISIS are deliberately keeping Mawla’s elevation to the top position secret out of concern he may not be seen by jihadis around the world as a legitimate caliph.                 But it is not clear how sustainable this will be for the terrorist group. Although pledges of allegiance have flowed into the new leader from fighters purporting to belong to ISIS satellites around the world, ISIS could risk losing support if they do not provide more biographical detail about their new leader.                  “ISIL will face a challenge over the longer term to enthuse its supporters, especially those in more remote locations, about the new leader without putting him in danger by having him communicate more directly and confirm his identity,”  the UN report states.                  The picture the report paints of the global terror threat picture is that it has reduced overall since 2015-2017 when ISIS still controlled significant swaths of Syria and Iraq and launched and instigated a wave of attacks around the world. But there is also significant concern over the resilience of ISIS and its worldwide satellites, as well as the potential threat posed by the al-Qaeda network.                  The report stated that “Al -Qaida affiliates are stronger than ISIL in many conflict zones, especially the Sahel, Somalia, Yemen and the north-west of the Syrian Arab Republic.”                  It warned that in West Africa, the combined efforts of al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates “are threatening the stability of fragile Member States in the region.”                 The report stated that “ISIL appears not to have regenerated its external operational planning capability, although documents have emerged in the Syrian Arab Republic concerning a plan within ISIL to reconstitute its office to assist operatives in Europe with planning and executing attacks. Despite weaknesses in the current structure, the threat of a planned complex attack in Europe, especially by former expert operatives who have the ability to operate independently, is assessed to persist.”                  It reported that ISIS “suffered a setback to its ability to inspire attacks in November 2019, with the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) operation with several Internet companies that resulted in the removal of large quantities of ISIL online material, especially from Telegram’s instant messaging platform.”      Related articleIran drives another stake into the heart of the nuclear deal             In assessing the al-Qaeda threat, the report focused particular attention on Hurras al-Deen (HAD), a group of 3,500 to 5,000 al-Qaeda loyalists currently based in the Idlib province of Syria. “One Member State in the region assessed that HAD, given its size, ideology and the capabilities of its veterans, presented a growing threat to peace and security regionally and globally, and that its leadership plans to revive external operations targeting Western and United States interests wherever possible.”                 The report noted that “one Member State, however, highlighted Al-Qaida’s conservative approach to expenditure and its consistent prioritization of administrative costs and salaries over operations. The ambitions of Al-Qaida affiliated elements in Idlib Province to plan and execute international attacks are assessed to be curtailed both by the military pressure they are under and by Al-Qaida’s reluctance to resource such activity.”                 The report said that “Afghanistan continues to be the conflict zone of greatest concern to Member States outside the ISIL core area and suffers by some measures the heaviest toll from terrorism of any country in the world. Al-Qaida and foreign terrorist fighters aligned with it, under the protection and influence of the Taliban, pose a long -term global threat.”                 According to the UN relations between al-Qaeda (whose fighters are estimated between 400 and 600 in Afghanistan) and the Taliban “continue to be close and mutually beneficial, with Al-Qaida supplying resources and training in exchange for protection.” The UN Monitors identified a pressing priority for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan: do everything possible to spoil a potential peace deal in the country. It noted that “Al-Qaida is concerned about the current focus of the Taliban leadership on peace talks. Al-Qaida representatives undertook shuttle diplomacy, persuading various factions of the Taliban and field commanders not to support negotiations with the Government of Afghanistan and promising to increase financial support.”                 The terrorist attack in the vicinity of London Bridge in November 2019 by a convicted terrorist the year after his release underlined the threat posed by the many terrorist convicts and radicalized inmates who are due to be released from European prisons in the coming years. According to the report, “many of the foreign terrorist fighters who received relatively short sentences upon their return to Europe prior to 2015 are expected to be released in the coming period. Some are still assessed to be dangerous. One member state reported that approximately 1,000 returnees were due for release in Europe in 2020.”                  The UN report warned that “the issue of foreign terrorist fighters remains acute, with Member States continuing to assess that between one half and two thirds of the more than 40,000 who joined the ‘caliphate’ are still alive. This is expected to aggravate the global threat posed by ISIL, and possibly Al-Qaida, for years to come.”                 It has long been clear that identifying and interdicting ISIS veterans should be a key priority for the international community. But the report warns that the “timely detection and identification of foreign terrorist fighters returning to Europe is complicated by their various travel routes and measures taken to avoid detection.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Follow her on Twitter and Instagram. The views expressed are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. President Donald Trump has often shown his deeply anti-Muslim bigotry and Islamophobia. But just when you think he couldn’t make already vulnerable Muslim-Americans — especially our fellow Iranian-Americans — any more vulnerable than we already are, Trump one-ups himself.                 On Monday, the President retweeted a blatantly doctored, fake image of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer in Middle Eastern garb together in front of an Iranian flag. In the image, Pelosi is wearing a hijab and Schumer has a turban on his head with “Democrats 2020” written on the bottom of the image. The tweet accompanying the photo reads “the corrupted Dems trying their best to come to the Ayatollah’s rescue.”                  Trump retweeted the image from an anonymous account with the alias “D0wn_Under,” which has previously tweeted out other conspiracy theories around Pelosi and Iran.                  Trump didn’t stop with just one deeply offensive, anti-Muslim tweet. Other tweets he sent included one showing a graphic picture of what appeared to be a man’s mutilated body, along with the claim that Pelosi “supports this mullahs’ crime.” The tweet was later removed and replaced, according to the Washington Post, with a note saying it “violated the Twitter Rules.”                 All of this is a new low, even for the impeached president who is infamous for making low blows, and it’s a new low for the people who work for him. Trump’s tweeting the racist pictures show that this president apparently believes portraying someone as Muslim and as sympathetic to a Muslim country is a good way to insult them. Making fun of Islamic clothing, reducing the world’s roughly 1.6 billion Muslim population to turbans and veils is offensive and incorrect, especially considering not all Muslims choose to cover or wear religious headgear.      Related articleWhy Trump's photoshopped Pelosi tweet reveals his true nature             Instead of trying to apologize for her boss’s tweets, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham went on Fox News and defended Trump’s decision to amplify the tweet, stating he did what he did to make a point.                   “I think the president is making clear that the Democrats have been parroting Iranian talking points and almost taking the side of terrorists and those who were out to kill the Americans,” she said. “I think the president was making the point that the Democrats seem to hate him so much that they’re willing to be on the side of countries and leadership of countries who want to kill Americans.”                  Even if we were to seriously consider Grisham’s point on Trump just lashing out at fellow US government officials for opposing his foreign policy, is it ever OK to insult your opponents using Islamophobic slurs?                  No matter what point Grisham claims Trump is making, his tweets make it clear to the world that the president of the United States thinks that what millions of Americans believe in and how they dress are slurs. This is absolutely unacceptable, and Congress needs to demand that Trump apologize to Muslims at home and abroad.      Related articleAnthropologist: Why Trump's threat is unthinkable             Furthermore, during such a sensitive period of renewed and heightened tensions with Iran, Trump is showing that he has no issue proffering anti-Muslim sentiments that put the lives of American Muslims and Iranian-Americans at risk. Recent studies have found Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise in the US. One study has even found that Trump’s tweets about Islam are correlated with anti-Muslim hate crimes.                   “It is unconscionable that an American president would mock Islam and Muslims in such a derogatory manner,” Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, told Newsweek in an emailed statement. “This type of bigoted message promoted by the President of the United States will serve to further endanger American Muslims, Sikhs and members of other faiths who wear recognizable religious attire.”                 Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League condemned as “outrageous” the tweet’s “repulsive anti-Muslim bigotry,” insisting that “an apology is in order ASAP.”                  Trump’s hateful and shameful tweets must be condemned by congressional lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Americans, Muslim and non-Muslims alike, are owed an apology for this filthy language coming from the highest level of our government.

But perhaps more important than pointing out and establishing Trump’s Islamophobic pattern is how we collectively as Americans respond to it.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/05/world/trump-iran-cultural-sites-war-crime/index.html,Trump’s threatened attack on Iranian cultural sites could be a war crime if carried out,"After an al-Qaeda affiliated group destroyed ancient religious monuments in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012, the International Criminal Court took on a unique criminal case: prosecuting cultural destruction.","Jan 6, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Eric Levenson,International,"After an al-Qaeda affiliated group destroyed ancient religious monuments in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012, the International Criminal Court took on a unique criminal case: prosecuting cultural destruction.                 Though it generally focuses on human rights violations, the ICC charged the leader of the jihadist group, Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, with a war crime for destroying cultural artifacts in Timbuktu.                 The case was the first criminal charge of its kind. It “breaks new ground for the protection of humanity’s shared cultural heritage and values,” UNESCO Secretary-General Irina Bokova said at the time. Al-Mahdi eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine years in prison.                 That case has renewed relevance amid the standoff between the United States and Iran days after the United States killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in a targeted drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq, on Friday.                 In a tweet Saturday night, Trump said that if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets, the United States has targeted 52 Iranian sites – a reference to the number of Americans taken hostage in the 1979 revolution – “some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture,” he wrote.     Related articleIraqi Parliament votes for government to work on plan to end US troop presence in Iraq after Soleimani killing             “They attacked us, & we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!” Trump wrote.                 Sunday, he reiterated that threat in a conversation with reporters aboard Air Force One.                  “They’re allowed to kill our people, they’re allowed to torture and maim our people, they’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people, and we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way,” Trump said, according to a pool report.                 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” avoided directly answering whether or not the United States was actually targeting cultural sites and defended Trump’s tweeted threat.                 “We will be bold in protecting American interests and we’ll do so in a way that is consistent with the rule of law. We’ve always done that, Jake, and President Trump’s tweet doesn’t deviate from that one iota,” he said.                 “So cultural centers are theoretically fair targets, in your view?” Tapper asked.                 “We’re going to do the things that are right and the things that are consistent with American law,” Pompeo said.                 However, an attack on a cultural site would violate several international treaties and would likely be considered a war crime.                  In 2017, for example, a United Nations Security Council resolution “condemns the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artifacts.” That resolution came as a response to the Islamic State’s destruction of a number of major historic and cultural sites in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and 2015.                 The UN was clear then that actions targeting cultural locations constituted a war crime.                 “The deliberate destruction of our common cultural heritage constitutes a war crime and represents an attack on humanity as a whole,” said the spokesman for then-UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2015.                 Nicholas Burns, former undersecretary of state for political affairs and ambassador to NATO, noted the Trump administration supported the 2017 UN resolution condemning destruction of cultural sites.                 “His threat is immoral and Un-American,” Burns wrote on Twitter.                 Hossein Dehghan, the main military adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, said Trump’s tweets are “ridiculous and absurd.” He told CNN that Iran’s response “will be military and against military sites.”                 If the United States does carry out Trump’s threat to strike any of Iran’s cultural sites, then “for sure no American military staff, no American political center, no American military base, no American vessel will be safe,” Dehghan said. “If he says 52, we say 300, and they are accessible to us.”                 In a tweet, Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said an attack on a cultural site is a war crime.                  “Having committed grave breaches of (international) law in Friday’s cowardly assassinations, (Trump) threatens to commit again new breaches of JUS COGENS,” he said, referring to the phrase for international law norms. “Targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME”                 “Those masquerading as diplomats and those who shamelessly sat to identify Iranian cultural & civilian targets should not even bother to open a law dictionary,” he continued. “Jus cogens refers to peremptory norms of international law, i.e. international red lines. That is, a big(ly) ‘no no.’”                 Two senior US officials on Sunday described to CNN’s Jim Sciutto widespread opposition within the Trump administration to targeting cultural sites in Iran.                 “Nothing rallies people like the deliberate destruction of beloved cultural sites. Whether ISIS’s destruction of religious monuments or the burning of the Leuven Library in WWI, history shows targeting locations giving civilization meaning is not only immoral but self-defeating,” one of the officials told CNN.     Related articleSenior US officials say there is widespread opposition within the Trump administration to targeting cultural sites in Iran              Another official who formerly worked in both the Trump and Obama administrations told CNN: “As a matter of principle, we as a nation and as a military do not attack the culture sites of any adversary.”                 Additionally, several sources told CNN there are no indications – aside, perhaps, from Trump’s tweet – that the United States would actually strike cultural sites in Iran.                 Colin Kahl, former deputy assistant to President Barack Obama and national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, expressed skepticism that there are actually cultural sites on the list of possible retaliatory sites.                 “For what it’s worth, I find it hard to believe the Pentagon would provide Trump targeting options that include Iranian cultural sites,” he tweeted. “Trump may not care about the laws of war, but (Department of Defense) planners and lawyers do…and targeting cultural sites is (a) war crime.”                 Iran has 22 UNESCO World Heritage cultural sites, including the ancient ruins of Persepolis, the historic Masjed-e Jameh mosque in Esfahan and the lavish Golestan Palace in Tehran.

The recent wave of nine violent anti-Semitic attacks in the New York area since mid-December, comes as hate crimes against the Jewish community and attacks on synagogues have increased in the US, the UK and elsewhere. Many politicians and media personalities have fanned the flames of hatred by mainstreaming antisemitism, promulgating conspiracy theorizing tropes about Jewish people and legitimizing hate groups who target racial and religious minorities and promote acts of violence against them.                 Some of the recent incidents include the killing of six people at a Jersey City, New Jersey kosher market by two assailants, one of whom allegedly expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, and a number of stabbings allegedly by a black man with a long history of mental illness at the home of a Monsey, New York rabbi on the last night of Hanukah.                 Responding to the sentiment that it is open season on the Jewish community in America and that lives are in danger, some have sought group punishment for the black community at large, blaming African Americans and even Jews of color for violence against white Jews. Others have blamed the attacks on all Black Israelites, including Rabbi Capers Funnye, a member of the Chicago Board of Rabbis and the chief rabbi of the International Israelite Board of Rabbis, who recently received a social justice award from the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs for his work against racism and antisemitism.     Morton Klein of the pro-Trump, MAGA-friendly Zionist Organization of America,  tweeted urging “all Rabbis and Pastors to use their podiums this weekend to preach against the vile frightening attacks/murders of African Americans against innocent Jewish women, children and men. Never Again!”                  Others have advocated for more policing of multiracial neighborhoods. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to beef up police patrols in Brooklyn neighborhoods of Boro Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg, noting that “Hate doesn’t have a home in our city” and that “Anyone who terrorizes our Jewish community WILL face justice.”                  Others still sought a return of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a group the Southern Poverty Law Center identifies as a racist-right terrorist organization, whose members have been responsible for attacks in the US and elsewhere.                 Indeed, these approaches are wrong: more policing, guns and violence to fight anti-Semitic hate crimes will not make people safer. It will endanger the lives of already marginalized groups who bear the brunt of discrimination and injustice.     Related articleAnti-Semitic attacks show a society at risk of falling apart             As an African-American man who is a member of the Jewish community, I know that more policing will not bring security or safety to my family or those who look like me. After the anti-Semitic, white supremacist attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, many Jewish places of worship across the nation sought greater security measures and a greater police presence.                  While an understandable response, such plans do not take into consideration the specific dangers faced by black people, who are viewed with suspicion and treated as potential criminals by the police. Increased security also fails to consider black Jews, who have been regarded as impostors, or potential criminals, who are not really Jewish and who do not belong in a synagogue.                  Take for example Yehudah Webster, a black man and a Jewish educator who, while walking in November 2018 with a Torah scroll outside his Crown Heights, Brooklyn apartment was reportedly surrounded and accosted by a mob of Hasidic men and security personnel. Or Jared Jackson, a black, multiheritage Jew and founder and executive director of Jews in All Hues, who notes that, when approaching synagogues, “I have had people call the police and observed mothers running away as I come near the building. Occasionally people stare and others try to educate me about how to read a siddur or explain the Hebrew.”                 Their experiences aren’t unique: Other black Jews have experienced being called schvartze – a derogatory Yiddish term for black – have been racially harassed by white Jews and treated like outsiders and interrogated to prove they are actually Jewish.     Related articleRudy Giuliani's anti-Soros tirade exposes three uncomfortable truths             In response to de Blasio’s call for increased policing, some Jewish groups pushed back. Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, an advocacy group in New York City, tweeted, “This is what dividing vulnerable communities looks like,” adding that “Instead of investing in restorative solutions that prioritize the safety of all communities, [de Blasio] is implementing a plan that treats abuse of Black and Brown communities as the answer to antisemitic violence. It isn’t.”      Jewish Voice for Peace, another advocacy group, emphasized the need for Jews to seek equality and freedom with allies, but said more cops are not the answer. “We know we have to address rising white nationalist violence – against Jews, Muslims, Black people and all people of color – while not relying on the very forces detaining and locking up and killing our friends, family & neighbors,” the group tweeted.                 And, as @TheHipsterRebbe, a Jewish man of color, noted, the police or the National Guard “may offer some minimal safety to Jews while inflicting worse damage to other ethnic minorities who at the same time have no such sympathy or respite from their own violence.”                 Rather than increased policing, the best way to fight these religious hate crimes is what Yousef Munayyer of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights calls “a broad, unified front of solidarity between all.”     Related articleTrump is trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes. It must stop             As black Jewish filmmaker and writer Rebecca Pierce noted, “There are people and orgs who are experts in community relationships and violence prevention” who are doing the work that “can be duplicated and amplified if we focus on building stronger communities rather than walls.”                 People must work together to solve hate with the knowledge that their suffering is interconnected. Visibly identifiable members of all religious groups, including Muslims and Orthodox Jews, have much in common in that they are easily targeted for violence. In the years since the election of Donald Trump, violent hate crimes have reached a 16-year high, and many communities feel it is open season on them.                 My children’s ancestors include black refugees who fled the South Carolina slave plantation police state during the Civil War, and Jewish refugees who fled the Russian pogroms in the 1880s. However different their circumstances, they bear similarities to the present-day Latinx, Caribbean and African refugees languishing at the border in ICE detention camps, or Muslims facing oppression in China or India – or America.

We must take lessons from interfaith organizations such as POWER, a Philadelphia-area coalition of congregants and faith leaders who organize to fight injustice and solve problems of common concern in their communities.

Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.“The week was supposed to start off with a rebuke of Omar's anti-Semitic comments and it ended up turning into a long list of other hateful actions,” House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News on Friday, saying the final product “fell short of addressing the real problem.”The House resolution, following aweek of Democratic infightingover the language, was approved on a 407-23 vote. The measure originally was drafted in response to Omar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, suggesting last week that Israel supporters want U.S. lawmakers to pledge “allegiance” to the Jewish state – which was widely condemned as echoing the age-old “dual loyalties” smear against Jewish politicians.ANTI-OMAR POSTER IGNITES OUTRAGE AT WEST VIRGINIA CAPITOLYet after Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced a rebellion in the ranks amid concerns the resolution would unfairly single out Omar, a Muslim, and increase security threats against her (she was recently the subject of an inflammatory posterat the West Virginia capitol falsely tying her to the 9/11 attacks), the resolution was overhauled.The result was a broad rebuke of bigotry, including anti-Semitism as well as “anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities” perpetrated by white supremacists and others. The resolution condemned “dual loyalty” accusations, but did not mention Omar by name.After its passage, Omar and her allies were able to cheer the resolution as a win against Islamophobia.“Today is historic on many fronts. It’s the first time we have voted on a resolution condemning Anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation’s history. Anti-Muslim crimes have increased 99% from 2014-2016 and are still on the rise,” Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Rep. André Carson, D-Ind., said in a joint statement. “We are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry including anti-Semitism, racism, and white supremacy. At a time when extremism is on the rise, we must explicitly denounce religious intolerance of all kinds and acknowledge the pain felt by all communities.”On the sidelines, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign began fundraising, claiming AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) was “coming after” her, Omar and Tlaib for questioning American foreign policy. The fundraising message cited a recent quote from an AIPAC activist predicting the three freshmen “will not be around in several years.”Further, Ocasio-Cortez sought to turn the tables on the 23 Republican members who opposed the resolution, suggesting a double-standard was at play.PELOSI FACES REVOLT OVER ANTI-SEMITISM RESOLUTION“Where’s the outrage over the 23 GOP members who voted NO on a resolution condemning bigotry today? Oh, there’s none?” she tweeted. “Did they get called out, raked over, ambushed in halls and relentlessly asked why not? No? Okay. Got it.”Those who voted against the resolution, though, said they did so out of concern it was watered down.“It was spineless ... it was unfortunately filled with moral equivalency and double standards,” Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who is Jewish, told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney said in a statement that the resolution vote “was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism.”But the developments of the past week underscored the rising influence of some of the chamber’s newest members and their allies, whose objections helped reshape what was essentially a rebuke of one of them into a message every member in the caucus could support.And it pointed to emerging divisions and disagreements inside the party unlikely to resolve soon.During debate on the House floor over the resolution, Rep. Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, slammed party leaders for hesitating to sharply condemn Omar, and remarked that supporting language condemning anti-Semitism ""shouldn’t be this hard.""""Why are we unable to singularly condemn anti-Semitism?"" Deutch asked. ""It feels like we're only able to call out the use of anti-Semitic language by a colleague of ours -- any colleague of ours -- if we're addressing all forms of hatred. It feels like we can't say it's anti-Semitism unless everyone agrees it's anti-Semitism.""Ocasio-Cortez, though, said that Democratic women of color ""are being treated differently"" and ""targeted.""Scalise on Friday once again called for Pelosi to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, a step party leaders have been reluctant to take.“Clearly, Speaker Pelosi is afraid of some of the fringe elements on the socialist left, and that was on full display this week,” he told Fox News.Pelosi told reporters Thursday that thedebate was not about Omar, but about all forms of hatred. Asked Thursday if Omar should apologize, Pelosi said, “It’s up to her to explain,” adding, “I do not believe that she understood the full weight of the words.”Fox News’ Gregg Re and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Only one board member was absent at the time and news of the campaign gained little attention.Criticism began pouring in when the anti-Islamophobia campaign gained traction on news sites and social media. Some called it an unwanted intrusion of Muslim beliefs and culture, while others said it prioritized one religion over another.The San Diego Union School District told Fox News it could not comment on pending litigation, but provided resources that defended its decision to form the program. One of the reasons stemmed from an April survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) which found that Muslim children were more susceptible to bullying in school compared to students practicing other religions, theSan Diego Union-Tribunereported. The survey also found that a teacher or student official was involved in 25 percent of reported anti-Muslim incidents.PROM NIGHT CONFLICT PITS MUSLIM STUDENTS VS.

TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/europe/islamophobia-is-being-defined-as-a-form-of-racism-why-12711811,Islamophobia is being defined as a form of racism. Why?,"Defining anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe is not just about confronting hatred, it's also about understanding the deep institutional currents that fan anti-Muslim discourse.",6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,TRT World,International,"Defining anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe is not just about confronting hatred, it's also about understanding the deep institutional currents that fan anti-Muslim discourse.  After more than two years of consultation, including interviews with academics, charities, politicians and the wider Muslim community, a group of MPs in the UK will attempt to put forward a working definition of ‘Islamophobia’. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) that initiated the process consists of a group of MPs across party lines. The report notes that even as the UK government has made a mild effort to tackle Islamophobia, “there has been no attempt to adopt a definition of Islamophobia by Government despite recognising the significant impact the problem has on British Muslim communities”. Under the current Conservative Party government the Muslim community has often felt neglected, and at worst, placed in the crosshairs of a state-led effort to institutionalise the ‘othering’ of Muslims. How is Islamophobia defined?  The term Islamophobia has gained increasing political currency over the last decade. The APPG has put forward the following definition of the term: “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."" The government, on the one hand, argues that it is fighting Islamophobia but on the other hand has disputed the need for a definition, stating: “We do not accept the need for a definitive definition.” This understanding begs the question: what is the government fighting against if it has not defined what the problem is in the first place? For proponents of the definition, albeit not perfect, has made strides towards addressing how anti-Muslim sentiment has become widespread and more importantly leaves the door open to addressing institutional Islamophobia.  Dr Katy Sian a Lecturer of Sociology at the University of York told TRT World she believes the current proposed definition marks a radical departure from previous definitions. She said: “[It] moves it away from individual biases and prejudices to a more critical and analytical understanding. By showing its links with racism it is showing Islamophobia’s structural nature.” In the immediate period after the ‘War on Terror’, the US and UK in particular set about implementing a set of policies that had the impact of silencing Muslim opinion and damping social activism. These policies had the intended impact of normalising suspicion and discrimination against Britain’s Muslim population. Policing mosques, beards, speech, community activism and women’s clothing became an acceptable form of stigmatising and securitising Muslim communities. Had these practices been applied to a particular ethnic group they would have been considered a form of racism but Islamophobia has no set definition and in particular no legally acceptable definition, making such intrusive policing acceptable and institutionalised. Professor Salman Sayyid from Leeds University proposed the APPG’s definition of Islamophobia alongside his colleague Abdoolkarim Vakil at King’s College. They have argued that government policies have surreptitiously exploited the lack of clear definitions to push policies that would otherwise be considered discriminatory. Sayyid has laid out his rationale for the development of racial policies on a religious community. He explained: “Because Muslims are not a race the systemic violations directed against them cannot be racially motivated. Because Muslims are not a race their subjugation is not racism.” However, the current definition, if adopted by the government and introduced in legislation, would go some way to addressing this disparity. Linda Hyokki, Senior Research Associate at the Center for Islam and Global Affairs at Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University, spoke to TRT World, arguing that the current working definition has the potential of moving the debate away “from the everlasting disputes about whether or not the term ‘Islamophobia’ is suitable for its intended purpose”. In the past, the debate has been muddied, mainly by right-wing opponents. According to Hyokki, they argue: “Because it is called a ‘phobia’, it would only denote a fear of Muslims and as such would not make sense because the way in which people think of Muslims and behave towards Muslims could not be compared to other phobias, which are oftentimes clinical conditions."" Anti-Muslim sentiment, when viewed in these terms, is far from being an irrational fear of Islam. It is a deliberate, institutional and systemic approach towards the Muslim community’s set of beliefs and practices. Rising Anti-Muslim sentiment A recent poll showed that a majority of people in Western Europe were in favour of restrictions on Muslim women's religious attire - and where public sentiment has moved in that direction, so have the laws of those countries. In August of this year, Denmark became the latest Western European country to ban Muslim women from wearing the face veil following Austria, Belgium and France, as well as parts of Italy and Spain who have enacted similar laws over the last decade. “Muslims are constantly used as a punching bag by the UK mainstream media, with news articles frequently referring to Muslim communities as being illiberal, backwards and a threat to the West,” said a spokesman for Muslim Engagement and Development (MEND) to TRT World, a UK-based NGO focusing on media monitoring. These developments also reflect a wider trend across the western world to see limits on Muslim migration, not just in light of US President Donald Trump, but as part of a growing atmosphere of hostility towards Muslims. In a 2006 speech Douglas Murray, a leading British journalist and author well positioned to advise policymakers and government officials stated: “Conditions for Muslims in Europe must be made harder across the board: Europe must look like a less attractive proposition. We in Europe owe – after all – no special dues to Islam.”"
TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/anti-zionism-anti-semitism-and-the-disregard-for-islamophobia-12721872,"Anti-Zionism, anti-semitism, and the disregard for Islamophobia","A rise in anti-semitism deserves attention and action against it - but it should not be conflated with anti-Zionism, and Islamophobia should not be ignored in the process.",6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,TRT World,International,"A rise in anti-semitism deserves attention and action against it - but it should not be conflated with anti-Zionism, and Islamophobia should not be ignored in the process. People attend a national gathering to protest antisemitism and the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in the Place de la Republique in Paris, France, February 19, 2019. The writing on the sign reads: ""Antisemitism, islamophobia, racism - not in our name"". It is difficult to dispute the fact that there is a rise in anti-semitic behaviour across the world today. However, it is quite problematic that politicians across the spectrum are either manipulating this fact for their political gain or are genuinely ignorant The most recent example is a report from France24 noting that French President Emmanual Macron’s intends to recognise anti-Zionism as anti-Semitism. He said at the Annual Dinner of the Council of Jewish Institutions in France that his government will take measures to define, “anti-Zionism as a modern-day form of anti-Semitism.” This comes off the back of an incident that occurred during a Yellow Vest protest concerning academic Alain Finkielkraut wherein a video recording showed protesters hurling remarks such as “dirty Zionist.”  Also, close to the city of Strasbourg close to 100 Jewish graves were defiled with Swastikas. It's understandable that the French leader would want to take measures against this violence but what he fails to understand is that the terms are not interchangeable.  As Dr Azmi Bishara points out, there is no connection between the two ideas.  He says, “Regardless of whether Macron really wants to, or even can, pass legislation of this kind, it seems that he is ignorant about both anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. He will be surprised to find that not only are some of the most important thinkers on anti-Zionism or anti-Zionists Jewish intellectuals of various political persuasions, but anti-Zionism itself, like Zionism, is a Jewish phenomenon – emerging originally as a Jewish response to Zionism.” In his piece, he continues to highlight the different Jewish groups which are consistently opposed to Zionism - which positions the problem in a new context. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) too distinguishes between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as [anti-Semitic].” The key to differentiating between the two ultimately leads to the Israeli state.  In sum, Zionism was a project started to create a home for the Jewish people in the historical land of Palestine. While there is more nuance to the issue, essentially, it means that criticism of Zionism is a valid criticism of a settler-colonial project. Why then in the UK and the US is there growing confusion between the two terms causing political scandal where none should be. Why are there accusations against US representative Ilhan Omar of being an anti-semite for practising the influence of The American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC, on American politics? In the UK Labour party, 9 Members of Parliament resigned citing criticism in how the party deals with anti-semitism within and outside of the party. This caused a media frenzy and heated statements from resigned members, calling it Labour’s ‘worst day.’  A BBC report on Labour’s comments accepting IHRA’s definition of anti-Semitism, “It included an extra statement saying this should not undermine free speech on Israel. Jeremy Corbyn proposed a longer additional statement - which would have allowed criticism of the foundation of the state of Israel as racist - but this was not accepted by the party's ruling executive.” These two issues each stem separately from a criticism of Israel’s state and foreign policies, not discrimination against the global Jewish population. If politicians at the highest rank fail to make this distinction for public knowledge, it will continue to increase the hegemonic rhetoric allowing the Israeli occupation of Palestine to continue. Amidst all this confusion surrounding discrimination of one religious group, we must also ask why the persistent attacks on another continue without the same indignation? One needs only to return to France to understand the contrast. French retailer Decathlon announced their decision to scrap their ‘running hijab’ in France amidst serious outcry, from non-veiled women, against this product for defying moral values. This included politicians such as the Health Minister saying that while such a product is not illegal, “it's a vision of women that I don't share. I would prefer if a French brand did not promote the headscarf.”  This product is set to go on sale in over 40 other countries after it’s enormous success in Morocco. A large part of the French population, politicians, and the current government fail to recognise that this effectively seeks to exclude veiled women from sports, much like they have successfully banned veiled girls from public schools. For this to be misconstrued as anything but discrimination, and xenophobia is questionable.  The country’s leader goes so far as to hope to, “reduce the influence of Arab countries, which prevents French Islam from entering modernity,” thus a French reform of Islam.  Rather than invest in improved integration that encourages acceptance on both sides of the debate the current position openly vilifies one religion and weaponises oppressive political ideologies."

Not until proponents of Islamophobia are confronted, will this change. CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND - MARCH 18: Schoolchildren and other well-wishers view flowers and tributes near Al Noor mosque on March 18, 2019 in Christchurch, New Zealand. 50 people were killed, and dozens are still injured in hospital after a gunman opened fire on two Christchurch mosques on Friday, 15 March. The accused attacker, 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, has been charged with murder and remanded in custody until April 5. The attack is the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's history. It is difficult to know how to respond to the Christchurch shooting as a Muslim. The immense pain that one feels is salved only by the conviction that God will accept these people as martyrs whose lives were taken simply because of their faith.  The innumerable personal tragedies experienced by the victims’ families and loved ones have been amplified on a global scale by the news cycle and social media. While there is global revulsion at the massacre, Muslims are especially traumatised by the recognition that they were specifically targeted. Muslims in the West carry multiple burdens in the so-called War on Terror. They are just as likely to be victims of an indiscriminate terrorist act perpetrated by a Muslim. The Western Muslim’s potential or actual victimhood is coupled with the frequent Islamophobic insinuation that they are also somehow to blame for terrorism that is, in most cases, a consequence of the Western occupation of Muslim-majority countries.  Alongside this unconscionable state of affairs, Western Muslims are also especially at risk of being targeted by white supremacist terrorist acts. The violence of white privilege Friday’s attack is only one of the latest instances of many decades of anti-Muslim violence on the part of the global structures of white privilege. White supremacists are the blunt edge of the structural inequality that is represented by white privilege, which allows for normalised violence against people of colour globally.  Whether it’s the vicious policing of ghettoised neighbourhoods in Philadelphia, to the bombing into oblivion of civilians in the Middle East for decades, the structures of racial inequality that normalise violence against non-white bodies are far more pervasive than most mainstream (and white) commentators are able to recognise. Whiteness is a complex social construct that denotes more than skin colour. The Irish were not considered white in North America until relatively recently. In recent centuries, Ashkenazi Jews faced aggressive mainstream anti-Semitism in Western nations despite looking like the rest of their fellow Westerners. And in recent years, a black president was able to oversee the USA’s vast structures of global violence against non-white peoples as its Commander in Chief.  Whiteness, as scholars have elaborated extensively, denotes something of an ideology or a worldview that privileges some humans over others. White privilege and the ‘War on Terror’ This is something that we would all do well to better understand. For underprivileged groups, such as Muslims who have been dehumanised on a global scale by the discourse of the War on Terror, developing our understanding of how such systems of prejudice work has an obvious urgency. But even those who benefit from the structures of white privilege can recognise how such systems cause one to lose part of one’s humanity. In this context, it is worth acknowledging Islamophobia as a consequence of the globalised structures of white privilege. The forever war that is the War on Terror is part of a structure that allows for the use of one tragedy—the attacks of 9/11 which killed more than 3,000 people—to be used to justify visiting death and destruction upon non-white bodies on an epic scale.  By 2015, a US-based NGO, Physicians for Social Responsibility, estimated that the death toll of the War on Terror had reached “at least 1.3 million, and could be as high as 2 million”.  Four years later in 2019, with ongoing chaos in the Middle East that finds its origins in the Iraq War, one can only imagine how much the death toll might have risen. White privilege allows for such glaringly disproportionate responses to simply be ignored. There is nothing noteworthy about the disparity. It doesn’t even merit comment. This is not even considering the fact that the vast majority of these deaths are innocent civilians. The Islamophobic Trope  In the outpouring of grief that has manifested among Muslims since Friday and from exemplary leaders such as New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, some of the most disturbing responses to the tragedy have come from Muslim public figures. That commentators like the Islamophobia enabler extraordinaire, Maajid Nawaz, would be among them is little surprise.  His Facebook post after the attacks urged Muslims to avoid blaming the “critics of immigration or Islam” and “the political right”, whom he has partnered with for years, in fanning the flames of Islamophobia and reinforcing white privilege. Another example comes from the Muslim scholar, Abdullah bin Bayyah, who heads up the so-called Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies (FPPMS). Bin Bayyah issued a statement on his website and social media advising Muslims to be “patient and tolerant” in response to the atrocity. The Islamophobic trope that runs through such a pronouncement is the suggestion that Muslims are a powder keg of violence simply waiting to explode. Rather than provide comfort to Muslims who are under attack from white supremacists, Bin Bayyah’s concern which takes up half of his statement is that “Muslim rage” is constantly liable of boiling over and thus calls for preemptive restraint.  In fact, Bin Bayyah is complicit in the culture of Islamophobia as the President of the FPPMS in line with the policies of its funder, the UAE Foreign Minister, Abdullah bin Zayed (AbZ). In 2017, the same foreign minister warned Western governments that their Muslim populations were an “ulcer” in their midst, and that these governments would need to aggressively police them to ensure that the dangerous threat of terrorism posed by these immigrant communities would be kept at bay.  Using a familiar white supremacist shibboleth, AbZ argued that European countries were sleepwalking into more terrorist attacks because they were “trying to be politically correct” and failing to recognise that they were “harbouring terrorists and extremists” in their midst.  Getting real about structural Islamophobia In the nearly two decades since 2001, Muslims have been targeted for vilification on the basis of a series of Islamophobic tropes in a global public sphere that is dominated by the paradigms of white privilege.  These have included the tropes of violence, terrorism, irrationality, misogyny, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and paedophilia among a host of others. Such vicious generalisations about any sizeable group are likely to be inaccurate, let alone one with a global population of nearly two billion.  Until those with the power to influence public opinion and policy are willing to recognise the structural inequalities that underlie Islamophobia as a global phenomenon, little is likely to change. And until respected mainstream proponents of Islamophobia are treated as pariahs, whose race-baiting has directly contributed to the evils of white supremacy, the horrors of Christchurch will continue to be visited on Muslim bodies over and over and over again."

The French Council of the Muslim Faith says such vandalism has multiplied in France ""in a very worrisome way."" The council repeated a demand for the government to create a parliamentary panel to study rising Islamophobia. Graffiti beside swastika reads: No Arab here. You can read the 74-page manifesto written by the Christchurch mosque shooter, but that’s what he wants you to do. It’s impossible to separate the misdirection from the trolling, from the lies. It’s a work of fiction, and you’re not likely to learn much about the root of white supremacy.  But another letter written by a white supremacist murderer provides a much clearer window into the mind of a person that carries out racist violence. Unlike the Christchurch killer, he did not intend for the general public, or even a coven of Internet trolls on 8chan, to read what he wrote.  “To my brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ our savior and Lord, my name is John D. Carothers and I believe the Bible is about white people and for white people,” Carothers wrote from prison to a white supremacist group, from which he also requested a study bible.  “I am in Rutherford County Jail for burning a black man. I set him on fire with lighter fluid poured on his head.” Carothers, 53, a white American man from Tennessee, burned a black man to death on March 17, 2018, pouring lighter fluid on him while he slept. His victim, Robert Miller, 40, was a person under the care of Carrothers, who was then working as a home health aide at a veterans’ residence in Murfreesboro, a town outside Nashville.  Miller died from his burns ten days later.  When he first committed the crime, Carothers act of violence seemed to lack a motive. Once the letter was intercepted by authorities, the story garnered a brief flash of attention, as the horrific act gained a wider, even more, disturbing meaning.  Although crudely composed, Carothers’ letter provides a startlingly simple calculus for white supremacist thought. The Bible is “about white people and for white people.”  The Christchurch killer included in his manifesto provocative statements about “reclaiming” Istanbul for Christians. But we should consider those messages as deliberate attempts at incitement, repackaging of “Deus Vult” crusader memes that titillate the chan crowd with a twisted, atavistic sense of belonging online. Carothers, however, was not seeking to broadcast his white supremacist views. A detective unsealed his letter and read it to a court considering his sentence. Prosecutors expressed their revulsion at the racism behind the murder. The churn of the local and national news cycle swallowed the story. Nevertheless, Carothers’ letter remains as a reminder of the link between religion and racism that underpins white nationalist movements across the world. Even those that don’t embrace Christianity, or reject it outright, can justify Islamophobia or antisemitism as necessary to ‘preserve’ Christian culture. And this phenomenon is not limited to those who would see Christianity through the lens of white supremacy. Fair-skinned Israeli settlers in the West Bank will hurl racist slurs (“N---rs don’t expel Jews”) even at Ethiopian Israeli soldiers who try to evict them from their illegal outposts. People of colour who travelled to Syria to join Daesh were not welcome to join the top ranks of that nihilistic terrorist enterprise. Some of them found themselves cleaning latrines, and quickly found a reason to regret their decision. There is a pattern here, one far clearer than anything the Christchurch manifesto offers. The most violent and ruthless ideologies combine hatred of other races with hatred of other religions. What makes these ideologies so dangerous is that they demand allegiance from their adherents’ skin colour and soul at the same time. Indeed, they fuse physical traits and the spiritual together. What that means for people infected by these ideologies is that there’s no way out. Their skin becomes not just their uniform, but also their soul."

People walk past branded awning at the venue of the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, 1 October, 2018 Britain’s Labour Party has adopted the working definition of Islamophobia produced by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) at the end of last year. In adopting the definition, Jennie Formby, the General Secretary of the Labour Party said: “I’m proud that Labour’s NEC adopted the working definition of #Islamophobia produced by the APPG on British Muslims. We must tackle Islamophobia, build a common understanding of its cause and consequences and express solidarity with Muslim communities.” The APPG spent more than two years speaking to academics and civil society organisations before adopting the following definition: “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."" The adoption by the Labour Party puts it at odds with the ruling Conservative Party which has so far failed to adopt a working definition of Islamophobia. The APPG in its report criticised Theresa May’s government for not doing enough to tackle Islamophobia saying: “There has been no attempt to adopt a definition of Islamophobia by Government despite recognising the significant impact the problem has on British Muslim communities.” The Labour MP and Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, Naz Shah, also recently called out the Conservative Party response to Islamophobia citing its refusal to “listen and deny the problem exists let alone accept the need for any inquiry.” Shah, who is also the Vice Chairman of the APPG which produced the working definition, has also called the refusal by the Conservatives to come to terms with discrimination in their party as “disgraceful”.

In light of the terrorist attack in New Zealand, which saw 51 Muslim worshippers massacred by white nationalist Brenton Tarrant, Warsi spoke of the need for her party to confront Islamophobia, adding: “u can duck & dive but I will keep bringing this fight to u [sic].” The former Conservative foreign secretary Boris Johnson has called women who don the niqab “letterboxes” and have been widely condemned for normalising discrimination towards Muslim women. Years of raising Islamaphobia w/n my Party had left me weary but #NZMosqueShooting tragically reminded me that this fight is essential &must go onSo @Conservatives u can duck &dive but I will keep bringing this fight to u - the longer we deny it the more we confirm we hav a prob Wow just wow Revolving door racism is the new policy it seems.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday called for a global fight against rising anti-Muslim bigotry along the same lines as ""anti-Semitism after the Holocaust"" following the deadly attacks on two New Zealand mosques. Speaking at a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul to discuss last week's twin terrorist attacks on two New Zealand mosques that killed at least 50 Muslim worshippers during Friday prayers, President Erdogan said that Muslim nations must take action against developments threatening the future of humanity. Friday marks exactly one week since the attacks on the Al Noor and Linwood mosques in Christchurch. Australian-born Brenton Tarrant, 28, has been charged for the massacre and is being held at a maximum-security prison in Auckland.  Among the victims were four children under the age of 18. Other children are still being treated at local hospitals for injuries they sustained during the attack. Erdogan also praised New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's reaction to the terror attacks, calling it a model for all leaders around the world. ""Humanity should fight Islamophobia with same determination it fought anti-Semitism after the Holocaust,"" Erdogan said. Islamophobia not only subject of politics, civil society, or scholarship but concern for security forces, statesmen, and people in streets, the Turkish president further said. Erdogan also thanked New Zealand authorities, people, premier for showing the truth, their firm stand against the terrorist attacks on the mosques. Golan Heights Erdogan said he will never allow occupation of Golan Heights to be legitimised, adding that US president’s ""unfortunate"" remarks on the Golan Heights brought the region to the brink of a new crisis and tension.

He further said thathis country would work to protect its Muslim community and confront the use of social media to ""spread vile hate."" ""We need other countries to be a part of that,"" Winston Peters added. Earlier Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also praised New Zealand authorities and their ""sincere solidarity messages"". ""We are here to show we are one body against Islamophobic actions across the world,"" he said. Turkish foreign minister also mentioned the ""Israeli oppression of Muslims in Palestine and the Rohingya situation in Myanmar as examples of Islamophobia."" ""Islamophobia has risen during the past few years and it is turning into action, which is concerning,"" Cavosuglu said. He added, ""We will stand up against all hate speech, violence, and terror with both declarations and practical steps."""

Following the massacre of Muslim worshippers at a mosque in Christchurch by an Islamophobic fascist, we must now begin to look at Islamophobia not simply as a global phenomenon, but as a phenomenon intimately tied to the current epoch – an epoch defined by movements against egalitarianism and liberalism. An epoch where genocide and the state-led mass murder and persecution of Muslims has become normalised. In Brenton Tarrant, the fascist murderer responsible for the Chirstchurch massacre, we see can see Islamophobia, or anti-Muslim bigotry, for what it is – an ideology intimately attached to genocide and mass murder.  It begins with people saying they have concerns about ‘radical Islam’, but these are merely code words when applied to Muslim communities in general – code words that conceal or obfuscate the fact that the concern isn’t with the perceived ‘radicalism’ of Islam, but with the very presence of Muslims in the West. For all the stuff that will be written about Tarrant’s perceived motivations, and many British newspapers have gone for a bizarre ‘ordinary white man went bad’ narrative, he has been nothing if not upfront about his direct aims. He calls not just Muslims, but all non-whites ‘invaders’ who threaten to ‘replace’ so-called indigenous populations. But, according to the ideology of Islamophobia, Muslims above all others are the vanguard of this conspiracy or move to usurp white people. Muslims, in the shadow of the ‘war on terror’ and the rise of modern ‘Islamic terrorism’, are constantly depicted as ‘failing to integrate’ and ‘rejecting western values’. This isn’t just the discourse of far-right agitators, but can be found in the pages of mainstream liberal newspapers or in the speeches of mainstream centrist politicians.  In fact, these narratives are often the first line of western societies after instances of ‘Islamic terror’ – they’re always looking at the problem as a communal one that places Muslims as the Others, where, implicitly or explicitly, their ‘Islamicness’ is to blame for the very act of radicalisation.  This produces the familiar absurd calls by non-Muslims for a ‘reformation within Islam’, or for calls for Muslims to somehow dilute or reshape their Muslim identities according to the bigoted demands of Islamophobes.  Mainstreaming the fringe Well what exactly was it that ‘radicalised’ Tarrant to mercilessly exterminate men, women and children for the sole reason that they were Muslims? It certainly wasn’t because his dad had died of a terminal illness as The Daily Mail so bizarrely implied in one of its headlines. While one can rightfully look at the ubiquity of negative stories about Muslims in the media as sources of radicalisation for the likes of Tarrant, there is a much wider aspect to this.  And it is the global aspect of Islamophobia in this epoch. While Tarrant ranted against ‘multiculturalism’, the self-declared fascist also praised the People’s Republic of China as being the state that most aligns with his principles and as a source of emulation. It’s hardly difficult to understand why a fascist would idolise the current Chinese state. Its persecution of mostly Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region conjures both a return to the policies of 20th century fascism and the further degradation of the already crumbling egalitarian world order. It proves very acutely and savagely that concern about ‘radical Islam’ is simply a cover for the true Islamophobic determination that Muslims are simply not wanted.  As many as 1 million Muslims are kept in ‘re-education camps’ where the entire project is designed to rid the Uighurs of their Islamic faith, while there have also been moves by China to inhibit the procreation of Muslims. Along with this, China has been a staunch and vocal defender of the regime in Burma as it carries out genocide against Rohingya Muslims. What links these together is in each case the ideology of Islam and Muslims is painted as an alien and destructive force that seeks to destroy an allegedly ‘civilised’ status quo.  Even in Muslim countries, the ideology of Islamophobia can be appealed to by tyrants seeking approval from western leaders who want to limit Muslim immigration – we’ve seen this used most effectively by Bashar al-Assad and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, as well as the tyrants of the UAE and Saudi Arabia.   This is precisely what is meant by the globalisation and normalisation of Islamophobia. The Arab spring saw the potential social, cultural and political emancipation of vast swathes of Muslims – the counter-revolution, steeped in the idea that Muslims aren’t fit for democracy or liberty and must be ruled by tyrant, has not only bolstered global authoritarianism, but it has justified long-held western Orientalist and racist ideas about ‘the Muslim world’ and the alleged inherent savagery of Islam, complicated by the rise of Daesh. What we’ve seen emerging since 9/11 is a loose, though rapidly coalescent, network of Islamophobic movements concomitant with a more general rise of ethnonationalism, authoritarianism and anti-egalitarianism on the global stage. Whether it’s his veneration of Middle Age Venetian commanders who defeated Ottoman Muslim armies or Serb warlords guilty of the crime of genocide of Muslims in the 1990s, Tarrant is steeped in the global mythos of Islamophobia.  The conclusion is that white non-Muslims have to violently annihilate Muslims or they themselves will be usurped or ‘replaced’. This is the world order that Tarrant craves and though it would be hyperbolic to say this is just around the corner, the fact remains that around the world Muslims face increasing circumstances of genocide, cleansing and persecution. More generally, minorities find themselves under threat from ethnonationalist populists and authoritarians, from Bolsonaro to Trump. A global wave  All around Europe, we’ve witnessed the rise of far-right movements who emphasise Islamophobia – in Poland, Hungary, Italy and Austria, they have gained state power, while they have large electoral representation in Germany, France and Spain.  In the UK, Brexit, whose triumph was inspired by fearmongering about immigration in general and the Islamophobic lies of Turkish accession to the EU and the UK being swamped by Muslim Syrian refugees, currently dominates over everything.  Though the electoral Islamophobic far-right might weakly denounce the massacre, the reality is that it not only serves but is actually a consequence of their agenda of sowing discord among the white majority against Muslims and immigrants.  This is the epoch that has birthed Brenton Tarrant – the epoch of genocide in Bosnia, Syria, Burma and the mass murder of refugees in the Mediterranean fuelled by the rising Islamophobic far-right in Europe. The epoch where an American president can implement a ‘Muslim ban’ and get away with it. We have seen 60,000 fascists marching through the streets of Warsaw calling for an ‘Islamic Holocaust’, while a few nights ago mosques in Birmingham were attacked by racists wielding sledgehammers.  Following the massacre, Jacinda Ardern rightfully warned that the fight against racism was a global one that should know no national boundaries, but given the manner in which those who claim to support egalitarianism, human rights and liberal democracy have sought to appease and ignore fascism, one can only conclude that her warning will fall on deaf ears.   Whether it’s by airstrikes, poison gas or bullets, or whether it’s in concentration camps, besieged towns or mosques, Muslim blood has never been cheaper. Who knows to what new horrors it will lead?"

The government decision follows comments by British police that the definition risked hindering their anti-terror work.

The UK’s largest Muslim body, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), said the government’s decision not to adopt the definition reflected a disinterest in the welfare of Muslims. “Rejecting a definition of Islamophobia that has the support of 750 British Muslim organisations and has been widely accepted by political parties sends a message that this government is not interested in protecting the rights of British Muslims and that the very basic right of Muslims to define their own oppression has been denied,” an MCB spokesperson told TRT World, adding:  “Moreover, those who choose to espouse Islamophobic sentiment will feel empowered now that their right to discriminate against Muslims has been validated, while structural Islamophobia continues to remain unchallenged.” The prime minister’s Conservative party has faced strong criticism for its stance on Islamophobia in recent years. Former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson infamously compared Muslim women who wore the niqab face covering to postboxes, while former 2016 London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith’s campaign was centred around painting his Muslim rival and eventual winner, Sadiq Khan, as a “closet extremist”.

In particular, the study shows that contempt cannot always be quantified. A demonstrator carries a flag reading “Islam, no thanks” during a rally of nationalist Alternative for Germany against the planned building of a mosque in Erfurt, eastern Germany, Wednesday, May 18, 2016. Germany’s Islamic council has published an eye-opening and extensive study into the challenges facing Muslim communities in the country within educational institutions and workplaces. The 27-page report, released by Islamrat, paints a gloomy picture about the future of fundamental rights of Muslims living in the country and makes recommendations to political circles for short-term and long-term plans to tackle the issue. The study looks at social exclusion, the increasingly bipolar debate surrounding Muslims and Islam and the day-to-day issues Muslims face within the country. Given the largely negative way in which the community is portrayed within the media, the study highlights both the threat xenophobia has on Muslims and pinpoints ways to quell the anti-Muslim sentiment. More than 7,700 racist crimes were recorded in Germany last year, representing an overall increase of 20 percent. Muslims remain “the other” within media outlets and political spheres In a first, the report discusses why the term “Islamophobia” does not adequately address all forms of discrimination against Muslims and tenets that may not, in fact, be Islamic. “Muslims are declared ‘others’ or ‘strangers’ and are always represented negatively. For the majority, the focus is not so much on the lives of Muslims, but on attributions,” says the report. There were 813 attacks against Muslims and mosques last year in Germany, according to figures released by the German federal parliament. The German government points out that the final figures are likely to be even higher due to a lapse in notifications. The report comes to a similar conclusion. ""Attacks on Muslims and their institutions are on the increase. Unfortunately, anti-Muslim racism has become widespread.” Discrimination starts from kindergarten  This can be seen, for example, in exclusionary practices in which children are labelled as coming from a “migration background” and as such, are seen as “non-homogenous” members of society. Children’s books routinely portray minors from migrant families as “non-German”, exotic or foreign. ""Islam is an essential differentiating feature for the justification of social and societal conditions,” writes Iman Attia, a professor specialising in racism and migration at Alice Salomon University in Berlin, adding “two important elements of racism can be seen in this entanglement of levels: racism serves, on the one hand, to secure privileges and legitimise exploitation and exclusion.” It starts with harassment and ends in violenceMurat Gumus, chairman of the Islamic Council, stresses to TRT World that the report is structured as a “solution-oriented approach” in which “concrete contact partners” in federal ministries are identified.  Gumus says the topic is not getting nearly the amount of attention it requires, adding that there were 90 reported attacks on mosques in 2018. “This is a consequence of the harassment and discrimination that Muslims have faced for years. The problem is that words become acts of violence. Muslims are routinely insulted, mobbed and more and more frequently violently attacked on the street. The inhibition threshold to violence has never been so low,"" Islamrat said in a press release linked to the report. The saddest part, Gumus says, is the increasing number of attacks in broad daylight on Muslim women wearing headscarves, adding that questionable reporting around such incidents has prevailed for more than a decade. German federal politicians recently instituted a new law that bars young girls from covering their hair. While German politicians fuel these narratives, those who are not directly impacted by the law continue to struggle in daily life as their interactions with other Germans become increasingly interlaced with negative prejudices."

Dr Farid Hafez is targeted by the Austrian state over his work on anti-Muslim hate crime. Academic and anti-Islamophobia scholar, Farid Hafez, was targeted by Austrian authorities as a sign of a growing crackdown on those that speak out against the government's anti-Muslim policies. Hafez, an Austrian academic, spoke out against the raid on his family home for the first time since it happened on November 9, 2020. In a video released on Monday, Hafez, an internationally published academic, recalls guns with infrared dots were aimed at his chest as police sporting balaclavas stormed his house. A scholar on racism and anti-Muslim bigotry, Hafez has been a strong critic of Austria's increasingly draconian policies towards its Muslim minority. Born in a village in Upper Austria, Hafez, in a video, recalls the growing spectre and confidence of the far-right in the country, which has focused in particular on Muslims. ""This is the reason I became interested in Islamophobia because I felt like nobody was talking about it,"" says Hafez in the almost eight-minute video. The Austrian government has seemingly taken notice and is now on a mission to silence Hafez, who works at the University of Salzburg and is a senior research fellow at Georgetown University in the US. Hafez has not been charged with any crimes by the Austrian government, leading some to believe that the government is deliberately harassing the academic in a bid to muzzle his research. One academic called Hafez's treatment by the Austrian state ""a gross miscarriage of justice."" Whereas another called it a ""chilling...witchhunt against a Muslim academic."" During his ordeal, Hafez was asked what he thought about the term Islamophobia and whether he believes ""Muslims [are] discriminated against in Austria"" and even if he prays, casting aside any doubt about why he was targeted. Other questions that were posed to the academic were whether he allows his wife to go to the supermarket and if his children play musical instruments. The Austrian government has also blocked Hafez's bank accounts, putting his family's livelihood in jeopardy. The Austrian authorities have a right to keep the investigation open for up to three years without providing any evidence and without pressing charges while maintaining restrictions on Hafez's bank accounts. In the words of one academic, the state's actions were ""a scary reminder that Islamophobia is entrenched in EU politics and govs aren't shy from politically persecuting Muslim academics."" Supporters of Hafez have set up a fundraising page to help the academic pay for his legal costs. Austria's problem with Islam? The country up until very recently was the only Western country to recognise Islam as an official religion. The move stemmed from the country's annexation of Bosnia in 1908, a land it had occupied for several decades. Muslims in Austria have experienced a relatively strong level of tolerance compared to other European countries, however, that tolerance has recently eroded. The most significant turning point was in 2016 when the then right-wing government changed a century-old law on Islam by making it illegal for mosques to receive funding from abroad while allowing synagogues and churches to continue to do so.  The move was widely seen as an attempt to interfere in the workings of the Muslim community in the country. Since then, the Austrian government has been on a crusade to tighten its grip on the Muslim community. In 2017 the state instituted a niqab ban, a face covering worn by some Muslim women. In 2019, a hijab ban aimed at school girls was overturned in December 2020 after the country's highest court ruled that it was an infringement of Muslims' rights. Austria's right-wing Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has recently sought to create ""political Islam,"" a vaguely defined term, into a criminal offence. Kurz has warned the country's Muslim population that mosques could be closed down, and the state could create a register for imams in a bid keep track of Muslims. When TRT World spoke to Farid Hafez at the time he warned, ""This is the latest step by the government to crush Muslim civil society and send a message out that no one is safe."""

BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour is immediately recognisable as one of the most forthrightly feminist programmes on air. It’s why you would expect, as the youngest person and first ever woman to be elected head of the Muslim Council of Britain, Zara Mohammed would have been a natural and welcomed guest. And maybe, for the most part, she was. That is until, their Twitter account uploaded a clip showing Emma Barnett persistently questioning an incredulous Zara on the number of female imams in Britain. Not content with the answers given, the host embarked on an antagonistic tirade about how Islam was lagging behind in women’s leadership. There are women priests and rabbis, she claimed, surely there must be female imams?  You’d be forgiven for thinking this was a deeply held conviction for Barnett, such was the strength of feeling behind the line of questioning. You’d also be forgiven for not realising this was in fact the same presenter who was described as “a feminist who believes in equality for women, but, as an orthodox Jew, she’s uncomfortable with female rabbis.” She went on, belittling previous Muslim Council leaders for daring to request that faith be recorded on the national census. If Muslims could be part of a focused campaign to get faith recognised in a once-a-decade questionnaire, why couldn’t they keep meticulous records on the thousands of mosques and their imams, mainly volunteers, up and down the UK? Cue a collective sigh. Even when a woman is leading the largest cross-section of British Muslim society, representing hundreds of mosques, we can’t escape the allegation that we’re not doing enough to promote the leadership of women. You may well be the most accomplished, scholarly and talented Muslim woman in Britain, but if there’s a scarf on your head you’re probably still oppressed.  It seems to be white liberal feminism’s unending quest to prove once and for all that Islam is an inferior and oppressive religion. The formula for enacting the trope is simple. First, you view Islam through a lens of your own choosing – in this case, you don’t know exactly what an imam is or how Muslim prayer works, but it can’t be too different from Christianity and Judaism, and there aren’t any female imams so it must be a problem. You’ve added 2 to 2, and made 500. Second, you belligerently demand unsuspecting followers to churn out explanation upon justification after apology for what you’ve decided to believe about them.  The worst part? Some don’t even realise they’re doing it.  The issue remains that there isn’t a like-for-like comparison that you can use for clerical or religious figures in Islam, Christianity and Judaism. An imam doesn’t hold the religious authority that priests or rabbis do. In this decentralised system, imams will normally be people who can recite and lead prayer. Where there are positions of knowledge and scholarship in Islam, they are equally accessible to both Muslim men and women. Indeed, Sheikh Akram Nadwi is a scholar who has compiled volume upon volume of examples of where Muslim women acquired knowledge and transmitted it, to say nothing about their contributions in fields like recitation, translation and the creation of legal rulings.  Many women and religious minorities whose contributions aren’t well known or given space have sought to reclaim that space within mosques and reassert these rich traditions of female scholarship. What a shame then, that it is these women who are questioned and treated as collaborators in their own oppression. In this environment, leading questions won’t be taken in good faith. It’s this that has incensed Muslim women in particular, who refuse to complete the mental gymnastics it takes to accept lines of questioning (designed to trip us up) with simpering generosity.  No matter how many articles, research papers or headlines are written about Islam, media literacy on the faith remains despondently low and presenters understand very little. It’s one of the reasons why the Muslim Council of Britain set up the Centre for Media Monitoring. Had Barnett attempted even the slightest bit of research or been minded to give Zara a fair hearing on the issue of women’s leadership, she would have found out that the majority of MCB’s projects have, in the last four years, been led by women.  Perhaps she would have been surprised to note that a conference of entirely women speakers was hosted for International Women’s Day two years ago, or that it was followed by a nationwide survey on women’s access to mosques.  Maybe, in her zeal to admonish a Muslim woman about the lack of female leadership in mosques, she might have forgotten that MCB’s continually successful Women in Mosques Development Programme has promoted exactly that since 2018. But how would she remember, when programmes like Woman’s Hour won’t give the representatives of these projects the time of day to begin with? So, no, there may not be female imams in mainstream mosques, but there’s nothing to stop you going into one and finding a woman leading other women in prayer, holding Quran classes or teaching a new generation of scholars. You could definitely argue that there isn’t enough being done to accommodate women, but this is a challenge that many Muslim women have taken head on.  Frankly, the last thing we need is people who don’t understand our situation to bulldoze over all the hard work being done to focus on a non-existent problem like female imams."

I hope this decision will influence other organisations to change their own rules regarding the hijab, I really hope companies will follow.” Une excellent nouvelle ! Un geste fort en faveur de l'#inclusion de toutes les #femmes adultes à l'enseignement supérieur. Des femmes qui pourront poursuivre à présent leur scolarité et leurs rêves d'avoir une carrière professionnelle. #respect #OpenSchool4Women 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓🧑‍🎓 https://t.co/Z7AbHqWJ7m Until now, Belgium had banned “religious symbols”, including the headscarf worn by Muslim women in their religious practice, in schools, including higher education.  “We are reversing the principle, in the name of the inclusion of the greatest number, of emancipation and the fight against inequalities,” Julien Nicaise, general administrator of Wallonia-Brussels Education (WBE), a public body that manages French-speaking public schools in Belgium told local media on Saturday, adding that there will be restrictions in cases where “security is threatened or for reasons of hygiene"". ""The general interest must come first. We can no longer refuse these young women on the pretext that they wear a veil, prevent them from studying. A diploma is their passport to inclusion through employment.""  The announcement came after years of campaigning by anti-Islamophobia and Muslim women’s rights groups in Belgium. “I think this is a political decision, as we really made a lot of demonstrations, and it’s also a social decision, as more and more Muslims in Belgium are wearing hijab,” said Younsi, who is a co-founder of Collectif les 100 diplômées (100 Graduates Collective), an NGO that supports  young professionals who wear the Islamic headscarf and face discrimination. She tells TRT World that her organisation has been lobbying for the lifting of hijab bans in schools and also tracking incidences of hijab bans in workplaces and public institutions across Belgium.  According to official WBE figures, higher education institutions have 50,000 students, including 20,000 in universities and 30,000 in social advancement institutions. Thus, the new decision concerns five universities, five arts schools and 29 social advancement institutions.  Although Belgium does not keep official demographic records based on religion, it is estimated that out of a population of nearly 11.5 million, over 850,000 are Muslims. Even though not all Muslim women in Belgium wear hijab, the impact of this new decision has the potential to affect a vast number of women who were previously limited in their studies and employment opportunities. The decision was reached by consensus within the board of directors of WBE, which has representatives of all political parties. #HijabisFightBack The news comes after the Belgian constitutional court ruled in June that prohibiting religious symbols, including hijabs, in higher education did not constitute a violation of freedom of religion or the right to education under the Belgian Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights. The decision was slammed by rights activists, anti-Islamophobia organisations, and women’s and feminist collectives, who viewed this as a violation of basic human rights and as a discriminatory act against women.  In response, thousands went online to protest the decision using hashtags like, #TouchePasAMesEtudes (Don’t touch my studies) and #HijabisFightBack. In July, over one thousand (some organisations counted several thousand) gathered in Brussels to advocate for the right to wear headscarves in universities.  Over 1,000 people took to the streets in Belgium to advocate for the right to wear headscarves at universities. The #HijabisFightBack protest targeted a recent constitutional court ruling that allows a ban on religious symbols in higher education pic.twitter.com/wVRcWyaCr3 Anti-Islamophobia organisations said that the court opinion could lead to the isolation of Muslims and entrench structural discrimination within the education system. Belgium is a federal country divided into three regions: majority French-speaking Wallonia, majority Flemish-speaking Flanders, and the Brussels-Capital Region. Each region has its own government and legislative body, which decide upon housing, education policy, the economy, and other public matters.  There is still no federal legislation that protects the right of Muslim women to wear the headscarf in universities across Belgium.  Today’s pictures. © Yassin Akouh #HijabisFightBack #TouchePasAMesEtudes pic.twitter.com/fmF0djEQ9F At the same time, headscarf bans in universities are not widespread. Several higher education institutions, including the prestigious KU Leuven and Free University of Brussels (VUB) stated in July that they welcome students ""regardless of gender, origin or social status, with or without a headscarf."" Aan de VUB staan gelijkheid en inclusie centraal. Diversiteit is een feit, ook aan onze universiteit. Laat het dus duidelijk zijn dat elke student welkom is bij ons ongeacht gender, afkomst of sociale status. Met of zonder hoofddoek. Ons gelijkheidsbeleid: https://t.co/2AV2enC2Re However, Belgians did not hear similar statements from universities in Brussels or Wallonia, according to Younsi. The Islamic headscarf is a contentious issue in many European countries, most notoriously in France, where the government has been criticised over the decades for discriminatory and marginalising policies against Muslim women in the name of laïcité (secularism). Studies have shown that anti-Muslim hate crimes overwhelmingly target women. In Belgium, for instance, a recent report found that 9 out 10 victims of Islamophobia were women.  “I have been receiving so many messages from girls wearing hijab saying, ‘Now I can pursue this program,’ or ‘before I was thinking of not doing it, as the hijab is forbidden,’” says Younsi.  “Economically, it will make sense to open school for everyone, no matter their belief. It just makes sense.”"

A Canadian MPP proposed a motion to condemn Islamophobia and racism, but it was rejected by Ontario’s government. “I seek unanimous consent to move a motion without notice condemning all forms of Islamophobia and reaffirming the Legislature’s support for the Anti-Racism Directorate and that the question be put immediately,” said Scarborough-Guildwood Liberal MPP Mitzie Hunter standing in the Ontario legislature on Thursday.  Hunter’s motion proposal came after a hit-and-run attack, one which the police said was “pre-planned” and “targeted hate crime” against a Muslim family in London, Ontario. The attack killed four Muslim family members and left a nine-year-old boy wounded. He is still receiving treatment in a hospital. Triggering a stream of anger and grief across Canada, the attack alarmed human rights advocates who called for all levels of government to take action to tackle Islamophobia. MPPs belonging to the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario blocked the motion on the grounds that they did not receive the legislative text beforehand, which is compulsory as per party policy.   ""What happened today was a Liberal MPP, with no notice, tried to surprise the government with a motion that we still have not seen. It is our policy to turn down all requests for unanimous consent that we have not seen in advance,” said Paul Calandra, the government house leader. But for the Ontario Liberal Party and its members, it is nothing but an excuse.  “Today I asked for the unanimous consent of the legislature to condemn all forms of Islamophobia and to reaffirm support for the Anti-Racism Directorate. @Fordnation 's government said NO,” Mitzie Hunter tweeted on Thursday.  The Party condemned the decision of blocking the motion, saying that “Doug Ford’s Conservative caucus blocked what should have been a simple, meaningful motion for the Muslim community.”  “Now they’re hiding behind procedure — it’s inexcusable,” read the party statement. Two days before his party rejected the proposal, Ontario Premier Doug Ford promised to honour the family and called the attack “an act of terrorism.” When he joined a vigil alongside thousands of people who mourned the dead, he was booed by the crowd.  Doug Ford was boo-ed at the Tuesday vigil for #OurLondonFamily.The people are done with platitudes.

The party stands by the decision saying that the rejection was a procedural requirement, but in the past, the party’s MPPs voted down another legislation that was proposed to combat anti-muslim hate crimes. Liberal MP Iqra Khalid tabled a motion inviting federal politicians to condemn Islamophobia in 2017 after a gunman killed six people and injured 19 worshippers in a Quebec mosque. Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole, who used to be an MP at the time, voted against it alongside many others. The motion has passed regardless.  According to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, extremism is on the rise in Canada.

TRT World A celebrated Austrian political scientist who was targeted in a controversial anti-terrorism raid on Muslims by his own government two years ago said on Thursday that the growing Islamophobia worldwide is being fuelled by European nations that label Islam as a political identity to justify their ban on mosques, hijab, halal or circumcision.  Farid Hafez, a widely respected scholar who has written extensively on Islamophobia, was speaking through video conference at a conclave on human rights violations faced by Muslims worldwide, especially in Europe. Hafez, 41, teaches political science at the University of Salzburg, and is also associated with Georgetown University's The Bridge Initiative, a research project on Islamophobia. Hazez  argued that one of the major problems that Muslims face today is “the weaponisation of political Islam” through which countries create terminalogies to target Muslims—Austria’s political Islam, France’s Islamist seperatism and Germany’s legalist Islamism. “They are against Islam and nothing else,” the academic said. Islamophobia is not only about having a bad image of Islam, said Fared, explaining that these European governments use anti-terrorism laws to clamp down on Muslims, jeopardising not only their freedom of speech but also freedom of association.  The Muslim Austrian academic, whose house was raided on November 9, 2020 as part of the Austrian goverment’s anti-terrrorism “Operation Luxor”, said that nowadays even talking about islamophobia is criminalised and considered as instigating terrorism.  “What is really at stake here? It is a question of power,” Hazez said, adding that the European governments do not know how to govern their own Muslim populations today. Explaining that these governments have been used to handling poor working-class immigrants — people who could be subordinated for the past 40 years—Farid said now these European countries are faced with a new generation of Muslims who have full capacity to participate in the European political landscape as active citizens. There is a growing Muslim population in Europe and the far-right’s “superficial solution” to this problem is to drive out the people so as to avoid committing outright genocide, Hafez added. He added that the centrist political parties, which have been shaping policies within the last two decades in a lot of European countries, are taking a different approach: ""We are going to change Muslims and we are going to crack down on their civil society that fights for equality and gives Muslims place as equal citizens in their countries"". “The important take for the Muslim countries, especially those who accommodate and foster this discourse in European countries on behalf of the Muslims is what role are they playing? This will be the defining relationship within the next few decades between those Muslim minorities in Europe and the Muslim majority who are outside of Europe,” Hafez concluded. “This is the key  question every Muslim majority country has to ask itself regarding their future in a wider sense.”  [NOTE: The article came from TRT World’s Eyes on Discrimination (EOD) Centre, which monitors and reports on offences, hate crimes and discrimination on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, national origin and religion, or other related social categories.

Worshippers pray in the street outside the Lakemba Mosque in Sydney during Friday prayers, Friday, Nov. 3, 2006. Non-Muslims who shared neighbourhood spaces with Muslims are less likely to express Islamophobic views, a study by RMIT University has found. The study is part of stage 3 of a larger project focused on “Islamophobia and Neighbourhood Experience” funded by the Government of Australia's Commonwealth Department of Social Services (DSS) through the Strong and Resilient Communities (SARC) National Research Grants program. Islamophobia is defined in the study as “indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims” while neighbourhood experience is a “composite of elements included in the concepts of social capital, local participation and satisfaction with one’s suburbs”. Among the central research questions of the study was to examine the relationships between neighbourhood experience and Islamophobia. The findings were drawn upon data from a survey of 1,020 people – half of which were targeted in the ten suburbs with the highest concentration of Muslims in Sydney and Melbourne, and the other half in the greater metropolitan areas of the two cities. Respondents were given a series of statements that included, “the number of Muslims in Australia is too high,” “I dislike seeing Muslim women with their hair covered,” “I would be opposed to a new mosque being built in my local area” and “I am worried about Muslims forming enclaves in Sydney and Melbourne”. They were asked to agree or disagree with such statements on a five-point scale, which produced an “Islamophobia score” from one (no prejudice) to five (high prejudice). The survey data analysis revealed a number of interesting findings. Among non-Muslims in Sydney and Melbourne, Islamophobia was significantly lower in suburbs with a high proportion of Muslim Australians – such as Lakemba in New South Wales, where Muslims make up 59 percent of residents, or Dandenong, Victoria, where they are 30 percent – than the general populations of both cities, scoring 2.31 compared to 2.80. Respondents who professed no religion or other (non-Islam) religions displayed less Islamophobia than those who identified as Christian, with non-religious respondents scoring 2.48 versus 2.77 of Christian respondents in both metro and target areas. Age and education were important indicators. Those aged 18 to 34 had a lesser Islamophobic score (2.32) than those over 65 did (2.80), and those who were university educated scored 2.47 compared to 2.90 for those with only ten years of schooling. Socio-economic factors were meaningful too. Data showed that occupations associated with higher levels of education tend to be associated with lower Islamophobia, with a statistically significant difference between managers (1.97) and those in sales, laboring or machinery operator positions (2.57). Satisfaction with income was a stronger predictor of Islamophobia than income levels itself, with those stating that they were “comfortable” (2.49) with their incomes displaying lower scores of prejudice than those who stated they were “struggling” (2.86). Meanwhile, respondents from Sydney (2.18) were found to be less Islamophobic than their Melbourne counterparts (2.32), likely due to the fact that Muslims are more concentrated in Sydney suburbs than in Melbourne suburbs, where they are much more dispersed. Overall, the survey’s findings strengthen the evidence of what is known as “contact theory,” which proposes that usually, but not always, contact between people of different backgrounds reduces prejudice between groups. This is in contrast to “threat theory,” which holds that encounters between individuals from different groups may, in certain instances, increase feelings of anxiety and threat perception. The study points out that prior evidence on contact and threat theories in neighbourhoods where minority Muslims share spaces with non-Muslims has been mixed, citing a recent UK study that confirms the contact theory hypothesis but a similar Dutch study that revealed the opposite. Muslims make up 2.6 percent of the total Australian population, over 600,000 according to the last census in 2016. About three-quarters live in Sydney and Melbourne. Representations of Muslims in Australian media coverage have often been negative and contribute to Islamophobic discourse, as studies have shown. There have been examples of elected officials whipping up fear of Muslims to peddle xenophobic rhetoric. The 2019 Islamophobia in Australia report highlights that Muslims continue to be targets of hostility and violence."

Türkiye and its institutions are making strenuous effort to combat Islamophobia and raise awareness of this issue, said Altun. Speaking at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) ministerial meeting in Istanbul, Türkiye’s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun has said Islamophobia is one of the biggest threats the world is facing.  ""Indeed, one of today's global threats is undoubtedly Islamophobia. Hostility towards Islam and Muslims is intensely evident all over the world,"" Altun said during his opening remarks on Saturday. He said global institutions should be reformed in a way that decision-making mechanisms include Muslim countries.   ""Islamophobia also has a feature that divides the world community and threatens global peace and stability. Therefore, the whole world needs to see Islamophobia as an open hate crime, a crime against humanity and to fight against this crime effectively. ""In other words, fighting this crime should be one of the main duties of not only Muslims but also of the international community,"" he added. Altun also criticised global mainstream media for not giving enough space to Muslims and said that disinformation accelerates the spread of Islamophobia around the world. He said the role played by the international media and global think tanks in spreading Islamophobia is ""undeniable"" as ""international media paints an extremely negative portrait of Muslims."" He also said right-wing radical parties and populist parties are playing an effective role in the increase of anti-Islam sentiments.

Ministers and high-level representatives from 57 countries will discuss issues, seeking to deepen cooperation in the fields of media, communications, and information in the Islamic world. “The Islamic world faces challenges that require responsibility to present its message in a thoughtful way,” an OIC official told the preparatory meeting of the conference on Friday. The conference will discuss the importance of intensifying media action on the question of Palestine and Al Quds Al-Shareef, highlighting issues of the African OIC member states, the role of the OIC in combating Islamophobia, the statement said. It will also deliberate on issues relating to developing media expertise and training in the Muslim world. At the conference, a Saudi representative handed over to Türkiye the term presidency of the OIC Information Ministers Conference. Altun said he believes the meeting will yield concrete results."

PM Khan has called for a million of his supporters to rally in the capital next week. Foreign ministers of Muslim nations have gathered in Pakistan as the country's leader touts his achievement of getting Islamophobia recognised at the United Nations while at the same time battling the most serious challenge to his government in four years. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is meeting in Islamabad on Tuesday and Wednesday with an ambitious agenda that seeks approval for over 100 declarations, including aid for financially strapped Afghanistan and support for Palestine and Kashmir. But as officials praise Prime Minister Imran Khan for getting the UN last week to formally recognise Islamophobia as a global threat, the cricket star-turned-politician faces a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. In a hectic week on the political front, the country on Wednesday also celebrates Pakistan Day, with a military parade and flypasts. The theme for the OIC gathering is ""Partnering for Unity, Justice and Development"", and Khan will deliver the keynote speech that is sure to reference last week's UN resolution. Khan won office through an electorate weary of the two-party dynasties that have dominated Pakistan politics since independence –– periods of power punctuated by military coups –– but now he faces a new challenge.  ""I think the army leadership must be extremely concerned seeing what is happening on the political scene at the moment,"" said Talat Masood, a retired general-turned-political analyst. Khan has called for a million of his supporters to rally in the capital next week to put pressure on dozens of National Assembly members who are reported to be considering voting against him. The leaders of the two main opposition parties have also called for their supporters to gather, prompting authorities to declare most of this week a public holiday in the hope of avoiding conflict –– particularly during the OIC meeting. READ MORE:Pakistan lawmakers to vote on motion to oust PM Imran Khan next week 'A collision course' ""It is dragging the country to chaos,"" Masood said. ""It seems that the government and opposition parties are on a collision course. They don't seem to solve the problems politically, and rather try to show their street power."" The no-confidence motion is scheduled to be formally introduced on Friday with a vote next week, but horse-trading is common in Pakistan politics and the rebels could well return to the fold before then. Although Khan's policies helped Pakistan escape the worst of the Covid-19 epidemic, the economy is in the doldrums with soaring inflation, a feeble rupee, and crippling debt. While Pakistan helped US-Taliban reach a deal leading to US end 20-year invasion of Afghanistan, the return of the Taliban to power in has also provoked a resurgence of militancy in Pakistan. With flaring domestic issues, Khan visited Russia and met President Putin for hours just when Moscow was about to launch its offensive against Ukraine.  He was also one of the few world leaders to attend the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics when others boycotted in protest at China's human rights record. Khan criticised Islamabad-based Western envoys who recently sought to pressure Pakistan to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine, asking them if they thought Pakistan was their ""slave"". ""We are friends with Russia, and we are also friends with America; we are friends with China and with Europe; we are not in any camp,"" Khan added, saying Pakistan would remain ""neutral"" and work with those trying to end the war in Ukraine. On Monday, Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, told a press conference he had intelligence inputs that the vote of no confidence against PM Khan was happening at the behest of foreign powers. READ MORE:'Are we your slaves': Pakistani premier hits out at West over Russia letter Possible scenarios  There are several scenarios at play for Pakistan this week. Khan's PTI party is pursuing a court case against rebellious members that could force them to follow the whip. Another tactic is for parties to, quite literally, hold lawmakers hostage and prevent them from voting or having a quorum. And even if Khan does lose the vote, there will likely be a series of challenges both inside and outside the assembly. Most of that will be lost on today's OIC gathering, which is largely a talking shop that will pass a series of political resolutions. Key among them is channelling aid to Afghanistan, although any formal recognition of the country's new Taliban government remains unlikely.

TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/the-uns-intl-day-to-combat-islamophobia-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction-12791005,The UN’s Int'l Day to Combat Islamophobia is a step in the right direction,"The institutionalisation of such a day has high symbolic value, despite its limits.",3 YEARS AGO,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,TRT World,International,"The institutionalisation of such a day has high symbolic value, despite its limits. This week, the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution declaring March 15 as International Day to Combat Islamophobia. Exactly three years after the murder of 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand’s Christchurch, the United Nations adopted a resolution to make March 15 the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.  This marks the highest political recognition so far of the problem Muslims have faced for years. Several NGOs have declared national days against anti-Muslim racism, such as July 1 in Germany or the European Day Against Islamophobia on September 21. But never has a state, much less a supranational institution, ever institutionalised a day to symbolise the importance of tackling anti-Muslim sentiment. The UN General Assembly, representing 193 member states, approved the resolution by consensus. It was introduced by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which represents more than 50 mainly Muslim majority countries, recalling a 1981 resolution calling for “the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief.” Contention came mainly from three sides: France, India, and the representative of the European Union, which is of little surprise. Recently, a report by an NGO has claimed that the French government’s anti-Muslim sentiment reaches the threshold of “persecution” under international law, and the anti-Muslim policies of President Emmanuel Macron's government have been heavily criticised. India has a long record of anti-Muslim policies, especially under the right-wing BJP government, and experts are warning of an impending genocide.  And the current EU leadership seems to be more than reluctant in fighting anti-Muslim sentiment. While in the US, Congress passed the International Islamophobia Act in December 2021, the 2015-established position of the European Commission’s Coordinator on combating anti-Muslim hatred has been vacant for many months and beyond this has been regarded as widely impotent by many NGOs.  But there are also movements in the right direction. The Council of Europe’s European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) has recently adopted a revised recommendation on preventing and combating “anti-Muslim racism and discrimination.” Importantly, this recommendation does not only find a precise word to name the problem beyond usual titles used by European institutions such as hate, crime and discrimination. It very deliberately challenges the structural dimension of the problem.  This also seems to have been on the mind of Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN, Munir Akram, who introduced the resolution on behalf of the OIC. He cited the UN’s special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, saying: “Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, institutional suspicion and fear of Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim has escalated to epidemic proportions.” Such an institutional approach clearly turns the question towards the UN itself, given its central role in creating the global framework for deradicalisation policies that have harmed many fundamental freedoms and have been legitimised in the backdrop of an imagined Muslim threat.  Despite the fact that countries like China, which has more than a bad record when it comes to religious freedom in general and anti-Muslim policies in particular, have co-sponsored this resolution, which is unlikely to lead to a change in their treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, the resolution itself is of a high symbolic value. It asks all countries, UN bodies, international and regional organisations, civil society, private sector and faith-based organisations “to organise and support various high-visibility events aimed at effectively increasing awareness, at all levels, about curbing Islamophobia.”  The observation of the new International Day to Combat Islamophobia on March 15 is not only a reminder of the violence of white supremacists. It is also a major step in the right direction, making people and institutions conscious of a growing problem that even some political leaders deny, as the reaction of a minority to the resolution has revealed."

Indians hold placards and candles during a protest against banning Muslim girls wearing hijab from attending classes at some schools in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. The state's high court later upheld the ban. “Pack your bags and move to Hyderabad,” Kalvakuntla Taraka Rama Rao wrote on Twitter in response to a Bengaluru-based entrepreneur who complained about the Indian city's crumbling infrastructure.  Rao, the information technology minister for Telangana state, where Hyderabad is located, was making a larger point that did not go unnoticed. Though long favoured for its moderate climate and cosmopolitan character, many fear that Bengaluru — with its cherry blossom-lined boulevards — is losing much of its sheen. What the minister tweeted only amplified the suspicion that many nursed in private, but few dared to air in public. Considered India’s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru serves as the capital of Karnataka state and hosts thousands of information technology companies. In fact, global tech giants such as Infosys and Wipro were founded in the city of 10 million, which accounts for more than 60 percent of the province’s revenue. The city has always attracted the best, both in terms of investments and intellect. It currently boasts some 13,000 technology start-ups, and about 40 percent of India’s unicorns — unlisted companies valued at more than a billion dollars each. But the rush has also meant the city is rapidly becoming unlivable. Civic amenities are proving inadequate, while traffic has virtually choked. A one-way trip to the airport during rush hour could take as long as three hours. For many, even more suffocating is the rising religious strife that is threatening Bengaluru. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rules Karnataka and considers it to be a vital springboard for eventually expanding its footprint in the other four southern states. Karnataka, therefore, has become a kind of a Hindu nationalism laboratory, where the BJP has been experimenting with bringing about larger Hindu consolidation through means of religious rhetoric and communal provocations. Muslims account for no less than 12 percent of Karnataka’s population. But the BJP sees the support of the overwhelming number of Hindus as crucial for its electoral success. For drumming up Hindu support, right-wing Hindu activists aligned with the BJP have been on overdrive to deepen the Hindu-Muslim divide and stoke hatred. Virtually endless episodes of orchestrated indignations are ratcheting up tensions. First, some months ago, Hindu mobs took exception to Muslim girls wearing hijab — the Muslim headscarf — while attending schools. The hijab, they claimed, went against India’s secular principles and also violated the school dress code. The state high court upheld the ban. But then the mobs picked up one more issue to become outraged over. And then another. Activists seeking to establish Hindutva, or the primacy of Hindus, have launched an angry, abusive campaign against Halal — the process that certifies products, including meat, as being compliant with Islamic practices. At the receiving end are mostly Muslim meat traders. Several in Bengaluru have had their shops raided and vandalised. The mobs are having a virtually free run, with the Karnataka government headed by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai paying only lip service to the cause of religious peace and harmony. Many say the government itself has been complicit in instilling the fear of a tightening siege among the minorities. Last year, it banned the trade and slaughter of cows traditionally associated with Muslims. The government is now working to include the Hindu holy book Bhagavad Gita in the school curriculum. All these and more have emboldened supporters of Hindutva, who have now moved on to their next targets. Muslim traders have been physically barred from setting up shops in temple fairs, something that they have done for generations. Muslim mango sellers are the newest targets of the Hindutva mob, who have now reportedly set their sights on “cleansing” the fruit trade. The rising “hatred” disturbs the calm and tranquillity that are essential for businesses to prosper, and captains of the corporate world are alarmed. Kiran Majumdar Shaw, the chairperson of Biocon — a leading biotechnology firm — was among the first to speak out. “Karnataka has always forged inclusive economic development and we must not allow such communal exclusion…@BSBommai please resolve this growing religious divide,” she tweeted a couple of days ago, tagging the chief minister. Being a very important voice, BJP politicians promptly responded and assured her that no damage would be allowed to the state’s business environment. But it is unlikely that the damage already done to the dignity and right to livelihood of Karnataka’s Muslims can be repaired. It will also be equally difficult to repair the dent in Bengaluru’s reputation. The city’s loss, Telangana minister Rama Rao calculates, will be beneficial to Hyderabad. Home to mega defence and aerospace industries, Telangana’s state capital has assiduously nursed its ambitions of replacing Bengaluru as India’s IT hub. Now that chinks have surfaced in Bengaluru’s armour, Hyderabad — or more appropriately, its IT minister — has moved in for the kill. In luring entrepreneurs, like the one who complained over “unlivable” Bengaluru, to move to Hyderabad, Rama Rao is offering several incentives. “We have better physical infrastructure & equally good social infrastructure. Our airport is one of the best and getting in and out of the city is a breeze. More importantly, our government’s focus is on the 3-I Mantra: innovation, infrastructure & inclusive growth,” Rama Rao said in his tweet. His sales pitch for Hyderabad elicited a strong response from a senior opposition politician of Karnataka. “My friend, I accept your challenge,” tweeted Doddalahalli Kempegowda Shivakumar, the state Congress president.  “By the end of 2023, with the Congress back in power in Karnataka, we will restore the glory of Bengaluru as India’s best city,” he added.  Ironically, Karnataka’s own information technology minister seemed unfazed by the veritable storm over the challenge to Bengaluru’s coveted status. “We are competing globally,” insisted Chikkakalya Narayanappa Ashwath Narayan, choosing to ignore the challenge from Hyderabad, some 550 kilometres away."

Anti-Muslim hatred ""is poisoning all segments of society, from people on the street to politicians, workers, and civil servants,” he said in a video message at the 2nd International Media and Islamophobia Forum in Ankara on Tuesday. “The atmosphere of hatred promoted by irresponsible media negatively affects Muslims as well as millions of people with different languages, religions, origins, and cultures,"" he added. “The embarrassing debates in the context of the Ukraine crisis reveal the dangerous dimensions of Islamophobia and cultural racism.” Erdogan denounced discrimination against all vulnerable people around the world, stressing that anti-Muslim sentiment is not only an issue for Muslims, but it should also be for all people around the world. “Otherwise, we cannot prevent Islamophobic attacks like (the ones in) New Zealand in 2019 and Canada in 2021,” he warned. The president emphasised that along with Western politicians, media outlets and state institutions, the biggest responsibility falls on the Islamic world and its institutions. “Muslims must react strongly, seek their rights on legitimate grounds, and fight against this injustice, unlawfulness and discrimination, which targets hundreds of millions of people along with them,” he said.

The report said that the war in Ukraine overshadowed many issues, and stressed that the conflict exposed glaring double standards. That Europeans are more welcoming to certain types of refugees than others. The report detailed that many European countries openly welcomed white, Christian Ukrainians fleeing Russia's attack in the early stages of the war, while having for years opposed accepting mostly Muslim refugees escaping conflicts. Researchers who contributed to the report also highlighted how western media coverage, vastly differed in their portrayal of Ukrainian and Muslim refugees. Islamopbhobia was also found to be expanding at the institutionalized state level, where legislation and government policies directly targeted Muslims in certain countries.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi threw her support behind congresswoman Ilhan Omar as the freshman lawmaker continues to face calls for censure for remarks some have criticised as anti-Semitic. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that the House will vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other forms of hate after an upheaval that split Democrats and clouded their agenda.  But Pelosi said the measure won't name Ilhan Omar, the freshman Democrat whose comments about Israel sparked the uproar. Pelosi defended Omar and says she does not believe the new congresswoman understood the ""weight of her words"" or that they would be perceived by some as anti-Semitic. ""It's not about her. It's about these forms of hatred,"" Pelosi told reporters. Resolution of divide  The move was in part intended to resolve a divide that opened after Omar, D-Minn., said that Israel's supporters were pushing lawmakers to take a pledge of ""allegiance"" to a foreign country.  A Muslim-American, she has been critical of the Jewish state in the past and apologised for those previous comments. But she has not apologised for what many in Congress saw as a suggestion that Israel's supporters have split loyalties. And that sparked a demand from some quarters to put a resolution on the floor condemning anti-Semitism. Other members who wanted to broaden it to include a rejection of all forms of racism and bigotry. Trump's disparaging racial comments Some proposed two separate resolutions. Others questioned whether a resolution was necessary, and viewed such a move as unfairly singling out Omar at a time when President Donald Trump and others have made disparaging racial comments. Early Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told Democrats that the House would vote later in the day. That seemed to quiet some of the dissention, but there remained frustration that the party that touts its diversity conducted such a messy and public debate about how to declare its opposition to bigotry. ""This shouldn't be so hard,"" said Rep Ted Deutch, D-Fla., said on the House floor Thursday. The abrupt turn of events come as Democratic leaders try to quickly fend off a challenge from Republicans on the issue. Anti-hate bill  Democratic leaders worried they could run into trouble on another bill, their signature ethics and voting reform package, if Republicans tried to tack their own anti-Semitism bill on as an amendment. By voting on Thursday, the House Democratic vote counters believe they could inoculate their lawmakers against such a move by passing Democrats' own anti-hate bill."

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pointed out the need to end Islamophobia in the country. Canada has announced its intention to appoint a special representative on combatting Islamophobia as part of the country's anti-racism strategy, five years after a deadly mosque shooting in Quebec. “This year, on the eve of the five-year anniversary of this act of terror (mosque attack in Quebec City), the Government of Canada stands with and supports Muslim communities across Canada and reaffirms its commitment to take action to denounce and tackle Islamophobia and hate-fueled violence,” the government said in a statement on Saturday. Underlining that Islamophobia is a reality for Muslims across Canada and around the world, it noted that building a more inclusive country and combatting discrimination is a must.

Sharing the statement on social media, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pointed out the need to end Islamophobia in the country.

TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/understanding-american-islamophobia-in-the-age-of-trump-13110603,Understanding American Islamophobia in the age of Trump,"In the shadows during the Obama administration, Islamophobia has come out into the light under Trump. The silver lining is that it can now be challenged.",6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,TRT World,International,"In the shadows during the Obama administration, Islamophobia has come out into the light under Trump. The silver lining is that it can now be challenged.  On June 26, 2018, the United States Supreme Court upheld President Donald Trump’s executive order, widely dubbed as the “Muslim Ban.”   This decision came 932 days after Trump, then a Republican “longshot” candidate for the presidency, called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” This proposal, dismissed as mere campaign rhetoric by veteran pundits and aberrant bigotry non-emblematic of American society by others, reveals more about the country today than when originally uttered by Trump on December 7, 2015.  Indeed, the explicit bigotry of one private individual, with the diabolical design of mobilising Islamophobia into a full-fledged campaign strategy, would evolve into the law of the land.  This evolution, which marks the Muslim Ban’s transition from a deviant political proposal by a wayward candidate into standing immigration policy, unveils the roots and resilience of American Islamophobia.   Trump did not invent it, but identified its potency as a political tool, unearthed it, then deployed it fully to his advantage. The brazen Islamophobia Trump unleashed on the campaign trail alarmed the liberal and cosmopolitan peripheries of American society, but the nation’s core took to it zealously, registering approval of it in the ballot box by the droves.    The Islamophobia that Trump wielded on the campaign trail galvanised voters that tied their failures and fears to a looming Islamic threat, delivering him the presidency, and subsequently opening the door to the possibility of the Supreme Court upholding the ban.  In addition to revealing why the underbelly of American Islamophobia could be lifted to the core so rapidly, this evolution of Trump’s Islamophobia also illustrates the distinct yet linked dimensions of Islamophobia – an animus that cannot, and should not, be reduced to merely “fear and hatred of Muslims.”   The brash anti-Muslim ideas that Trump disseminated as a presidential candidate were, at that juncture, the views of one private individual, not yet fully sponsored by the state by way of presidential executive order or Supreme Court ruling.  In my book, American Islamophobia: Understanding the Roots and Rise of Fear, I outline the parts and processes that form the makeup of this rising form of bigotry. I define Islamophobia as the presumption that Islam is inherently violent, alien and unassimilable, a presumption driven by the belief that expressions of Muslim identity correlate with a propensity for terrorism. Beyond this foundational definition, Islamophobia is comprised of three dimensions: private, structural and dialectical Islamophobia. The first dimension, private Islamophobia, is “the fear, suspicion, and violent targeting of Muslims by private actors.” Most notably hatemongers that vandalise mosques, bigots that target and attack visible Muslims, and murderers, like Craig Hicks, who killed three Muslim American students. Islamophobia is also structural, as exemplified by the enforcement of the Muslim Ban by way of presidential executive order.   “Structural Islamophobia, the second dimension, is the fear and suspicion of Muslims on the part government institutions [such as the Supreme Court] and actors. This fear and suspicion are manifested and enforced through the enactment and advancement of laws, policy, and programming built upon the presumption that Muslim identity is associated with a national security threat.” That association forms the very foundation of the Muslim Ban, which casts every Muslim immigrant from the five restricted Muslim-majority nations as presumptive terrorists. Finally, and most importantly, Islamophobia is also a dialectic tying state policy with (private) societal actors. “Dialectical Islamophobia is the process by which structural Islamophobia shapes, reshapes, and endorses views or attitudes about Islam and Muslim subjects inside and outside of America’s borders.” This process is vividly and violently manifested by the hate incidents and crimes emboldened by Trump’s presidential rhetoric and policies, and in the imminent future, encouraged by the recent Supreme Court ruling.   Put simply, state-sponsored Islamophobia authorises and incites it on the ground, pushing private citizens to partake in the national project of punishing and persecuting Muslims – or individuals they (mistakenly) profile as Muslims. While Islamophobia was alive and well during the Obama era, Trump has lifted the curtain of political correctness that kept it hidden and difficult to detect.   No more grand Cairo speeches inspiring optimism, or visits to American mosques decorated by the rhetoric of celebrating Islam in America, but inspired by monitoring it in the very spaces where it is observed.  It was difficult to identify American Islamophobia during the eights years of Obama largely because he was brilliant at keeping it concealed. None of this is true under Trump, who has made the distinct parts of American Islamophobia crystal clear with his rhetoric and easily detectable through his policy.    Trump’s transparency makes it easier to understand how each of the three dimensions of Islamophobia unfold in real time in America, and also, how deeply interconnected they are.  Understanding it is an essential first step.  Followed by the more daunting burden of mounting a challenge against it, especially as the might of the state summons the groundswell of hate eying Muslims steadily rising from every corner of American society."
