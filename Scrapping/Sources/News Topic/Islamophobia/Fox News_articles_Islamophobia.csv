""Based on what I have observed on college campuses nationwide in the past couple of weeks, I believe this vow to protect is more relevant now than ever as individuals live in fear for their lives and are unable to go about living freely and peacefully because of their religion or country of origin. This cannot be tolerated.""She also spoke about how free speech is embraced in the U.S., but terroristic threats, destruction and violence are not. They are instead serious crimes.""I hope the deafening silence from AG Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray in the face of what appears to be rampant violations of federal civil rights and hate crimes across college campuses nationwide in the last couple of weeks is not an indication of a lack of resources and effort being spent to address the threats,"" Parker said.""Americans have observed the federal criminal justice system in the last few years. … Typically, they make it very clear to the public when they are interested in addressing the matter.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPShe also urged anyone who believes they may be a victim of a hate crime to contact the FBI.""If you believe you have been the victim or witness of a hate crime or a violation of your civil rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, I encourage you to report it.""Greg Norman of Fox News Digital contributed to this report.Greg Wehner is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.Story tips and can be sent to Greg.Wehner@Fox.com and on Twitter @GregWehner.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.,"March 8, 2019",2024-10-15 22:43:27.311220,Islamophobia,Fox News,International,"The passageThursday of a broad anti-bigotry resolutionthatexposed chasmsin the Democratic caucus regarding Israel marked a coup of sorts for a tight-knit band of House freshmen who – in a matter of hours – were able to shift the spotlight away from embattled Rep. Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.“The week was supposed to start off with a rebuke of Omar's anti-Semitic comments and it ended up turning into a long list of other hateful actions,” House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News on Friday, saying the final product “fell short of addressing the real problem.”The House resolution, following aweek of Democratic infightingover the language, was approved on a 407-23 vote. The measure originally was drafted in response to Omar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, suggesting last week that Israel supporters want U.S. lawmakers to pledge “allegiance” to the Jewish state – which was widely condemned as echoing the age-old “dual loyalties” smear against Jewish politicians.ANTI-OMAR POSTER IGNITES OUTRAGE AT WEST VIRGINIA CAPITOLYet after Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced a rebellion in the ranks amid concerns the resolution would unfairly single out Omar, a Muslim, and increase security threats against her (she was recently the subject of an inflammatory posterat the West Virginia capitol falsely tying her to the 9/11 attacks), the resolution was overhauled.The result was a broad rebuke of bigotry, including anti-Semitism as well as “anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities” perpetrated by white supremacists and others. The resolution condemned “dual loyalty” accusations, but did not mention Omar by name.After its passage, Omar and her allies were able to cheer the resolution as a win against Islamophobia.“Today is historic on many fronts. It’s the first time we have voted on a resolution condemning Anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation’s history. Anti-Muslim crimes have increased 99% from 2014-2016 and are still on the rise,” Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Rep. André Carson, D-Ind., said in a joint statement. “We are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry including anti-Semitism, racism, and white supremacy. At a time when extremism is on the rise, we must explicitly denounce religious intolerance of all kinds and acknowledge the pain felt by all communities.”On the sidelines, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign began fundraising, claiming AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) was “coming after” her, Omar and Tlaib for questioning American foreign policy. The fundraising message cited a recent quote from an AIPAC activist predicting the three freshmen “will not be around in several years.”Further, Ocasio-Cortez sought to turn the tables on the 23 Republican members who opposed the resolution, suggesting a double-standard was at play.PELOSI FACES REVOLT OVER ANTI-SEMITISM RESOLUTION“Where’s the outrage over the 23 GOP members who voted NO on a resolution condemning bigotry today? Oh, there’s none?” she tweeted. “Did they get called out, raked over, ambushed in halls and relentlessly asked why not? No? Okay. Got it.”Those who voted against the resolution, though, said they did so out of concern it was watered down.“It was spineless ... it was unfortunately filled with moral equivalency and double standards,” Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who is Jewish, told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney said in a statement that the resolution vote “was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism.”But the developments of the past week underscored the rising influence of some of the chamber’s newest members and their allies, whose objections helped reshape what was essentially a rebuke of one of them into a message every member in the caucus could support.And it pointed to emerging divisions and disagreements inside the party unlikely to resolve soon.During debate on the House floor over the resolution, Rep. Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, slammed party leaders for hesitating to sharply condemn Omar, and remarked that supporting language condemning anti-Semitism ""shouldn’t be this hard.""""Why are we unable to singularly condemn anti-Semitism?"" Deutch asked. ""It feels like we're only able to call out the use of anti-Semitic language by a colleague of ours -- any colleague of ours -- if we're addressing all forms of hatred. It feels like we can't say it's anti-Semitism unless everyone agrees it's anti-Semitism.""Ocasio-Cortez, though, said that Democratic women of color ""are being treated differently"" and ""targeted.""Scalise on Friday once again called for Pelosi to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, a step party leaders have been reluctant to take.“Clearly, Speaker Pelosi is afraid of some of the fringe elements on the socialist left, and that was on full display this week,” he told Fox News.Pelosi told reporters Thursday that thedebate was not about Omar, but about all forms of hatred. Asked Thursday if Omar should apologize, Pelosi said, “It’s up to her to explain,” adding, “I do not believe that she understood the full weight of the words.”Fox News’ Gregg Re and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Only one board member was absent at the time and news of the campaign gained little attention.Criticism began pouring in when the anti-Islamophobia campaign gained traction on news sites and social media. Some called it an unwanted intrusion of Muslim beliefs and culture, while others said it prioritized one religion over another.The San Diego Union School District told Fox News it could not comment on pending litigation, but provided resources that defended its decision to form the program. One of the reasons stemmed from an April survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) which found that Muslim children were more susceptible to bullying in school compared to students practicing other religions, theSan Diego Union-Tribunereported. The survey also found that a teacher or student official was involved in 25 percent of reported anti-Muslim incidents.PROM NIGHT CONFLICT PITS MUSLIM STUDENTS VS. EDUCATION OFFICIALSAlong with protecting Muslim students from bullying by creating ""safe spaces,"" the district would provide more lessons about Islam to help students better understand the religion, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune. A district staff added that students already learned about Islam, but more resources would be beneficial.The policy would ensure Muslim holidays would be recognized on staff calendars, but students would not be getting those days off. The district also planned to consider high school clubs that promote American Muslim culture and engage in partnerships with the Council on American Islamic Relations.A letter outlining the plans was expected to be sent to staff and parents of the district's 132,000 students before the school year ends.District officials also provided a detailed outline of Frequently Asked Questions on its website, where it explains how Muslim students weren't obtaining ""special treatment.""""The District takes seriously the bullying of any student, and we have programs and procedures already in place to address bullying,"" according to thewebsite.The district said it would not be endorsing Islam and that the policy did not violate the separation between church and state because they were not promoting or teaching a religion.

""There can be a more commonsense approach to this where all students can be protected and no students are being favored to the disadvantage of anyone else.""Hanif Mohebi, executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations' San Diego chapter, said the lawsuit ""seems to be an attempt to have the courts enforce growing Islamophobia in our state and nation, and to strip away much-needed protection for Muslim students who face increasing bullying.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.,"March 8, 2019",2024-10-15 22:43:31.348058,Islamophobia,Fox News,International,"The passageThursday of a broad anti-bigotry resolutionthatexposed chasmsin the Democratic caucus regarding Israel marked a coup of sorts for a tight-knit band of House freshmen who – in a matter of hours – were able to shift the spotlight away from embattled Rep. Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.“The week was supposed to start off with a rebuke of Omar's anti-Semitic comments and it ended up turning into a long list of other hateful actions,” House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News on Friday, saying the final product “fell short of addressing the real problem.”The House resolution, following aweek of Democratic infightingover the language, was approved on a 407-23 vote. The measure originally was drafted in response to Omar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, suggesting last week that Israel supporters want U.S. lawmakers to pledge “allegiance” to the Jewish state – which was widely condemned as echoing the age-old “dual loyalties” smear against Jewish politicians.ANTI-OMAR POSTER IGNITES OUTRAGE AT WEST VIRGINIA CAPITOLYet after Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced a rebellion in the ranks amid concerns the resolution would unfairly single out Omar, a Muslim, and increase security threats against her (she was recently the subject of an inflammatory posterat the West Virginia capitol falsely tying her to the 9/11 attacks), the resolution was overhauled.The result was a broad rebuke of bigotry, including anti-Semitism as well as “anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities” perpetrated by white supremacists and others. The resolution condemned “dual loyalty” accusations, but did not mention Omar by name.After its passage, Omar and her allies were able to cheer the resolution as a win against Islamophobia.“Today is historic on many fronts. It’s the first time we have voted on a resolution condemning Anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation’s history. Anti-Muslim crimes have increased 99% from 2014-2016 and are still on the rise,” Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Rep. André Carson, D-Ind., said in a joint statement. “We are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry including anti-Semitism, racism, and white supremacy. At a time when extremism is on the rise, we must explicitly denounce religious intolerance of all kinds and acknowledge the pain felt by all communities.”On the sidelines, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign began fundraising, claiming AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) was “coming after” her, Omar and Tlaib for questioning American foreign policy. The fundraising message cited a recent quote from an AIPAC activist predicting the three freshmen “will not be around in several years.”Further, Ocasio-Cortez sought to turn the tables on the 23 Republican members who opposed the resolution, suggesting a double-standard was at play.PELOSI FACES REVOLT OVER ANTI-SEMITISM RESOLUTION“Where’s the outrage over the 23 GOP members who voted NO on a resolution condemning bigotry today? Oh, there’s none?” she tweeted. “Did they get called out, raked over, ambushed in halls and relentlessly asked why not? No? Okay. Got it.”Those who voted against the resolution, though, said they did so out of concern it was watered down.“It was spineless ... it was unfortunately filled with moral equivalency and double standards,” Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who is Jewish, told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney said in a statement that the resolution vote “was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism.”But the developments of the past week underscored the rising influence of some of the chamber’s newest members and their allies, whose objections helped reshape what was essentially a rebuke of one of them into a message every member in the caucus could support.And it pointed to emerging divisions and disagreements inside the party unlikely to resolve soon.During debate on the House floor over the resolution, Rep. Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, slammed party leaders for hesitating to sharply condemn Omar, and remarked that supporting language condemning anti-Semitism ""shouldn’t be this hard.""""Why are we unable to singularly condemn anti-Semitism?"" Deutch asked. ""It feels like we're only able to call out the use of anti-Semitic language by a colleague of ours -- any colleague of ours -- if we're addressing all forms of hatred. It feels like we can't say it's anti-Semitism unless everyone agrees it's anti-Semitism.""Ocasio-Cortez, though, said that Democratic women of color ""are being treated differently"" and ""targeted.""Scalise on Friday once again called for Pelosi to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, a step party leaders have been reluctant to take.“Clearly, Speaker Pelosi is afraid of some of the fringe elements on the socialist left, and that was on full display this week,” he told Fox News.Pelosi told reporters Thursday that thedebate was not about Omar, but about all forms of hatred. Asked Thursday if Omar should apologize, Pelosi said, “It’s up to her to explain,” adding, “I do not believe that she understood the full weight of the words.”Fox News’ Gregg Re and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Only one board member was absent at the time and news of the campaign gained little attention.Criticism began pouring in when the anti-Islamophobia campaign gained traction on news sites and social media. Some called it an unwanted intrusion of Muslim beliefs and culture, while others said it prioritized one religion over another.The San Diego Union School District told Fox News it could not comment on pending litigation, but provided resources that defended its decision to form the program. One of the reasons stemmed from an April survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) which found that Muslim children were more susceptible to bullying in school compared to students practicing other religions, theSan Diego Union-Tribunereported. The survey also found that a teacher or student official was involved in 25 percent of reported anti-Muslim incidents.PROM NIGHT CONFLICT PITS MUSLIM STUDENTS VS.

The district also planned to consider high school clubs that promote American Muslim culture and engage in partnerships with the Council on American Islamic Relations.A letter outlining the plans was expected to be sent to staff and parents of the district's 132,000 students before the school year ends.District officials also provided a detailed outline of Frequently Asked Questions on its website, where it explains how Muslim students weren't obtaining ""special treatment.""""The District takes seriously the bullying of any student, and we have programs and procedures already in place to address bullying,"" according to thewebsite.The district said it would not be endorsing Islam and that the policy did not violate the separation between church and state because they were not promoting or teaching a religion.

""There can be a more commonsense approach to this where all students can be protected and no students are being favored to the disadvantage of anyone else.""Hanif Mohebi, executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations' San Diego chapter, said the lawsuit ""seems to be an attempt to have the courts enforce growing Islamophobia in our state and nation, and to strip away much-needed protection for Muslim students who face increasing bullying.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

The FBI also made it the highest priority because there is no tolerance for hate in the U.S.""The FBI vowed to use their full resources to reduce the hate crime threats and protect all Americans,"" Parker said. ""Based on what I have observed on college campuses nationwide in the past couple of weeks, I believe this vow to protect is more relevant now than ever as individuals live in fear for their lives and are unable to go about living freely and peacefully because of their religion or country of origin. This cannot be tolerated.""She also spoke about how free speech is embraced in the U.S., but terroristic threats, destruction and violence are not. They are instead serious crimes.""I hope the deafening silence from AG Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray in the face of what appears to be rampant violations of federal civil rights and hate crimes across college campuses nationwide in the last couple of weeks is not an indication of a lack of resources and effort being spent to address the threats,"" Parker said.""Americans have observed the federal criminal justice system in the last few years. … Typically, they make it very clear to the public when they are interested in addressing the matter.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPShe also urged anyone who believes they may be a victim of a hate crime to contact the FBI.""If you believe you have been the victim or witness of a hate crime or a violation of your civil rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, I encourage you to report it.""Greg Norman of Fox News Digital contributed to this report.Greg Wehner is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.Story tips and can be sent to Greg.Wehner@Fox.com and on Twitter @GregWehner.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.,"March 8, 2019",2024-10-15 22:43:35.382363,Islamophobia,Fox News,International,"The passageThursday of a broad anti-bigotry resolutionthatexposed chasmsin the Democratic caucus regarding Israel marked a coup of sorts for a tight-knit band of House freshmen who – in a matter of hours – were able to shift the spotlight away from embattled Rep. Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.“The week was supposed to start off with a rebuke of Omar's anti-Semitic comments and it ended up turning into a long list of other hateful actions,” House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News on Friday, saying the final product “fell short of addressing the real problem.”The House resolution, following aweek of Democratic infightingover the language, was approved on a 407-23 vote. The measure originally was drafted in response to Omar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, suggesting last week that Israel supporters want U.S. lawmakers to pledge “allegiance” to the Jewish state – which was widely condemned as echoing the age-old “dual loyalties” smear against Jewish politicians.ANTI-OMAR POSTER IGNITES OUTRAGE AT WEST VIRGINIA CAPITOLYet after Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced a rebellion in the ranks amid concerns the resolution would unfairly single out Omar, a Muslim, and increase security threats against her (she was recently the subject of an inflammatory posterat the West Virginia capitol falsely tying her to the 9/11 attacks), the resolution was overhauled.The result was a broad rebuke of bigotry, including anti-Semitism as well as “anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities” perpetrated by white supremacists and others. The resolution condemned “dual loyalty” accusations, but did not mention Omar by name.After its passage, Omar and her allies were able to cheer the resolution as a win against Islamophobia.“Today is historic on many fronts. It’s the first time we have voted on a resolution condemning Anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation’s history. Anti-Muslim crimes have increased 99% from 2014-2016 and are still on the rise,” Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Rep. André Carson, D-Ind., said in a joint statement. “We are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry including anti-Semitism, racism, and white supremacy. At a time when extremism is on the rise, we must explicitly denounce religious intolerance of all kinds and acknowledge the pain felt by all communities.”On the sidelines, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign began fundraising, claiming AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) was “coming after” her, Omar and Tlaib for questioning American foreign policy. The fundraising message cited a recent quote from an AIPAC activist predicting the three freshmen “will not be around in several years.”Further, Ocasio-Cortez sought to turn the tables on the 23 Republican members who opposed the resolution, suggesting a double-standard was at play.PELOSI FACES REVOLT OVER ANTI-SEMITISM RESOLUTION“Where’s the outrage over the 23 GOP members who voted NO on a resolution condemning bigotry today? Oh, there’s none?” she tweeted. “Did they get called out, raked over, ambushed in halls and relentlessly asked why not? No? Okay. Got it.”Those who voted against the resolution, though, said they did so out of concern it was watered down.“It was spineless ... it was unfortunately filled with moral equivalency and double standards,” Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who is Jewish, told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney said in a statement that the resolution vote “was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism.”But the developments of the past week underscored the rising influence of some of the chamber’s newest members and their allies, whose objections helped reshape what was essentially a rebuke of one of them into a message every member in the caucus could support.And it pointed to emerging divisions and disagreements inside the party unlikely to resolve soon.During debate on the House floor over the resolution, Rep. Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, slammed party leaders for hesitating to sharply condemn Omar, and remarked that supporting language condemning anti-Semitism ""shouldn’t be this hard.""""Why are we unable to singularly condemn anti-Semitism?"" Deutch asked. ""It feels like we're only able to call out the use of anti-Semitic language by a colleague of ours -- any colleague of ours -- if we're addressing all forms of hatred. It feels like we can't say it's anti-Semitism unless everyone agrees it's anti-Semitism.""Ocasio-Cortez, though, said that Democratic women of color ""are being treated differently"" and ""targeted.""Scalise on Friday once again called for Pelosi to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, a step party leaders have been reluctant to take.“Clearly, Speaker Pelosi is afraid of some of the fringe elements on the socialist left, and that was on full display this week,” he told Fox News.Pelosi told reporters Thursday that thedebate was not about Omar, but about all forms of hatred. Asked Thursday if Omar should apologize, Pelosi said, “It’s up to her to explain,” adding, “I do not believe that she understood the full weight of the words.”Fox News’ Gregg Re and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Only one board member was absent at the time and news of the campaign gained little attention.Criticism began pouring in when the anti-Islamophobia campaign gained traction on news sites and social media. Some called it an unwanted intrusion of Muslim beliefs and culture, while others said it prioritized one religion over another.The San Diego Union School District told Fox News it could not comment on pending litigation, but provided resources that defended its decision to form the program. One of the reasons stemmed from an April survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) which found that Muslim children were more susceptible to bullying in school compared to students practicing other religions, theSan Diego Union-Tribunereported. The survey also found that a teacher or student official was involved in 25 percent of reported anti-Muslim incidents.PROM NIGHT CONFLICT PITS MUSLIM STUDENTS VS.

The district also planned to consider high school clubs that promote American Muslim culture and engage in partnerships with the Council on American Islamic Relations.A letter outlining the plans was expected to be sent to staff and parents of the district's 132,000 students before the school year ends.District officials also provided a detailed outline of Frequently Asked Questions on its website, where it explains how Muslim students weren't obtaining ""special treatment.""""The District takes seriously the bullying of any student, and we have programs and procedures already in place to address bullying,"" according to thewebsite.The district said it would not be endorsing Islam and that the policy did not violate the separation between church and state because they were not promoting or teaching a religion.

Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.,"March 8, 2019",2024-10-15 22:43:39.468531,Islamophobia,Fox News,International,"The passageThursday of a broad anti-bigotry resolutionthatexposed chasmsin the Democratic caucus regarding Israel marked a coup of sorts for a tight-knit band of House freshmen who – in a matter of hours – were able to shift the spotlight away from embattled Rep. Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.“The week was supposed to start off with a rebuke of Omar's anti-Semitic comments and it ended up turning into a long list of other hateful actions,” House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News on Friday, saying the final product “fell short of addressing the real problem.”The House resolution, following aweek of Democratic infightingover the language, was approved on a 407-23 vote. The measure originally was drafted in response to Omar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, suggesting last week that Israel supporters want U.S. lawmakers to pledge “allegiance” to the Jewish state – which was widely condemned as echoing the age-old “dual loyalties” smear against Jewish politicians.ANTI-OMAR POSTER IGNITES OUTRAGE AT WEST VIRGINIA CAPITOLYet after Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced a rebellion in the ranks amid concerns the resolution would unfairly single out Omar, a Muslim, and increase security threats against her (she was recently the subject of an inflammatory posterat the West Virginia capitol falsely tying her to the 9/11 attacks), the resolution was overhauled.The result was a broad rebuke of bigotry, including anti-Semitism as well as “anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities” perpetrated by white supremacists and others. The resolution condemned “dual loyalty” accusations, but did not mention Omar by name.After its passage, Omar and her allies were able to cheer the resolution as a win against Islamophobia.“Today is historic on many fronts. It’s the first time we have voted on a resolution condemning Anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation’s history. Anti-Muslim crimes have increased 99% from 2014-2016 and are still on the rise,” Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Rep. André Carson, D-Ind., said in a joint statement. “We are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry including anti-Semitism, racism, and white supremacy. At a time when extremism is on the rise, we must explicitly denounce religious intolerance of all kinds and acknowledge the pain felt by all communities.”On the sidelines, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign began fundraising, claiming AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) was “coming after” her, Omar and Tlaib for questioning American foreign policy. The fundraising message cited a recent quote from an AIPAC activist predicting the three freshmen “will not be around in several years.”Further, Ocasio-Cortez sought to turn the tables on the 23 Republican members who opposed the resolution, suggesting a double-standard was at play.PELOSI FACES REVOLT OVER ANTI-SEMITISM RESOLUTION“Where’s the outrage over the 23 GOP members who voted NO on a resolution condemning bigotry today? Oh, there’s none?” she tweeted. “Did they get called out, raked over, ambushed in halls and relentlessly asked why not? No? Okay. Got it.”Those who voted against the resolution, though, said they did so out of concern it was watered down.“It was spineless ... it was unfortunately filled with moral equivalency and double standards,” Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who is Jewish, told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney said in a statement that the resolution vote “was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism.”But the developments of the past week underscored the rising influence of some of the chamber’s newest members and their allies, whose objections helped reshape what was essentially a rebuke of one of them into a message every member in the caucus could support.And it pointed to emerging divisions and disagreements inside the party unlikely to resolve soon.During debate on the House floor over the resolution, Rep. Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, slammed party leaders for hesitating to sharply condemn Omar, and remarked that supporting language condemning anti-Semitism ""shouldn’t be this hard.""""Why are we unable to singularly condemn anti-Semitism?"" Deutch asked. ""It feels like we're only able to call out the use of anti-Semitic language by a colleague of ours -- any colleague of ours -- if we're addressing all forms of hatred. It feels like we can't say it's anti-Semitism unless everyone agrees it's anti-Semitism.""Ocasio-Cortez, though, said that Democratic women of color ""are being treated differently"" and ""targeted.""Scalise on Friday once again called for Pelosi to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, a step party leaders have been reluctant to take.“Clearly, Speaker Pelosi is afraid of some of the fringe elements on the socialist left, and that was on full display this week,” he told Fox News.Pelosi told reporters Thursday that thedebate was not about Omar, but about all forms of hatred. Asked Thursday if Omar should apologize, Pelosi said, “It’s up to her to explain,” adding, “I do not believe that she understood the full weight of the words.”Fox News’ Gregg Re and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Only one board member was absent at the time and news of the campaign gained little attention.Criticism began pouring in when the anti-Islamophobia campaign gained traction on news sites and social media. Some called it an unwanted intrusion of Muslim beliefs and culture, while others said it prioritized one religion over another.The San Diego Union School District told Fox News it could not comment on pending litigation, but provided resources that defended its decision to form the program. One of the reasons stemmed from an April survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) which found that Muslim children were more susceptible to bullying in school compared to students practicing other religions, theSan Diego Union-Tribunereported. The survey also found that a teacher or student official was involved in 25 percent of reported anti-Muslim incidents.PROM NIGHT CONFLICT PITS MUSLIM STUDENTS VS.

The district also planned to consider high school clubs that promote American Muslim culture and engage in partnerships with the Council on American Islamic Relations.A letter outlining the plans was expected to be sent to staff and parents of the district's 132,000 students before the school year ends.District officials also provided a detailed outline of Frequently Asked Questions on its website, where it explains how Muslim students weren't obtaining ""special treatment.""""The District takes seriously the bullying of any student, and we have programs and procedures already in place to address bullying,"" according to thewebsite.The district said it would not be endorsing Islam and that the policy did not violate the separation between church and state because they were not promoting or teaching a religion.

Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.,"March 8, 2019",2024-10-15 22:43:44.448045,Islamophobia,Fox News,International,"The passageThursday of a broad anti-bigotry resolutionthatexposed chasmsin the Democratic caucus regarding Israel marked a coup of sorts for a tight-knit band of House freshmen who – in a matter of hours – were able to shift the spotlight away from embattled Rep. Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.“The week was supposed to start off with a rebuke of Omar's anti-Semitic comments and it ended up turning into a long list of other hateful actions,” House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News on Friday, saying the final product “fell short of addressing the real problem.”The House resolution, following aweek of Democratic infightingover the language, was approved on a 407-23 vote. The measure originally was drafted in response to Omar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, suggesting last week that Israel supporters want U.S. lawmakers to pledge “allegiance” to the Jewish state – which was widely condemned as echoing the age-old “dual loyalties” smear against Jewish politicians.ANTI-OMAR POSTER IGNITES OUTRAGE AT WEST VIRGINIA CAPITOLYet after Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced a rebellion in the ranks amid concerns the resolution would unfairly single out Omar, a Muslim, and increase security threats against her (she was recently the subject of an inflammatory posterat the West Virginia capitol falsely tying her to the 9/11 attacks), the resolution was overhauled.The result was a broad rebuke of bigotry, including anti-Semitism as well as “anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities” perpetrated by white supremacists and others. The resolution condemned “dual loyalty” accusations, but did not mention Omar by name.After its passage, Omar and her allies were able to cheer the resolution as a win against Islamophobia.“Today is historic on many fronts. It’s the first time we have voted on a resolution condemning Anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation’s history. Anti-Muslim crimes have increased 99% from 2014-2016 and are still on the rise,” Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Rep. André Carson, D-Ind., said in a joint statement. “We are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry including anti-Semitism, racism, and white supremacy. At a time when extremism is on the rise, we must explicitly denounce religious intolerance of all kinds and acknowledge the pain felt by all communities.”On the sidelines, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign began fundraising, claiming AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) was “coming after” her, Omar and Tlaib for questioning American foreign policy. The fundraising message cited a recent quote from an AIPAC activist predicting the three freshmen “will not be around in several years.”Further, Ocasio-Cortez sought to turn the tables on the 23 Republican members who opposed the resolution, suggesting a double-standard was at play.PELOSI FACES REVOLT OVER ANTI-SEMITISM RESOLUTION“Where’s the outrage over the 23 GOP members who voted NO on a resolution condemning bigotry today? Oh, there’s none?” she tweeted. “Did they get called out, raked over, ambushed in halls and relentlessly asked why not? No? Okay. Got it.”Those who voted against the resolution, though, said they did so out of concern it was watered down.“It was spineless ... it was unfortunately filled with moral equivalency and double standards,” Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who is Jewish, told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney said in a statement that the resolution vote “was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism.”But the developments of the past week underscored the rising influence of some of the chamber’s newest members and their allies, whose objections helped reshape what was essentially a rebuke of one of them into a message every member in the caucus could support.And it pointed to emerging divisions and disagreements inside the party unlikely to resolve soon.During debate on the House floor over the resolution, Rep. Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, slammed party leaders for hesitating to sharply condemn Omar, and remarked that supporting language condemning anti-Semitism ""shouldn’t be this hard.""""Why are we unable to singularly condemn anti-Semitism?"" Deutch asked. ""It feels like we're only able to call out the use of anti-Semitic language by a colleague of ours -- any colleague of ours -- if we're addressing all forms of hatred. It feels like we can't say it's anti-Semitism unless everyone agrees it's anti-Semitism.""Ocasio-Cortez, though, said that Democratic women of color ""are being treated differently"" and ""targeted.""Scalise on Friday once again called for Pelosi to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, a step party leaders have been reluctant to take.“Clearly, Speaker Pelosi is afraid of some of the fringe elements on the socialist left, and that was on full display this week,” he told Fox News.Pelosi told reporters Thursday that thedebate was not about Omar, but about all forms of hatred. Asked Thursday if Omar should apologize, Pelosi said, “It’s up to her to explain,” adding, “I do not believe that she understood the full weight of the words.”Fox News’ Gregg Re and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Only one board member was absent at the time and news of the campaign gained little attention.Criticism began pouring in when the anti-Islamophobia campaign gained traction on news sites and social media. Some called it an unwanted intrusion of Muslim beliefs and culture, while others said it prioritized one religion over another.The San Diego Union School District told Fox News it could not comment on pending litigation, but provided resources that defended its decision to form the program. One of the reasons stemmed from an April survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) which found that Muslim children were more susceptible to bullying in school compared to students practicing other religions, theSan Diego Union-Tribunereported. The survey also found that a teacher or student official was involved in 25 percent of reported anti-Muslim incidents.PROM NIGHT CONFLICT PITS MUSLIM STUDENTS VS.

A district staff added that students already learned about Islam, but more resources would be beneficial.The policy would ensure Muslim holidays would be recognized on staff calendars, but students would not be getting those days off. The district also planned to consider high school clubs that promote American Muslim culture and engage in partnerships with the Council on American Islamic Relations.A letter outlining the plans was expected to be sent to staff and parents of the district's 132,000 students before the school year ends.District officials also provided a detailed outline of Frequently Asked Questions on its website, where it explains how Muslim students weren't obtaining ""special treatment.""""The District takes seriously the bullying of any student, and we have programs and procedures already in place to address bullying,"" according to thewebsite.The district said it would not be endorsing Islam and that the policy did not violate the separation between church and state because they were not promoting or teaching a religion.

""There can be a more commonsense approach to this where all students can be protected and no students are being favored to the disadvantage of anyone else.""Hanif Mohebi, executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations' San Diego chapter, said the lawsuit ""seems to be an attempt to have the courts enforce growing Islamophobia in our state and nation, and to strip away much-needed protection for Muslim students who face increasing bullying.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.,"March 8, 2019",2024-10-15 22:43:51.156616,Islamophobia,Fox News,International,"The passageThursday of a broad anti-bigotry resolutionthatexposed chasmsin the Democratic caucus regarding Israel marked a coup of sorts for a tight-knit band of House freshmen who – in a matter of hours – were able to shift the spotlight away from embattled Rep. Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.“The week was supposed to start off with a rebuke of Omar's anti-Semitic comments and it ended up turning into a long list of other hateful actions,” House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News on Friday, saying the final product “fell short of addressing the real problem.”The House resolution, following aweek of Democratic infightingover the language, was approved on a 407-23 vote. The measure originally was drafted in response to Omar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, suggesting last week that Israel supporters want U.S. lawmakers to pledge “allegiance” to the Jewish state – which was widely condemned as echoing the age-old “dual loyalties” smear against Jewish politicians.ANTI-OMAR POSTER IGNITES OUTRAGE AT WEST VIRGINIA CAPITOLYet after Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced a rebellion in the ranks amid concerns the resolution would unfairly single out Omar, a Muslim, and increase security threats against her (she was recently the subject of an inflammatory posterat the West Virginia capitol falsely tying her to the 9/11 attacks), the resolution was overhauled.The result was a broad rebuke of bigotry, including anti-Semitism as well as “anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities” perpetrated by white supremacists and others. The resolution condemned “dual loyalty” accusations, but did not mention Omar by name.After its passage, Omar and her allies were able to cheer the resolution as a win against Islamophobia.“Today is historic on many fronts. It’s the first time we have voted on a resolution condemning Anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation’s history. Anti-Muslim crimes have increased 99% from 2014-2016 and are still on the rise,” Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Rep. André Carson, D-Ind., said in a joint statement. “We are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry including anti-Semitism, racism, and white supremacy. At a time when extremism is on the rise, we must explicitly denounce religious intolerance of all kinds and acknowledge the pain felt by all communities.”On the sidelines, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign began fundraising, claiming AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) was “coming after” her, Omar and Tlaib for questioning American foreign policy. The fundraising message cited a recent quote from an AIPAC activist predicting the three freshmen “will not be around in several years.”Further, Ocasio-Cortez sought to turn the tables on the 23 Republican members who opposed the resolution, suggesting a double-standard was at play.PELOSI FACES REVOLT OVER ANTI-SEMITISM RESOLUTION“Where’s the outrage over the 23 GOP members who voted NO on a resolution condemning bigotry today? Oh, there’s none?” she tweeted. “Did they get called out, raked over, ambushed in halls and relentlessly asked why not? No? Okay. Got it.”Those who voted against the resolution, though, said they did so out of concern it was watered down.“It was spineless ... it was unfortunately filled with moral equivalency and double standards,” Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who is Jewish, told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney said in a statement that the resolution vote “was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism.”But the developments of the past week underscored the rising influence of some of the chamber’s newest members and their allies, whose objections helped reshape what was essentially a rebuke of one of them into a message every member in the caucus could support.And it pointed to emerging divisions and disagreements inside the party unlikely to resolve soon.During debate on the House floor over the resolution, Rep. Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, slammed party leaders for hesitating to sharply condemn Omar, and remarked that supporting language condemning anti-Semitism ""shouldn’t be this hard.""""Why are we unable to singularly condemn anti-Semitism?"" Deutch asked. ""It feels like we're only able to call out the use of anti-Semitic language by a colleague of ours -- any colleague of ours -- if we're addressing all forms of hatred. It feels like we can't say it's anti-Semitism unless everyone agrees it's anti-Semitism.""Ocasio-Cortez, though, said that Democratic women of color ""are being treated differently"" and ""targeted.""Scalise on Friday once again called for Pelosi to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, a step party leaders have been reluctant to take.“Clearly, Speaker Pelosi is afraid of some of the fringe elements on the socialist left, and that was on full display this week,” he told Fox News.Pelosi told reporters Thursday that thedebate was not about Omar, but about all forms of hatred. Asked Thursday if Omar should apologize, Pelosi said, “It’s up to her to explain,” adding, “I do not believe that she understood the full weight of the words.”Fox News’ Gregg Re and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Only one board member was absent at the time and news of the campaign gained little attention.Criticism began pouring in when the anti-Islamophobia campaign gained traction on news sites and social media. Some called it an unwanted intrusion of Muslim beliefs and culture, while others said it prioritized one religion over another.The San Diego Union School District told Fox News it could not comment on pending litigation, but provided resources that defended its decision to form the program. One of the reasons stemmed from an April survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) which found that Muslim children were more susceptible to bullying in school compared to students practicing other religions, theSan Diego Union-Tribunereported. The survey also found that a teacher or student official was involved in 25 percent of reported anti-Muslim incidents.PROM NIGHT CONFLICT PITS MUSLIM STUDENTS VS. EDUCATION OFFICIALSAlong with protecting Muslim students from bullying by creating ""safe spaces,"" the district would provide more lessons about Islam to help students better understand the religion, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune. A district staff added that students already learned about Islam, but more resources would be beneficial.The policy would ensure Muslim holidays would be recognized on staff calendars, but students would not be getting those days off. The district also planned to consider high school clubs that promote American Muslim culture and engage in partnerships with the Council on American Islamic Relations.A letter outlining the plans was expected to be sent to staff and parents of the district's 132,000 students before the school year ends.District officials also provided a detailed outline of Frequently Asked Questions on its website, where it explains how Muslim students weren't obtaining ""special treatment.""""The District takes seriously the bullying of any student, and we have programs and procedures already in place to address bullying,"" according to thewebsite.The district said it would not be endorsing Islam and that the policy did not violate the separation between church and state because they were not promoting or teaching a religion. The initiative was not a ""separate effort"" from its current anti-bullying policy for all students, the site stated.The lawsuit, however, asks a judge to immediately halt the policy while the merits of the claim are considered.TEXAS TEACHER'S 'MOST LIKELY TO BECOME A TERRORIST' AWARD FOR STUDENT DRAWS BACKLASHLiMandri said he was open to settlement talks and that an attorney for the school district appeared open to revisiting its partnership with the Council on American-Islamic Relations.""No one is saying we have to have expensive, protracted litigation,"" LiMandri said at a news conference Thursday. ""There can be a more commonsense approach to this where all students can be protected and no students are being favored to the disadvantage of anyone else.""Hanif Mohebi, executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations' San Diego chapter, said the lawsuit ""seems to be an attempt to have the courts enforce growing Islamophobia in our state and nation, and to strip away much-needed protection for Muslim students who face increasing bullying.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

In 2008, its leadersreceived life sentencesfor ""funneling $12 million to Hamas,"" which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization.
