Why?,"Defining anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe is not just about confronting hatred, it's also about understanding the deep institutional currents that fan anti-Muslim discourse.",6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,TRT World,International,"Defining anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe is not just about confronting hatred, it's also about understanding the deep institutional currents that fan anti-Muslim discourse.  After more than two years of consultation, including interviews with academics, charities, politicians and the wider Muslim community, a group of MPs in the UK will attempt to put forward a working definition of ‘Islamophobia’. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) that initiated the process consists of a group of MPs across party lines. The report notes that even as the UK government has made a mild effort to tackle Islamophobia, “there has been no attempt to adopt a definition of Islamophobia by Government despite recognising the significant impact the problem has on British Muslim communities”. Under the current Conservative Party government the Muslim community has often felt neglected, and at worst, placed in the crosshairs of a state-led effort to institutionalise the ‘othering’ of Muslims. How is Islamophobia defined?  The term Islamophobia has gained increasing political currency over the last decade. The APPG has put forward the following definition of the term: “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."" The government, on the one hand, argues that it is fighting Islamophobia but on the other hand has disputed the need for a definition, stating: “We do not accept the need for a definitive definition.” This understanding begs the question: what is the government fighting against if it has not defined what the problem is in the first place? For proponents of the definition, albeit not perfect, has made strides towards addressing how anti-Muslim sentiment has become widespread and more importantly leaves the door open to addressing institutional Islamophobia.  Dr Katy Sian a Lecturer of Sociology at the University of York told TRT World she believes the current proposed definition marks a radical departure from previous definitions. She said: “[It] moves it away from individual biases and prejudices to a more critical and analytical understanding. By showing its links with racism it is showing Islamophobia’s structural nature.” In the immediate period after the ‘War on Terror’, the US and UK in particular set about implementing a set of policies that had the impact of silencing Muslim opinion and damping social activism. These policies had the intended impact of normalising suspicion and discrimination against Britain’s Muslim population. Policing mosques, beards, speech, community activism and women’s clothing became an acceptable form of stigmatising and securitising Muslim communities. Had these practices been applied to a particular ethnic group they would have been considered a form of racism but Islamophobia has no set definition and in particular no legally acceptable definition, making such intrusive policing acceptable and institutionalised. Professor Salman Sayyid from Leeds University proposed the APPG’s definition of Islamophobia alongside his colleague Abdoolkarim Vakil at King’s College. They have argued that government policies have surreptitiously exploited the lack of clear definitions to push policies that would otherwise be considered discriminatory. Sayyid has laid out his rationale for the development of racial policies on a religious community. He explained: “Because Muslims are not a race the systemic violations directed against them cannot be racially motivated. Because Muslims are not a race their subjugation is not racism.” However, the current definition, if adopted by the government and introduced in legislation, would go some way to addressing this disparity. Linda Hyokki, Senior Research Associate at the Center for Islam and Global Affairs at Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University, spoke to TRT World, arguing that the current working definition has the potential of moving the debate away “from the everlasting disputes about whether or not the term ‘Islamophobia’ is suitable for its intended purpose”. In the past, the debate has been muddied, mainly by right-wing opponents. According to Hyokki, they argue: “Because it is called a ‘phobia’, it would only denote a fear of Muslims and as such would not make sense because the way in which people think of Muslims and behave towards Muslims could not be compared to other phobias, which are oftentimes clinical conditions."" Anti-Muslim sentiment, when viewed in these terms, is far from being an irrational fear of Islam. It is a deliberate, institutional and systemic approach towards the Muslim community’s set of beliefs and practices. Rising Anti-Muslim sentiment A recent poll showed that a majority of people in Western Europe were in favour of restrictions on Muslim women's religious attire - and where public sentiment has moved in that direction, so have the laws of those countries. In August of this year, Denmark became the latest Western European country to ban Muslim women from wearing the face veil following Austria, Belgium and France, as well as parts of Italy and Spain who have enacted similar laws over the last decade. “Muslims are constantly used as a punching bag by the UK mainstream media, with news articles frequently referring to Muslim communities as being illiberal, backwards and a threat to the West,” said a spokesman for Muslim Engagement and Development (MEND) to TRT World, a UK-based NGO focusing on media monitoring. These developments also reflect a wider trend across the western world to see limits on Muslim migration, not just in light of US President Donald Trump, but as part of a growing atmosphere of hostility towards Muslims. In a 2006 speech Douglas Murray, a leading British journalist and author well positioned to advise policymakers and government officials stated: “Conditions for Muslims in Europe must be made harder across the board: Europe must look like a less attractive proposition. We in Europe owe – after all – no special dues to Islam.”",,,,
TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/anti-zionism-anti-semitism-and-the-disregard-for-islamophobia-12721872,"Anti-Zionism, anti-semitism, and the disregard for Islamophobia","A rise in anti-semitism deserves attention and action against it - but it should not be conflated with anti-Zionism, and Islamophobia should not be ignored in the process.",6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,TRT World,International,"A rise in anti-semitism deserves attention and action against it - but it should not be conflated with anti-Zionism, and Islamophobia should not be ignored in the process. People attend a national gathering to protest antisemitism and the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in the Place de la Republique in Paris, France, February 19, 2019. The writing on the sign reads: ""Antisemitism, islamophobia, racism - not in our name"". It is difficult to dispute the fact that there is a rise in anti-semitic behaviour across the world today. However, it is quite problematic that politicians across the spectrum are either manipulating this fact for their political gain or are genuinely ignorant The most recent example is a report from France24 noting that French President Emmanual Macron’s intends to recognise anti-Zionism as anti-Semitism. He said at the Annual Dinner of the Council of Jewish Institutions in France that his government will take measures to define, “anti-Zionism as a modern-day form of anti-Semitism.” This comes off the back of an incident that occurred during a Yellow Vest protest concerning academic Alain Finkielkraut wherein a video recording showed protesters hurling remarks such as “dirty Zionist.”  Also, close to the city of Strasbourg close to 100 Jewish graves were defiled with Swastikas. It's understandable that the French leader would want to take measures against this violence but what he fails to understand is that the terms are not interchangeable.  As Dr Azmi Bishara points out, there is no connection between the two ideas.  He says, “Regardless of whether Macron really wants to, or even can, pass legislation of this kind, it seems that he is ignorant about both anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. He will be surprised to find that not only are some of the most important thinkers on anti-Zionism or anti-Zionists Jewish intellectuals of various political persuasions, but anti-Zionism itself, like Zionism, is a Jewish phenomenon – emerging originally as a Jewish response to Zionism.” In his piece, he continues to highlight the different Jewish groups which are consistently opposed to Zionism - which positions the problem in a new context. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) too distinguishes between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as [anti-Semitic].” The key to differentiating between the two ultimately leads to the Israeli state.  In sum, Zionism was a project started to create a home for the Jewish people in the historical land of Palestine. While there is more nuance to the issue, essentially, it means that criticism of Zionism is a valid criticism of a settler-colonial project. Why then in the UK and the US is there growing confusion between the two terms causing political scandal where none should be. Why are there accusations against US representative Ilhan Omar of being an anti-semite for practising the influence of The American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC, on American politics? In the UK Labour party, 9 Members of Parliament resigned citing criticism in how the party deals with anti-semitism within and outside of the party. This caused a media frenzy and heated statements from resigned members, calling it Labour’s ‘worst day.’  A BBC report on Labour’s comments accepting IHRA’s definition of anti-Semitism, “It included an extra statement saying this should not undermine free speech on Israel. Jeremy Corbyn proposed a longer additional statement - which would have allowed criticism of the foundation of the state of Israel as racist - but this was not accepted by the party's ruling executive.” These two issues each stem separately from a criticism of Israel’s state and foreign policies, not discrimination against the global Jewish population. If politicians at the highest rank fail to make this distinction for public knowledge, it will continue to increase the hegemonic rhetoric allowing the Israeli occupation of Palestine to continue. Amidst all this confusion surrounding discrimination of one religious group, we must also ask why the persistent attacks on another continue without the same indignation? One needs only to return to France to understand the contrast. French retailer Decathlon announced their decision to scrap their ‘running hijab’ in France amidst serious outcry, from non-veiled women, against this product for defying moral values. This included politicians such as the Health Minister saying that while such a product is not illegal, “it's a vision of women that I don't share. I would prefer if a French brand did not promote the headscarf.”  This product is set to go on sale in over 40 other countries after it’s enormous success in Morocco. A large part of the French population, politicians, and the current government fail to recognise that this effectively seeks to exclude veiled women from sports, much like they have successfully banned veiled girls from public schools. For this to be misconstrued as anything but discrimination, and xenophobia is questionable.  The country’s leader goes so far as to hope to, “reduce the influence of Arab countries, which prevents French Islam from entering modernity,” thus a French reform of Islam.  Rather than invest in improved integration that encourages acceptance on both sides of the debate the current position openly vilifies one religion and weaponises oppressive political ideologies.",,,,

Not until proponents of Islamophobia are confronted, will this change. CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND - MARCH 18: Schoolchildren and other well-wishers view flowers and tributes near Al Noor mosque on March 18, 2019 in Christchurch, New Zealand. 50 people were killed, and dozens are still injured in hospital after a gunman opened fire on two Christchurch mosques on Friday, 15 March. The accused attacker, 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, has been charged with murder and remanded in custody until April 5. The attack is the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's history. It is difficult to know how to respond to the Christchurch shooting as a Muslim. The immense pain that one feels is salved only by the conviction that God will accept these people as martyrs whose lives were taken simply because of their faith.  The innumerable personal tragedies experienced by the victims’ families and loved ones have been amplified on a global scale by the news cycle and social media. While there is global revulsion at the massacre, Muslims are especially traumatised by the recognition that they were specifically targeted. Muslims in the West carry multiple burdens in the so-called War on Terror. They are just as likely to be victims of an indiscriminate terrorist act perpetrated by a Muslim. The Western Muslim’s potential or actual victimhood is coupled with the frequent Islamophobic insinuation that they are also somehow to blame for terrorism that is, in most cases, a consequence of the Western occupation of Muslim-majority countries.  Alongside this unconscionable state of affairs, Western Muslims are also especially at risk of being targeted by white supremacist terrorist acts. The violence of white privilege Friday’s attack is only one of the latest instances of many decades of anti-Muslim violence on the part of the global structures of white privilege. White supremacists are the blunt edge of the structural inequality that is represented by white privilege, which allows for normalised violence against people of colour globally.  Whether it’s the vicious policing of ghettoised neighbourhoods in Philadelphia, to the bombing into oblivion of civilians in the Middle East for decades, the structures of racial inequality that normalise violence against non-white bodies are far more pervasive than most mainstream (and white) commentators are able to recognise. Whiteness is a complex social construct that denotes more than skin colour. The Irish were not considered white in North America until relatively recently. In recent centuries, Ashkenazi Jews faced aggressive mainstream anti-Semitism in Western nations despite looking like the rest of their fellow Westerners. And in recent years, a black president was able to oversee the USA’s vast structures of global violence against non-white peoples as its Commander in Chief.  Whiteness, as scholars have elaborated extensively, denotes something of an ideology or a worldview that privileges some humans over others. White privilege and the ‘War on Terror’ This is something that we would all do well to better understand. For underprivileged groups, such as Muslims who have been dehumanised on a global scale by the discourse of the War on Terror, developing our understanding of how such systems of prejudice work has an obvious urgency. But even those who benefit from the structures of white privilege can recognise how such systems cause one to lose part of one’s humanity. In this context, it is worth acknowledging Islamophobia as a consequence of the globalised structures of white privilege. The forever war that is the War on Terror is part of a structure that allows for the use of one tragedy—the attacks of 9/11 which killed more than 3,000 people—to be used to justify visiting death and destruction upon non-white bodies on an epic scale.  By 2015, a US-based NGO, Physicians for Social Responsibility, estimated that the death toll of the War on Terror had reached “at least 1.3 million, and could be as high as 2 million”.  Four years later in 2019, with ongoing chaos in the Middle East that finds its origins in the Iraq War, one can only imagine how much the death toll might have risen. White privilege allows for such glaringly disproportionate responses to simply be ignored. There is nothing noteworthy about the disparity. It doesn’t even merit comment. This is not even considering the fact that the vast majority of these deaths are innocent civilians. The Islamophobic Trope  In the outpouring of grief that has manifested among Muslims since Friday and from exemplary leaders such as New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, some of the most disturbing responses to the tragedy have come from Muslim public figures. That commentators like the Islamophobia enabler extraordinaire, Maajid Nawaz, would be among them is little surprise.  His Facebook post after the attacks urged Muslims to avoid blaming the “critics of immigration or Islam” and “the political right”, whom he has partnered with for years, in fanning the flames of Islamophobia and reinforcing white privilege. Another example comes from the Muslim scholar, Abdullah bin Bayyah, who heads up the so-called Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies (FPPMS). Bin Bayyah issued a statement on his website and social media advising Muslims to be “patient and tolerant” in response to the atrocity. The Islamophobic trope that runs through such a pronouncement is the suggestion that Muslims are a powder keg of violence simply waiting to explode. Rather than provide comfort to Muslims who are under attack from white supremacists, Bin Bayyah’s concern which takes up half of his statement is that “Muslim rage” is constantly liable of boiling over and thus calls for preemptive restraint.  In fact, Bin Bayyah is complicit in the culture of Islamophobia as the President of the FPPMS in line with the policies of its funder, the UAE Foreign Minister, Abdullah bin Zayed (AbZ). In 2017, the same foreign minister warned Western governments that their Muslim populations were an “ulcer” in their midst, and that these governments would need to aggressively police them to ensure that the dangerous threat of terrorism posed by these immigrant communities would be kept at bay.  Using a familiar white supremacist shibboleth, AbZ argued that European countries were sleepwalking into more terrorist attacks because they were “trying to be politically correct” and failing to recognise that they were “harbouring terrorists and extremists” in their midst.  Getting real about structural Islamophobia In the nearly two decades since 2001, Muslims have been targeted for vilification on the basis of a series of Islamophobic tropes in a global public sphere that is dominated by the paradigms of white privilege.  These have included the tropes of violence, terrorism, irrationality, misogyny, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and paedophilia among a host of others. Such vicious generalisations about any sizeable group are likely to be inaccurate, let alone one with a global population of nearly two billion.  Until those with the power to influence public opinion and policy are willing to recognise the structural inequalities that underlie Islamophobia as a global phenomenon, little is likely to change. And until respected mainstream proponents of Islamophobia are treated as pariahs, whose race-baiting has directly contributed to the evils of white supremacy, the horrors of Christchurch will continue to be visited on Muslim bodies over and over and over again.",,,,

The council repeated a demand for the government to create a parliamentary panel to study rising Islamophobia. Graffiti beside swastika reads: No Arab here. You can read the 74-page manifesto written by the Christchurch mosque shooter, but that’s what he wants you to do. It’s impossible to separate the misdirection from the trolling, from the lies. It’s a work of fiction, and you’re not likely to learn much about the root of white supremacy.  But another letter written by a white supremacist murderer provides a much clearer window into the mind of a person that carries out racist violence. Unlike the Christchurch killer, he did not intend for the general public, or even a coven of Internet trolls on 8chan, to read what he wrote.  “To my brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ our savior and Lord, my name is John D. Carothers and I believe the Bible is about white people and for white people,” Carothers wrote from prison to a white supremacist group, from which he also requested a study bible.  “I am in Rutherford County Jail for burning a black man. I set him on fire with lighter fluid poured on his head.” Carothers, 53, a white American man from Tennessee, burned a black man to death on March 17, 2018, pouring lighter fluid on him while he slept. His victim, Robert Miller, 40, was a person under the care of Carrothers, who was then working as a home health aide at a veterans’ residence in Murfreesboro, a town outside Nashville.  Miller died from his burns ten days later.  When he first committed the crime, Carothers act of violence seemed to lack a motive. Once the letter was intercepted by authorities, the story garnered a brief flash of attention, as the horrific act gained a wider, even more, disturbing meaning.  Although crudely composed, Carothers’ letter provides a startlingly simple calculus for white supremacist thought. The Bible is “about white people and for white people.”  The Christchurch killer included in his manifesto provocative statements about “reclaiming” Istanbul for Christians. But we should consider those messages as deliberate attempts at incitement, repackaging of “Deus Vult” crusader memes that titillate the chan crowd with a twisted, atavistic sense of belonging online. Carothers, however, was not seeking to broadcast his white supremacist views. A detective unsealed his letter and read it to a court considering his sentence. Prosecutors expressed their revulsion at the racism behind the murder. The churn of the local and national news cycle swallowed the story. Nevertheless, Carothers’ letter remains as a reminder of the link between religion and racism that underpins white nationalist movements across the world. Even those that don’t embrace Christianity, or reject it outright, can justify Islamophobia or antisemitism as necessary to ‘preserve’ Christian culture. And this phenomenon is not limited to those who would see Christianity through the lens of white supremacy. Fair-skinned Israeli settlers in the West Bank will hurl racist slurs (“N---rs don’t expel Jews”) even at Ethiopian Israeli soldiers who try to evict them from their illegal outposts. People of colour who travelled to Syria to join Daesh were not welcome to join the top ranks of that nihilistic terrorist enterprise. Some of them found themselves cleaning latrines, and quickly found a reason to regret their decision. There is a pattern here, one far clearer than anything the Christchurch manifesto offers. The most violent and ruthless ideologies combine hatred of other races with hatred of other religions. What makes these ideologies so dangerous is that they demand allegiance from their adherents’ skin colour and soul at the same time. Indeed, they fuse physical traits and the spiritual together. What that means for people infected by these ideologies is that there’s no way out. Their skin becomes not just their uniform, but also their soul.",,,,

In adopting the definition, Jennie Formby, the General Secretary of the Labour Party said: “I’m proud that Labour’s NEC adopted the working definition of #Islamophobia produced by the APPG on British Muslims. We must tackle Islamophobia, build a common understanding of its cause and consequences and express solidarity with Muslim communities.” The APPG spent more than two years speaking to academics and civil society organisations before adopting the following definition: “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."" The adoption by the Labour Party puts it at odds with the ruling Conservative Party which has so far failed to adopt a working definition of Islamophobia. The APPG in its report criticised Theresa May’s government for not doing enough to tackle Islamophobia saying: “There has been no attempt to adopt a definition of Islamophobia by Government despite recognising the significant impact the problem has on British Muslim communities.” The Labour MP and Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, Naz Shah, also recently called out the Conservative Party response to Islamophobia citing its refusal to “listen and deny the problem exists let alone accept the need for any inquiry.” Shah, who is also the Vice Chairman of the APPG which produced the working definition, has also called the refusal by the Conservatives to come to terms with discrimination in their party as “disgraceful”.

In light of the terrorist attack in New Zealand, which saw 51 Muslim worshippers massacred by white nationalist Brenton Tarrant, Warsi spoke of the need for her party to confront Islamophobia, adding: “u can duck & dive but I will keep bringing this fight to u [sic].” The former Conservative foreign secretary Boris Johnson has called women who don the niqab “letterboxes” and have been widely condemned for normalising discrimination towards Muslim women.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday called for a global fight against rising anti-Muslim bigotry along the same lines as ""anti-Semitism after the Holocaust"" following the deadly attacks on two New Zealand mosques. Speaking at a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul to discuss last week's twin terrorist attacks on two New Zealand mosques that killed at least 50 Muslim worshippers during Friday prayers, President Erdogan said that Muslim nations must take action against developments threatening the future of humanity. Friday marks exactly one week since the attacks on the Al Noor and Linwood mosques in Christchurch. Australian-born Brenton Tarrant, 28, has been charged for the massacre and is being held at a maximum-security prison in Auckland.  Among the victims were four children under the age of 18. Other children are still being treated at local hospitals for injuries they sustained during the attack. Erdogan also praised New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's reaction to the terror attacks, calling it a model for all leaders around the world. ""Humanity should fight Islamophobia with same determination it fought anti-Semitism after the Holocaust,"" Erdogan said. Islamophobia not only subject of politics, civil society, or scholarship but concern for security forces, statesmen, and people in streets, the Turkish president further said. Erdogan also thanked New Zealand authorities, people, premier for showing the truth, their firm stand against the terrorist attacks on the mosques. Golan Heights Erdogan said he will never allow occupation of Golan Heights to be legitimised, adding that US president’s ""unfortunate"" remarks on the Golan Heights brought the region to the brink of a new crisis and tension.

Following the massacre of Muslim worshippers at a mosque in Christchurch by an Islamophobic fascist, we must now begin to look at Islamophobia not simply as a global phenomenon, but as a phenomenon intimately tied to the current epoch – an epoch defined by movements against egalitarianism and liberalism. An epoch where genocide and the state-led mass murder and persecution of Muslims has become normalised. In Brenton Tarrant, the fascist murderer responsible for the Chirstchurch massacre, we see can see Islamophobia, or anti-Muslim bigotry, for what it is – an ideology intimately attached to genocide and mass murder.  It begins with people saying they have concerns about ‘radical Islam’, but these are merely code words when applied to Muslim communities in general – code words that conceal or obfuscate the fact that the concern isn’t with the perceived ‘radicalism’ of Islam, but with the very presence of Muslims in the West. For all the stuff that will be written about Tarrant’s perceived motivations, and many British newspapers have gone for a bizarre ‘ordinary white man went bad’ narrative, he has been nothing if not upfront about his direct aims. He calls not just Muslims, but all non-whites ‘invaders’ who threaten to ‘replace’ so-called indigenous populations. But, according to the ideology of Islamophobia, Muslims above all others are the vanguard of this conspiracy or move to usurp white people. Muslims, in the shadow of the ‘war on terror’ and the rise of modern ‘Islamic terrorism’, are constantly depicted as ‘failing to integrate’ and ‘rejecting western values’. This isn’t just the discourse of far-right agitators, but can be found in the pages of mainstream liberal newspapers or in the speeches of mainstream centrist politicians.  In fact, these narratives are often the first line of western societies after instances of ‘Islamic terror’ – they’re always looking at the problem as a communal one that places Muslims as the Others, where, implicitly or explicitly, their ‘Islamicness’ is to blame for the very act of radicalisation.  This produces the familiar absurd calls by non-Muslims for a ‘reformation within Islam’, or for calls for Muslims to somehow dilute or reshape their Muslim identities according to the bigoted demands of Islamophobes.  Mainstreaming the fringe Well what exactly was it that ‘radicalised’ Tarrant to mercilessly exterminate men, women and children for the sole reason that they were Muslims? It certainly wasn’t because his dad had died of a terminal illness as The Daily Mail so bizarrely implied in one of its headlines. While one can rightfully look at the ubiquity of negative stories about Muslims in the media as sources of radicalisation for the likes of Tarrant, there is a much wider aspect to this.  And it is the global aspect of Islamophobia in this epoch. While Tarrant ranted against ‘multiculturalism’, the self-declared fascist also praised the People’s Republic of China as being the state that most aligns with his principles and as a source of emulation. It’s hardly difficult to understand why a fascist would idolise the current Chinese state. Its persecution of mostly Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region conjures both a return to the policies of 20th century fascism and the further degradation of the already crumbling egalitarian world order. It proves very acutely and savagely that concern about ‘radical Islam’ is simply a cover for the true Islamophobic determination that Muslims are simply not wanted.  As many as 1 million Muslims are kept in ‘re-education camps’ where the entire project is designed to rid the Uighurs of their Islamic faith, while there have also been moves by China to inhibit the procreation of Muslims. Along with this, China has been a staunch and vocal defender of the regime in Burma as it carries out genocide against Rohingya Muslims. What links these together is in each case the ideology of Islam and Muslims is painted as an alien and destructive force that seeks to destroy an allegedly ‘civilised’ status quo.  Even in Muslim countries, the ideology of Islamophobia can be appealed to by tyrants seeking approval from western leaders who want to limit Muslim immigration – we’ve seen this used most effectively by Bashar al-Assad and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, as well as the tyrants of the UAE and Saudi Arabia.   This is precisely what is meant by the globalisation and normalisation of Islamophobia. The Arab spring saw the potential social, cultural and political emancipation of vast swathes of Muslims – the counter-revolution, steeped in the idea that Muslims aren’t fit for democracy or liberty and must be ruled by tyrant, has not only bolstered global authoritarianism, but it has justified long-held western Orientalist and racist ideas about ‘the Muslim world’ and the alleged inherent savagery of Islam, complicated by the rise of Daesh. What we’ve seen emerging since 9/11 is a loose, though rapidly coalescent, network of Islamophobic movements concomitant with a more general rise of ethnonationalism, authoritarianism and anti-egalitarianism on the global stage. Whether it’s his veneration of Middle Age Venetian commanders who defeated Ottoman Muslim armies or Serb warlords guilty of the crime of genocide of Muslims in the 1990s, Tarrant is steeped in the global mythos of Islamophobia.  The conclusion is that white non-Muslims have to violently annihilate Muslims or they themselves will be usurped or ‘replaced’. This is the world order that Tarrant craves and though it would be hyperbolic to say this is just around the corner, the fact remains that around the world Muslims face increasing circumstances of genocide, cleansing and persecution. More generally, minorities find themselves under threat from ethnonationalist populists and authoritarians, from Bolsonaro to Trump. A global wave  All around Europe, we’ve witnessed the rise of far-right movements who emphasise Islamophobia – in Poland, Hungary, Italy and Austria, they have gained state power, while they have large electoral representation in Germany, France and Spain.  In the UK, Brexit, whose triumph was inspired by fearmongering about immigration in general and the Islamophobic lies of Turkish accession to the EU and the UK being swamped by Muslim Syrian refugees, currently dominates over everything.  Though the electoral Islamophobic far-right might weakly denounce the massacre, the reality is that it not only serves but is actually a consequence of their agenda of sowing discord among the white majority against Muslims and immigrants.  This is the epoch that has birthed Brenton Tarrant – the epoch of genocide in Bosnia, Syria, Burma and the mass murder of refugees in the Mediterranean fuelled by the rising Islamophobic far-right in Europe. The epoch where an American president can implement a ‘Muslim ban’ and get away with it. We have seen 60,000 fascists marching through the streets of Warsaw calling for an ‘Islamic Holocaust’, while a few nights ago mosques in Birmingham were attacked by racists wielding sledgehammers.  Following the massacre, Jacinda Ardern rightfully warned that the fight against racism was a global one that should know no national boundaries, but given the manner in which those who claim to support egalitarianism, human rights and liberal democracy have sought to appease and ignore fascism, one can only conclude that her warning will fall on deaf ears.   Whether it’s by airstrikes, poison gas or bullets, or whether it’s in concentration camps, besieged towns or mosques, Muslim blood has never been cheaper. Who knows to what new horrors it will lead?",,,,

British Muslims conclude their prayers for the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which marks the end of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, outside London's Central Mosque across from Regent's Park, Friday Sept. 10, 2010. British Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected a definition of Islamophobia determined by a parliamentary group because it needs further “consideration”, a government spokesperson said. The government decision follows comments by British police that the definition risked hindering their anti-terror work. The All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims (APPG BM), which was made up of MPs from across the political spectrum, was set up after the Finsbury Park Terror attack, which left one Muslim worshipper dead in London. Its report concluded that: “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.” Muslim groups have overwhelmingly backed the definition and consider it a necessary step to counter rising anti-Muslim hatred in the UK. Over 750 Muslim organisations urging Theresa May and the Government to accept Islamophobia definition.May to reject the calls on free speech grounds?!?!You have a genuine problem Prime Minister.https://t.co/qoESzq9FWp Though accepted by MPs from the opposition Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, and Conservatives in Scotland, there has been significant push back from the right over claims that it will endanger the right to criticise Islam as a religion. The UK’s largest Muslim body, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), said the government’s decision not to adopt the definition reflected a disinterest in the welfare of Muslims. “Rejecting a definition of Islamophobia that has the support of 750 British Muslim organisations and has been widely accepted by political parties sends a message that this government is not interested in protecting the rights of British Muslims and that the very basic right of Muslims to define their own oppression has been denied,” an MCB spokesperson told TRT World, adding:  “Moreover, those who choose to espouse Islamophobic sentiment will feel empowered now that their right to discriminate against Muslims has been validated, while structural Islamophobia continues to remain unchallenged.” The prime minister’s Conservative party has faced strong criticism for its stance on Islamophobia in recent years. Former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson infamously compared Muslim women who wore the niqab face covering to postboxes, while former 2016 London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith’s campaign was centred around painting his Muslim rival and eventual winner, Sadiq Khan, as a “closet extremist”. Islamophobia is a type of racism #APPGDefinition #IslamophobiaDefined@APPGBritMuslims https://t.co/rqfaB5K5Hb pic.twitter.com/Bv5hA4CoyD Labour MP Wes Streeting, who worked on the APPG BM report, slammed the party in an op-ed for the Guardian newspaper shortly after the government decision. “The party that has so spectacularly failed British Muslims now intends to produce a government definition,” he wrote, continuing: “Its abject failure to understand and tackle Islamophobia within its own ranks suggests it has neither the wisdom nor the credibility to do so.” If this free speech rationale is true, it would mean that the government believes that defining the racism that targets Muslims or expressions of Muslimness somehow impinges on free speech. Defining anti-semitism does not do so, but defining Islamophobia does.Truly shocking. https://t.co/ZP7D0797aE",,,,

In particular, the study shows that contempt cannot always be quantified.",5 YEARS AGO,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,TRT World,International,"A new report issued by the German Islamic Council addresses discrimination against the Muslim community in the country and calls on local institutions to act. In particular, the study shows that contempt cannot always be quantified. A demonstrator carries a flag reading “Islam, no thanks” during a rally of nationalist Alternative for Germany against the planned building of a mosque in Erfurt, eastern Germany, Wednesday, May 18, 2016. Germany’s Islamic council has published an eye-opening and extensive study into the challenges facing Muslim communities in the country within educational institutions and workplaces. The 27-page report, released by Islamrat, paints a gloomy picture about the future of fundamental rights of Muslims living in the country and makes recommendations to political circles for short-term and long-term plans to tackle the issue. The study looks at social exclusion, the increasingly bipolar debate surrounding Muslims and Islam and the day-to-day issues Muslims face within the country. Given the largely negative way in which the community is portrayed within the media, the study highlights both the threat xenophobia has on Muslims and pinpoints ways to quell the anti-Muslim sentiment. More than 7,700 racist crimes were recorded in Germany last year, representing an overall increase of 20 percent. Muslims remain “the other” within media outlets and political spheres In a first, the report discusses why the term “Islamophobia” does not adequately address all forms of discrimination against Muslims and tenets that may not, in fact, be Islamic. “Muslims are declared ‘others’ or ‘strangers’ and are always represented negatively. For the majority, the focus is not so much on the lives of Muslims, but on attributions,” says the report. There were 813 attacks against Muslims and mosques last year in Germany, according to figures released by the German federal parliament. The German government points out that the final figures are likely to be even higher due to a lapse in notifications. The report comes to a similar conclusion. ""Attacks on Muslims and their institutions are on the increase. Unfortunately, anti-Muslim racism has become widespread.” Discrimination starts from kindergarten  This can be seen, for example, in exclusionary practices in which children are labelled as coming from a “migration background” and as such, are seen as “non-homogenous” members of society. Children’s books routinely portray minors from migrant families as “non-German”, exotic or foreign. ""Islam is an essential differentiating feature for the justification of social and societal conditions,” writes Iman Attia, a professor specialising in racism and migration at Alice Salomon University in Berlin, adding “two important elements of racism can be seen in this entanglement of levels: racism serves, on the one hand, to secure privileges and legitimise exploitation and exclusion.” It starts with harassment and ends in violenceMurat Gumus, chairman of the Islamic Council, stresses to TRT World that the report is structured as a “solution-oriented approach” in which “concrete contact partners” in federal ministries are identified.  Gumus says the topic is not getting nearly the amount of attention it requires, adding that there were 90 reported attacks on mosques in 2018. “This is a consequence of the harassment and discrimination that Muslims have faced for years. The problem is that words become acts of violence. Muslims are routinely insulted, mobbed and more and more frequently violently attacked on the street. The inhibition threshold to violence has never been so low,"" Islamrat said in a press release linked to the report. The saddest part, Gumus says, is the increasing number of attacks in broad daylight on Muslim women wearing headscarves, adding that questionable reporting around such incidents has prevailed for more than a decade. German federal politicians recently instituted a new law that bars young girls from covering their hair. While German politicians fuel these narratives, those who are not directly impacted by the law continue to struggle in daily life as their interactions with other Germans become increasingly interlaced with negative prejudices.",,,,

Dr Farid Hafez is targeted by the Austrian state over his work on anti-Muslim hate crime. Academic and anti-Islamophobia scholar, Farid Hafez, was targeted by Austrian authorities as a sign of a growing crackdown on those that speak out against the government's anti-Muslim policies. Hafez, an Austrian academic, spoke out against the raid on his family home for the first time since it happened on November 9, 2020. In a video released on Monday, Hafez, an internationally published academic, recalls guns with infrared dots were aimed at his chest as police sporting balaclavas stormed his house. A scholar on racism and anti-Muslim bigotry, Hafez has been a strong critic of Austria's increasingly draconian policies towards its Muslim minority. Born in a village in Upper Austria, Hafez, in a video, recalls the growing spectre and confidence of the far-right in the country, which has focused in particular on Muslims. ""This is the reason I became interested in Islamophobia because I felt like nobody was talking about it,"" says Hafez in the almost eight-minute video. The Austrian government has seemingly taken notice and is now on a mission to silence Hafez, who works at the University of Salzburg and is a senior research fellow at Georgetown University in the US. Hafez has not been charged with any crimes by the Austrian government, leading some to believe that the government is deliberately harassing the academic in a bid to muzzle his research. One academic called Hafez's treatment by the Austrian state ""a gross miscarriage of justice."" Whereas another called it a ""chilling...witchhunt against a Muslim academic."" During his ordeal, Hafez was asked what he thought about the term Islamophobia and whether he believes ""Muslims [are] discriminated against in Austria"" and even if he prays, casting aside any doubt about why he was targeted. Other questions that were posed to the academic were whether he allows his wife to go to the supermarket and if his children play musical instruments. The Austrian government has also blocked Hafez's bank accounts, putting his family's livelihood in jeopardy. The Austrian authorities have a right to keep the investigation open for up to three years without providing any evidence and without pressing charges while maintaining restrictions on Hafez's bank accounts. In the words of one academic, the state's actions were ""a scary reminder that Islamophobia is entrenched in EU politics and govs aren't shy from politically persecuting Muslim academics."" Supporters of Hafez have set up a fundraising page to help the academic pay for his legal costs. Austria's problem with Islam? The country up until very recently was the only Western country to recognise Islam as an official religion. The move stemmed from the country's annexation of Bosnia in 1908, a land it had occupied for several decades. Muslims in Austria have experienced a relatively strong level of tolerance compared to other European countries, however, that tolerance has recently eroded. The most significant turning point was in 2016 when the then right-wing government changed a century-old law on Islam by making it illegal for mosques to receive funding from abroad while allowing synagogues and churches to continue to do so.  The move was widely seen as an attempt to interfere in the workings of the Muslim community in the country. Since then, the Austrian government has been on a crusade to tighten its grip on the Muslim community. In 2017 the state instituted a niqab ban, a face covering worn by some Muslim women. In 2019, a hijab ban aimed at school girls was overturned in December 2020 after the country's highest court ruled that it was an infringement of Muslims' rights. Austria's right-wing Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has recently sought to create ""political Islam,"" a vaguely defined term, into a criminal offence. Kurz has warned the country's Muslim population that mosques could be closed down, and the state could create a register for imams in a bid keep track of Muslims. When TRT World spoke to Farid Hafez at the time he warned, ""This is the latest step by the government to crush Muslim civil society and send a message out that no one is safe.""",,,,

BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour is immediately recognisable as one of the most forthrightly feminist programmes on air. It’s why you would expect, as the youngest person and first ever woman to be elected head of the Muslim Council of Britain, Zara Mohammed would have been a natural and welcomed guest. And maybe, for the most part, she was. That is until, their Twitter account uploaded a clip showing Emma Barnett persistently questioning an incredulous Zara on the number of female imams in Britain. Not content with the answers given, the host embarked on an antagonistic tirade about how Islam was lagging behind in women’s leadership. There are women priests and rabbis, she claimed, surely there must be female imams?  You’d be forgiven for thinking this was a deeply held conviction for Barnett, such was the strength of feeling behind the line of questioning. You’d also be forgiven for not realising this was in fact the same presenter who was described as “a feminist who believes in equality for women, but, as an orthodox Jew, she’s uncomfortable with female rabbis.” She went on, belittling previous Muslim Council leaders for daring to request that faith be recorded on the national census. If Muslims could be part of a focused campaign to get faith recognised in a once-a-decade questionnaire, why couldn’t they keep meticulous records on the thousands of mosques and their imams, mainly volunteers, up and down the UK? Cue a collective sigh. Even when a woman is leading the largest cross-section of British Muslim society, representing hundreds of mosques, we can’t escape the allegation that we’re not doing enough to promote the leadership of women. You may well be the most accomplished, scholarly and talented Muslim woman in Britain, but if there’s a scarf on your head you’re probably still oppressed.  It seems to be white liberal feminism’s unending quest to prove once and for all that Islam is an inferior and oppressive religion. The formula for enacting the trope is simple. First, you view Islam through a lens of your own choosing – in this case, you don’t know exactly what an imam is or how Muslim prayer works, but it can’t be too different from Christianity and Judaism, and there aren’t any female imams so it must be a problem. You’ve added 2 to 2, and made 500. Second, you belligerently demand unsuspecting followers to churn out explanation upon justification after apology for what you’ve decided to believe about them.  The worst part? Some don’t even realise they’re doing it.  The issue remains that there isn’t a like-for-like comparison that you can use for clerical or religious figures in Islam, Christianity and Judaism. An imam doesn’t hold the religious authority that priests or rabbis do. In this decentralised system, imams will normally be people who can recite and lead prayer. Where there are positions of knowledge and scholarship in Islam, they are equally accessible to both Muslim men and women. Indeed, Sheikh Akram Nadwi is a scholar who has compiled volume upon volume of examples of where Muslim women acquired knowledge and transmitted it, to say nothing about their contributions in fields like recitation, translation and the creation of legal rulings.  Many women and religious minorities whose contributions aren’t well known or given space have sought to reclaim that space within mosques and reassert these rich traditions of female scholarship. What a shame then, that it is these women who are questioned and treated as collaborators in their own oppression. In this environment, leading questions won’t be taken in good faith. It’s this that has incensed Muslim women in particular, who refuse to complete the mental gymnastics it takes to accept lines of questioning (designed to trip us up) with simpering generosity.  No matter how many articles, research papers or headlines are written about Islam, media literacy on the faith remains despondently low and presenters understand very little. It’s one of the reasons why the Muslim Council of Britain set up the Centre for Media Monitoring. Had Barnett attempted even the slightest bit of research or been minded to give Zara a fair hearing on the issue of women’s leadership, she would have found out that the majority of MCB’s projects have, in the last four years, been led by women.  Perhaps she would have been surprised to note that a conference of entirely women speakers was hosted for International Women’s Day two years ago, or that it was followed by a nationwide survey on women’s access to mosques.  Maybe, in her zeal to admonish a Muslim woman about the lack of female leadership in mosques, she might have forgotten that MCB’s continually successful Women in Mosques Development Programme has promoted exactly that since 2018. But how would she remember, when programmes like Woman’s Hour won’t give the representatives of these projects the time of day to begin with? So, no, there may not be female imams in mainstream mosques, but there’s nothing to stop you going into one and finding a woman leading other women in prayer, holding Quran classes or teaching a new generation of scholars. You could definitely argue that there isn’t enough being done to accommodate women, but this is a challenge that many Muslim women have taken head on.  Frankly, the last thing we need is people who don’t understand our situation to bulldoze over all the hard work being done to focus on a non-existent problem like female imams.",,,,

I hope this decision will influence other organisations to change their own rules regarding the hijab, I really hope companies will follow.” Une excellent nouvelle !

Des femmes qui pourront poursuivre à présent leur scolarité et leurs rêves d'avoir une carrière professionnelle. #respect #OpenSchool4Women 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓🧑‍🎓 https://t.co/Z7AbHqWJ7m Until now, Belgium had banned “religious symbols”, including the headscarf worn by Muslim women in their religious practice, in schools, including higher education.  “We are reversing the principle, in the name of the inclusion of the greatest number, of emancipation and the fight against inequalities,” Julien Nicaise, general administrator of Wallonia-Brussels Education (WBE), a public body that manages French-speaking public schools in Belgium told local media on Saturday, adding that there will be restrictions in cases where “security is threatened or for reasons of hygiene"". ""The general interest must come first. We can no longer refuse these young women on the pretext that they wear a veil, prevent them from studying. A diploma is their passport to inclusion through employment.""  The announcement came after years of campaigning by anti-Islamophobia and Muslim women’s rights groups in Belgium. “I think this is a political decision, as we really made a lot of demonstrations, and it’s also a social decision, as more and more Muslims in Belgium are wearing hijab,” said Younsi, who is a co-founder of Collectif les 100 diplômées (100 Graduates Collective), an NGO that supports  young professionals who wear the Islamic headscarf and face discrimination. She tells TRT World that her organisation has been lobbying for the lifting of hijab bans in schools and also tracking incidences of hijab bans in workplaces and public institutions across Belgium.  According to official WBE figures, higher education institutions have 50,000 students, including 20,000 in universities and 30,000 in social advancement institutions. Thus, the new decision concerns five universities, five arts schools and 29 social advancement institutions.  Although Belgium does not keep official demographic records based on religion, it is estimated that out of a population of nearly 11.5 million, over 850,000 are Muslims. Even though not all Muslim women in Belgium wear hijab, the impact of this new decision has the potential to affect a vast number of women who were previously limited in their studies and employment opportunities. The decision was reached by consensus within the board of directors of WBE, which has representatives of all political parties. #HijabisFightBack The news comes after the Belgian constitutional court ruled in June that prohibiting religious symbols, including hijabs, in higher education did not constitute a violation of freedom of religion or the right to education under the Belgian Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights. The decision was slammed by rights activists, anti-Islamophobia organisations, and women’s and feminist collectives, who viewed this as a violation of basic human rights and as a discriminatory act against women.  In response, thousands went online to protest the decision using hashtags like, #TouchePasAMesEtudes (Don’t touch my studies) and #HijabisFightBack. In July, over one thousand (some organisations counted several thousand) gathered in Brussels to advocate for the right to wear headscarves in universities.  Over 1,000 people took to the streets in Belgium to advocate for the right to wear headscarves at universities.

Belgium is a federal country divided into three regions: majority French-speaking Wallonia, majority Flemish-speaking Flanders, and the Brussels-Capital Region. Each region has its own government and legislative body, which decide upon housing, education policy, the economy, and other public matters.  There is still no federal legislation that protects the right of Muslim women to wear the headscarf in universities across Belgium.  Today’s pictures. © Yassin Akouh #HijabisFightBack #TouchePasAMesEtudes pic.twitter.com/fmF0djEQ9F At the same time, headscarf bans in universities are not widespread. Several higher education institutions, including the prestigious KU Leuven and Free University of Brussels (VUB) stated in July that they welcome students ""regardless of gender, origin or social status, with or without a headscarf."" Aan de VUB staan gelijkheid en inclusie centraal. Diversiteit is een feit, ook aan onze universiteit.

The Islamic headscarf is a contentious issue in many European countries, most notoriously in France, where the government has been criticised over the decades for discriminatory and marginalising policies against Muslim women in the name of laïcité (secularism). Studies have shown that anti-Muslim hate crimes overwhelmingly target women. In Belgium, for instance, a recent report found that 9 out 10 victims of Islamophobia were women.  “I have been receiving so many messages from girls wearing hijab saying, ‘Now I can pursue this program,’ or ‘before I was thinking of not doing it, as the hijab is forbidden,’” says Younsi.  “Economically, it will make sense to open school for everyone, no matter their belief. It just makes sense.”",,,,

A Canadian MPP proposed a motion to condemn Islamophobia and racism, but it was rejected by Ontario’s government. “I seek unanimous consent to move a motion without notice condemning all forms of Islamophobia and reaffirming the Legislature’s support for the Anti-Racism Directorate and that the question be put immediately,” said Scarborough-Guildwood Liberal MPP Mitzie Hunter standing in the Ontario legislature on Thursday.  Hunter’s motion proposal came after a hit-and-run attack, one which the police said was “pre-planned” and “targeted hate crime” against a Muslim family in London, Ontario. The attack killed four Muslim family members and left a nine-year-old boy wounded. He is still receiving treatment in a hospital. Triggering a stream of anger and grief across Canada, the attack alarmed human rights advocates who called for all levels of government to take action to tackle Islamophobia. MPPs belonging to the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario blocked the motion on the grounds that they did not receive the legislative text beforehand, which is compulsory as per party policy.   ""What happened today was a Liberal MPP, with no notice, tried to surprise the government with a motion that we still have not seen. It is our policy to turn down all requests for unanimous consent that we have not seen in advance,” said Paul Calandra, the government house leader. But for the Ontario Liberal Party and its members, it is nothing but an excuse.  “Today I asked for the unanimous consent of the legislature to condemn all forms of Islamophobia and to reaffirm support for the Anti-Racism Directorate. @Fordnation 's government said NO,” Mitzie Hunter tweeted on Thursday.  The Party condemned the decision of blocking the motion, saying that “Doug Ford’s Conservative caucus blocked what should have been a simple, meaningful motion for the Muslim community.”  “Now they’re hiding behind procedure — it’s inexcusable,” read the party statement. Two days before his party rejected the proposal, Ontario Premier Doug Ford promised to honour the family and called the attack “an act of terrorism.” When he joined a vigil alongside thousands of people who mourned the dead, he was booed by the crowd.  Doug Ford was boo-ed at the Tuesday vigil for #OurLondonFamily.The people are done with platitudes.

The party stands by the decision saying that the rejection was a procedural requirement, but in the past, the party’s MPPs voted down another legislation that was proposed to combat anti-muslim hate crimes. Liberal MP Iqra Khalid tabled a motion inviting federal politicians to condemn Islamophobia in 2017 after a gunman killed six people and injured 19 worshippers in a Quebec mosque. Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole, who used to be an MP at the time, voted against it alongside many others.

TRT World A celebrated Austrian political scientist who was targeted in a controversial anti-terrorism raid on Muslims by his own government two years ago said on Thursday that the growing Islamophobia worldwide is being fuelled by European nations that label Islam as a political identity to justify their ban on mosques, hijab, halal or circumcision.  Farid Hafez, a widely respected scholar who has written extensively on Islamophobia, was speaking through video conference at a conclave on human rights violations faced by Muslims worldwide, especially in Europe. Hafez, 41, teaches political science at the University of Salzburg, and is also associated with Georgetown University's The Bridge Initiative, a research project on Islamophobia. Hazez  argued that one of the major problems that Muslims face today is “the weaponisation of political Islam” through which countries create terminalogies to target Muslims—Austria’s political Islam, France’s Islamist seperatism and Germany’s legalist Islamism. “They are against Islam and nothing else,” the academic said. Islamophobia is not only about having a bad image of Islam, said Fared, explaining that these European governments use anti-terrorism laws to clamp down on Muslims, jeopardising not only their freedom of speech but also freedom of association.  The Muslim Austrian academic, whose house was raided on November 9, 2020 as part of the Austrian goverment’s anti-terrrorism “Operation Luxor”, said that nowadays even talking about islamophobia is criminalised and considered as instigating terrorism.  “What is really at stake here? It is a question of power,” Hazez said, adding that the European governments do not know how to govern their own Muslim populations today. Explaining that these governments have been used to handling poor working-class immigrants — people who could be subordinated for the past 40 years—Farid said now these European countries are faced with a new generation of Muslims who have full capacity to participate in the European political landscape as active citizens. There is a growing Muslim population in Europe and the far-right’s “superficial solution” to this problem is to drive out the people so as to avoid committing outright genocide, Hafez added. He added that the centrist political parties, which have been shaping policies within the last two decades in a lot of European countries, are taking a different approach: ""We are going to change Muslims and we are going to crack down on their civil society that fights for equality and gives Muslims place as equal citizens in their countries"". “The important take for the Muslim countries, especially those who accommodate and foster this discourse in European countries on behalf of the Muslims is what role are they playing? This will be the defining relationship within the next few decades between those Muslim minorities in Europe and the Muslim majority who are outside of Europe,” Hafez concluded. “This is the key  question every Muslim majority country has to ask itself regarding their future in a wider sense.”  [NOTE: The article came from TRT World’s Eyes on Discrimination (EOD) Centre, which monitors and reports on offences, hate crimes and discrimination on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, national origin and religion, or other related social categories.

Worshippers pray in the street outside the Lakemba Mosque in Sydney during Friday prayers, Friday, Nov. 3, 2006. Non-Muslims who shared neighbourhood spaces with Muslims are less likely to express Islamophobic views, a study by RMIT University has found. The study is part of stage 3 of a larger project focused on “Islamophobia and Neighbourhood Experience” funded by the Government of Australia's Commonwealth Department of Social Services (DSS) through the Strong and Resilient Communities (SARC) National Research Grants program. Islamophobia is defined in the study as “indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims” while neighbourhood experience is a “composite of elements included in the concepts of social capital, local participation and satisfaction with one’s suburbs”. Among the central research questions of the study was to examine the relationships between neighbourhood experience and Islamophobia. The findings were drawn upon data from a survey of 1,020 people – half of which were targeted in the ten suburbs with the highest concentration of Muslims in Sydney and Melbourne, and the other half in the greater metropolitan areas of the two cities. Respondents were given a series of statements that included, “the number of Muslims in Australia is too high,” “I dislike seeing Muslim women with their hair covered,” “I would be opposed to a new mosque being built in my local area” and “I am worried about Muslims forming enclaves in Sydney and Melbourne”. They were asked to agree or disagree with such statements on a five-point scale, which produced an “Islamophobia score” from one (no prejudice) to five (high prejudice). The survey data analysis revealed a number of interesting findings. Among non-Muslims in Sydney and Melbourne, Islamophobia was significantly lower in suburbs with a high proportion of Muslim Australians – such as Lakemba in New South Wales, where Muslims make up 59 percent of residents, or Dandenong, Victoria, where they are 30 percent – than the general populations of both cities, scoring 2.31 compared to 2.80. Respondents who professed no religion or other (non-Islam) religions displayed less Islamophobia than those who identified as Christian, with non-religious respondents scoring 2.48 versus 2.77 of Christian respondents in both metro and target areas. Age and education were important indicators. Those aged 18 to 34 had a lesser Islamophobic score (2.32) than those over 65 did (2.80), and those who were university educated scored 2.47 compared to 2.90 for those with only ten years of schooling. Socio-economic factors were meaningful too. Data showed that occupations associated with higher levels of education tend to be associated with lower Islamophobia, with a statistically significant difference between managers (1.97) and those in sales, laboring or machinery operator positions (2.57). Satisfaction with income was a stronger predictor of Islamophobia than income levels itself, with those stating that they were “comfortable” (2.49) with their incomes displaying lower scores of prejudice than those who stated they were “struggling” (2.86). Meanwhile, respondents from Sydney (2.18) were found to be less Islamophobic than their Melbourne counterparts (2.32), likely due to the fact that Muslims are more concentrated in Sydney suburbs than in Melbourne suburbs, where they are much more dispersed. Overall, the survey’s findings strengthen the evidence of what is known as “contact theory,” which proposes that usually, but not always, contact between people of different backgrounds reduces prejudice between groups. This is in contrast to “threat theory,” which holds that encounters between individuals from different groups may, in certain instances, increase feelings of anxiety and threat perception. The study points out that prior evidence on contact and threat theories in neighbourhoods where minority Muslims share spaces with non-Muslims has been mixed, citing a recent UK study that confirms the contact theory hypothesis but a similar Dutch study that revealed the opposite. Muslims make up 2.6 percent of the total Australian population, over 600,000 according to the last census in 2016. About three-quarters live in Sydney and Melbourne. Representations of Muslims in Australian media coverage have often been negative and contribute to Islamophobic discourse, as studies have shown. There have been examples of elected officials whipping up fear of Muslims to peddle xenophobic rhetoric. The 2019 Islamophobia in Australia report highlights that Muslims continue to be targets of hostility and violence.",,,,

He said global institutions should be reformed in a way that decision-making mechanisms include Muslim countries.   ""Islamophobia also has a feature that divides the world community and threatens global peace and stability. Therefore, the whole world needs to see Islamophobia as an open hate crime, a crime against humanity and to fight against this crime effectively.

Altun also criticised global mainstream media for not giving enough space to Muslims and said that disinformation accelerates the spread of Islamophobia around the world. He said the role played by the international media and global think tanks in spreading Islamophobia is ""undeniable"" as ""international media paints an extremely negative portrait of Muslims.""

PM Khan has called for a million of his supporters to rally in the capital next week. Foreign ministers of Muslim nations have gathered in Pakistan as the country's leader touts his achievement of getting Islamophobia recognised at the United Nations while at the same time battling the most serious challenge to his government in four years. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is meeting in Islamabad on Tuesday and Wednesday with an ambitious agenda that seeks approval for over 100 declarations, including aid for financially strapped Afghanistan and support for Palestine and Kashmir. But as officials praise Prime Minister Imran Khan for getting the UN last week to formally recognise Islamophobia as a global threat, the cricket star-turned-politician faces a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. In a hectic week on the political front, the country on Wednesday also celebrates Pakistan Day, with a military parade and flypasts. The theme for the OIC gathering is ""Partnering for Unity, Justice and Development"", and Khan will deliver the keynote speech that is sure to reference last week's UN resolution. Khan won office through an electorate weary of the two-party dynasties that have dominated Pakistan politics since independence –– periods of power punctuated by military coups –– but now he faces a new challenge.  ""I think the army leadership must be extremely concerned seeing what is happening on the political scene at the moment,"" said Talat Masood, a retired general-turned-political analyst. Khan has called for a million of his supporters to rally in the capital next week to put pressure on dozens of National Assembly members who are reported to be considering voting against him. The leaders of the two main opposition parties have also called for their supporters to gather, prompting authorities to declare most of this week a public holiday in the hope of avoiding conflict –– particularly during the OIC meeting. READ MORE:Pakistan lawmakers to vote on motion to oust PM Imran Khan next week 'A collision course' ""It is dragging the country to chaos,"" Masood said. ""It seems that the government and opposition parties are on a collision course. They don't seem to solve the problems politically, and rather try to show their street power."" The no-confidence motion is scheduled to be formally introduced on Friday with a vote next week, but horse-trading is common in Pakistan politics and the rebels could well return to the fold before then. Although Khan's policies helped Pakistan escape the worst of the Covid-19 epidemic, the economy is in the doldrums with soaring inflation, a feeble rupee, and crippling debt. While Pakistan helped US-Taliban reach a deal leading to US end 20-year invasion of Afghanistan, the return of the Taliban to power in has also provoked a resurgence of militancy in Pakistan. With flaring domestic issues, Khan visited Russia and met President Putin for hours just when Moscow was about to launch its offensive against Ukraine.  He was also one of the few world leaders to attend the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics when others boycotted in protest at China's human rights record. Khan criticised Islamabad-based Western envoys who recently sought to pressure Pakistan to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine, asking them if they thought Pakistan was their ""slave"". ""We are friends with Russia, and we are also friends with America; we are friends with China and with Europe; we are not in any camp,"" Khan added, saying Pakistan would remain ""neutral"" and work with those trying to end the war in Ukraine. On Monday, Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, told a press conference he had intelligence inputs that the vote of no confidence against PM Khan was happening at the behest of foreign powers. READ MORE:'Are we your slaves': Pakistani premier hits out at West over Russia letter Possible scenarios  There are several scenarios at play for Pakistan this week. Khan's PTI party is pursuing a court case against rebellious members that could force them to follow the whip. Another tactic is for parties to, quite literally, hold lawmakers hostage and prevent them from voting or having a quorum. And even if Khan does lose the vote, there will likely be a series of challenges both inside and outside the assembly. Most of that will be lost on today's OIC gathering, which is largely a talking shop that will pass a series of political resolutions. Key among them is channelling aid to Afghanistan, although any formal recognition of the country's new Taliban government remains unlikely.

This week, the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution declaring March 15 as International Day to Combat Islamophobia. Exactly three years after the murder of 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand’s Christchurch, the United Nations adopted a resolution to make March 15 the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.  This marks the highest political recognition so far of the problem Muslims have faced for years. Several NGOs have declared national days against anti-Muslim racism, such as July 1 in Germany or the European Day Against Islamophobia on September 21. But never has a state, much less a supranational institution, ever institutionalised a day to symbolise the importance of tackling anti-Muslim sentiment. The UN General Assembly, representing 193 member states, approved the resolution by consensus. It was introduced by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which represents more than 50 mainly Muslim majority countries, recalling a 1981 resolution calling for “the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief.” Contention came mainly from three sides: France, India, and the representative of the European Union, which is of little surprise. Recently, a report by an NGO has claimed that the French government’s anti-Muslim sentiment reaches the threshold of “persecution” under international law, and the anti-Muslim policies of President Emmanuel Macron's government have been heavily criticised. India has a long record of anti-Muslim policies, especially under the right-wing BJP government, and experts are warning of an impending genocide.  And the current EU leadership seems to be more than reluctant in fighting anti-Muslim sentiment. While in the US, Congress passed the International Islamophobia Act in December 2021, the 2015-established position of the European Commission’s Coordinator on combating anti-Muslim hatred has been vacant for many months and beyond this has been regarded as widely impotent by many NGOs.  But there are also movements in the right direction. The Council of Europe’s European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) has recently adopted a revised recommendation on preventing and combating “anti-Muslim racism and discrimination.” Importantly, this recommendation does not only find a precise word to name the problem beyond usual titles used by European institutions such as hate, crime and discrimination. It very deliberately challenges the structural dimension of the problem.  This also seems to have been on the mind of Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN, Munir Akram, who introduced the resolution on behalf of the OIC. He cited the UN’s special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, saying: “Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, institutional suspicion and fear of Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim has escalated to epidemic proportions.” Such an institutional approach clearly turns the question towards the UN itself, given its central role in creating the global framework for deradicalisation policies that have harmed many fundamental freedoms and have been legitimised in the backdrop of an imagined Muslim threat.  Despite the fact that countries like China, which has more than a bad record when it comes to religious freedom in general and anti-Muslim policies in particular, have co-sponsored this resolution, which is unlikely to lead to a change in their treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, the resolution itself is of a high symbolic value. It asks all countries, UN bodies, international and regional organisations, civil society, private sector and faith-based organisations “to organise and support various high-visibility events aimed at effectively increasing awareness, at all levels, about curbing Islamophobia.”  The observation of the new International Day to Combat Islamophobia on March 15 is not only a reminder of the violence of white supremacists. It is also a major step in the right direction, making people and institutions conscious of a growing problem that even some political leaders deny, as the reaction of a minority to the resolution has revealed.",,,,

Indians hold placards and candles during a protest against banning Muslim girls wearing hijab from attending classes at some schools in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. The state's high court later upheld the ban. “Pack your bags and move to Hyderabad,” Kalvakuntla Taraka Rama Rao wrote on Twitter in response to a Bengaluru-based entrepreneur who complained about the Indian city's crumbling infrastructure.  Rao, the information technology minister for Telangana state, where Hyderabad is located, was making a larger point that did not go unnoticed. Though long favoured for its moderate climate and cosmopolitan character, many fear that Bengaluru — with its cherry blossom-lined boulevards — is losing much of its sheen. What the minister tweeted only amplified the suspicion that many nursed in private, but few dared to air in public. Considered India’s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru serves as the capital of Karnataka state and hosts thousands of information technology companies. In fact, global tech giants such as Infosys and Wipro were founded in the city of 10 million, which accounts for more than 60 percent of the province’s revenue. The city has always attracted the best, both in terms of investments and intellect. It currently boasts some 13,000 technology start-ups, and about 40 percent of India’s unicorns — unlisted companies valued at more than a billion dollars each. But the rush has also meant the city is rapidly becoming unlivable. Civic amenities are proving inadequate, while traffic has virtually choked. A one-way trip to the airport during rush hour could take as long as three hours. For many, even more suffocating is the rising religious strife that is threatening Bengaluru. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rules Karnataka and considers it to be a vital springboard for eventually expanding its footprint in the other four southern states. Karnataka, therefore, has become a kind of a Hindu nationalism laboratory, where the BJP has been experimenting with bringing about larger Hindu consolidation through means of religious rhetoric and communal provocations. Muslims account for no less than 12 percent of Karnataka’s population. But the BJP sees the support of the overwhelming number of Hindus as crucial for its electoral success. For drumming up Hindu support, right-wing Hindu activists aligned with the BJP have been on overdrive to deepen the Hindu-Muslim divide and stoke hatred. Virtually endless episodes of orchestrated indignations are ratcheting up tensions. First, some months ago, Hindu mobs took exception to Muslim girls wearing hijab — the Muslim headscarf — while attending schools. The hijab, they claimed, went against India’s secular principles and also violated the school dress code. The state high court upheld the ban. But then the mobs picked up one more issue to become outraged over. And then another. Activists seeking to establish Hindutva, or the primacy of Hindus, have launched an angry, abusive campaign against Halal — the process that certifies products, including meat, as being compliant with Islamic practices. At the receiving end are mostly Muslim meat traders. Several in Bengaluru have had their shops raided and vandalised. The mobs are having a virtually free run, with the Karnataka government headed by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai paying only lip service to the cause of religious peace and harmony. Many say the government itself has been complicit in instilling the fear of a tightening siege among the minorities. Last year, it banned the trade and slaughter of cows traditionally associated with Muslims. The government is now working to include the Hindu holy book Bhagavad Gita in the school curriculum. All these and more have emboldened supporters of Hindutva, who have now moved on to their next targets. Muslim traders have been physically barred from setting up shops in temple fairs, something that they have done for generations. Muslim mango sellers are the newest targets of the Hindutva mob, who have now reportedly set their sights on “cleansing” the fruit trade. The rising “hatred” disturbs the calm and tranquillity that are essential for businesses to prosper, and captains of the corporate world are alarmed. Kiran Majumdar Shaw, the chairperson of Biocon — a leading biotechnology firm — was among the first to speak out. “Karnataka has always forged inclusive economic development and we must not allow such communal exclusion…@BSBommai please resolve this growing religious divide,” she tweeted a couple of days ago, tagging the chief minister. Being a very important voice, BJP politicians promptly responded and assured her that no damage would be allowed to the state’s business environment. But it is unlikely that the damage already done to the dignity and right to livelihood of Karnataka’s Muslims can be repaired. It will also be equally difficult to repair the dent in Bengaluru’s reputation. The city’s loss, Telangana minister Rama Rao calculates, will be beneficial to Hyderabad. Home to mega defence and aerospace industries, Telangana’s state capital has assiduously nursed its ambitions of replacing Bengaluru as India’s IT hub. Now that chinks have surfaced in Bengaluru’s armour, Hyderabad — or more appropriately, its IT minister — has moved in for the kill. In luring entrepreneurs, like the one who complained over “unlivable” Bengaluru, to move to Hyderabad, Rama Rao is offering several incentives. “We have better physical infrastructure & equally good social infrastructure. Our airport is one of the best and getting in and out of the city is a breeze. More importantly, our government’s focus is on the 3-I Mantra: innovation, infrastructure & inclusive growth,” Rama Rao said in his tweet. His sales pitch for Hyderabad elicited a strong response from a senior opposition politician of Karnataka. “My friend, I accept your challenge,” tweeted Doddalahalli Kempegowda Shivakumar, the state Congress president.  “By the end of 2023, with the Congress back in power in Karnataka, we will restore the glory of Bengaluru as India’s best city,” he added.  Ironically, Karnataka’s own information technology minister seemed unfazed by the veritable storm over the challenge to Bengaluru’s coveted status. “We are competing globally,” insisted Chikkakalya Narayanappa Ashwath Narayan, choosing to ignore the challenge from Hyderabad, some 550 kilometres away.",,,,

Turkish President Erdogan addressed the 2nd International Media and Islamophobia Forum in Ankara via video message. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that anti-Muslim sentiments are continuing to spread like a plague in Western countries. Anti-Muslim hatred ""is poisoning all segments of society, from people on the street to politicians, workers, and civil servants,” he said in a video message at the 2nd International Media and Islamophobia Forum in Ankara on Tuesday. “The atmosphere of hatred promoted by irresponsible media negatively affects Muslims as well as millions of people with different languages, religions, origins, and cultures,"" he added. “The embarrassing debates in the context of the Ukraine crisis reveal the dangerous dimensions of Islamophobia and cultural racism.” Erdogan denounced discrimination against all vulnerable people around the world, stressing that anti-Muslim sentiment is not only an issue for Muslims, but it should also be for all people around the world. “Otherwise, we cannot prevent Islamophobic attacks like (the ones in) New Zealand in 2019 and Canada in 2021,” he warned. The president emphasised that along with Western politicians, media outlets and state institutions, the biggest responsibility falls on the Islamic world and its institutions. “Muslims must react strongly, seek their rights on legitimate grounds, and fight against this injustice, unlawfulness and discrimination, which targets hundreds of millions of people along with them,” he said.

As part of racism, Islamophobia is already a global problem,” Türkiye’s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun said in his address at the forum. “We see that Islamophobic events are also disseminating on the social life and we see that in certain countries. The women are prohibited from reaching out to education due to their clothes and headscarves,” Altun said. People who are subjected to hate attacks are in need of greater safety and security, he urged. “Islamophobia is not a problem that Türkiye can fight on its own. We are in need of an international and multi-dimensional struggle against Islamophobia,” he added. “This struggle should definitely start from Europe and disseminate to the whole world. As Islamophobia is becoming institutionalized in Europe, the fight against Islamophobia should be institutionalized in Europe as well,” he stressed.

The report said that the war in Ukraine overshadowed many issues, and stressed that the conflict exposed glaring double standards. That Europeans are more welcoming to certain types of refugees than others. The report detailed that many European countries openly welcomed white, Christian Ukrainians fleeing Russia's attack in the early stages of the war, while having for years opposed accepting mostly Muslim refugees escaping conflicts. Researchers who contributed to the report also highlighted how western media coverage, vastly differed in their portrayal of Ukrainian and Muslim refugees. Islamopbhobia was also found to be expanding at the institutionalized state level, where legislation and government policies directly targeted Muslims in certain countries.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi threw her support behind congresswoman Ilhan Omar as the freshman lawmaker continues to face calls for censure for remarks some have criticised as anti-Semitic. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that the House will vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other forms of hate after an upheaval that split Democrats and clouded their agenda.  But Pelosi said the measure won't name Ilhan Omar, the freshman Democrat whose comments about Israel sparked the uproar. Pelosi defended Omar and says she does not believe the new congresswoman understood the ""weight of her words"" or that they would be perceived by some as anti-Semitic. ""It's not about her. It's about these forms of hatred,"" Pelosi told reporters. Resolution of divide  The move was in part intended to resolve a divide that opened after Omar, D-Minn., said that Israel's supporters were pushing lawmakers to take a pledge of ""allegiance"" to a foreign country.  A Muslim-American, she has been critical of the Jewish state in the past and apologised for those previous comments. But she has not apologised for what many in Congress saw as a suggestion that Israel's supporters have split loyalties. And that sparked a demand from some quarters to put a resolution on the floor condemning anti-Semitism. Other members who wanted to broaden it to include a rejection of all forms of racism and bigotry. Trump's disparaging racial comments Some proposed two separate resolutions. Others questioned whether a resolution was necessary, and viewed such a move as unfairly singling out Omar at a time when President Donald Trump and others have made disparaging racial comments. Early Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told Democrats that the House would vote later in the day. That seemed to quiet some of the dissention, but there remained frustration that the party that touts its diversity conducted such a messy and public debate about how to declare its opposition to bigotry. ""This shouldn't be so hard,"" said Rep Ted Deutch, D-Fla., said on the House floor Thursday. The abrupt turn of events come as Democratic leaders try to quickly fend off a challenge from Republicans on the issue. Anti-hate bill  Democratic leaders worried they could run into trouble on another bill, their signature ethics and voting reform package, if Republicans tried to tack their own anti-Semitism bill on as an amendment. By voting on Thursday, the House Democratic vote counters believe they could inoculate their lawmakers against such a move by passing Democrats' own anti-hate bill.",,,,

On June 26, 2018, the United States Supreme Court upheld President Donald Trump’s executive order, widely dubbed as the “Muslim Ban.”   This decision came 932 days after Trump, then a Republican “longshot” candidate for the presidency, called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” This proposal, dismissed as mere campaign rhetoric by veteran pundits and aberrant bigotry non-emblematic of American society by others, reveals more about the country today than when originally uttered by Trump on December 7, 2015.  Indeed, the explicit bigotry of one private individual, with the diabolical design of mobilising Islamophobia into a full-fledged campaign strategy, would evolve into the law of the land.  This evolution, which marks the Muslim Ban’s transition from a deviant political proposal by a wayward candidate into standing immigration policy, unveils the roots and resilience of American Islamophobia.   Trump did not invent it, but identified its potency as a political tool, unearthed it, then deployed it fully to his advantage. The brazen Islamophobia Trump unleashed on the campaign trail alarmed the liberal and cosmopolitan peripheries of American society, but the nation’s core took to it zealously, registering approval of it in the ballot box by the droves.    The Islamophobia that Trump wielded on the campaign trail galvanised voters that tied their failures and fears to a looming Islamic threat, delivering him the presidency, and subsequently opening the door to the possibility of the Supreme Court upholding the ban.  In addition to revealing why the underbelly of American Islamophobia could be lifted to the core so rapidly, this evolution of Trump’s Islamophobia also illustrates the distinct yet linked dimensions of Islamophobia – an animus that cannot, and should not, be reduced to merely “fear and hatred of Muslims.”   The brash anti-Muslim ideas that Trump disseminated as a presidential candidate were, at that juncture, the views of one private individual, not yet fully sponsored by the state by way of presidential executive order or Supreme Court ruling.  In my book, American Islamophobia: Understanding the Roots and Rise of Fear, I outline the parts and processes that form the makeup of this rising form of bigotry. I define Islamophobia as the presumption that Islam is inherently violent, alien and unassimilable, a presumption driven by the belief that expressions of Muslim identity correlate with a propensity for terrorism. Beyond this foundational definition, Islamophobia is comprised of three dimensions: private, structural and dialectical Islamophobia. The first dimension, private Islamophobia, is “the fear, suspicion, and violent targeting of Muslims by private actors.” Most notably hatemongers that vandalise mosques, bigots that target and attack visible Muslims, and murderers, like Craig Hicks, who killed three Muslim American students. Islamophobia is also structural, as exemplified by the enforcement of the Muslim Ban by way of presidential executive order.   “Structural Islamophobia, the second dimension, is the fear and suspicion of Muslims on the part government institutions [such as the Supreme Court] and actors. This fear and suspicion are manifested and enforced through the enactment and advancement of laws, policy, and programming built upon the presumption that Muslim identity is associated with a national security threat.” That association forms the very foundation of the Muslim Ban, which casts every Muslim immigrant from the five restricted Muslim-majority nations as presumptive terrorists. Finally, and most importantly, Islamophobia is also a dialectic tying state policy with (private) societal actors. “Dialectical Islamophobia is the process by which structural Islamophobia shapes, reshapes, and endorses views or attitudes about Islam and Muslim subjects inside and outside of America’s borders.” This process is vividly and violently manifested by the hate incidents and crimes emboldened by Trump’s presidential rhetoric and policies, and in the imminent future, encouraged by the recent Supreme Court ruling.   Put simply, state-sponsored Islamophobia authorises and incites it on the ground, pushing private citizens to partake in the national project of punishing and persecuting Muslims – or individuals they (mistakenly) profile as Muslims. While Islamophobia was alive and well during the Obama era, Trump has lifted the curtain of political correctness that kept it hidden and difficult to detect.   No more grand Cairo speeches inspiring optimism, or visits to American mosques decorated by the rhetoric of celebrating Islam in America, but inspired by monitoring it in the very spaces where it is observed.  It was difficult to identify American Islamophobia during the eights years of Obama largely because he was brilliant at keeping it concealed. None of this is true under Trump, who has made the distinct parts of American Islamophobia crystal clear with his rhetoric and easily detectable through his policy.    Trump’s transparency makes it easier to understand how each of the three dimensions of Islamophobia unfold in real time in America, and also, how deeply interconnected they are.  Understanding it is an essential first step.  Followed by the more daunting burden of mounting a challenge against it, especially as the might of the state summons the groundswell of hate eying Muslims steadily rising from every corner of American society.",,,,
