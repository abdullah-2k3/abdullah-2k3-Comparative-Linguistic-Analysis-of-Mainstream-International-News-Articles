BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kjrr44mvdo,"Religious hate crime at record high, figures show","The Israel-Hamas war has led to an increase in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents, the Home Office says.",5 days ago,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Religious hate crime recorded by police in England and Wales has risen by 25% over the past year, driven by a rise in offences against Jews and Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Home Office figures show. The vast majority of the 140,561 hate crime offences recorded - about seven in 10 - are shown to have been motivated by race, according to the data. But the increase in religious hate crimes is mainly driven by a rise in antisemitic offences, the department said. Hate crimes targeted at Jewish people more than doubled, while incidents against Muslims were up 13% on the previous 12 months, according to data. The Home Office said this is the highest annual count in religious hate crime offences since the department began collecting data in the year ending March 2012. More recent figures, recorded by community organisations rather than police, have shown record highs in antisemitism and Islamophobia up to the end of September. Publishing the statistics on Thursday, the Home Office said the 25% increase ""was driven by a rise in hate crimes against Jewish people and to a lesser extent Muslims and has occurred since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict"". The hate crimes figures, supplied to the Home Office by the 43 territorial police forces across England and Wales and British Transport Police, showed a 5% decline in the overall number of hate crimes. But over the year ending March 2024 there were 3,282 religious hate crimes targeting Jews, more than double the previous year (1,543). The spike in such incidents coincided with the start of the conflict in the Middle East, and though the number decreased, by the spring it had not returned to levels identified before the conflict. The data corresponds to what has been reported by Jewish charities over the past year, with the highest number of offences reported in Greater London. Jewish charity the Community Security Trust (CST) said the 5,583 incidents recorded across the UK between 7 October 2023 and 30 September is the highest total of any 12-month period and was three times that of the previous 12-month period, which saw 1,830 incidents recorded. The figures also show there were 3,866 religious hate crimes targeting Muslims, up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year. It means 38% of recorded religious hate crimes were targeted against Muslims, and the figures do not yet include the unrest following events in Southport in the summer. Tell Mama - which records anti-Muslim incidents - said it had recorded 4,971 incidents of hate and discrimination across the UK in the year since the 7 October 2023 attacks, the highest total it had noted in more than a decade. ""The appalling levels of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crimes outlined in today’s figures are a stain on our society, and this government will work tirelessly to tackle this toxic hatred wherever it is found,"" said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. ""We must not allow events unfolding in the Middle East to play out in increased hatred and tension here on our streets and those who push this poison - offline or online - must face the full force of the law,"" she said. The police numbers do show that there were decreases in recorded disability hate crimes (down 18%) and those targeting people for their sexual orientation (down 8%), and a 2% fall in transgender hate crimes. But they also show that while there was a 5% fall in race hate crimes, 98,799 were still recorded over 12 months, and it remains by far the most common motivation in such offenses. Hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation have fallen for the second year in a row to 22,839 reported incidents. It means that these types of hate crime have fallen a total of 13% since March 2022 - which was the highest number on record. The Home Office says these decreases have been driven by falls in malicious communications offences, as well as reports of incidents causing public fear, alarm or distress. Simon Blake, CEO of LGBT campaigning charity Stonewall, told BBC News that hate crime reported to police ""is only part of the picture"". He said: ""It’s vital that all those affected have access to support. The fight against hatred is shared, so we must work together to build a society where everyone is safe and respected and free from harm."" Danielle St James, chief executive of trans charity Not A Phase, told the BBC that trans people are often reluctant to report hate crimes. She said: ""After many years in which hate crimes against trans people have soared, the news that these are down by 2% is certainly welcome. ""That being said, we know all too well that there is a reluctance to report these crimes on the part of the community, so it’s always worth taking stats such as these with a pinch of salt."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxrv2200veo,'We couldn't leave our home for a week after riots',Community groups come together to support better cohesion in the wake of far right riots.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Outside the mosque he manages in Stoke-on-Trent, Farouk Farage is reflecting on a ""horrifying"" few days in August, when riots unfolded in the streets. “It was very hard...with my daughters, my son and my wife, we effectively stayed inside our house for a week.   ""For some kids it must have felt like jail,"" he said. The scenes they witnessed on 3 August were terrifying, with riot police deployed when hundreds of people protested in the wake of the deaths of three young girls in Southport. Missiles were thrown at officers and Islamophobic chants directed towards the mosque, Sallahuddin Masjid. Children in a dance show were locked inside a theatre for their safety. Mr Farag said those who targeted them – yelling abuse and throwing stones at cars - have left a fear that is still being felt, an anxiety that can’t easily be shaken off. “There are around 3,000 Kurdish people in our community in Stoke-on-Trent who felt they couldn’t leave their homes for days”, he said. More than £1.5m had been raised for a community centre and, when news of the disorder spread on social media, dozens of worshippers came to surround the mosque. A rapid response security team was brought into Sallahuddin Masjid to guard the site day and night. “We hope it won’t happen again and know that the police will do their best to prevent disorder,"" Mr Farage said. ""We are grateful to Staffordshire Police.  Ever since we came here in 2016, we have had no trouble.  We are all in this together, we love Stoke and try to build the city up."" BBC Midlands Today spoke to community groups about the impact of the riots, which followed the fatal stabbings of three girls in Southport on 29 July.  Eight more children and two adults were also injured.  Anecdotally, they said they were aware of a rise in reports of hate crime offences, targeting Muslims in particular. The Crown Prosecution Service reported that in the year to December 2023, 12,737 hate crime offences were prosecuted, of which 9,245 were on grounds of racial abuse.  “It needs to be taken more seriously, Islamophobia is increasing since the riots”, said Shazia Nasreen, a Hate Crime Ambassador in Walsall. She said she suffered verbal abuse just days after the riots while walking past a bus stop. “A lot of people don’t have the confidence [to report it], first of all they feel it’s not a hate crime and secondly they think nothing is going to be done about it”. She credited the police for their response to the riots but said she remained anxious leaving home for work.  Her experience is helping to shape a new hate crime strategy in Walsall. She works with Black Country Innovate, a social enterprise, who have helped to form a ‘hate crime pledge’. Signed by the Leader of Walsall Council, senior police officers and multiple faith organisations, it promises an integrated approach to helping vulnerable people, who may be experiencing hate crime on grounds of race, religion, disability and sexual orientation. “To protect the vulnerable we need to build trust with authorities and victims need to see justice”, said founder Nasar Iqbal. “The fact that events occurred elsewhere but we felt an impact in Walsall is very common.  A lot of people were suffering from anxiety – people we spoke to had cancelled their travel plans and holidays as a result of the summer disorder”. After conducting research on hate crime with De Montfort University, Black Country Innovate will start free trauma coaching sessions for hate crime victims. It must be the start of a new approach, recognising that people are experiencing abuse in person and online, Mr Iqbal said. “The narratives have changed from 20 years ago.  It’s become more complicated, and more people may be impacted."" Follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly311el04go,"Hate crime rise abhorrent, Sadiq Khan says","The mayor is urging Londoners to be united against hate, as the conflict in the Middle East deepens.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Sadiq Khan has urged Londoners to remain united “against all forms of hate” as the conflict in the Middle East deepens. The mayor has announced a further £875,000 investment in grass-roots community projects working to tackle hate, extremism and radicalisation. The funding comes just ahead of the first anniversary of the outbreak of war in Gaza on 7 October. “We know that an escalation in conflict in the Middle East often leads to an increase in hate crime here in London,” Mr Khan said at an event bringing together organisations that work to combat hate crime and extremism. “With the appalling further escalation of the conflict in Lebanon, Israel, Gaza and the region, I’m appealing to Londoners to continue to look out for their friends and neighbours, whatever their faith and backgrounds, and stand united against all forms of hate. “We have seen an abhorrent and completely unacceptable rise in hate crime over the last year – particularly antisemitism and Islamophobia – which has profoundly impacted our Jewish and Muslim communities in London. ""I’m determined to continue to work in partnership with community, faith and police leaders to ensure everyone in the capital feels safe and is safe.” The Met Police recorded a 286% rise in antisemitic hate crime from September 2023 to August, compared to the same period in the 12 months before, and a 67% increase in anti-Muslim hate crime. The need for early intervention to prevent radicalisation was highlighted earlier this month, when Home Office data revealed that a record number of children were arrested as terror suspects in the year to June. Police detained 242 people on suspicion of terror offences during the 12-month period, of whom 40 were aged 17 or under.  According to City Hall, the £875,000 investment will support 20 groups, among them the Anne Frank Trust UK, to deliver workshops that challenge anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate. Another recipient of funding is Exit Hate, which works with people aged 14-18 to help them understand the dangers posed by extreme ideologies. The latest funding package forms part of the mayor’s Shared Endeavour Fund, and is expected to benefit about 50,000 Londoners. Met Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said: “Our work, which is underpinned by engagement with community representatives and with our key partners, will continue.  ""Together, we are determined to demonstrate that there will be no tolerance for hate crime in London.” Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Public disorder broke out in several towns and cities following the fatal stabbing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July. Burnley Council Leader Afrasiab Anwar said he was ""proud with how our communities came together... to send a clear message that there is no place for such racism and anarchy in our borough"". Mr Anwar said he was pleased the government had invited members of council staff to contribute to a review of the summer's events and help shape any subsequent reforms. At Wednesday's full council meeting, he said: ""The violence we witnessed across the UK last month was deeply concerning. ""Although we escaped violence locally, we witnessed a lot of fear and anxiety as well as several heinous provocations, including the desecration of Muslim graves at Burnley cemetery and the mural at Valley Street Community Centre."" Mr Anwar said he wanted to ""put on record my gratitude to all the police officers who kept us safe during those difficult times"", adding: ""Sadly, some officers were injured and I wish them a speedy recovery."" He also thanked police and council staff for keeping residents informed about what was happening and providing them with reassurance.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e1q5w0q9po,Baroness Warsi quits Conservatives in the Lords,She accuses the party of “hypocrisy and double standards in its treatment of different communities”.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Former Conservative Party chairwoman Baroness Warsi has resigned from the party in the House of Lords, claiming it has moved to the “far right”. The peer, who was Britain's first Muslim cabinet minister during David Cameron's premiership, accused the party of “hypocrisy and double standards in its treatment of different communities”. But the Conservatives say she was about to be investigated for allegedly using ""divisive language"". “Baroness Warsi was informed an investigation was about to begin earlier this week,” a party spokesperson said.  “We have a responsibility to ensure that all complaints are investigated without prejudice.” The BBC has been told the complaints were in relation to a post about Marieha Hussain. Ms Hussain was found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence after holding a placard at a pro-Palestine protest depicting Conservative leader Rishi Sunak and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman as coconuts. In one post on X, Baroness Warsi congratulated Ms Hussain on her acquittal. On Thursday, after announcing her resignation, Baroness Warsi wrote: ""It was the right decision and I rightly congratulated Marieha on her acquittal. ""I was subsequently asked to delete my public support for Marieha - I refused to do so. ""That is the basis of the complaint. No other comments or language is the basis of the complaint."" She said the case was ""due to be conducted in private behind closed doors"" and so she ""felt it appropriate in the circumstances to resign my whip and look forward to dealing with these issues openly and transparently"". Her resignation comes on the eve of the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. Baroness Warsi has previously criticised Tory leadership contenders Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch. She has also been a vocal critic of the party’s approach to allegations of Islamophobia and language used by Conservative politicians, including Ms Braverman. She wrote on X: “It is with a heavy heart that I have today informed my whip and decided for now to no longer take the Conservative whip. “This is a sad day for me. I am a Conservative and remain so but sadly the current party are far removed from the party I joined and served in cabinet.” She added: “My decision is a reflection of how far right my party has moved and the hypocrisy and double standards in its treatment of different communities.” Baroness Warsi suggested she would raise some of these issues in her new book, Muslims Don’t Matter. Responding on social media, Tory leadership candidate James Cleverly said: ""'You’re not properly black if you’re a Tory' is a particularly pernicious attack. ""I’ve been called a coconut too many times to laugh it off.  ""It hasn’t held me back or brought me down, but a Conservative peer not recognising the abuse of other black colleagues is unacceptable."" After the 2010 general election, Baroness Warsi made history by becoming the first Muslim woman in the cabinet as co-chair of the Conservative Party. A former solicitor with the Crown Prosecution Service, she then served as a minister in David Cameron’s government. But she quit as the minister for faith and communities in 2014 over the government’s policy on the Israel-Gaza conflict. She has since criticised the party's inquiry into Islamophobia inquiry and called it “institutionally xenophobic and racist”. Resigning the Conservative whip means she will no longer be affiliated with the party in the House of Lords, where she has sat as a peer since 2007. The party is still choosing its next leader, with the final four candidates set to make speeches at the conference in Birmingham. An intensive round of hustings and multiple votes will follow the conference from 8 October, lasting three days, until only two candidates are left. Conservative Party members will then choose which of the final two candidates they want as the new leader, with the result announced on 2 November."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lw0081e1yo,Sweden blames Iran for cyber-attack after Quran burnings,"Sweden's security service says 15,000 messages were sent after several Quran-burning incidents.",24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Sweden's security service Sapo has accused Iranian intelligence of hacking into a text messaging service to send 15,000 messages to Swedes. Sapo said the data breach in summer last year involved SMS messages calling for ""revenge against Quran-burners"", after several anti-Islam activists set fire to copies of the Islamic holy book. Iran's embassy in Stockholm has rejected the accusations, calling them ""baseless"" and harmful to the two countries' relations. But Sweden says investigators found a cyber group called Anzu, acting for Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), that had sought to create division in society and paint Sweden as an Islamophobic country. Sweden's government condemned the Quran burnings at the time and police tried to ban them, but they were allowed by the courts under freedom of expression laws. The incidents led to outrage in several Muslim-majority countries, and Sweden's embassy in Iraq was set alight by protesters. Last month, Swedish prosecutors charged an Iraqi activist and an accomplice with incitement against an ethnic group in connection with the book-burnings. Both men deny wrongdoing. According to a preliminary investigation led by prosecutors, the Anzu group were said to have hacked into a Swedish company's SMS-service and taken over passwords, usernames and other tools at the end of July 2023, before sending a message to private individuals on 1 August that ""those who insulted the Quran must be punished for their work"". Fredrik Hallstrom of Sapo told the Dagens Nyheter website that a number of people involved in the operation were linked to the Revolutionary Guards and that the text messages had partially succeeded in adding further fuel to the threat against Sweden. Prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said that investigators had succeeded in identifying the Iranian hackers' identities, but that there was no way they could be extradited and their preliminary inquiry had been shelved. The security service warned that foreign powers such as Iran were seizing on opportunities to create division and bolster their own regimes. Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said in a statement that it was very serious that a state actor such as Iran was aiming to ""destabilise Sweden or increase polarisation in our country"". This is not the first time that Sweden's security service has accused Iran's government of carrying out hostile acts on its territory. Last May Sapo said Tehran had used criminal networks in Sweden to carry out violent acts against other states, groups or individuals in Sweden that Iran considered a threat. It identified Iran, alongside Russia and China, as posing the greatest security threats to Sweden."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvglk3md4e3o,"Iran may be behind attacks on Israeli embassies, Sweden says",Blasts and gunfire were reported near the Israeli embassies in Copenhagen and Stockholm earlier this week.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Sweden's security service Sapo has said that Iran may have been involved in the explosions and gunfire that took place near the Israeli embassies in Stockholm and Copenhagen earlier this week. Fredrik Hallstrom of Sapo said that choice of targets and methods pointed in the direction of Iran, but added this was an “assumption rather than pure knowledge”. On Monday evening, shots were fired at the Israeli embassy in Stockholm. Nobody was injured. Two explosions were then reported near the Israeli embassy in central Copenhagen in the early hours of Wednesday.  Two Swedish teenagers aged 16 and 19 were arrested at the Copenhagen train station later that afternoon. One of them had reportedly bought tickets to Amsterdam. On Thursday, the two were charged with possessing hand grenades and denotating them near the embassy.  They have pleaded not guilty and have been remanded in custody until 30 October. A third Swedish national who was arrested near the embassy was later released. Danish police have not confirmed whether the Israeli embassy was the target of the explosions. There are other embassies close to the road junction were the blasts were heard. This is not the first time that incidents of this kind take place near Israeli embassies in a Nordic capital. In January, a ""dangerous object"" was found outside the Israeli embassy in Stockholm and destroyed in what the Israeli ambassador called an ""attempted attack"". At the time, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the situation was ""very serious"" and promised to tighten the surveillance of the embassy and of Jewish institutions. And in May, gunshots were heard around the same embassy. A number of teenagers were investigated in connection with the shooting, although several were later released. After that incident, Sapo warned that the Iranian government was recruiting Swedish gang members to carry out violent acts against other groups and individuals in Sweden. Last month, Sapo also accused Iranian intelligence of hacking into a text messaging service to send 15,000 messages to Swedes aimed at creating divisions in society and painting Sweden as an Islamophobic country.  The messages were sent around the time that Swedish anti-Islam activists set fire to copies of the Islamic holy book. Iran's embassy in Stockholm rejected the accusations, calling them ""baseless"" and harmful to the two countries' relations."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced0vp2z38jo,Ex-minister suggests Welsh Tory leader should go,Ex-Welsh secretary says his party in the Senedd needs a refresh and suggests its leader should go.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Conservative former cabinet minister has cast doubt on whether Andrew RT Davies should lead the Tories into the next Senedd election. Stephen Crabb warned that the 2026 vote would be ""tough"" for the party, and that it ""probably"" needed a leadership ""refresh"". ""If the party needs to change in order to survive, it's harder to do that when you always have the same personalities in place,"" said Crabb, who was in the cabinet as Welsh secretary and also work and pensions secretary. The Senedd Tory leader rejected Crabb's comments, saying he was ""up for the fight in 2026"". Davies is currently on his second stint as leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd: his first ran from 2012 to 2018, and he returned in 2021. He has been under pressure in recent months after he was accused of ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by a Muslim group, and over inappropriate language from one of his politicians. Speaking to James Williams on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Crabb warned that the Conservatives were not well positioned for the next Senedd election in 2026. ""I think it's going to be a tough Senedd election. Reform will be looking to build on the gains they've made electorally... there was an awful lot of people voting for Reform in July."" He said the party had not been ""good enough at providing alternative policies"". Asked if Davies was the right leader for the next Senedd election, Crabb said: ""I don't like making it about personalities."" But he added: ""If you're asking me do I think there needs to be refresh of the Welsh party and the Welsh leadership, probably yes. ""If the party needs to change in order to survive, it's harder to do that when you always have the same personalities in place."" He ruled himself out of standing in the 2026 Senedd election: ""I spent the last couple of months pursuing other options. ""I think to do that, you've got to do it with a single mind and not with one foot stuck in the past."" Andrew RT Davies told BBC Wales he is still the right person to lead the Welsh Conservatives into the next Senedd election. He refuted Stephen Crabb’s comments and said he was “up for the fight in 2026”. Asked if he was the right man for the election, he said: “Very much so. I’m up for making that change agenda resonating in communities across the whole of Wales.” He added: “I never need to look over my shoulder because I’ve got a mirror to look in all the time [to see] whose behind me. “Because politics is always about making sure that no one gets too close to you, otherwise the knife might go in.” One former MP said it was ""not a time for further turmoil and infighting"" in the party. Asked if she agreed with the suggestion from former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb that Andrew RT Davies should go, the former Tory MP for Wrexham Sarah Atherton said: ""We need to prove to the country that we are unified and cohesive going forward."" The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd group chairman, Sam Kurtz, said he and the Senedd group had ""full confidence"" in Davies. ""I think we're working tirelessly to come forward with a plethora of policies that will be attractive to all voters in Wales in 2026,"" the Member of the Senedd for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire added. The discussion comes after former Downing Street PR chief Guto Harri said the Conservatives in the Senedd needed ""new leadership"" . He said they were not just ""there to draw a pay cheque"". Crabb was MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire until the summer general election, when he lost his seat, as did all other Welsh Conservatives. He had served as chairman of the Commons' Welsh Affairs Select Committee, and in frontbench roles under David Cameron and Theresa May. The former MP spoke as his party met in Birmingham for its annual UK party conference, amid a leadership contest to replace former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Crabb said it had been clear the party was going to suffer a ""massive defeat  in July"" because of a ""huge loss of trust in the Conservative government"". He hoped the next Tory leader would ""occupy the centre ground"". ""Culture wars, the war on woke,"" he said, ""isn't the thing that's going to persuade somebody languishing on a hospital waiting list that they'll see public services improve."" Separately on Monday, UK Tory leadership contender Tom Tugendhat promised that he would include a Conservative Senedd member in his shadow cabinet, alongside others from the Scottish Parliament and councils in England, if he was to win."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wkxv9d99vo,Antisemitic incidents in US surge to record high - report,"The Anti-Defamation League identified 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the year after the 7 October attacks.",7 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Reports of antisemitic incidents in the US have reached a record high since last year's Hamas attack in Israel, according to a preliminary report from the Anti-Defamation League Center for Extremism (ADL). The group found more than 10,000 incidents from 7 October 2023 to 24 September of this year, more than a 200% increase compared to the same period a year earlier.  It is the highest ever since the ADL began tracking such incidents in 1979.  The report comes just days after the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a joint statement warning of possible violent threats amid the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East.  Since last October’s Hamas attack on Israel which saw around 1,200 people killed ""Jewish Americans haven’t had a single moment of respite,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.  “Instead, we’ve faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere.” The more than 10,000 episodes of antisemitism reported by the ADL included roughly 8,015 incidents of verbal or written harassment, 1,840 incidents of vandalism and 150 incidents of physical assault. The states with the highest number of recorded cases in the report were California, with 1,266 incidents, New York with 1,218, New Jersey with 830, and Florida with 463.  The ADL said that it expected its preliminary numbers to increase as it receives more data. The final report for 2024 will be published in the spring of 2025. Part of the overall increase comes from a change in methodology to include ""expressions of opposition to Zionism, as well as support for resistance against Israel or Zionists that could be perceived as supporting terrorism"", the ADL said.  The ADL's preliminary report tallied more than 3,000 of incidents that took place during anti-Israel rallies ""which featured regular explicit expressions of support for terrorist groups"", including Hamas and Hezbollah.  Excluding these incidents, the ADL counted 7,523 episodes of antisemitism, a 103% increase from 2022.  Following the 7 October attack, Israel launched a massive military operation in the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.  Since then, 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and more than 97,000 injured in Gaza, most of them women and children, the Hamas-run health ministry says.  The war inspired a wave of demonstrations across the US, particularly at college campuses, with many protesting against the growing humanitarian toll.  In Lebanon, more than 1,000 people have been killed while up to a million people may have been displaced since Israel launched its attack against Iran-backed Hezbollah.  The continued violence in the region has led to a surge in anti-Muslim and Islamophobic incidents as well across the US.  Anti-Muslim incidents reached 8,061 in 2023, according to a report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released in April. The report marked the highest level since CAIR began tallying nearly 30 years ago, with nearly half coming after the 7 October attack."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj47p4lnepo,ITV says Balls interview with wife Cooper was fair,"Ofcom will not investigate 16,000 complaints made about a Good Morning Britain episode in August.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"ITV's chief executive has defended Ed Balls' interview with his wife, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, on Good Morning Britain - but said they would not do it again. Dame Carolyn McCall was speaking after media regulator Ofcom announced it will not investigate more than 16,000 complaints about an episode of the ITV breakfast show on 5 August. That morning, Balls and co-host Kate Garraway interviewed Cooper about the government's response to violent unrest in parts of the UK. ""It was a very, very tricky morning, there was a national emergency almost being called, and so we got very short notice that the home secretary was coming on the show,"" Dame Carolyn said. ""She was doing a whole round [of interviews], but it was unexpected, and we believe that it was fair and impartial,"" she told the Royal Television Society London Conference on Tuesday. ""And actually Ofcom just ruled, but amazingly no-one has picked up on the fact, that Ofcom are not pursuing these complaints, because they believe it's fair, balanced and impartial. ""So would we do it again? No. Was it impartial, fair and balanced? And did they behave professionally? Yes. ""I mean, he asked her a few questions, but I think Kate was leading on that wasn't she? And so I do think you've just got to say, if Ofcom have looked at it and they're not pursuing this any further because they thought it was fair balanced and impartial, you know, that's it."" Balls, a former Labour minister, is now a regular GMB presenter; Cooper, his wife, was appointed home secretary following the general election in July. They have been married since 1998. Ofcom said it carefully considered the complaints of a conflict of interest. But a spokesperson said: ""Taking into account that their relationship was made clear twice, that a range of views about Labour's handling of the riots were included in the programme as a whole, and given the vast majority of the interview was conducted by co-presenter, Kate Garraway, we will not be pursuing further."" Ofcom added that it had issued guidance warning ITV to ""take particular care over the compliance of such interviews in future to ensure due impartiality"". Some of the complaints about the episode related to how Balls and Garraway questioned Coventry South MP Zarah Sultana in a separate interview. In response, Ofcom said: ""In our view, Ms Sultana was given ample opportunity to express her views and respond to the questions put to her, while we consider the robust line of questioning would be consistent with regular viewers' expectations of interviews with political figures on this programme."" In the item, Sultana, who previously sat as a Labour MP before she had the whip suspended in July, said the government should describe the riots as Islamophobic as well as racist, and challenged Balls on an article he had previously written about immigration. Writing afterwards on X, she said: ""The sneering contempt of 'journalists' will never stop me from calling out racism and Islamophobic hate."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9qlzl310o,School shuts X account over 'racism' on platform,"The head says young people on the app ""were drawn into lies and racism"" during the summer riots.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Welsh secondary school has said it is closing its account on X - formerly known as Twitter - over concerns about racism on the social media platform. The head teacher of Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf in Cardiff said a decision was made by governors to ""move away from the platform"".  Matthew HT Evans also called for other organisations such as the Welsh government and school inspectors Estyn to consider if they should remain on it.  X, which was bought for $44bn (£38.1bn) in 2022 by the billionaire Elon Musk, has been contacted for a response.  Speaking to BBC Cymru Fyw, Mr Evans said he was ""shocked"" over messages appearing on the platform during the summer, when rioting broke out in several areas of England and Northern Ireland following the murder of three girls in Southport. ""During the hate riots in the summer, we were able to see young people and children on the streets who were drawn into the lies and racism that was going on, which was disturbing,"" he said. ""You were seeing comments that made you feel uncomfortable about the clear racism that was going on that platform,"" he said.  After the killings in Southport, a false name - attributed to the 17-year-old suspect - spread like wildfire across X. There were false claims the attacker was a refugee who arrived in the UK by boat in 2023 and unfounded speculation he is Muslim - some of these posts were accompanied by Islamophobic and racist hate. The site's owner Mr Musk also shared a post from far-right activist and convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson. Yaxley-Lennon, who had been banned on the platform until Musk took over, had taken aim at Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for his comments after riots broke out. Mr Musk also posted on X predicting civil war in the UK and repeatedly attacking the prime minister. The head of Glantaf said that since the school returned in September, concerns had been reflected in conversations with staff and with parents who felt uncomfortable. However, he said the school has also received ""very vehement"" messages about freedom of speech and freedom of information.   ""As far as we were concerned, it was not a matter of freedom of speech. Messages of hate and racism are another matter,"" he added.  The school was Cardiff's first Welsh-medium secondary school when it opened in 1978, and according to its latest Estyn report, has more than 1,300 pupils. It has decided that it will use now start using the social platform Instagram,  although that will remain under scrutiny.  ""We will review it, as I'm not sure if Instagram is the right platform and ultimately we may have to consider that social platforms are not suitable for schools to communicate on,"" said Mr Evans.  He also wondered if other organisations using X will follow suit.  ""My feeling is you've got a large number of organisations that are on this platform – Estyn, Welsh government, county councils – and I think there's a question for them all to how long they're going to continue on this platform?"" he said.  The Welsh government said it keeps the accounts it uses ""under ongoing review."" ""We recognise the concerns raised about the management of X in recent months, but believe it is important to continue to engage with as many people as possible and provide clear, trusted information.” A spokesperson for Estyn said: ""Our social media is an important way in which we share effective practice across education providers. ""We regularly review our social media channels and continue to monitor our engagement on X as part of this review activity."" The Welsh Local Government Association, which represents councils, declined to comment."

Organisations across Merseyside have been invited to apply for a share of £100,000 to run projects which would promote diversity, equality and inclusion in the wake of recent violent disorder. The funding comes from money taken from criminals through the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) which is then invested into good causes in communities through the Community Cashback Fund. Emily Spurrell said the move would ""tackle hate crime at the earliest opportunity and focus on building and improving community cohesion and resilience"". ""The scenes of violence we saw in our region last month were shocking and appalling,"" Ms Spurrell said. ""It was not protest. It was mindless crime and disorder motivated and manipulated by racism and islamophobia and all those involved are now feeling the full force of the law."" She said it was ""a sad reminder that if stereotypes and hate-fuelled attitudes are allowed to fester it can lead to very serious crimes that have devastating consequences on many lives"". But she added in the wake of the riots people ""saw the very best of our region as communities came together to help each other to cope and recover"". She said: ""Through this funding we want to support those brilliant local organisations which are working to prevent crime and make their areas safer and stronger. ""By taking the cash out of the pockets of those who bring misery to our communities and investing it into these projects, we can effectively turn bad money into good."" About 20 grants have been made available for projects which have a focus on improving understanding of minority communities, raising awareness of the impact of hate crime and challenging harmful attitudes towards other people. The fund is being managed by the Community Foundation for Merseyside and applications can be made until 14 October.

The Executive Office committee has been hearing from local groups on how racist violence has affected their communities. It was also told that some ethnic minority groups have been ""advised by the PSNI to consult, negotiate or listen to community leaders with a link to paramilitary organisations"". The focus comes after a summer of racially motivated violence including disorder, street violence and targeted attacks. The PSNI has described a recent rise in the number of reported race hate crimes as ""stark"". One of the witnesses was Beverly Simpson, representing the North West Migrants' Forum, she told the committee ""whether it is one member or a hundred members, proscribed organisations are engaged in repeat harassment, intimidation and attacks against ethnic minorities communities"". She said it ""is not acceptable"" to be told to negotiate with leaders with paramilitary links.  ""Our community members report being advised by the PSNI to consult, negotiate or listen to community leaders with a link to paramilitary organisations. This is not acceptable in any democratic, peaceful society."" She went on to say the executive has ""a duty protect the human rights of all its citizens. We need robust action on paramilitary violence"". The PSNI have been contacted for a response.  Dr Naomi Green, from the Belfast Islamic Centre said there are nearly 12,000 Muslims in Northern Ireland and that 4000 of them are children. She said that because of violence and disorder ""many are now contemplating leaving Northern Ireland"". When speaking about the disorder in August she said: ""The initial police response was disappointing but we are grateful that the police have responded swiftly since. ""It's not enough to react when hate surfaces, the underlying causes that allow it to fester must be addressed. Racism and islamophobia intersect and there is a longstanding failure to address either of these in NI."" She also called out superficial responses with the issue of racism and said there needs to be ""real meaningful engagement to tackle racism...not tick box exercises"". Dr Green also spoke about the discourse surrounding the August protests and violence. She said: ""There are voices within the political and media space who continue to speak of legitimate concerns in a way that subtly excuses attacks and prejudice on minority communities in NI.  ""There is nothing legitimate about fuelling resentment and scapegoating Muslims or other minorities for complex issues like housing shortages or economic difficulties and you will not resolve them by scapegoating us."" Mr Takura Donald Makoni, from the African and Caribbean Support Organisation NI, told the committee that funding is not getting to the organisations run by and for migrants and ethnic minority groups. ""What benefit is an Open Botanic event, which is a cultural event, which costs £40,000...it's not for us, it's making yourself feel good for doing something which actually has no outcome for the community that you're being funded to service. ""This is ubiquitous in the third sector,"" he added. Mr Muhammed Atif is a representative of the Belfast Multi-Cultural Association. He asked the committee: ""When do I stop being an immigrant, is there a timeline? It's been 16 years. My kids have not seen any other country. ""Please do not call us immigrants anymore."" Mr Atif is a business owner and said he has invested a lot in Northern Ireland: ""200 jobs I've created...I've opened and successfully run multiple business, I'm proud of that"". ""Do you know how many locals I employ? 99%, but I am not local,"" he added."

Alex Hutton, 19, left the victim hospitalised after using mixed martial arts moves on her, said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It said Hutton, from Morriston, Swansea, held extreme racist, transphobic and homophobic views. Hutton, also known as Alex Edwards, appeared before Winchester Crown Court in Hampshire after pleading guilty to terror offences and an assault motivated by hostility toward the victim because she was trans. He was sentenced to a total of five years and four months in custody, plus an extended sentence with a further five years on licence. Hutton had previously been convicted of offences under the Terrorism Act and arrested last November. The arrest came after South Wales Police received a report from a member of the public that they had seen a video on Hutton’s Instagram in which he claimed to have kicked an unidentified person in the head. The video also contained far right imagery. Hutton was subject to a Criminal Behaviour Order restricting his use of the internet and mobile phones after previous convictions for possessing terrorist documents and publishing statements that encouraged terrorism, the CPS said. It added that police investigated his phone use and found he had distributed extreme videos encouraging and glorifying terrorism. There were references to ""cleansing London"" of non-white people and Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, homophobic and transphobic messages.  He shared Nazi extremism and racist videos from the Ku Klux Klan, and bragged about planning terrorist attacks, the CPS said. He spread messages on Instagram and messaging app Telegram where he talked  of wanting to kill anybody who was not white. ""Alex Hutton, motivated by hate, engaged in a horrendous and unprovoked attack on a defenceless young girl who was minding her own business one afternoon in a Swansea park in May 2023,"" said Counter Terrorism Policing Wales investigations chief Det Ch Insp Leanne Williams. ""There is no doubt that the attack will have lasting effects on this young person and I really hope today’s outcome provides her with some comfort."" Hutton, she said, demonstrated a ""clear intention"" to spread his hatred across the internet encouraging acts of terrorism.  Bethan David, of the CPS, said Hutton was a ""dangerous young man"", adding that his ""unprovoked attack was driven by hate and he poses a substantial risk to other groups and society as a whole"". ""He celebrated terrorist acts of white supremacy and encouraged his friends and associates on various social media and messaging platforms to join him in his extreme and disturbing views,"" she added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevjvw9jl8eo,Double killer wins compensation for solitary confinement,"Fuad Awale suffered ""severe depression"" when he was denied contact with other inmates, judges hear.",16 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A double murderer who also held a prison officer hostage has been awarded compensation after suffering ""severe depression"" when he was denied contact with other inmates.  Fuad Awale is serving a life sentence for shooting two men in the head in 2011 in what a judge described as a planned ""execution"".  Awale had been transferred to a special unit for the UK's most dangerous prisoners in 2013 after he and another inmate ambushed the officer and threatened to kill him.  However, a court heard he experienced mental health issues after being denied association with other inmates in the unit, partly due to risks reportedly posed by the so-called Death Before Dishonour anti-Muslim prison gang.   Awale, from Milton Keynes, claimed the gang stopped him from associating with other inmates in HMP Manchester and other prisons.  In a judgment from the High Court, judge Mrs Justice Ellenbogan concluded that Awale's rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been breached.  ""The degree of interference with the claimant's private life which has resulted from his removal from association has been of some significance and duration,"" she wrote. Awale, then 25, was sentenced to a minimum of 38 years in January 2013 after shooting Abdi Farah, 19, and Amin Ahmed Ismail, 18, in an alleyway in Milton Keynes over a drugs dispute.  The court heard Awale was also assessed to ""hold extremist beliefs"" following the 2013 hostage attempt, in which demands were made to release the radical cleric Abu Qatada.  At one stage, Awale requested to be allowed to associate with one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby, the Manchester soldier murdered in 2013 by Islamic extremists Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale in Woolwich.  That request was denied owing to ""counter-terrorism concerns"", the court heard.  However Awale's lawyers argued he had been classed as suitable for association with other prisoners within the tightly controlled units known as the Close Supervision Centre - which consists of 68 places across the UK's prison estate. For several years he was able to mix with several other pre-assessed prisoners and attend Friday Prayers, until a fight among the group meant it was disbanded.  Awale was told he could join another association group with a prisoner referred to as GV - however the court heard that man was a member of Death Before Dishonour and had attacked Muslims before.  In October 2019, Awale was moved to HMP Manchester and was told he would be able to associate with two other prisoners in the supervision centre area.  However after his arrival, he was told the men ""posed a threat to him"" and there were no prisoners suitable for him to associate with in that unit.  He told the court he later heard the men were also members of the Death Before Dishonour gang - which the court heard are dedicated to the ""eradication of Muslims from the prison system"".  Awale remained in Manchester throughout 2020 and initially ""engaged with staff"", but that relationship deteriorated due to what Awale described as his ""depressed state"".  In January 2021, Awale punched a prison officer in the face - a strike he claimed he made in ""self-defence"" - and a series of moves across the prison estate began.  Awale has been held in HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes since 2021 and had not associated with any other prisoners since 17 March, 2023.  His lawyers argued the decisions to deny association were ""opaque"", that he had been denied the chance to argue his case and prison managers had failed to regularly review his segregated conditions as required by law.  Awale also argued that the Secretary of State for Justice had failed to take into account the high numbers of racist and Islamophobic prisoners in the supervision centre, making it difficult to find suitable groups for him to associate with.  Justice Ellenbogan allowed the claim on all grounds.  The court ruled that Awale would be entitled to non-pecuniary damages at an amount to be determined later.  The Ministry of Justice said: ""We acknowledge the court’s judgement and will carefully consider the findings.""

The Women’s Empowered Minds project was set up by Abbas Najib, chief executive officer of Better Communities Bradford (BCB).  It is a charitable incorporated organisation (CIO) which has offered free therapy and group sessions to women for the past five years. Mr Najib said grants of £600,000 from the Henry Smith Foundation and the National Lottery Better Communities Fund will enable it to run for another three years and hold five classes each week. ""The funding equals about £200,000 a year,"" Mr Najib said. ""It provides sewing classes for about 100 women a week plus about fifty hours of mental health therapy for one-on-one sessions and group therapy for the same women."" He said the project started off small providing services for women in the BD7 area. ""It was a demand that had been expressed by the local residents. ""We've been providing them for about five years now and this year we've secured funding for the next three years and are able to run five classes a week."" According to BCB, 150 to 200 women benefit each month from some kind of mental health therapy. Referrals can be from GPs, friends or family and by direct contact. Mr Najib said issues tackled included isolation, depression, anxiety, couples' and family counselling, as well as bereavement.  ""The majority of our beneficiaries are from BD7 - Lidget Green, Scholemoor and the like,"" he said. ""Around 90 to 95% of the users are from the South Asian community. That reflects the area's demographic.  ""Of course we also have users who are white English, Eastern European, and we have users who are from African heritage."" Mr Najib said many of the issues experienced by those who use BCB's services were similar to those of other women across the country. ""When the recent Islamophobic riots happened, South Asian women were more isolated as a result,"" he said.  ""Mosques being targeted, people of colour being singled out and anti-Muslim chants being expressed.

The announcement follows posts on social media by the far-right leader Tommy Robinson, who said in July that a ""pro-UK peaceful protest"" would be held in Glasgow this month. An anti-racism rally is being organised in response. Scotland's prosecution service is instructing police to remand suspects in custody and cases will be fast-tracked through the courts. Police Scotland said it had no specific intelligence to suggest any disorder was going to take place. A letter from the Solicitor General for Scotland, Ruth Charteris, to Audrey Nicoll MSP, the convener of the Scottish Parliament's criminal justice committee, commented on the disorder and riots seen in England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport. She said the disorder was ""motivated by hate, racism and prejudice"" and called for a robust response to ensure that public confidence was maintained and further offending deterred. She said those arrested should expect to be remanded in custody to appear in court at the earliest opportunity. They can also expect prosecutors to oppose their release on bail to ""ensure that public safety is prioritised"". ""To ensure that justice is delivered swiftly, prosecutors will prioritise such cases ahead of existing investigations in order to bring the accused before the court at the earliest opportunity,"" she said. ""These arrangements will be kept under review for as long as necessary and it is my hope that there continues to be no such offending in Scotland."" She added that Scottish prosecutors were committed to tackling crimes motivated by hatred and prejudice, whether committed on social media or in person, and had a range of tools available to deal with reports of that nature robustly. ""In the event that such offending takes place in Scotland, I will ensure that the committee is updated on the actions taken by prosecutors to deliver swift and robust justice,"" she said. First Minister John Swinney told the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday that the disorder seen in England and Northern Ireland should not be classed as protests. ""This was violence and thuggery pure and simple, perpetrated by those with a far-right ideology, by those who had been taken in by that rhetoric, and by criminals,"" he said. ""Far from having legitimate concerns, those indulging in these mindless acts were doing so from a place of racism, Islamophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment. ""This cannot, and should not, be tolerated anywhere."" He added: ""We cannot take the view that we may be immune from related disorder occurring on our own doorstep. ""We must guard against prejudice, discrimination and misinformation that aim to incite hatred and violence. ""Let me be clear to anyone in Scotland considering mimicking the kind of vile behaviour we have witnessed in parts of England and Northern Ireland this summer that their actions will not be tolerated, they will be dealt with robustly and criminal actions online will be taken just as seriously."""

The 310 bus runs every 20 minutes between Stamford Hill in Hackney and Golders Green in Barnet. It was launched in response to longstanding requests from the Jewish community for a service connecting the neighbourhoods, the mayor's office said. Sadiq Khan said that creating the route, which operates from 07:00 to 19:00 daily, was one of his re-election pledges. Mr Khan told BBC London: ""For 16 years now the Jewish communities in Stamford Hill and Golders Green have been lobbying for a direct link between those two communities. ""I was struck by the conversations I've had in recent months with the Jewish community. ""They were frightened because of a massive increase of antisemitism since October 7 last year.  ""I was told stories by families who, where they changed buses from Stamford Hill to Golders Green at Finsbury Park, they were frightened about the abuse they had received."" The Met Police recorded 2,065 antisemitic hate crime incidents between October  and July. Of the 2,065 reports, 390 took place in Barnet, 277 in Westminster, 250 in Hackney and 190 in Camden. Mr Khan said the new bus route ""connects communities, connects congregations"" and would reassure Jewish Londoners they would be ""safe when they travel between these two communities"". ""We have heard stories of Jewish Londoners receiving verbal abuse,"" Mr Khan added. ""We've also heard stories about Jewish Londoners not leaving their homes... because they're worried about their safety. ""I don't want any Londoner to be scared to leave their home because they're worried about public transport. ""I think we've got to recognise the fear that Londoners feel who are Jewish, we've got to recognise the tremors of hate that are felt by Jewish people across the country. ""We've got to be good allies to our Jewish friends and neighbours."" Antisemitic hate crimes rose by 278.9% - with 2,068 offences recorded - in the 12 months to July, compared with the preceding year, according to Met Police data. In the same time frame, according to the force's data, it recorded a total of 3,869 faith-related hate crime incidents, including 1,370 Islamophobic hate crime incidents. There were also 2,642 homophobic-related hate crime offences in that period. According to the data, in total the Met Police dealt with just under 21,000 offences treated as hate crime incidents. The London Jewish Forum and the Board of Deputies of British Jews said they were ""delighted"" with the bus route. ""This bus provides a significant enhancement for our strictly Orthodox community,"" they said in a statement. The 310 trial is the first direct bus service connecting Stamford Hill and Golders Green and has cost Transport for London (TfL) more than £3,160,000.  It runs parallel to the 253 between Stamford Hill and Finsbury Park station, and the 210 between Finsbury Park station and Golders Green. TfL is running a public consultation on the route over the next 12 months. Geoff Hobbs, TfL’s director of public transport service planning, urged passengers to provide feedback on the service via its consultation. Route 310 includes stops at Highgate Village, Whittington Hospital and Finsbury Park.  05/09/2024: This story has been updated to reflect the latest Metropolitan Police data on levels of hate crime in London.

Nathan Thompson, 25, from Newcastle, had previously admitted nine counts of inciting racial hatred and two malicious communications offences between April and July last year. Using two accounts on Twitter, now known as X, he shared and reposted offensive, extreme right-wing messages about religious groups, ethnic minorities and the LGBTQ+ community, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Thompson thanked Judge Julie Clemitson for giving him a chance, to which she replied: ""Make sure you don't waste it."" Sentencing, Judge Clemiston told Thompson his posts celebrated Hitler, fascists and those who had committed terror attacks around the world. She said: ""Each homophobic, transphobic, Islamophobic, antisemitic, racist or fascist tweet fans the flames of division and hatred."" But she did not impose an immediate custodial sentence, saying Thompson had ""borderline"" learning difficulties and was isolated, spending a great deal of time in his bedroom on his computer. The judge imposed a 16-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, with a series of requirements including that his use of the internet should be closely monitored by police or probation officers. At a previous hearing, Gregg Stephens, defending, said: ""He is a young lad who is quite isolated and socially vulnerable. ""He has mental health issues, doesn't mix with people and spends a lot of time on his computer. ""He has got himself connected to this right-wing stuff which you can find online.""

After watching the footage in court, district judge Sunil Khanna concluded Dixon had thrown ""the first punch"" and sentenced him to four months in prison. Campion, of Whitcombe Gardens, Nottingham, was the second man to be sentenced in relation to the incident, the CPS said. He was jailed for four months after pleading guilty to the same charge on 16 August. A third man charged with the same offence, Witney, of Tennyson Avenue, Gedling, was handed a suspended sentence on Friday. He was given a three-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Nine people have so far appeared in court following their part in the unrest in the Nottingham city centre. They were among 20 people arrested during the demonstrations, when rival groups were separated by officers. The events in the city, however, were described by police as ""largely peaceful"" at the time. Janine McKinney, from the CPS, said: ""The arrests, charges, convictions and sentences we have seen over the last weeks make clear the consequences for those criminals on our streets and on social media. These individuals have paid the penalty that awaits anyone caught wreaking such havoc. ""We will continue to work at pace, alongside partners in the criminal justice system, to put anyone whose conduct has crossed the line into criminal behaviour before the courts to face the full consequences of their actions.""

Sadiq Khan said the city was “united against all forms of hate”, as he pledged £10,000 to help protect Muslims against Islamophobic attacks. The extra support comes as people shared their safety fears following the recent racist riots and disorder across the country. City Hall said the mayoral funding will be used to provide the sessions on protective security, safety processes and online safety. Mr Khan had been urged earlier this month to ensure places of worship had extra security. Hina Bokhari, the London Assembly’s Liberal Democrat group leader, said many Muslims had become “extremely worried” by the “unacceptable” spread of hate crimes. Tell MAMA, the organisation working to tackle anti-Muslim hatred, told Reuters that it had received more than 500 calls and online reports of Islamophobic incidents from across the UK since the start of the disorder two weeks ago. The mayor said: “I’m proud that last week Londoners sent a clear message that we are an open and welcoming city that is united against all forms of hate."" He praised the ""peaceful shows of unity on our streets"", which he said were ""inspiring and comforting"". ""However, the violence and disorder that was seen across the country has left many Londoners afraid,"" added Mr Khan.  ""There is no room for complacency. We can never stop being vigilant."" He said he was working ""closely"" with the government, the Metropolitan Police and community leaders ""to ensure that Londoners feel safe, and are safe"".

Paul Dixon, 35, had been drinking with friends on 3 August, when thousands gathered in the city centre for a pre-planned protest, a court heard. The railway safety supervisor, of Broadwood Road in Bestwood, Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty at Nottingham Magistrates' Court to the charge of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. Dixon, who was identified by police from a YouTube video, was arrested on Wednesday at his girlfriend's home where officers found him in possession of cannabis, which he also pleaded guilty to. After watching the footage in court, district judge Sunil Khanna concluded Dixon had thrown ""the first punch"" and sentenced him to four months in prison. ""You were very, very lucky this was not affray,"" he told Dixon, adding his sentencing powers were ""limited"". Mr Khanna said: ""I also have to bear in mind that thankfully it did not get any worse but there was a chance it could have."" Earlier on Thursday, another defendant charged with offences during the Nottingham protests appeared in court. Kevin Musgrave, 37, admitted grabbing a police officer's arm as his girlfriend was detained when hundreds of people gathered near the Brian Clough Statue in King Street. The court heard that Musgrave, of Derbyshire, was not involved in the protest itself, but was arrested for assault and criminal damage after he spat in a police vehicle. The self-employed roofer was given a six-month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. Mr Khanna told Musgrave: ""I must say, Mr Musgrave, it was touch and go. ""Had you been part of the main group, I would have sent you straight to prison."" Musgrave, of High Lane East in Ilkeston, was arrested after his partner Victoria Gray pushed a police officer and spat on another during the Nottingham protest - one of a number to take place across the UK on August 3. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had said Gray was detained after pushing an officer policing the protest in Long Row. The 42-year-old, also of High Lane East, shouted a series of offensive racist and homophobic comments and went on to spit on one of the officers arresting her, the CPS added. She pleaded guilty to a series of charges, including assaults and possession of a weapon, after she took a can of pepper spray to the scene.

Earlier this month, Clive Lewis, who represents Norwich South, claimed a link between attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and what he called ""rising Islamophobia"" in the UK. In response to Mr Lewis's comment, which he made in a post on X, the campaign group Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS) called for him to be suspended from the party. Now Mr Lewis has said attempts to ""shut down and silence"" politicians is a ""dangerous path"" and ""fundamentally wrong"". In a new post on X, he said: ""Combatting antisemitism and advocating for Palestinian human rights and addressing broader Islamophobia, are not mutually exclusive goals. ""We have a responsibility as politicians to ensure all minorities feel safe here in the UK and to advocate for the upholding of human rights abroad. ""Differences of opinion as how best to do this should, of course, always be encouraged. But attempting to shut down and silence those seeking to highlight these issues is a dangerous path and one that is fundamentally, wrong."" LAAS made an official complaint to UK Labour over Mr Lewis's original post, claiming it was ""highly irresponsible"" and breached the official definition of antisemitism. However, it is understood no further action would be taken by the party, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. A Labour spokesperson previously said all complaints were treated seriously and ""thoroughly assessed in line with its rules and procedures"". In his original post, Mr Lewis had written: ""The link between the daily inhumanity being metted [sic] out to Palestinians and rising Islamophobia in the UK, are not unconnected. ""The inhumanity being shown to one is giving 'permission' for the other. These actions diminish us all."" He also linked to a Guardian newspaper article about how dozens of people were reported dead after an Israeli attack on a school in Gaza. Mr Lewis’s comment came after the arrests of hundreds of people in connection with riots and anti-immigration protests across the UK. Alex Hearn, LAAS co-director, described the comments as ""extremely irresponsible"" and a ""conspiracy fantasy"". ""I put in the complaint because we have been seeing a pattern from the far right and across elements of the left that have been blaming Zionists and Israelis for the unrest that has been going on across the country,” he said. “The conflict going on thousands of miles away has no connection to the domestic cases that we have.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4yezz3v1po,Mum fears for children's safety after racist disorder,A Muslim mother in Northern Ireland said recent racist disorder has made parents concerned for children's safety.,28 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A mother-of-three has said she is ""hesitant and worried"" for her children's safety after recent protests and racist disorder in Northern Ireland. Faiza Ahmed, who lives in Bangor, is part of a group of 400 Muslim women across Northern Ireland that wrote a letter to Education Minister Paul Givan with concerns.  ""As mothers we were worried, we have young children and soon they will be going to school and we are worried about their safety, they are worried about their safety,"" she told BBC News NI. Mr Givan said risk assessments are being carried out at schools near to recent protests and racist disorder in Belfast. It follows recent racist disorder in Belfast which saw many ethnic minority owned businesses attacked.  The Muslim Mothers Collective wrote to Mr Givan to say they were ""deeply concerned"" following the incidents. A number of people, including under 18s, have since been charged in connection to the disorder. Ms Ahmed told BBC News NI that ""psychologically"" her children have been affected by the recent racist disorder.  Having enjoyed their school in Northern Ireland so far, Ms Ahmed said that ""it won't be the same, now they go back to school thinking, wondering and worrying"". Speaking earlier on BBC Radio Ulster’s Good Morning Ulster, Ms Ahmed said some parents were hesitant to send their children to school.  “We are not sure whether they will be safe or not,"" she said. “The children themselves are looking forward to going back to school, because we are not sure whether they will be safe or not.” Ms Ahmed said the summer months were “terrible” due to the disorder. “We could not go out because we were worried and this is the time when we thought we were going to spend with our children,” she added. “I have only been in Bangor for a year, so this was my opportunity to make memories, but after the events we couldn’t do that.” She said her youngest child was starting school on Wednesday. “I’m a little bit anxious, as she was leaving this morning she said to me: ’Mum is it safe?’. “I said it should be safe and she says ‘you know what the first thing I will do when I get to school is to hug my friends’. “It is very difficult, our children should be safe, they should be children, it’s not their duty to look into their security, it’s not their responsibility.” In a letter to Democratic Unionist Party politician Mr Givan, the Muslim Mothers Collective said they had been shocked by the intensity of recent events. They requested ""strong assurances"" their children will be safe when they return to school, and that schools take ""proactive measures to prevent racist and Islamophobic bullying"". In response, the minister set out plans including risk assessments. He said his department was working with principals to identify schools that ""may be vulnerable dependent on location, school cohort (i.e high numbers of newcomers) and nature of building"". Mr Givan acknowledged ""recent events may make it more difficult for children from ethnic minority communities"" to be happy, learning and succeeding at school. In response, Mr Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party said his department was involved with the Education Authority carrying out risk assessments ""on a number of schools located close to recent unrest and protests"".  He added they were working with principals to identify schools that ""may be vulnerable dependent on location, school cohort (i.e high numbers of newcomers) and nature of building"". ""Where necessary, maintenance work will be prioritised as well as guidance provided on managing emergency incidents,"" he said. The minister also said officials were working with Translink to ""reinforce transport guidance and the need for reasonable adjustments for potentially vulnerable pupils"". Mr Givan said he hoped his response would assure the Muslim Mothers Collective that the department would ensure schools were ""safe for all children within our community, irrespective of race or religion"" and added he would be happy to meet with them to discuss their concerns.  Ms Ahmed said she thought it was a “good response” from Mr Givan, but that it was important it delivered. “It gives us some reassurance that at least someone is looking into the matter, but again the real test is in the results, is it going to work..is it going to address the issues on the ground?” The secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers in Northern Ireland (NAHT) said that the prospect of risk assessments in schools is ""unthinkable"" and ""absolutely abhorrent"".  Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Graham Gault said that ""every single school leader in every single school across Northern Ireland would stand wholly behind the minister’s position on this issue"". ""All of our children must be free to enjoy their educational experiences in all of our schools in total uncompromised safety fully free from any threats."" Mr Gault told BBC News NI that school leaders will ""do whatever they can to work with whoever they can to protect our children"" and make all of their experiences ""safe and joyful""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj08mjmq107o,News Corp boss apologises for doing Nazi salute,"Patrick Delaney tried to explain the context of an old photo that showed him ""demonstrating"" the gesture.",19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The boss of Foxtel - a majority News Corp-owned cable television company in Australia - has ""unreservedly"" apologised after an image surfaced of him performing a Nazi salute.  Patrick Delaney said he believed he was showing ""the similarity"" between the gesture and one used by some fans of a Western Sydney soccer club when the photo was taken a decade ago. ""Regardless of the context, the fact I demonstrated this offensive salute was wrong,"" he said in an email to staff seen by the BBC. The Jewish Council of Australia condemned Mr Delaney's actions as ""deeply concerning"". “Equally [concerning] is that he operates in a media industry where he felt this was somehow okay,"" Sarah Schwartz, the council's executive officer, said in a statement on Monday. ""It shouldn't need to be said that the salute is an offensive and violent act not only for Jews, but also for other racialised groups."" In his internal memo, Mr Delaney said that he had been ""searching [his] mind"" for a circumstance where ""a photo capturing me in this pose could ever be possible"". He then explained that he believed he was impersonating a threatening gesture made by a group of Western Sydney Wanderers fans during the 2014-15 season, while visiting the set of a Fox Sports television program during his tenure as the channel’s CEO. Mr Delaney said the photograph - first published by Crikey - was ""completely inconsistent"" with his ""values, beliefs, and family connections"". He also condemned ""racism in all its forms"", pointing to his commitment to the 'Say No to Antisemitism letter' which he signed along with other prominent Australian leaders in the wake of the unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed in that attack, and 251 others were taken hostage. Mr Delaney added that he would continue to meet with Jewish leaders to ""express"" his ""deep remorse"". But Ms Schwartz said the idea that Mr Delaney could sign a letter condemning antisemitism, while also feeling comfortable doing a Nazi salute, was proof the nation needed ""more than superficial pledges"". The scandal comes at a time when Australia is grappling with a sharp uptick in both antisemitism and Islamophobia, amid rising community tension over the Israel-Gaza war. In July, the federal government installed a special envoy to combat antisemitism, while promising to appoint an Islamophobia equivalent in the coming months. During a visit to Sydney in November, Lachlan Murdoch called on News Corp's staff in Australia to ""address and tackle"" all forms of antisemitism and said there was ""no room for equivocation"" or fence-sitting on the issue.  Once a mainstay across the nation's homes, Foxtel's business model has been in sharp decline in recent years, after being displaced by the rise of cheaper international streaming services. Earlier this month, News Corp said it was considering selling the ailing pay TV company."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w69p2vz0lo,Scale of Rotherham abuse shocked man who exposed it,Journalist Andrew Norfolk says grooming gangs were brought to justice because of 'mainstream media'.,26 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The journalist who uncovered the Rotherham grooming gangs scandal has said that even he massively underestimated the scale of the abuse. Andrew Norfolk told the BBC on the 10th anniversary of the Jay Report that he had ""absolutely no idea"" it would name 1,400 girls as victims before the figure was announced at a bombshell press conference. Mr Norfolk had been putting pressure on Rotherham Council and South Yorkshire Police to answer questions about child sexual exploitation by predominantly Asian men since he started receiving tip-offs in 2011. His subsequent investigation for The Times had ""seismic"" ramifications and led to a major inquiry. Looking back at the impact of Professor Alexis Jay's findings in 2014, Mr Norfolk said that the outcome of his investigative work proved the value of the ""mainstream media"" in exposing crime and the failings of authorities. He admitted that he had had to balance his instinct to reveal the abuse with concerns that the story's publication would both stoke the reaction of the far-right and lead to accusations of racism. ""If you’d asked me the day before that press conference how many young teenage girls had been groomed and exploited in Rotherham over the time period the report covered, I would have guessed 150,” he said. He was “staggered” to hear Prof Jay reveal how 1,400 girls had been abused, trafficked to other cities, or had petrol poured on them. “They were treated like sub-human species for the pleasure of these men,” he added. Mr Norfolk had first identified a ""pattern"" of Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs exploiting white girls in the north of England and the Midlands in 2010, but came up against a ""conspiracy of silence"" when he tried to elicit responses from police forces and councils. He said that hearing Prof Jay explicitly refer to the perpetrators' ethnic backgrounds was an ""extraordinary"" moment. “It was so hard-hitting, she didn’t mince her words. The response was seismic across the world.” He added: “When the leader of Rotherham Council was asked by the Home Affairs Select Committee why it had ordered that inquiry, he said: ‘Because The Times wouldn't leave us alone’. That in itself, in 35 years of journalism, is vindication for being a journalist.” The Times had been called racist and Islamophobic for pursuing the investigation. “It was a very difficult story to cover because it was a story about white British girls, aged typically between 12 to 15, being groomed and abused by men who, as the pattern seemed to become more clear, were overwhelmingly of Pakistani and Muslim heritage,” he said. “It's not fun being regarded as somebody with abhorrent views, when in your heart, you know the opposite is the case.”  There were also fears about how far-right groups would react to the story, which did eventually lead to protests and marches descending on Rotherham. “It was a dream story for the far-right,” he said. “They had no interest in solutions, they were interested in exploiting the situation."" Ten years on, tensions remain in the town and recently came to the fore at the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers, near Rotherham, when a riot broke out outside the hotel, which housed asylum seekers, in the wake of the Southport knife attack. “There is such a danger in allowing people to blame ‘the other’, especially when your life itself isn't great,” he said. Mr Norfolk first became aware of cases in West Yorkshire when Ann Cryer, at the time the MP for Keighley, publicly raised concerns about the abuse of two girls in her constituency. “I'd noticed a handful of cases from local newspaper reports. Initially, I wanted to look away, which is shame on me, but then one particular incident happened.” Mr Norfolk heard a BBC radio report from Manchester Crown Court about nine men who had been convicted of offences against a 14-year-old girl who lived in a care home. He discovered the men were Asian. His editor granted him five months to research the cases across the north. In January 2011, The Times ran its first story. Days later, a concerned Rotherham grandfather contacted him and told him his 12-year-old granddaughter had been found drunk and half-naked, with a group of Asian men. When police attended the house, the schoolgirl was arrested for being drunk and disorderly. This was a “key introduction” into how girls and their parents had been so badly let down in the town. “It became my full-time job until we felt everybody knew what was happening, the system had been changed and the perpetrators held to account”, he added. In 2012, grooming victim ""Amy’s"" story was the first of several Rotherham case studies to be published in the newspaper. Her confidential files given to Mr Norfolk detailed how authorities had failed to respond after she reported being abused by 10 men, who were eventually jailed in 2018. “We'd thought when that story was published, Rotherham Council and South Yorkshire Police would have to respond by saying, ‘this is appalling, we will take action',” he said. “Instead, what they did was ask South Yorkshire Police to launch a criminal inquiry into who had leaked the material to me. They remained in total denial and were telling us they were a model example of how to deal with child sexual exploitation - and so we just carried on. “A year later, another very brave young woman contacted me. She was being serially abused by a man who is now serving a 35-year prison sentence.” Mr Norfolk said he was proud of the legacy of his investigation, which resulted in child sexual exploitation being made a national policing priority. He believes authorities no longer ""shy away"" from tackling the problem, even if it had not been eradicated.  “It’s thanks to journalism. Sometimes the most difficult stories are the ones that only journalists can tell. People turn to the ""mainstream media"" when they've tried everywhere else and the people who should have been helping, didn't.” The government said lessons had been learned from ""past mistakes"" around the handling of abuse. Jess Phillips MP, the new minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said: “My heart goes out to the brave survivors from Rotherham and other communities. I have met many of these victims and worked with them over the years I have been involved in the issue of grooming and sexual exploitation. They must live not only with the unimaginable horror of what happened to them as children, but with the woeful failures and indifference of the adults who were supposed to protect them. “In the decade since Prof Jay’s report was published, we have seen some positive strides on addressing her recommendations. For example, the work of the Child Sexual Exploitation Taskforce which has led to hundreds of arrests and helped to identify and protect thousands of victims. But much remains to be done. “Everyone who is responsible for children must learn from past mistakes. I am committed to working with the police and wider partners to identify more perpetrators of these heinous crimes and bring them to justice. I want to ensure child and adult survivors are treated with compassion so they feel safe and believed; that authorities take these types of reports seriously; and that victims and their families can access the support they need.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq827855x5vo,Brother of Hamas victim accuses SNP of double standards on Israel,"Colin Cowan said the SNP displayed ""double standards"" in the fallout of Angus Robertson's meeting with an Israeli diplomat.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The brother of a British-Israeli man killed by Hamas has accused the SNP of double standards in its stance on Israel.  Bernard Cowan, originally from Glasgow, was killed by Hamas gunmen in his home on a kibbutz in Southern Israel during the 7 October attack. The 57-year-old left his family in Scotland when he was just 19 to move to Israel. Then first minister Humza Yousaf was widely praised after he embraced Mr Cowan's grieving mother during a visit to Giffnock Newton Mearns Synagogue in East Renfrewshire a few days after his death.   Mr Cowan's brother, Colin Cowan, said he now believed Mr Yousaf had merely used the meeting with his mother as a photo opportunity and questioned how sincere he has been in his comments at the time. He also said he had been angered by criticism of External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson, who apologised after meeting an Israeli diplomat earlier this month.  Mr Cowan said Scottish Jews wanted First Minister John Swinney to acknowledge the “legitimate fears” of the community and to meet them. An SNP spokesperson said the party stood ""entirely against"" antisemitism, and the first minister said he would be grateful for the opportunity to meet Mr Cowan and his family. Mr Robertson was heavily criticised by several senior members of his own party - including former SNP ministers Emma Roddick, Kevin Stewart and Elena Whitham - after he met Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK Daniela Grudsky on 8 August. Mr Robertson subsequently said he was sorry that the meeting was not ""strictly limited"" to talks about a ceasefire.  He said the Scottish government would not accept further invitations to meet Israeli diplomats until ""real progress"" had been made towards peace and humanitarian assistance, and until Israel ""co-operates fully with its international obligations on the investigation of genocide and war crimes"". The SNP also withdrew the party whip from MSP John Mason over social media posts in which he questioned whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, the Hamas-run health ministry has said. That equates to about 1.7% of the 2.3 million population of the territory, with satellite image analysis suggesting nearly 60% of buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war. Mr Cowan said he believed Israel was being ""targeted"" as the Scottish government had met with representatives from other countries with ""terrible civil rights"" such as Turkey. ""Israel is the only Jewish state in the world,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland. ""The definition of antisemitism is prejudice against Jewish people. ""So if the Scottish government aren’t willing to talk to Israel, is that not being prejudiced against Jewish people? ""Why is it that Israel is being targeted when every other Western country is quite happy to talk to Israel? If you want a balanced, impartial view, you should meet with both sides."" Speaking at the service on 12 October at the Giffnock Newton Mearns Synogogue at which he met Mr Cowan's mother, Mr Yousaf said he stood in solidarity with Scotland’s Jewish community. He added: ""I want you to know that this first minister, who is proudly Muslim, shares the pain of our Jewish communities. ""Your heartbreak is my heartbreak. Your loss is my loss. Your tears are my tears."" Mr Yousaf has been a vocal critic of the Israeli military action in Gaza, which says has gone ""way beyond a legitimate response"" and has been ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"".  Mr Cowan said he now believed Mr Yousaf had used the service at the synogogue as a ""photo opportunity"" and questioned how genuine he had been. “At the time, it seemed quite genuine,"" he said. ""But some of what he said recently, it doesn't seem so genuine anymore. It seems a bit biased, what he did at the time.” Mr Yousaf said his thoughts were with all of the families impacted by the 7 October attack, as well as families in Gaza ""who have been devastated by Israel’s horrendous actions"". He said: “When I participated in the service of solidarity at Giffnock Shul in October last year, it was at a time of extreme personal grief as my in-laws continued to be trapped in a warzone in Gaza, not knowing whether they would live or die day-by-day.  ""My commitment to the Jewish community then, and now, is to be an ally in the face of antisemitism, and I am proud of my lifelong campaigning against hatred in all of its forms, and believe that Islamaphobia and antisemitism are two sides of the same coin."" But he said that criticism of the actions of the government of Israel was not antisemitism. “While I support diplomacy, even with countries we fundamentally disagree with, there must be limits,"" he said. ""That is why I support the Scottish government ensuring there are not normal diplomatic relationships with the government of Israel until they comply with their international obligations and cease killing civilians with impunity.” Mr Cowan said he had noticed a spike in antisemitism since the escalation between Israel and Gaza following the 7 October attacks.  ""I’ve never felt so unsafe in Scotland as I have in the last year,"" he said.  ""Walking down the street, would I be targeted if they knew I was Jewish? It’s definitely an unsafe feeling at the moment. ""There have been numerous incidents of buildings being attacked, people being attacked since 7 October. The Palestinian support that we see, the protests on a weekly basis, makes us feel unsafe."" He told BBC Scotland that his relatives living in Israel had been displaced amid the ongoing violence.  ""They’re not living in their home, they’re living somewhere else,"" he said.  ""They are distraught. They’ve lost a father, husband, grandfather, we’ve lost a brother, my mum’s lost a son. It’s hard.  ""It’s not easy when someone so young is taken. We’re still reeling from it.” An SNP spokesperson said the party stood ""entirely against"" antisemitism. They said: ""Following last year’s horrific attacks by Hamas, SNP policy has been consistent and clear that hostages must be released, an immediate ceasefire must be put in place and that a viable Palestine state must be recognised within a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live alongside each other in peace.”"

Screenshots shared with the BBC showed comments from a profile in the name of Stockton councillor Susan Scott suggesting Muslims would ""do whatever it takes"" to make the whole world Islamic. Stockton Borough Council's Labour leader Bob Cook said the Tory councillor had ""done the right thing and resigned"" in the wake of criticism. The authority's Conservative group leader Tony Riordan confirmed Ms Scott's resignation following ""a recent social media post"", with a by-election now being arranged. The post, which also said ""we ignore this threat at our peril"", was made on a Facebook page dedicated to local politics. The Stockton Liberal Democrats group expressed ""deep concern and disappointment"" in relation to the comments and said they came at a particularly volatile time. Chair Mo Waqas said: ""In light of the recent riots and attacks on mosques, it is especially irresponsible for Councillor Scott to be making such harmful statements."" Calling for a retraction of the comments and an apology from Ms Scott, he said Islamophobia should be addressed and ""condemned unequivocally"" as he called on the community to come together to reject all forms of hate speech. A council spokesman confirmed the formal resignation of Ms Scott, who represented the Fairfield ward, and said a by-election would be organised. The BBC has attempted to contact Ms Scott.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clygnk7mlnxo,'I used to hide that I am a son of refugees - now I'm proud of it',Rustam Wahab speaks about his family's journey from a comfortable life in Kabul to fleeing to England.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Rustam Wahab is the proud son of refugees - but only a few people knew until recently. His parents and older brother, who was two at the time, risked their lives in 2001 to flee war and persecution in Afghanistan and seek refuge in England.   Mr Wahab, 22, was in his mum's stomach when she made the journey to England in the hope of finding a better life.  The family, who now live in London and Essex, were used to a comfortable lifestyle when they lived in central Kabul, but were catapulted into extreme poverty when they first arrived in the country. Mr Wahab said: ""The first time I told people that I was a son of refugees was a year ago, so it's not been a long time."" Mr Wahab said: ""The earliest example I have of us being very poor as a result of being an asylum seeker was when me and my older brother went to school and it was a funfair day. ""We only had 50p [and] we didn't have money to go on the bouncy castle."" Mr Wahab said his older brother gave him the 50p as they did not have enough money for them both to have a go. ""One teacher saw and let us both go onto the bouncy castle, and stuff like that has stuck with me and my older brother. ""That's the first time we had experienced the kindness of other people and them treating us with fairness and love."" Mr Wahab said his family used to live near the presidential palace in the Afghan capital, but their life had been destroyed due to the war and left his parents with no other choice but to risk everything and flee. He said: ""It was a middle class life, my dad worked from the age of 12, he helped out his dad while still going to school. ""My dad was a really, really hard worker and he still is now, to support his family right now he is working crazy hours. ""So the transition from middle class life to them being at the bottom of society - it was really difficult for my parents. ""Not only did they flee war and persecution, [but] then they came to the UK and went through poverty and being dirt poor and [not being able] to afford certain stuff. ""The people who come here illegally don't want to come here, they have to come here and as soon as people realise that the whole narrative on asylum seekers coming here... will change."" Mr Wahab is studying for a degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Southampton University. Alongside his studies he runs an Instagram page, on which he shares videos that give an insight into events taking place across the world to more than 700,000 followers.  Mr Wahab has recently focused on sharing informative videos that reference the riots that took place after disinformation was spread online about the circumstances of an attack in which three young girls were fatally stabbed in Southport.  Following the disorder that followed the incident, he said: ""Of course, I have been subject to a little bit of racism and Islamophobia. ""But seeing that with my own eyes, a mass amount of people just rioting and attacking people of colour - it made me feel frightened, scared and unwelcomed. ""I really thought about immigrating to a different country because of it."" Yet he added he found the counter-protests ""heartwarming"".  Mr Wahab added: ""It just goes to show that there is a small minority who share those racist, far-right views, but the majority of the country actually want us here."" However, growing up Mr Wahab said he had kept his family's history a secret. Hostility was rampant towards people of colour after 9/11 and Mr Wahab's parents hoped to protect their children by telling them to hide who they were. Mr Wahab said: ""The first time I told people that I was a son of refugees was a year ago, so it's not been a long time."" He launched his Instagram page in 2019 and it started to grow quickly during 2020, but he felt his identity ""was sort of like a secret"". ""I saw that the hate towards people of colour and refugees was getting so bad, that I thought I should share my story and the person running this account is actually a son of refugees. ""We're just normal people, not a threat to anyone. We're just here living the same as them, paying their taxes."" ""We sort of had to hide our identity up until maybe our teenage years, when we kind of got fed up of it and we didn't want to hide who we were anymore. ""We used to say we were Pakistani or Turkish instead of saying we were Afghan. ""It was difficult really because my parents were always quite protective and a bit ashamed because of the connotations that come with [being a] refugee as well."" But now he said: ""I am pretty proud of it."" ""My parents have worked hard to give us good decent lives after they got their British status in 2007."" Moving forward he said he hoped to finish his degree and and wants to pursue a career as an MP.  ""I do want to be an MP, I do believe that to cause real change is through Parliament.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynl828yp0o,Row over Tory MP's Allahu Akbar arrest call,The Tory leadership hopeful says police should “immediately arrest” any protesters shouting Allahu Akbar.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Conservative MP Robert Jenrick has defended himself after being accused of Islamophobia for saying police should have “immediately arrested” any protesters shouting Allahu Akbar during last year’s Gaza ceasefire protests. Speaking on Sky News, the Tory leadership candidate accused police of treating far-right marches and violence more harshly than the pro-Palestinian demonstrations that began after the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year. Several Muslim MPs have argued Mr Jenrick's claim linked all Muslims to extremism and fuelled violent groups. But Mr Jenrick said the Arabic phrase - meaning God is great - had been “abused” by “extremists” to intimidate people. He told Sky News he had been angered by the way pro-Palestinian demonstrations had been policed. “I have been very critical of police in the past, particularly around the attitude of some police forces to the protests we saw since 7 October. “I thought it was quite wrong that somebody could shout Allahu Akbar on the streets of London and not be immediately arrested, project genocidal chants on to Big Ben and not be immediately arrested.  ""That attitude is wrong and I’ll always call out the police for it.” Mr Jenrick said he stood by earlier comments that ""our streets to be dominated by Islamist extremists"". Pressed further, he said: ""There were instances back then where we saw Islamist extremists on our streets. ""I've just given you one example where you literally had somebody chanting or shouting Allahu Akbar off Oxford Street."" Mr Jenrick, a former home office minister, was criticised by former Conservative party chair Baroness Sayeeda Warsi and Labour MPs Naz Shah and Afzal Khan, among others.  In a social media post, Baroness Warsi said: ""Every day before we start parliamentary business in the Commons and Lords we say a prayer and praise God - we say our parliamentary version of Allahu Akbars at the heart of democracy - a process Robert Jenrick is a part of.  ""This language from Jenrick is more of his usual nasty divisive rhetoric - he is such a tool."" Ms Shah, the MP for Bradford West, called Mr Jenrick's comments ""textbook Islamophobia"". His comments ""literally equates every Muslim in the world with extremism"" she argued.  In a social media post she said: “Imagine in this climate, either being that ignorant or deliberately trying to stigmatise all Muslims. He should apologise and speak to Muslim communities and learn more about our faith.” Afzal Khan, another Labour MP, said: “Another day, another senior Tory being Islamophobic.  ""Allahu Akbar means God is great – the Muslim equivalent of hallelujah. Jenrick’s confidence in going on national TV to say people should be arrested for saying Allahu Akbar exposes his deep-seated prejudice against Muslims.” Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said: “People like Robert Jenrick have been stirring up some of the problems that we’ve seen in our communities.   ""Actually, what we want to see is communities come together, and the vast majority of the community want to see that.” Mr Jenrick stood by his comments in a later social media post. He said: ""Allahu Akbar is spoken peacefully and spiritually by millions of British Muslims in their daily lives”. But “aggressive chanting” of the phrase as seen by gangs of men in balaclavas in Birmingham was “an offence under Section 4 and 5 of the Public Order Act”. A spokesperson for Mr Jenrick said: ""Robert has called out all disorder in the strongest possible terms, whether from the far-right or retaliatory violence from sectarian mobs. ""We are yet to see one Labour politician do the same. The country needs strong leadership, not squeamishness."" But Baroness Warsi accused Mr Jenrick of being dishonest and called on him to apologise. ""You do not get to go on national broadcasters and say one thing and try and pretend you said something else after,"" she said. Mr Jenrick is one of six candidates vying to replace Rishi Sunak as leader of the Conservative Party. He is facing: A winner will be announced on 2 November."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v5zgelqjyo,Cancelling show over Gaza remarks an 'error': Orchestra,Jayson Gillham premiered a piece that was dedicated to the journalists of Gaza.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) has admitted it made an ""error"" in cancelling an acclaimed pianist’s performance due to comments he made on the Israel-Gaza war. On Sunday, Jayson Gillham premiered a five-minute piece called Witness, written by composer Connor D’Netto, which was dedicated to the journalists of Gaza. Before starting the recital, Mr Gillham said Israel had killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists. The MSO subsequently removed the British-Australian pianist from an upcoming concert on Thursday, saying he put them in a ""difficult situation"". Now the entire concert, due to be held at Melbourne Town Hall, has been cancelled due to safety concerns. The MSO says they are trying to reschedule the performance. At Sunday’s concert, which was held at the Iwaki Auditorium in Melbourne, Jayson Gillham performed a range of other works, from Beethoven to Chopin.  Witness was a last-minute addition, according to the MSO. ""The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world,"" Mr Gillham claimed before starting to play Witness. In an apologetic statement on Thursday, the MSO said “While the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra maintains that a concert platform is not an appropriate stage for political comment, we acknowledge Jayson’s concerns for those in the Middle East and elsewhere."" “We recognise the strength of feelings of all parties on this matter and particularly acknowledge the dedication and commitment demonstrated by all our musicians and staff this week.” Mr Gillham has accepted the MSO’s apology. “I hold my relationship with the MSO, its players and audience with the highest regard and look forward to our continued working relationship in years to come,” he said in a statement. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. Nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. At least 113 of those were journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom. The decision by the MSO and their subsequent apology have caused a stir on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was “truly appalling,” later adding that “art is often powerful because it’s political”. Arts critic and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said of the MSO’s apology, “Not before time. How I wish Gillham was giving a concert in Sydney. He would get a standing ovation here from supporters who admire his courage almost as much as they admire his talent.” The Israel-Gaza war has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. As has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as sharp upticks in Islamophobia and anti-semitism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjwd033n0ko,We're inclusive says senior Tory after race rows,Shadow Welsh secretary urges Senedd Conservatives to be clear that they welcome all.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A senior Conservative has urged its Welsh Parliament group to make clear it is inclusive, after its leader was accused of ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" and another member used racist language about Chinese people. Shadow Welsh secretary Lord Byron Davies of Gower said the Tory party ""embraces all cultures, ethnic groups and religions"". “There is no other party view,"" he added. He spoke after Tory group leader Andrew RT Davies rejected criticism of his comments about halal meat in schools, and Laura Anne Jones apologised for using the racist slur on WhatsApp. Andrew RT Davies wrote that ""children should not be forced to eat halal school lunches"", in an article for GB News, after a constituent alleged she was told non-halal meat was not available at her daughter's school in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan. The school said on social media ""the statement that all meat options are halal-only is incorrect"". On Monday, he called allegations that this was race-baiting, made by the Muslim Council of Wales, ""completely untrue"", and said his concerns were focused on choice. He was speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. South Wales East Tory Senedd member Laura Anne Jones apologised last week for using a racist slur about Chinese people in an exchange about Chinese-owned TikTok. Ms Jones said the word was ""unacceptable and I deeply regret using it"". On Tuesday, Lord Davies said: ""The Conservative Party as a whole embraces all cultures, ethnic groups and religions. ""We are proud to have amongst our membership and representatives at all levels people from these groups. “There is no other party view. We are a broad church."" “The Muslim community have my absolute assurance that the Welsh Conservative Party are an inclusive party and the Senedd Conservative group should also make this absolutely clear.” On Sunday, Conservative peer Nick Bourne, a former Tory leader in Cardiff Bay, warned Andrew RT Davies against going down a ""blind alley"" of trying to debate the abolition of the Welsh Parliament. It followed a post on X, formerly Twitter, by Mr Davies saying he raised the issue at the Vale of Glamorgan agricultural show as he was ""keen to find out people's views"". On Tuesday, Lord Davies of Gower made the same point. “On the issue of abolishing the Senedd, the Conservative Party has no plans to support a move towards this and I see any action to test public opinion on this as completely futile,” he said. In Monday's radio interview Andrew RT Davies agreed that abolishing the Welsh Parliament ""certainly isn't our position, and it's not my position either"". ""But if you want to engage with a group of society that do hold a view contrary to yours you pose a question and then you engage with them on a one-to-one basis,"" he added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9l33pz493o,Call for Labour to suspend Clive Lewis over X post,An antisemitism group is calling for the suspension of an MP after comments he made on social media.,12 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"An antisemitism group has called for the Labour MP, Clive Lewis, to be suspended from his party. It follows a post Mr Lewis wrote on X, in which he claimed a link between attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and what he called “rising Islamophobia” in the UK.  The co-director of the Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS) group has described the comment as ""incendiary"" and ""inflammatory"". Mr Lewis declined to comment. A Labour spokesperson said: “All complaints are treated seriously and thoroughly assessed in line with our rules and procedures.” In the post on Saturday, Mr Lewis, who is the MP for Norwich South, shared a link to a report in the Guardian newspaper. The article said dozens of people had been reported dead following an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza.  Alongside the link, Mr Lewis wrote: “The link between the daily inhumanity being (sic) metted out to Palestinians and rising Islamophobia in the UK, are not unconnected. “The inhumanity being shown to one is giving ‘permission’ for the other. These actions diminish us all.” Alex Hearn is the co-director of LAAS, which was started by Labour members to combat what they saw as the rise of anti-Jewish sentiment in the Labour Party. He said he had written to the Labour Party, calling for Mr Lewis to be suspended. “I put in the complaint because we have been seeing a pattern from the far right and across elements of the left that have been blaming Zionists and Israelis for the unrest that has been going on across the country,” he said. “The conflict going on thousands of miles away has no connection to the domestic cases that we have. “In my opinion this is conspiracy fantasy. It’s extremely irresponsible that a Labour official should be pouring fuel on the fire in this way.” Mr Lewis’s comment came after the arrests of hundreds of people in connection with riots and anti-immigration protests across the UK. The unrest followed the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July. Mr Hearn said: “I think his [Mr Lewis’s] comments are dangerous because it’s a fantasy that blames racism against Muslims on Jews thousands of miles away in a different country. “When communities are attacking each other it’s awful. What our officials should be doing is calming things down. Mr Lewis took part in an anti-racism protest in Norwich on Saturday, in which up to 400 people gathered in the city centre. The demonstration was organised as part of a national day of protest by Norwich Stand Up to Racism and Protest with Pride Mr Lewis addressed the crowd, three days after attending another counter-protest near a hotel housing asylum seekers on the outskirts of Norwich. A spokesperson for the Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, was questioned by the BBC about Mr Lewis's comments. They said it was ""explicitly clear that violence has no place in UK society"". When asked if Mr Lewis's comments were antisemitic, they said it was not their role to get into individual discipline.  They added: ""The UK’s position is that we must have more aid into Gaza."" It is understood the Labour Party is taking no further action in this case. Follow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."

Michael Mongan, 39, of Castle Road, Ealing, west London, attacked a Ladbrokes branch in Northolt on 27 July. While released on bail, he racially abused a bus driver on 7 August - an incident that was widely shared on social media. At Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, Judge Ian Comfort described the bus incident as an ""appalling racial and religious abuse over a sustained period of time"". He added: ""Your behaviour (occurred) when there was violent disorder in other parts of the country against Muslims and other groups."" On 27 July, Mongan repeatedly hit windows with a large stick and racially abused staff while under the influence of alcohol, the court heard. A member of the public had to restrain him before he was arrested by police. While in custody, Mongan racially abused a police officer who was driving a van. In relation to this incident, Mongan pleaded guilty to two counts of racially aggravated behaviour, one charge of criminal damage and one count of causing damage to a police vehicle. The second incident occurred on 7 August, while he was on bail for the previous offences, after a bus driver refused to let him board as he did not have the money to pay for his journey. Mongan spat at the bus driver's cab a number of times while shouting Islamophobic abuse and other threats, the court was told. His lawyer, Giovanna Fiorentino, said Mongan had claimed a member of the public had offered to pay for his fare but the bus driver refused to let him board. After the video was posted on social media, Mongan was identified and arrested on Friday. He was charged with a racially aggravated public order offence and criminal damage. Mongan was sentenced to: All charges will run concurrently. He was also told to pay £500 to the bus driver, £200 to the police officer he racially abused and £200 to a staff member at Ladbrokes. Mongan bowed his head as the sentence was read out in court and told the judge afterwards: ""They won't see a pound of it from me.""

Omid Djalili has been working on a pilot for a TV show that follows a has-been comedian who starts to teach comedy at the University of Suffolk. The 58-year-old, who lives in the town, screened a pilot episode of the show on campus earlier this week to an audience of 140 people. He said: ""There is no demand for this sitcom, but there was no demand for The Office or Cobra Kai. We've got something which possibly has global appeal."" The concept for the sitcom is loosely based on an invitation Djalili had from university bosses back in April 2023, to helm a comedy course at the site. Despite saying he would love the opportunity to mould the next generation of stand-ups the arrangement did not materialise, nor did the suggestion of a reality series. That is when Djalili came up with the idea of filming a new TV programme at the university instead. Speaking to Wayne Bavin on the BBC Radio Suffolk breakfast show, he said: ""We were going to shoot it with my production company as a reality show, but then we said, 'Why don't we just shoot it as a sitcom?' ""I told the university and they said they'd love it. So, we put something together. ""We had 140 people show up and they absolutely loved it - now we can go and pitch it. ""It's a new format about a comedian who goes in to teach comedy at the University of Suffolk, but the problem is he has to teach it with a comedy critic who hates him."" The critic is played by Tom Goodman Hill, who recently starred in the Netflix hit Baby Reindeer, while the show itself will be directed by Matt Lipsey.  Djalili, who plays the lead role, added: ""We have a top class team and I am not sure how it happened. ""I was looking for the one ingredient which would make it international – and that's  that it is set in Ipswich."" Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."

Shafeel Hussain, 35, who joined a counter-protest in Lincoln Road in Peterborough on Wednesday, said it was beautiful to see ""more than 600 people from diverse backgrounds come out to counter division peacefully"". Malika Speaks, 29, former Peterborough poet laureate, said the responsibility taken by communities ""serves as a reminder of the impact of unity and allyship"". Amir Suleman said that while the message of unity was strong, the unrest had affected him as a parent and said he feared the ""threat of menace to my family"". Violence and disorder organised by far-right groups broke out around the country after three girls were fatally stabbed by a 17-year-old in Southport on 29 July. Peterborough mosques reduced their opening hours this week as a precaution. A spokesperson from Cambridgeshire Constabulary said there was no reported disorder in Peterborough on Wednesday, ""but a peaceful counter-protest took place"". Mr Suleman, a presenter at BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, said: ""When Brexit happened there were similar fears of Islamophobia. ""My son is 18 and had to go to London for work today.  ""But we were reluctant. We have told him to take a taxi instead of public transport in London. Those are the choices, sadly, we are having to think about."" Sameena Aziz said as a British-born, Muslim woman of colour, born to migrant parents, she felt unsafe. ""I am a qualified teacher - all my three children are in the medical field including doctors and a dentist, and my daughter-in-law is a barrister. So that’s five people from just one family,"" she said. ""The racists thugs want us to leave the country - but whose loss would it be? ""Why should we justify our belonging to Britain? I think Muslims are finding their voice and they know they here to stay."" Malika Speaks said it was critical the anti-racism support encouraged sustainable action from policy makers. Raheema Ahmed, 29, was born in London but grew up in Peterborough. She said the incidents made her feel “at edge” and ""fear being a women of colour"" after she experienced racial abuse on Sunday. ""I was in a supermarket with my young daughter. She was crying so I took a banana from my shopping trolley and gave it to her - I was going to pay for it in the end.  ""But suddenly a woman screamed at me and said ‘it’s people like you who are always stealing’ and followed me around the store. ""This is not the first time. In 2015, I was called ISIS when France’s hijab ban was kicking off."" Ms Ahmed said she remained ""cautious"" going forward. ""I have been scared to expose my elderly mum, who wears a headscarf, for fear of her safety,"" she said. Mr Suleman added: ""I woke up this morning feeling more hopeful.  ""But, for days to come as a family we will be thinking before we go anywhere."" Malika Speaks said: ""It’s important to remain realistic about the impact the racist and Islamophobic violence is having on Muslims, people seeking asylum and global majority populations."" Peterborough’s MP Andrew Pakes said he was proud that Peterborough rejected hate and thanked faith leaders, the police and city council for working tirelessly to keep everyone safe.

Jayson Gillham premiered Witness at a show at the MSO on Sunday. The piece was penned by another composer as a tribute to the Palestinian press. The British-Australian was scheduled to perform again on Thursday, but the MSO has said it is reworking the programme after Gillham introduced the piece by saying  Israel had killed more than 100 journalists. A spokesperson for Gillham told the ABC he won't comment on the decision to drop him ""out of respect to the MSO and his ongoing relationship with them"". Gillham - who is billed on the MSO website as ""as one of the finest pianists of his generation"" - was born in Australia but lives in the UK. At the concert at the Iwaki Auditorium on Sunday, he performed a range of works, from Beethoven to Chopin. He also played Witness, written by Australian composer Connor D'Netto, which the MSO says was a last-minute addition. ""Over the last 10 months, Israel has killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists,"" Mr Gillham said before starting the piece. A number were ""targeted assassinations of prominent journalists"" who were travelling in marked press vehicles or wearing press jackets, he claimed. ""The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world,"" he added. In an email to patrons, the MSO said they were blindsided by Mr Gillham's comments and he had put them in a ""difficult situation"". “The MSO does not condone the use of our stage as a platform for expressing personal views”, it added. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.

More than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom, reports that 113 of those were journalists. Apologising for the ""offence and distress"" caused, the MSO said it had removed Gillham from the program and would update customers soon. In a statement given to local media, a spokesperson for the MSO said: ""Mr Gillham's remarks went beyond the remit of his contract."" The decision has caused a backlash on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was “truly appalling” while arts critics and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said “MSO management should hang its collective head in shame”. The Israel-Gaza war has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. As has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as a sharp uptick in Islamophobia and antisemitism."

Riley Adey, 19, and Reece Greenwood, 31, were both sentenced for violent disorder that was carried out in Sunderland on 2 August. Adey, of Washington, was filmed standing on top of an overturned car, which had been set alight, while he handed out weapons, and Greenwood, also of Washington, live-streamed himself ""actively encouraging violent disorder"" and ""verbally abusing police"". During sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge Paul Sloan KC said both men had ""brought shame upon the city of Sunderland"". The court heard Adey had thrown a scaffolding pole, a vape and bricks at police officers. Defence counsel Andrew Findlay said Adey had drunk ""six to seven pints"" before the riots and had become ""emotionally and physiologically swept along"" by the events. He added his client was ""remorseful for what happened"". Adey was sentenced to two years in a young offenders' institution, having previously pleaded guilty at Teesside Magistrates' Court. Greenwood was handed a 30-month sentence for his part in the riot. He had been driven to the protest by his friend Josh Kellet, who was jailed last week for violent disorder. The court heard how the father-to-be washed and put away his clothes so they could not be recovered by police. Judge Sloan said Greenwood, who also filmed a mob vandalising a police vehicle and was seen shouting racist and Islamophobic slurs, was ""revelling in the mayhem"". Shaun Routledge, defending, said his client was ""completely and utterly ashamed of his behaviour"". The judge condemned the pair for taking part in ""an orgy of mindless destruction, violence and disorder"". ""Those participating in mass disorder must expect severe sentences intended not only to punish but to deter others in copying their example,"" he added. Additional reporting by PA.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdkk5r9y3zo,Imam welcomes emergency security offer for mosques,"Qari Asim says Muslims in Leeds feel ""so anxious"" following protests in several towns and cities.",5 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Muslims have been ""heartened"" by the government's offer of emergency security for mosques following recent disorder in several towns and cities, an imam in Leeds has said. Mosques in Liverpool, Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Hastings were targeted by protesters after the fatal stabbing of three children in Southport last week.  On Sunday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that police and local authorities could ask for rapid security to be deployed if needed. Qari Asim, imam at Leeds Makkah Mosque, told the BBC: ""My community feels so anxious and deeply worried about their safety on the streets."" Mr Asim, who is also chairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, added: ""It is absolutely horrifying what happened. In this country we have mechanisms to deal with issues peacefully and democratically."" Mosques were considered by Muslims to be ""places of sanctuary"", so people should feel safe there, according to Mr Asim. The ""blatant Islamophobic slurs"" heard over the past few days from far-right groups were ""despicable and disgusting"", he said. The recent disorder followed the deaths in Southport on Monday 29 July of three girls aged six, seven and nine in a knife attack. False claims had spread online that the person responsible was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat and a Muslim. Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from the village of Banks in Lancashire, appeared in court last week charged with murdering the three girls. He was also charged with 10 counts of attempted murder after eight other children and two adults were seriously injured in the attack. In a statement on Sunday, the Home Office offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said ""rapid security"" deployment could be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible. According to the government, the extra security funding would be on top of the £24.9m already available as part of the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme.  Announcing the move, Ms Cooper said: “As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.” She added that anyone involved in violent disorder should expect to face the ""full force of the law"".  Mr Asim said Ms Cooper's announcement was ""welcome and heartening"" and the next step would be to roll out the scheme and determine who would benefit most from the funding.  He added that Britain was one of the most tolerant places in the world and praised its ""rich diversity"". ""But unfortunately some criminal thugs want to reverse the cycle of history and push the thinking that one race is superior to another. It goes against the grain of our country."" However, Mr Asim said that despite the unrest, people of all faiths had come together at the weekend to show solidarity, which proved ""we have a lot more in common than what divides us"". ""We need to listen to the legitimate concerns people have around immigration and start a dialogue,"" he said. ""But throwing bricks at mosques, attacking people of colour and chanting Islamophobic slurs is not the way forward and will not achieve anything except the full force of the law.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm23yl2kz7no,Humza Yousaf admits ending Greens deal was his mistake,The move led to the ex-first minister's resignation earlier this year as he faced motions of no confidence.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Former first minister Humza Yousaf has said terminating a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens was his mistake.  The move led to the ex-SNP leader’s resignation earlier this year as he faced motions of no confidence. Mr Yousaf told an LBC event at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe he was considering whether to continue as an MSP. He also said he could not say with ""certainty"" that his daughters would not be attacked because of the colour of their skin.  Mr Yousaf resigned as first minister in May as he faced motions of no confidence in him and his government. He said at the time he had ""underestimated"" the level of hurt caused by his decision to end a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens in April. The breakdown came after a Green backlash against the SNP government’s decision to row back on climate targets and gender policies. It left the SNP with a minority administration at Holyrood. Mr Yousaf said the relationship came under strain following an interview by Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie in which he says Mr Harvie refused to accept the Cass review into gender services for children in England was a scientific document. The former first minster said ordinarily ""reasonable, supportive"" people in his party -and not only the “usual malcontents” - told him that Mr Harvie's comments had made the Bute House Agreement “very difficult to sustain”. Mr Yousaf then used an expletive to take full blame for the decision to end the deal with the Greens, adding: ""It was my choice.” He said he had calculated his administration could fend off opposition votes of no confidence with the support of Alba MSP Ash Regan. He told the Edinburgh event that deal became “impossible” when Alba leader and former first minister Alex Salmond proposed an electoral pact with the SNP. “There was no way I was going to play a part in rehabilitating Alex Salmond in the political bubble,” he said. He then said: “I could have done a deal (with Alba) that went against my principles, that would have saved my skin. “It would have got me the votes I needed but I wasn’t going to do that.” A spokesperson for the Alba Party said: ""There was no reference to an electoral pact in the proposals that would have saved Humza’s job - he knows that because he described them as sensible at the time."" Asked about the SNP's heavy general election defeat to Scottish Labour, Mr Yousaf said he accepted an “element of responsibility”. He said that he was not dealt “the easiest hand” after taking over from Nicola Sturgeon in March 2023. “I think anybody who was a past leader of the SNP in recent years has got to reflect very seriously,"" he added.  Asked if he would consider running for first minister again, the 39-year-old replied: “No.” He said he did not know if he would stand to be an MSP in the 2026 Holyrood election, telling LBC: “I’ll make that decision probably next year.” Mr Yousaf, Scotland's first ethnic minority leader, said earlier this week he had questioned whether he and his family have a future in Scotland or the UK due to Islamophobia. It came after violent riots in other parts of the UK.  He said: “Scotland has not had race riots and long may that continue but let’s not pretend Scotland doesn’t have racism and Islamophobia.  ""In fact, people in Scotland have been charged on numerous occasions and found guilty of racism, death threats, Islamophobia against me.""  Mr Yousaf said he was not planning on leaving Scotland but that he and other Muslim people he had spoken to were considering their futures.  He added: “Could I say that my daughters would be safe as people of colour, as Muslims? ""If the girls choose to wear a hijab in the future could I say that they won’t get attacked because of the colour of their skin, or because of their faith? I can’t say that with any certainty.” Mr Yousaf also branded Elon Musk “one of the most dangerous men on the planet”. The billionaire owner has been highly critical of the UK authorities and the way the disorder has been handled. He has come under fire for promoting a conspiracy theory about the UK building ""detainment camps"" on the Falkland Islands for rioters. He later deleted the image from his page. Posted by the co-leader of the far-right Britain First party, the image was faked to look like it had come from the Daily Telegraph website.  Mr Musk has not acknowledged he published then deleted the post. The BBC has approached X for comment. Mr Yousaf accused the tech entrepreneur of ""using his wealth to amplify the far right""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjz9e9yl6o,Tory blasts Senedd leader's abolish stunt,"Andrew RT Davies warned against going down ""blind alley"" in trying to debate whether to scrap Senedd.",11 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader has been warned against going down a ""blind alley"" of trying to debate the abolition of the Welsh Parliament. Andrew RT Davies took to X, formerly Twitter, to say that he raised the issue at the Vale of Glamorgan agricultural show as he was ""keen to find out people's views"". But Tory peer Nick Bourne, a former leader of the party in Wales and a member of the then Welsh Assembly, said there were ""very many good things about devolved politics"". While the abolition of the Senedd is not a policy of the Conservatives, Mr Davies said he was keen to find out people's views.  ""Once the vote was taken over 25 years ago, we determined that the correct approach was to make the assembly work, now the Senedd, for the good of the people of Wales,"" said Lord Bourne on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme.  ""That remains very much the position. I don't understand why we're going down this blind alley. ""It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me."" Earlier in the week, Mr Davies shared a photo on X from the Vale of Glamorgan Show, showing how people were being asked to drop a ball into one of two buckets to highlight whether they wanted to abolish the Senedd or not, which he admitted was an ""unscientific poll"". Responding to criticism on X, Mr Davies said: ""We're just keen to find out people's views. It's important to find out what people think."" Lord Bourne also questioned why Mr Davies had raised an issue of the availability of  non halal food in Welsh schools, prompting the Welsh Tory leader to be accused of engaging in ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by the Muslim Council of Wales. Lord Bourne said: ""We do have to make clear that we're a one nation party."" In response, Mr Davies said: ""Welsh Conservatives stand against all forms of racism, including anti-Muslim hatred. ""Representations from across Wales have been made to me about the availability of non-halal meat in schools. ""These are legitimate queries and I make no apologies for taking them forward. ""It is important to have these discussions in a measured way and we will continue to do so."" Lord Bourne called for Conservative Members of the Senedd (MSs) to have a group meeting to discuss its ""one nation"" stance despite Welsh Parliament being in recess. He went on to say that his party's ""focus should be how are we going to make things better for the people of Wales"" after the Conservative general election wipe-out in Wales and with the Reform party setting their sights on the Senedd elections in 2026. ""I think there's a great danger of talking Reform up,"" he added.  ""We've had UKIP before, and they were represented in the Senedd previously, and then it fizzled out. ""The exposure that Reform is going to get now that they've got elected politicians in Westminster may well show what a busted flush they are. ""We're not that party.  ""We're a party of the moderate right, and that should be reflected in the way we approach politics in Wales."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gx010pk7no,"Welsh Tory 'race-baiting', says Muslim group",Muslim Council of Wales criticises Andrew RT Davies over article he wrote on halal meat in schools.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Welsh Conservative Senedd leader has been accused of engaging in ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by a Muslim group. Andrew RT Davies wrote ""children should not be forced to eat halal school lunches"", in an article for GB News, after a constituent alleged she was told non-halal meat was not available at her daughter's school in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan. The school said on social media ""the statement that all meat options are halal only is incorrect"". The Muslim Council of Wales has accused Mr Davies' of ""ham-fisted attempts at dog-whistle racism"" which have ""real consequences on our streets"". Mr Davies has said he ""entirely"" rejects the criticism. The article was posted on X, formerly Twitter, by controversial far-right activist and convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and was widely shared. In the GB News article, Mr Davies said: ""Children shouldn’t be forced to have to eat halal school lunches, but in the era of conformity, this common sense call is derided."" The Muslim Council of Wales has released a strongly-worded response, saying: ""Andrew RT Davies is engaging in Islamophobic race-baiting, at a time when we require politicians to be the voice of reason and show moral leadership."" It added: ""The ham-fisted attempts at dog-whistle racism may lead to more engagement online for Mr Davies, but have real consequences on our streets and in our mosques."" ""Many Muslim children face bullying and discrimination in schools, and Mr Davies' public and misleading campaign on halal meat will undoubtedly have an impact on returning Muslim pupils in September."" South Wales East Senedd member Natasha Asghar, a member of Mr Davies' shadow cabinet, told BBC Wales she had raised concerns with him. She is one of two Muslims in the Conservative group in Cardiff Bay. ""As a member of the Conservative Party since 2010, I can categorically say that the party is not Islamophobic,"" she said. ""Anybody with any concerns of any kind can reach out to myself or any other members of the Senedd, we are not inapproachable.  ""Right now I am striving for peace and on working tirelessly to create community cohesion and peace on our streets for everyone."" In a statement, Mr Davies said he had contacted the local authority on behalf of his constituent asking for assurances that the choice of a non-halal meat option would be provided. ""These were legitimate questions and as an elected member, I fulfilled my responsibilities by asking them,"" he said. ""Attempts to equate those legitimate concerns with the disorder we’ve seen on our streets is particularly irresponsible. ""Just as the thuggery we’ve seen cannot be justified by legitimate concerns on political issues, those same concerns must not be ignored by political leaders. ""Doing so risks leaving the field clear for extremists to exploit for their own, dangerous ends."" He added: ""For my part, I will continue to engage with a broad range of individuals and organisations across all religious and community groups. ""This includes the Sikh constituents who welcomed the clarification I sought on school meals, as for religious reasons Sikhs cannot consume meat that has been ritually slaughtered. ""As a politician it is my job to take forward concerns raised by constituents, and I will continue to do so."" Some members of the Conservative Senedd group have expressed concerns privately about Mr Davies' social media posts. One said his posts were becoming increasingly ""difficult to defend"", adding that if things continue as they are then his position would become “untenable” and he could face a leadership challenge. It follows a post this week asking whether the Senedd should be abolished? Several senior party Senedd members, past and present, disagreed publicly with the post and asked why the question was being posed. Mr Davies's predecessor as leader, Paul Davies, said on X: ""The Conservative Party is clear - it is not party policy to abolish the Senedd so not sure why this question is even being asked."" Former group leader Lord Nick Bourne, said: ""It has NEVER been the policy of the Welsh Conservative Party to abolish the assembly/Senedd. Why pose this question?"" Senedd members Natasha Asghar and Tom Giffard also posted their disagreement. Despite widespread unhappiness within the Senedd group, it is not thought that a challenge to his leadership is imminent, largely because there is no obvious candidate to replace him."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cred8770008o,Swinney condemns Musk over racism row with Yousaf,"Scotland's first minister defended his predecessor, who has traded accusations with the billionaire owner of X.",12 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Scotland's first minister has described Elon Musk's behaviour as ""completely and utterly unacceptable” after the billionaire owner of X branded Humza Yousaf ""racist"" and a ""scumbag"".  John Swinney defended his predecessor, who has described Mr Musk as a ""race baiter"" and ""one of the most dangerous men on the planet”. The tech entrepreneur suggested he would welcome legal action from Mr Yousaf. The former first minister declined to speak to BBC Scotland.  However, Mr Swinney said his predecessor had faced racist and Islamophobic abuse for many years. “I think that’s why he has taken such a strong stance about the unacceptable conduct and content that we’ve heard from Elon Musk,"" the first minister told BBC Scotland. Following anti-immigrant riots in England and Northern Ireland in recent weeks, Mr Swinney echoed calls from regulator Ofcom for social media firms to urgently protect users from content likely to incite violence or hatred. Mr Musk has been highly critical of the UK authorities and the way the disorder has been handled. Mr Swinney said he had not received a response from X to a letter he had written to social media companies on the riots. “The conduct of Elon Musk is wholly unacceptable and the conduct of the social media company is just as unacceptable and needs to be tackled,"" he said.  The first minister said that while the riots had not spread north of the border, he wanted to ensure social media firms ""do not behave in a fashion that creates difficulties"" for communities in Scotland.  Mr Swinney was asked if the SNP or the Scottish government could step in to financially assist his predecessor in a possible legal case against Mr Musk, but said that was a matter for Mr Yousaf.  The most recent spat between Mr Musk and Mr Yousaf began last Thursday. Speaking at an event at the Edinburgh Festival, the former first minister branded the X owner “one of the most dangerous men on the planet”. “He is not accountable to anybody, he has vast wealth at his fingertips and disposal and he uses it for some of the most wicked evil I have seen,” he told LBC. Mr Yousaf accused Mr Musk of using his wealth to amplify the far right and white supremacists. After the ex-SNP leader made similar comments to CNN, Mr Musk described him as ""super, super racist"".  He posted on X: ""Scotland gave him everything and yet he loathes white people.” In the Sunday Mail, Mr Yousaf’s lawyer Aamer Anwar said the X owner had “effectively painted a target on Humza Yousaf’s back with his completely unacceptable, untrue and inflammatory comments”. The newspaper reported that Mr Yousaf had not ruled out legal action and was “considering all options”. Mr Yousaf also posted on X: “Elon Musk is a dangerous race baiter who must be held to account for his actions. “I can't think what it is that upsets him so much about a Brown, Muslim, progressive politician? But his billions won't stop me calling out his support for the far-right.” Mr Musk again responded online, claiming Mr Yousaf was ""obviously super racist against white people"".  ""I dare that scumbag to sue me,"" he said. ""Go ahead, make my day…” Mr Musk added: “Legal discovery will show that however big a racist he’s been in public communications, he is vastly worse in private communications.” This is not the first public spat between the pair. In October last year, while Mr Yousaf was first minister, Mr Musk branded him a “blatant racist”. The billionaire made the comment in response to an edited clip of a speech Mr Yousaf gave in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. The clip has once again been shared widely by right-wing accounts in recent days. A fact check by the Reuters news agency concluded that the clip misrepresented Mr Yousaf's comments by suggesting he had been arguing that Scotland contained too many white people – when he had been about racial injustice and a lack of people of colour in positions of power. Responding last year, Mr Yousaf’s spokesperson said Mr Musk should instead ""tackle racism and hatred that goes unchecked on the social media platform he owns""."

Andrew RT Davies has faced criticism over his remarks on halal meat, the future of the Senedd and inappropriate language from one of his MSs. He appeared to rule out suspending Laura Anne Jones, who used a racist slur to describe Chinese people in a WhatsApp chat.  Ms Jones has already been removed from Mr Davies's shadow cabinet pending a police investigation into her expenses. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Davies said none of his colleagues had suggested Ms Jones be suspended. ""I note that Laura Anne Jones has made a full and wholesome apology for the use of wholly inappropriate language. ""What do we do these days? Do we take people out and tar and feather them or do we accept an apology, understand that people learn the lessons from their mistake and move on?"" Conservative MSs are not due to meet as a group again until after the summer recess in September. But at least one is considering whether to ask for an emergency meeting before then. Some members of the Conservative Senedd group have expressed concerns privately about Mr Davies's social media posts. One said they were becoming increasingly ""difficult to defend"" and if things continued as they were then his position would be ""untenable"" and he could face a leadership challenge. In a separate row, Mr Davies was accused of ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by the Muslim Council of Wales over a GB News article he wrote. In it, he said children ""should not be forced to eat halal school lunches"", after a constituent alleged she was told non-halal meat was not available at her daughter's school in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan. The school said on social media: ""The statement that all meat options are halal only is incorrect."" Mr Davies said allegations of race-baiting were ""completely untrue"" and his concerns revolved around choice. Mr Davies has also been criticised by one of his predecessors, Lord Nick Bourne, after a post on social media in which he asked whether the Senedd should be abolished. He later clarified that abolishing the Welsh Parliament was was neither his nor his party's position. ""Do I feel challenged? Do I feel threatened? No of course I don't because I am a politician that engages with the public,"" Mr Davies said.  ""What is wrong with putting a question to people at an agricultural show when you're trying to engage with people as they go past your stand? ""If you want to engage with a group of society that do hold a view contrary to yours you pose a question and then you engage with them on a one-to-one basis."" Despite unhappiness within the Conservative Senedd group, it is not thought a leadership challenge is imminent, largely because there is no obvious replacement for Mr Davies."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0r82pg7lxo,Why is Elon Musk in a racism row with Scotland's ex-first minister?,"A long-running feud, sparked by a misleading video clip, has led to personal jibes and claims of racism.",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A spat between the world's richest person and the former first minister of Scotland has reignited in recent days - but the feud between Elon Musk and Humza Yousaf has been building for years. Tensions escalated over the weekend, when the billionaire X owner called he ex-SNP leader a racist ""scumbag"", claiming he ""loathes"" white people.  It came after Mr Yousaf had called Mr Musk a ""dangerous race baiter"" and ""one of the most dangerous men on the planet”. The tech entrepreneur has been widely criticised for his management of X, and for his own posts during recent far-right riots in England and Northern Ireland However, the origins of the row lie back in the pandemic summer of 2020, and are linked to the murder of George Floyd.   On 10 June 2020, the Scottish Parliament held a debate on showing solidarity with anti-racism demonstrations held in response to Mr Floyd's murder.  Mr Yousaf, the then justice secretary, told MSPs it was evident that Scotland had ""a problem of structural racism"". He said: ""At 99% of the meetings that I go to, I am the only non-white person in the room."" Mr Yousaf read out a list of senior positions - including the lord advocate, solicitor general and Police Scotland's chief constable - and, after each, added: ""white"". He said the same was true for every high court judge, every deputy chief constable, every assistant chief constable and every prison governor in Scotland. The then SNP minister also highlighted senior positions in the health sector and the trade union movement. ""That is a collective failure that includes every single one of us,"" he told MSPs. ""I hope that we are sitting uncomfortably, because those should be uncomfortable truths for us all."" An edited version of the lengthy speech was widely shared by right-wing accounts on social media. By October 2023, it had reached the attention of Mr Musk on X, which he had rebranded from Twitter three months earlier. He called Mr Yousaf - who had become the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party - a ""blatant racist"".  A fact check by the Reuters news agency concluded that the clip misrepresented Mr Yousaf's comments by suggesting he had been arguing that Scotland contained too many white people – when he had been complaining about racial injustice and a lack of people of colour in positions of power. Shortly afterwards, Mr Yousaf posted: ""Racists foaming at the mouth at my very existence."" He then added: ""Me:"" and shared a gif from the BBC comedy Still Game, featuring the character Navid dancing in his shop. The then first minister's spokesperson said Mr Yousaf had suffered racist abuse his whole life, adding: ""Mr Musk should use his position to tackle racism and hatred that goes unchecked on the social media platform he owns."" Tensions between the pair flared again following days of far-right violence in cities in England and Northern Ireland in recent weeks.  Mr Musk was highly critical of the UK authorities and the way the disorder has been handled. He suggested that ""civil war is inevitable"" and promoted a conspiracy theory that far-right agitators were treated more harshly than minority groups.  A spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""no justification"" for the comments.  Mr Musk and other social media owners have been urged by regulator Ofcom to protect users from content likely to incite violence or hatred. Mr Yousaf was asked about the tech businessman's intervention during an LBC event at the Edinburgh Festival last Thursday.  He branded the X owner “one of the most dangerous men on the planet”, adding: “He is not accountable to anybody, he has vast wealth at his fingertips and disposal and he uses it for some of the most wicked evil I have seen."" Mr Yousaf accused Mr Musk of using his wealth to amplify the far right and white supremacists. After the ex-SNP leader made similar comments to CNN, Mr Musk described him as ""super, super racist"". He posted on X: ""Scotland gave him everything and yet he loathes white people.” The row escalated further when it was reported Mr Yousaf could take legal action.  His lawyer, Aamer Anwar, told the Sunday Mail that Mr Musk had “effectively painted a target on Humza Yousaf’s back with his completely unacceptable, untrue and inflammatory comments”. Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf posted on X: “Elon Musk is a dangerous race baiter who must be held to account for his actions. “I can't think what it is that upsets him so much about a Brown, Muslim, progressive politician? But his billions won't stop me calling out his support for the far-right.” The tech entrepreneur responded by claiming Mr Yousaf was ""obviously super racist against white people"". ""I dare that scumbag to sue me,"" he posted. ""Go ahead, make my day…” Mr Musk added: “Legal discovery will show that however big a racist he’s been in public communications, he is vastly worse in private communications.” He did not elaborate on what that comment referred to.  Mr Yousaf has declined to speak to BBC Scotland about the issue, while Mr Musk very rarely gives interviews to media.  Having sacked about 80% of former Twitter staff following his takeover, Mr Musk announced last year that requests to X's media department would be met with an automatic response: a poo emoji.  The response now reads ""busy now, please check back later"". It seems likely that the war of words might continue to play out on X, or possibly in a court room. Whatever happens next, it is fair to say the pair's differences are nowhere near being resolved."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77lxyz7702o,Police Scotland could send officers to Northern Ireland after riots,"The chief constable in Northern Ireland asks for 120 officers, saying his staff are ""exhausted"" after several nights of riots.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Police Scotland is considering a request to send 120 officers to Northern Ireland following several nights of anti-immigration riots in Belfast and other parts of the UK. Jon Boutcher, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), said his officers were exhausted and could not “stand alone to deal with disorder like this any more”. Seventeen people were arrested and 11 of them have been charged following outbreaks of violence and disorder in Belfast. Police Scotland said it had received ""a number of requests for mutual aid"" from UK forces which would be balanced against policing needs in Scotland. Mr Boutcher said the PSNI needed support as it had been allowed to ""decay"" in recent years. ""Having those additional resources is vital to helping us be prepared for any future disorder,"" he added. Earlier, First Minister John Swinney said Scotland would remain vigilant following several nights of disturbances in England and Northern Ireland. He said violence and Islamophobia had ""no place"" in Scotland - which has so far avoided any outbreaks of disorder. Thousands of counter protesters took to the streets for peaceful rallies in towns and cities across England on Wednesday evening. Met Police chief Mark Rowley called it a ""very successful night"", saying the fears of extreme-right disorder were ""abated"". The National Police Coordination Centre, which provides support to forces across the UK, said it was considering a request from the Police Service in Northern Ireland (PSNI) for back-up from other forces. ""As a national service, Police Scotland has the ability to flex resources where the need is greatest in order to keep people safe,"" said a Police Scotland spokesperson. Anti-immigration violence in towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland over the weekend had led to more than 400 arrests.  This was sparked by misinformation over a fatal stabbing attack in Southport. Mr Swinney said Police Scotland had “comprehensive” plans in place to deal with any riots. He said the force had identified the possibility of anti-immigrant gatherings in Scotland, based on social media posts.  Mr Swinney said “thankfully” there had not been riots in Scotland, but added: “We have to remain vigilant because of the unacceptable conduct that's taking place."" He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: “I want everyone to remain vigilant because we have communities that are experiencing a great deal of fear and anxiety as a consequence of what they're observing in other parts of the United Kingdom.” He said Police Scotland had “formidable” resources that could be deployed flexibly across the country if required.  Mr Swinney said the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service could deliver “swift justice” under a strategy developed for the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, that had been revisited after the UK riots. Following a meeting with Chief Constable Jo Farrell in Edinburgh on Wednesday, he said there had been no requests for Police Scotland officers to be deployed south of the border to help deal with disorder. Earlier this week, former first minister Humza Yousaf said he had questioned whether he and his family have a future in Scotland or the UK due to Islamophobia.  Mr Swinney said his predecessor’s comments were illustrative of a “deep sense of anxiety” in Muslim communities.  After meeting faith leaders on Wednesday, he said both the Muslim and Jewish communities were feeling “acutely anxious”. And asked about the spread of disinformation about the riots, Mr Swinney said social media companies had “a lot of improvement to undertake in their conduct”. He echoed calls from regulator Ofcom for social media firms to urgently protect users from content likely to incite violence or hatred. The first minister said disinformation can be “profoundly dangerous”, citing false information spread about the stabbing of a woman in Stirling over the weekend. He said Police Scotland “did absolutely the right thing to stamp on that misinformation and we will continue to do that where that is required”. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told BBC Scotland News that the vast majority of people would look at recent events and be horrified by the acts of a ""far right thuggery"". Mr Sarwar called on social media companies to crack down on the spread of misinformation and ""allowing the far right to organise, to recruit, to amplify and in some cases to fundraise."" Asked whether this would infringe on the right to freedom of speech, he said: ""I’m all for freedom of speech but there is a responsibility that comes on these platforms too and allowing known mistruths to be spread is not freedom of speech."" Mr Sarwar said Scotland could not be complacent and must send the far right a ""strong message to say they are not welcome here"". Following social media speculation about far-right activity in the city, Glasgow Central Mosque said Police Scotland had confirmed there was no intelligence to suggest it would be targeted. In a statement, it said people should be vigilant but cautioned against alarm. “We urge everyone to be wary of what you read on social media, avoid speculation and not to share unverified information,” the mosque added. Reports of antisemitic incidents in the UK reached a record high in the first half of this year, according to figures from Jewish charity the Community Security Trust. In Scotland there were 40 incidents from January to June, compared to 14 in the first six months of 2023. A total of 22 of these incidents were in Glasgow. In their meeting with Mr Swinney on Wednesday, faith leaders agreed to work together to support vulnerable communities."

South Wales East Tory Senedd member Laura Anne Jones used the highly offensive term in an exchange about Chinese-owned video app TikTok. Ms Jones has apologised and issued a statement saying the word was ""unacceptable and I deeply regret using it"".  ""I sincerely apologise for any offence this has caused,"" she said. Warning: This story contains strong racist language Ms Jones' Senedd colleague, Tory MS Natasha Asghar said she was ""positively livid"" and ""embarrassed"" by Ms Jones' use of the racist term. Ms Asghar, who represents the same region as Ms Jones, added: ""Language like this is unacceptable at every level"". In the meantime two Conservative MSs have told BBC Wales that Ms Jones should lose the whip and be removed from the Conservative group. The Welsh Conservative Party has declined to comment. Ms Jones has represented South Wales East for the Tories in the Senedd since July 2020. But in June she was stripped of her position as the party's culture spokesperson, after texts from her phone appeared to show an employee was asked to maximise expenses claims. In the WhatsApp exchange about TikTok, first revealed by the news website Nation.Cymru, a message from Ms Jones says: ""No chinky spies for me!"" It is unclear when the message was sent. The apology from Ms Jones comes after the Conservative Senedd leader has been accused of engaging in ""Islamophobic race-baiting"" by a Muslim group. The Muslim Council of Wales has criticised Andrew RT Davies over an article he wrote about halal meat in schools. He has said he ""entirely"" rejects the criticism. Plaid Cymru said the language used in the WhatsApp conversation was ""vile"" and ""completely unacceptable,"" calling on the Conservative group in the Senedd to ""reflect on their recent behaviour and understand that their actions and words have consequences"". Ms Jones has been the subject of a police investigation over expenses allegations, which saw her removed from the shadow cabinet. One message about her expenses saw her ask a staff member: ""When doing petrol thing - always make more than I did – add in stuff please OK"". The context for the WhatsApp messages regarding her expenses was not evident. A solicitor on her behalf said at the time: ""Ms Jones is satisfied that any allegations in relation to impropriety surrounding expenses are entirely misconceived"". She remains a member of the Conservative group in Cardiff Bay."

The demos were in response to violence across England and Northern Ireland fuelled by far-right and anti-immigration sentiment. Thousands of police were deployed across the country poised for more than 100 possible events expected on Saturday.  All rallies were reported to be peaceful and one protester, Rachel Collins, said it was ""important to spread a message of love and kindness and inclusivity"". Ms Collins, who attended the rally in Southampton with about 250 other people, said: ""It's important that we really focus on being kind and polite to people of all societies rather than just our own.  ""[Southampton] feels like an inclusive place; it felt like that on Wednesday when everyone turned up; it feels like it today."" Retired academic Prof Ademuni-Odeke said he arrived in the UK as a refugee from Uganda in the 1970s after violence erupted during Idi Amin's dictatorship. ""This country is very welcoming to refugees and migrants and other people who have contributed,"" he said. ""I came to this country myself as a refugee and because I was welcomed here, I was allowed to go to school and become a professor in this country.  ""It's very important that this country remains the same."" In Weymouth, about 50 people attended a rally organised by Stand Up To Racism Dorset and other local anti-racism groups.  Two Dorset Police officers attended. Bishop Angie McLachlan, who belongs to the Liberal Catholic Church International, said: ""I'm here because I passionately feel that everything I stand for is being said today."" She added: ""I really cannot understand how anybody feels that racism and discrimination on any level is appropriate, kind, nice or even helpful to our country or our world at the moment and so I feel I have to be here in order to represent solidarity."" Candy Udwin, the joint secretary of Stand Up to Racism Dorset said the gathering sent a ""positive message that anti-racists will not stand for those horrible scenes of violence and hatred and division that we saw on the streets of Britain and Weymouth last week"". Luke Philpott said he attended his first rally in Oxford after being upset by the violence over recent weeks. He said: ""I have been really staggered by the fascism on the streets over the last week and really upset by it - from the point of view of someone who loves my country and doesn't want to see it taken over by what I believe is a small minority of people who feel this way about others.""

Jane, not her real name, says rising Islamophobia means parents are afraid to bring their children to play parks during the summer holidays. Similar fears have been expressed by a Nigeria-born community worker in Belfast, Israel Eguaogie. He said a summer scheme in the city had to be cancelled for security reasons. There have been a series of racially-motivated attacks and violent disorder since Saturday, following an anti-immigration protest in Belfast. Jane, who wears a hijab, told BBC News NI nowhere felt safe any more. “The prominent narrative has been against Muslims but it’s also people who are visibly different,"" she said. “Visible minorities - whether that’s black families, Asian families, anyone with a different skin colour, different accent - I think are thinking twice today about where they’re going to take their children … even to the park. “Even in the small regional towns that we haven’t heard so much about there’s been added graffiti, there’s been things said, there’s been maybe comments made that have just made people a little concerned … is there anywhere safe in Northern Ireland?"" Jane said some families were considering moving to Scotland, Wales or parts of England where there has not been unrest in recent days. She said there had been an escalation in racism in Northern Ireland in recent months, not just the past week. At the same time, she said she had been encouraged by offers of support. ""Don’t underestimate the small gestures, the people who have sent messages just saying: ‘I hope you’re safe, I hope your family are safe', offering to go to the shops with someone if they don’t feel safe,"" she said. “Those neighbourly, beautiful moments.  ""They mean a lot in a period like now.” Mr Eguaogie is involved with a number of organisations including Belfast City of Sanctuary and Diverse Youth NI, and has been in Northern Ireland for 14 years. He said the recent trouble had been “absolutely disgraceful” and “shocking”. “It has put everybody including myself in a state of fear and panic where people do not know what else to do,” he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra. “You have lived in a community for quite a long time that has been very peaceful and welcoming and all of a sudden your door is smashed in, that’s shocking.” He said a number of activities planned for young people from ethnic minorities had had to be cancelled. “We have had to reassure parents, please keep your children at home and Muslim women should stay at home because they are a target because of the hijab,” he added. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister said people involved in recent disorder in Northern Ireland were ""causing destruction to their own communities"". The Democratic Unionist Party Emma Little-Pengelly told reporters at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine that nothing was achieved by violence.  Police have made a number of arrests since the weekend. There has been widespread disorder across the UK - which erupted after the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport - with unrest fuelled by misinformation online."

They said it was completely unacceptable that far-right extremists ""feel emboldened to terrorise our streets, places of worship, asylum and refugee centres."" Anyone planning to take part in counter-protests has been urged not to wear face coverings, as they can suggest people are looking for trouble. Leaders of mosques in the city are also asking Muslims to be mindful of misinformation and fake news on social media platforms. There have been a number of disturbances in recent days, including in the Bordesley Green area, as well as groups gathering outside outside a mosque in Solihull.  In eight-point guidance issued by the mosques, they urge the community to show patience and restraint, and allow West Midlands Police do its job. ""Be responsible and conduct yourselves in the best of manner that epitomises our faith,"" state the leaders, warning against falling for ""bait"" shared on social media. Wait for verified information before ""reacting in a lawful manner"" or sharing news, they stressed. On Monday, a pub was attacked after rumours a far-right group was inside, with community activists later apologising to the venue. People considering getting involved in counter-protests should not wear balaclavas as they ""only portray negative connotations and cause aggravation."" There is no need to hide your face if your ""sincere intention is to protect and defend,"" added the statement.

A petrol bomb was thrown towards the centre on Greenwell Street on Saturday morning, while graffiti was written on the wall. It is one of a number of racially-motivated hate crimes being investigated by police across Northern Ireland over the past week. Abdul Rob said four generations of his family have used the centre. Cars were also set alight in Tavanagh Street and Sandhurst Gardens in Belfast in separate attacks. It follows a week of sporadic disorder which saw rioters attack police at various sites in Belfast and several members of the public reported they had been assaulted.  Thirty-four people have been arrested. On Friday night, the rear door of a restaurant on Ormeau Road was also kicked and racial slurs shouted to the workers inside. Speaking to BBC News NI on Saturday, Abdul Rob said his community is ""not going to leave"". ""This is our country, we’re going to stay there, why are we going to go,"" he said.  Strangford MP Jim Shannon condemned the ""heinous attack"". ""This attack is on, people, our neighbours, who live, work and school their children here, who work in the NHS, local shops and are a part of our community,"" he said in a social media post. ""It is unacceptable."" SDLP MP Claire Hanna said an attack on a place of worship is ""beneath and below contempt"" and that it would ""not be tolerated"". Speaking at the United Against Racism rally in Belfast, she added she hopes those responsible feel ""the full force of the law"". Sinn Féin assembly member Deirdre Hargey described the attack on the mosque as ""disheartening"". ""We need to show that if they carry out these actions then we will go after them,"" she continued. A statement from the Islamic Centres of Northern Ireland condemned the ""mindless Islamophobic and hate attack"" on the Newtownards mosque on Saturday. ""We know that those perpetrators represent only a small minority of individuals with a far right agenda which is detrimental to the prosperity of Northern Ireland,"" it added. The statement also thanked the community for the ""overwhelming support"" members have received and praised those who turned out to anti-racism rallies held in Belfast and Londonderry over recent days. A number of anti-racist rallies have been held following days of sporadic disorder. One man was seriously injured when  attackers stamped on his head during an assault in the Donegall Road/Oban Street area on Monday night. A number of family homes and businesses were damaged. These including an estate agency on Woodvale Road which was rammed by a gang in a hijacked car. People from ethnic minorities who have made Northern Ireland their home have spoken out about their fear of being targeted during the violence.  A trustee of the Belfast Multi-Cultural Association (BMCA) said on Friday that his own family had not left the house for a week.   In anticipation of the possibility of further disorder this weekend, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) cancelled leave and asked officers to work on rest days.  The PSNI is also receiving support from Police Scotland which is to send 120 officers to Belfast to help quell the threat of violence.  This article was amended on 27 August 2024 to include comments made at the time by the member of parliament for Strangford."

Sabir Zazai told BBC Scotland News that some people in communities his organisation works with were scared to go out.  The BBC understands some groups have planned protests and counter protests north of the border in the coming weeks.  Police Scotland said any disorder will be ""identified quickly"" and ""responded to immediately"". The force dismissed speculation of a protest in Glasgow's George Square earlier.  Mr Zazai spoke following a meeting with faith leaders and First Minister John Swinney at Bute House.  On Tuesday, former First Minister Humza Yousaf, who is of Muslim faith, said he questions whether he and his family have a future in Scotland or the UK due to Islamophobia.  Mr Zazai said there was “lots of anxiety and uncertainty” among communities the Scottish Refugee Council works with.  “These people are fearful already, they have fled dreadful situations,"" he said.  ""We don’t want them to be retraumatised.” The charity chief said Scotland was “fortunate” not to have seen riots but warned “nowhere is immune to racism”.  He told BBC Scotland News: “Yesterday we had somebody living in an asylum hotel saying should I stay in the hotel or should I leave? “We've had other people worried about their wellbeing, people not being able to travel to their appointments with their lawyers or getting advice from us and others. “This should all be avoided and that shouldn't happen, people should not feel that insecurity and fear in our streets."" Counter demonstrations in Scotland have been organised after far-right activist Tommy Robinson posted about a ""pro-UK"" rally to be held in Glasgow's George Square next month. The English Defence League founder, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had earlier promoted false claims about the Southport attacker. Mr Zazai said that misinformation about the violent riots ""is damaging to everyone"".  The Muslim Council of Scotland said it has ""full trust"" that police protection in Scotland is strong enough following disorder elsewhere.  Mr Swinney said he was “very concerned” about the riots in other parts of the UK. After meeting with faith leaders and Scottish political party chiefs, the first minister said they wanted to send a message of solidarity, adding: “Violence plays no part in our society, that the Islamophobia that we’ve seen has no place in our society and that we’ve got to stand together in representing cohesive communities in Scotland.” Mr Swinney also met with Chief Constable Jo Farrell and Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie in Edinburgh. Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said they understood the disorder in other parts of the UK was causing concern and the force is running ""enhanced patrols and direct engagement"" to provide reassurance to communities. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure any potential for violence or disorder in Scotland is identified quickly and responded to immediately,"" he said.  ""We are aware of a number of potential protests, and counter protests, over the coming weeks, which will be policed appropriately but we are not going to speculate on or add publicity to individual potential events. ""I would also encourage everyone to be responsible in their use of social media and not to share speculation or inaccurate information."" More than 400 people have been arrested, and 100 have now been charged, in connection with violent scenes in towns and cities such as Rotherham, Middlesbrough and Bolton over the weekend. There has been further disorder in London, Plymouth and Belfast.  In Tamworth, Staffordshire, a hotel used to house people in the asylum system was targeted by rioters using petrol bombs and fireworks.  The violence followed  the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport. Subsequent unrest has been fuelled by online misinformation relating to the attacker."

The complaints are focused on two controversial interviews in the same episode. There were accusations of a conflict of interest, after presenter Ed Balls interviewed his wife, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. And there was criticism of how Balls and co-host Kate Garraway questioned Coventry South MP Zarah Sultana. ITV said it considered its interviews to be ""balanced, fair and duly impartial"". An Ofcom spokesperson said: ""We are assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate."" Both interviews related to the wave of violent unrest that has broken out in parts of the UK over the past week. Following the interview with Cooper, Deadline reporter Jake Kanter said it was ""baffling it was allowed to happen"", while other viewers described the dynamic of the interview as ""absurd"" and ""untenable"". Balls, a former Labour minister, is now a regular GMB presenter; Cooper, his wife, was appointed home secretary following the general election last month. They have been married since 1998. In an earlier debate on the programme on Monday, there was a testy interview with Balls, Garraway and Sultana, the Independent MP for Coventry South. In the item, Sultana, who previously sat as a Labour MP before she had the whip suspended in July, said the government should describe the riots as Islamophobic as well as racist, and challenged Balls on an article he had previously written about immigration. Writing afterwards on X, she said: ""The sneering contempt of 'journalists' will never stop me from calling out racism and Islamophobic hate."" After the number of complaints to Ofcom was published on Wednesday, she posted: ""I appreciate the solidarity so much."" Following Monday's episode, an ITV spokesperson said: ""Following a weekend of rioting and national unrest, GMB featured a range of interviews and discussion around this national emergency on today’s programme. ""[These] included James Cleverly, Shadow Home Secretary and Yvette Cooper, Home Secretary. ""We are satisfied that these interviews were balanced, fair and duly impartial."""

Organisers said it was held to show solidarity with the migrant community of the north west in response to some of the violent scenes seen in Belfast and some areas in England in recent days. There have been no such violent scenes in Northern Ireland's north west. Derry City and Strabane District Mayor Lilian Seenoi-Barr, who is originally from Kenya and is Northern Ireland's first black mayor, was among those who addressed the crowd. The event was organised by United Against Racism Derry, as well as organisations such as the North West Islamic Association. Organiser Davy McAuley said it was great to see such a large turn-out in support of people who have come from all over the world to live in Derry. ""This is a city united against racism,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme. ""Events such as these are important because Derry has a rich history of standing up for people, this is a city of civil rights. ""When our friends and neighbours feel threatened, we want to tell people that we won't stand for this and it won't be tolerated."" Lilian Seenoi-Barr told the crowd that migrants, many of whom had fled persecution and war, should be made to feel welcome.  Ms Seenoi-Barr said she was deeply concerned by the ""escalating hate crimes, Islamophobia and racism on the island of Ireland"". She said she had met senior police officers, politicians and statutory agencies to reassure communities across Northern Ireland that everything is being done to make them feel safe. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the rally passed off peacefully and without incident. However, after the rally finished, police intercepted a number of individuals, some with their faces covered, on Magazine Street who were setting off smoke bombs.  The police said these individuals dispersed when officers intervened.  They said enquiries were ongoing and video footage would be reviewed. No injuries were reported and no arrests were made."

Police Scotland said any disorder will be ""identified quickly"" and ""responded to immediately"". Speaking to the News Agents podcast, Mr Yousaf said he was ""as Scottish as they come"" but he didn't know if he saw a future here for his wife and three children. The MSP for Glasgow Pollok said: ""I was born in Scotland, raised in Scotland, educated in Scotland, just welcomed my third child here in Scotland. Was leader of the Scottish government for just over a year, leader of the Scottish National Party.

He said he had been concerned about the rise of Islamophobia for some time. ""We are now seeing the culmination of not years, actually decades of anti-migrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric being normalised in our political discourse now playing out in the most violent way possible,"" he added. Mr Yousaf became the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party when he became first minister in March 2023. Police responded to violent scenes in towns and cities such as Rotherham, Middlesbrough and Bolton over the weekend. Disorder also occurred in Plymouth and Belfast on Monday. More than 400 people have been arrested in connection with the disorder and 100 have so far been charged. The disorder follows the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport. Subsequent unrest has been fuelled by misinformation online relating to the attacker. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned the violence, telling ministers: ""It is violent disorder and needs to be treated as such, as criminal activity.""

Thousands of counter-protesters have taken to the streets in towns and cities across the UK after rumours that far-right organised gatherings would target immigration centres and mosques. Haddi Malik, 25, joined a peaceful march in Accrington, Lancashire, walking between two mosques in the town to counter a potential right-wing march.  Mr Malik told the BBC it was a ""massive"" moment when pubgoers came up to some of the people marching and began hugging them.  ""We went to go and support the mosque that was under threat of violence,"" he said.  He said around 300 of the group gathered outside the Raza Jamia Masjid mosque before peacefully marching across town. Mr Malik said: ""We reflected on the history of the town, how South Asians, white people and Muslims have lived side-by-side there for decades."" In a video posted on X, patrons of a pub on Blackburn Road came out and embraced some of the group.  ""There were a few shouts of ‘respect’ which was fantastic, we need to see unity to stop all this far-right violence,"" Mr Malik said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l8pk0964no,Two men jailed after fight at Leeds protests,"Sameer Ali and Adnan Ghafoor, from Leeds, are jailed for their role in a fight following a protest.",9 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Two men from Leeds have been jailed after pleading guilty to affray following a protest. Sameer Ali, of West Park Drive, West Park, and Adnan Ghafoor, of Spen Bank, West Park, were sentenced at Leeds Crown Court on Friday. The offences took place following an anti-immigration protest and a counter- demonstration in Leeds city centre on 3 August. Ali, 21, was jailed for 20 months, while Ghafoor, 31, received a two-and-a-half-year sentence after the court heard he had breached a suspended sentence for driving offences. Ali and Ghafoor, who were not known to each other, had been walking in a group of about 17 people at about 16:40 BST after leaving the Headrow following the demonstrations outside Leeds Art Gallery. As they were walking, they encountered a group of four men on Great George Street, two of whom were draped in Union Jack flags while a third was wearing a Union Jack mask. Ali's solicitor, Graham O'Sullivan, said his client claimed a fight started when racist comments were made by one of the four men. CCTV footage played to the court showed Ali punching two of them before grabbing another man's flag and attacking him. He then returned to the other men and continued to attack them. Prosecutor Heather Gilmour said Ali played a ""leading role"" in the violence, while Ghafoor had hit one member of the group three times when he was in a chokehold. Defending Ali, Mr O'Sullivan said his client, who had no previous convictions, was ""provoked in this case by Islamophobic threats and abuse"". Ali appeared in court via video link from HMP Lincoln. He showed no emotion throughout the hearing. Mr O'Sullivan said his client ""recognises that what he did was very wrong"" and said the backdrop to the offence, amid recent heightened racial tensions throughout the UK, ""gives some explanation as to how he would behave this way, so out of character"". The Recorder of Leeds, His Honour Judge Guy Kearl, said it was not clear to him which group instigated the conflict. He told Ali: ""You walked away down the centre of the road, laughing and congratulating yourself and others in your group, turning towards those whom you had attacked with your arms out wide as you left through the traffic, which had stopped as a result of the disorder."" The court heard Ghafoor, a personal trainer, had two previous convictions for racially or religiously aggravated common assault and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. In April, he was given a 20-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for dangerous driving. His solicitor, Frances Penchton, said her client, who has an 18-month-old child, ""simply allowed himself to get caught up in a situation which unfolded and ended within 30 seconds"". His behaviour had been ""a short-lived moment of madness"", she added. Both men handed themselves in to police on Monday. Judge Kearl said Ghafoor had ""targeted a male who was being restrained by others and aimed punches at his head and body"". ""You then walked off, waving to the white males, inviting further confrontation,"" he added. Judge Kearl said Ali and Ghafoor's actions contributed to ""a heightened state of public concern and anxiety"". He told the court: ""Given the nationwide context of the violence and in order to provide punishment and deterrence in accordance with the overarching principles of sentencing, severe sentences will follow for those found to have participated in incidents of violence."" Meanwhile, another man was jailed for eight months at Leeds Crown Court on Friday after pleading guilty to using threatening or abusive words or behaviour with intent to cause alarm or distress at the same protest. The court heart that Jordan Plain, 30, from Horsforth, had made monkey noises and other racist gestures towards Sarata Sawo. In a victim impact statement, Ms Sawo told the court: ""Many people have defended Jordan for what he did to me and said it was right. It was not right. ""I was born in Leeds and I have lived here my whole life. It's such a beautiful, diverse city.  ""I don't even feel welcome in my own home. I don't even feel safe in my own house or area."" Ms Sawo, a full-time student, said she had taken time off work because of the impact of the incident. Plain, who the court heard had an eight-year-old child with a woman of mixed-race heritage, had been in attendance at an English Defence League protest on Saturday, Ms Gilmour said.  He had numerous previous convictions, including for racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage and fear or provocation of violence, the court was told. A probation officer said Plain had been drinking on the day of the protest and had been ""binge drinking"" while unemployed and in receipt of state benefits, having previously worked as a roofer. He had told a probation interview he was ""ashamed"" of his behaviour and added: ""I don't want to make any excuses for what I have done."" Defending, Mike Walsh said his client had shown ""genuine remorse, not just because he's finding himself in custody"". Judge Kearl told Plain: ""Given the context in which this incident occurred and the sustained nature of your conduct, which was designed to stir up racial hatred at a time of heightened social tension, an immediate custodial sentence cannot be avoided."" Like Ali and Ghafoor, he was told he must serve half of his sentence before he could be released on licence.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2r3lxzedo,'I thought days of race hatred were over' - Riots take British Asians back to 1970s,Scenes from the past week in England and Northern Ireland have sparked painful memories among British Asians who remember the 1970s and 80s.,10 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Mosques attacked with bricks and stones. Marchers chanting “we want our country back.” And a man’s head reportedly stamped on during a racist attack. These scenes from the past week in England and Northern Ireland have sparked painful memories among British Asians who remember the 1970s and 80s, when racist violence was widespread and the National Front was on the rise. Harish Patel, in his 70s, says it broke his heart. He says teenagers will have heard from their parents and grandparents about what life could be like in this country. “They’ll have thought it was all over. And now they are experiencing it for themselves.” The disorder was triggered by the fatal stabbing of three young girls in Southport - followed by false speculation that the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker. It sent a thunderbolt of fear down Asian and minority communities. Mungra, an elderly Asian woman who arrived from Kenya 50 years ago, was taken back to her early days in London. She worried the escalating violence would make it too frightening to get milk from the corner shop. “That’s how we felt in those days, and I worry.” Tens of thousands of South Asians came to work in the the UK's factories and public services in the 1950s, as the country rebuilt its post-war economy. By the early 1970s, the population had grown to around half a million - because of family reunions and Asians fleeing East Africa, many of whom had been expelled from Uganda. Immigration became a politically charged issue. In 1968, Conservative MP Enoch Powell had given his explosive “rivers of blood” speech, in which he said that by permitting mass immigration, the country was “heaping up its own funeral pyre”. The extreme right-wing National Front was at its most vocal and regularly held rallies. Asians had to contend with day-to-day harassment and police brutality. “The climate and fear of racism was so profound that it was hard to ignore that I was of coloured skin,” Mungra says. “It was the usual name-calling when walking on the street, the p-word.“ Mungra witnessed the riots in Southall, a predominantly Asian part of west London. They took place in 1979, three years after the racist murder of local Sikh teenager Gurdip Singh Chaggar. Weeks before a general election, the National Front decided to hold a meeting in Southall's town hall. Thousands - mainly Asians, but also anti-racist allies - took to the streets in protest against the far-right and police brutality. Forty were injured, including 21 police, 300 were arrested and a teacher was killed, probably by an officer who struck a fatal blow, according to a Met Police report. These were brutal times which left a lasting trauma on those who lived through them. And they bring me back to my own childhood. I was only a toddler when a lit firework was put through the letterbox of my parents’ home in Hampshire. Our neighbours didn’t like Asians living on the street. My mum recalls grabbing my brother - a hyperactive child a few years older than me - as he ran towards the front door. She was shaking for hours afterwards. She’ll never forget how frightened she felt in that moment. It happened months after the p-word was scrawled on our garage door. We were living with my Gujarati sari-wearing grandmother at the time, and my parents felt incredibly vulnerable. They felt they were being targeted for looking different when all they were doing was trying to live a happy life in 1980s Britain. We moved shortly afterwards. It’s striking that decades later, I’ve heard Asians - including members of my own family - saying they were again scared to leave their homes. Nervously tugging his fingers, Iqbal, a father from Bolton in his 50s, told me he was terrified and that his children had told him to not go outside. “I thought these days of race hatred were over,” he said. Over the seven days of riots, hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked, minority-owned businesses were looted and cars and buildings set alight. More than 400 arrests were made. Muslims were particularly targeted - with missiles hurled at mosques, Islamophobic chants and Muslim gravestones in Burnley vandalised. Police patrols were ramped up, but some younger people said they didn’t trust officers to protect them. “We don’t feel like they’ve got our back when they haven’t protected us so far. We feel vulnerable and feel like we’ve got to protect ourselves,” said Mohammad, in his 20s. But Wednesday felt like a turning point. As communities braced for a night of disorder, after names and addresses of immigration lawyers were spread online, the unrest largely failed to materialise. Instead, thousands of anti-racism protesters rallied in cities and towns across England. People chanted “racism off our streets”. In Accrington, Lancashire, Muslim anti-fascist protesters who went to protect a local mosque were embraced by pubgoers, in a “massive” moment of unity. ""There were a few shouts of ‘respect’ which was fantastic; we need to see unity to stop all this far-right violence,"" said Haddi Malik, who was in the group. The show of force has offered people a moment of hope and courage, and a sense of relief. But the ripples of intimidation haven’t yet settled. Some have been left wondering whether they’re really accepted in this country. “I don’t want to be made to feel like that,” says 20-year-old Muslim Hamza Moriss. “I’m a part of this country as much as they are.” Meanwhile, Mungra feels a deep sense of unease. “The last week has made me think that not much has really changed, that racism is still very much alive and we won’t ever actually be seen as the same… not really.” Top image shows a damaged shop on The Broadway in Southall following rioting in the area, taken on 4 July 1981."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ggw5r067o,ITV criticised after Balls interviews wife Cooper,"After criticism, a spokesman for ITV says they felt debates on Monday were ""fair and duly impartial"".",5 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"ITV has been criticised after Good Morning Britain presenter Ed Balls interviewed his wife, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, on Monday's programme. The former Labour MP and his co-host Kate Garraway interviewed Cooper  following the recent wave of violent unrest across England. Police officers have faced attacks in recent days, while shops have been broken into and cars set on fire. In response to accusations that the interview represented a conflict of interest, an ITV spokesman told the BBC it considered its interviews ""fair and duly impartial"". ""Following a weekend of rioting and national unrest, GMB featured a range of interviews and discussion around this national emergency on today’s programme,"" the broadcaster told BBC News. ""[These] included James Cleverly, Shadow Home Secretary and Yvette Cooper, Home Secretary. ""We are satisfied that these interviews were balanced, fair and duly impartial."" The programme attracted criticism on social media after it aired, with some viewers suggesting it raised issues of bias and conflict of interest. Deadline’s Jake Kanter posted on X: ""'Still to come, the home secretary will be joining us shortly, who Ed of course is married to.' Actual words said this morning on a TV channel with a legal duty to impartiality. ""Baffling it was allowed to happen."" Other viewers described the dynamic of the interview as ""absurd"" and ""untenable"". Over the last week, police have faced violence in Rotherham, Middlesbrough, Bristol, Bolton and other parts of the UK. Shops and hotels have been broken into, while cars and bins have been set on fire and officers attacked.  The exchange on Monday's programme aired before the government’s emergency Cobra meeting. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has since announced a ""standing army"" of specialist police officers to tackle violent protests. The unrest follows a stabbing attack in Southport last week in which three children attending a dance class were killed. Balls and Cooper have been married since 1998, and have three children. Earlier in the programme, Balls told Garraway he ""had not seen [Cooper] at all in the last week"", amid the fallout of the riots. ""When these events happen, and if you're the prime minister or the home secretary, it becomes pretty much 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so it's tough,"" he commented. When Garraway replied: ""So you have genuine questions you need answers to?"" He said: ""Absolutely."" After Garraway kicked off the interview, Balls said: ""Can I ask, because we've talked about this a few times in the last few days, like many of our viewers will have done at home since those terrible killings in Southport, there have been identifiable individuals on social media, who have been inciting not just riots but violence. ""They've been using racist language. They've been using falsehoods about what happened in Southport. ""This is this is happening on the social media platforms. What can be done, what should be done now by the social media companies and the police and the Government to stop this happening, because it's been happening for a week?"" Balls also questioned Cooper on whether there has been a ""two-tier approach"" to policing, and if police have been ""softer and more cautious"" when policing the Gaza demonstrations, compared to a ""tougher"" approach over the last week. Cooper replied that police have to operate ""without fear or favour, whatever the kinds of crimes it is that they face"". Viewers have also criticised an earlier debate on the programme, between Balls, Garraway and Labour MP Zarah Sultana. In the item, Sultana said the behaviour of riots should be considered Islamophobic as well as racist.  Nadine White, the Independent’s race correspondent, said Balls ""sneered at her"" in response, and criticised the rest of the panel, who she described as ""white commentators with no lived experience of racism"". BBC News has contacted a spokesperson for Balls for comment.  Islamophobic slurs were heard in the unrest on Saturday and Sunday, and mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers were targeted. Balls was a Labour MP from 2005 to 2015, and acted as shadow chancellor. He became a TV personality after competing in Strictly Come Dancing in 2016. He is one of several rotating hosts to have presented ITV's breakfast show in recent years, along with Richard Madeley, Adil Ray and Robert Rinder, following the departure of Piers Morgan. Balls first appeared as a guest presenter on Good Morning Britain in 2021, and joined their rotating presenter line-up regularly the following year."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84jjv7kp1wo,Mosque leaders find moments of hope after violent disorder,Photos of mosque worshippers reaching out to an angry mob have been widely shared on social media.,5 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Among the many stark images emerging from the recent wave of unrest across England were photos of Muslims embracing protesters outside the UK's oldest mosque. A demonstration was held outside the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque in Liverpool at the end of a week in which misinformation about the Southport attacks was blamed for stoking Islamophobia. A counter-demonstration drew a several hundred more people and, once the situation had calmed, mosque volunteer Adam Kelwick and other worshippers crossed over in an attempt to speak to those present. The mosque’s chairman Dr Abdul Hamid, a family doctor, believes there is a ""fear of the unknown"", adding: ""If they don’t get answers, they will try to find any excuse to label you."" Scratching below the surface of what was going on, Mr Kelwick said he found people not to have been motivated by anything in particular - rather just lashing out in a state of general frustration. He said: ""None of the people who I spoke to mentioned Southport. ""I don’t think they knew what they were protesting about - I think they’re just angry, fed up."" In fact, he said there were ""beautiful interactions"" as the group from the mosque were able to ""break bread"" and listen to some people's concerns in ""deep conversations"". Photographs showed the sharing of food, hugs and handshakes were among the more positive posts being shared widely on social media. ""Some of the most vocal protesters, after everyone else had gone, came inside the mosque for a little tour,"" Mr Kelwick added. Dr Hamid, who works as a GP in a deprived area of Liverpool, said: ""The far right are a spectrum so there are those who are very, very extreme but there are people who have certain issues, whether political or personal, and they need to vent that. ""If you don’t provide them with a platform to do that, they will go on to the streets."" Mr Kelwick, who became a Muslim in 1999, has engaged with several groups in open mosque forums during the past decade, discussing the impact of grooming gangs among other topics. And he said there was nearly always progress. ""Every single event has had people who are very angry - shouting sometimes - very upset, but everyone comes together after a time,"" he said. He remembered how one man nearly broke down in tears after being invited to a restaurant meal following an event. ""He said no one had treated him like that before. All we had done was buy him a kebab."" Mr Kelwick, who saw some of Saturday’s later clashes on the city’s Pier Head from a distance, said it was not a situation for ""bridge-building"". ""There are thugs among them but there are also genuine concerns,"" he said. ""The priority has to be safety and security and everyone needs to calm down."" However, mosque leaders are conscious that there is less hope for others. Ibrahim Syed, a coordinator with Liverpool Region Mosque Network, said engagement with some groups ""was encouraging to see"" but the more extreme far-right activists should be banned ""like other Islamist groups"". Speaking after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met religious leaders in the region, he said: “There is the argument that the police already have the powers to stop the violence.  ""But what I think it’s important to note is that actually their words of hate and polarisation also need to be controlled."" Initially set up in 1887, the Liverpool Muslim institute was recently renamed the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque after its founder William Quilliam, a lawyer born in the port city. While recovering from illness, he converted to Islam after a trip to Morocco and adopted the name Abdullah. Mr Kelwick told how the mosque faced angry mobs in the Victorian era but Quilliam had an ""open door"" policy, eager to engage with the wider city through charity and educational efforts. He said worshippers were still following in those footsteps by being involved in the ""ridding of ignorance and bringing people together"". Dr Hamid said the widely-shared images of the friendly exchanges could help ""drown out the negativity"". ""There might be people in that far-right spectrum that will think twice,"" he said. ""We’re not going to be able to change everyone’s mind, but that positivity can spread like wildfire."" Mr Kelwick said some people had been dismissive and sceptical about the mosque's efforts and dismissed the social media coverage as attention-seeking. But Mr Kelwick said perhaps they were missing the point. He added: ""Yes, I am doing this for publicity because I want this message of hope and coming together to get out as far as possible.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78l1x0d9zro,"No complacency over riots coming to Wales, says FM",Eluned Morgan says she has spoken to the prime minister about the possibility of riots in Wales.,7 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Wales' new first minister has said she is ""not complacent"" about the possibility of riots coming to Wales. Mass disorder broke out across England and Northern Ireland after false information spread across social media claiming the suspect in the murder of three children in Southport was an asylum seeker. Cardiff-born Axel Muganwa Rudakubana has been charged with three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murders and possession of a curved kitchen knife. ""We are a society and a nation that should be welcoming people... we cannot let those people who are determined to be destructive within our communities to get a hold,"" Eluned Morgan said. Ms Morgan officially became Wales' first female first minister on Tuesday, after the Senedd was recalled to vote in a replacement for Vaughan Gething.  Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, she said she had spoken to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Tuesday evening regarding the riots - one of her first duties as first minister. ""I am very concerned about it and I’m certainly not complacent about the possibility of that happening in Wales, which is why I have already asked for a meeting to be set up with the police and some community leaders,"" she said. ""I spoke to Keir Starmer about this last night and, clearly, policing is not a devolved issue so we do need to keep in close contact with them."" Posting to X, formerly known as Twitter, ex-Member of the Senedd for Plaid Cymru Bethan Sayed said Wales was ""not immune"" to the attitudes and views being channelled in the outbreaks of violence. She said a friend of her husband, who was from India, had recently been verbally abused while at a Cardiff petrol station. ""Guys came out of a car and went up to him as he was taking petrol, shouting, screaming at him to go home. He's so scared now,"" she wrote. Ms Morgan emphasised there was ""no place for racism within our communities"". She added: ""I think we have got to listen to communities and be sensitive to their needs, but there is a line where we must be intolerant of intolerance.  ""And that is a line I will not be prepared to cross."" Sir Keir promised communities they would be kept safe after he chaired an emergency Cobra meeting on Tuesday night. It is understood there are at least 30 potential gatherings planned for Wednesday that police are aware of. The prime minister praised the ""robust and swift response"" of the criminal justice system and said it should ""send a very powerful message"" to those considering further violence. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts MP, said: ""The behaviour of those people who seek to incite division, spread mistruths and pitch different groups of people against each other is beyond contempt.""  She added while there had been no reports of violence in Wales, ""we should all be mindful of the potential for racist and Islamophobic hatred to blight our communities and challenge those attitudes when they arise"". Andrew RT Davies MS, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""Thuggery is completely unacceptable, and all those responsible must face harsh punishment."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd05znr1xero,"'No place for racism in our society', says O'Neill","Since the weekend, there have been consecutive nights of violence in parts of Belfast.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Executive ministers condemned recent violence ahead of the Northern Ireland Assembly being recalled. First Minister Michelle O’Neill said the executive is “unequivocally” collective in its determination to say no to racism. She said there is “no place for racism in our society”, adding that it is “absolutely wrong”.  On Thursday afternoon during the recall, MLAs backed an Alliance motion condemning the recent disorder and rejecting “all forms of racism” in Northern Ireland. Ms O’Neill said people from ethnic minorities were afraid to go about their normal routines. “We have healthcare workers who are afraid to go to their work, we have nurses who are afraid to go home,” she said. That is “the real human impact” of this type of racist activity, she added.  Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said Northern Ireland's political parties were ""sending a strong and united message against violence, disorder and racism"". The fact that some healthcare workers are thinking of leaving as a result of the violence is ""deeply disturbing"", Ms Little-Pengelly said, emphasising their ""huge"" contribution. She also wanted to acknowledge the ""positive contribution of many ethnic minority people"" in Northern Ireland. Violence is always ""wrong"" and ""never the answer"", she added. Justice Minister Naomi Long said the disorder was not representative of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland. “We need to call it for what it is. It is racism; it is Islamophobia,"" she said.  ""If we’re going to deal with it, we need to name it what it is, and we need to challenge it.” The Alliance leader said the people being attacked are “part of our community” and “valued”. “It is incumbent on all of us in political leadership, but also all of us as a community to make them feel that they are welcome and safe,” she added. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent It's not often you hear a round of applause in the assembly chamber. But that happened on several occasions on Thursday as MLAs reflected on events of the past week. Members of minority community groups sat and watched in the public gallery as politicians addressed them directly, offering words of support and of condemnation against what has happened so far. While recall debates are often described as little more than talking shops, many felt the seriousness of the situation demanded our politicians' presence today. Politicians may struggle in the short-term to change attitudes, but there is pressure on the executive to act in certain policy areas, such as updating racial equality strategies. Strategies which at surface level may not mean much, have practical consequences for how those communities are represented and the access to services they get. There is also the question of better resources for the PSNI. Yesterday, when I asked the secretary of state could he commit to improved funding for the organisation, he said it was a matter for the executive to prioritise what they already have for this year. Today, the first and deputy first ministers told me they're still fighting to get the Treasury to improve our funding formula and insisted the PSNI will not be ""alone"" in tackling this issue. Speaking in the assembly, DUP MLA for Upper Bann, Jonathan Buckley, said he wanted to make it “crystal clear” that he condemned the violence “on our streets and across the United Kingdom”. He expressed his sympathy for the families of the victims of the knife attack in Southport on 29 July in which three young girls died. SDLP South Belfast MLA Matthew O’Toole welcomed members of the Muslim community to the assembly chamber. “We owe them an apology for what they and their community have had to endure in this society and city over recent weeks and days,” he said. Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken praised the work of ethnic minority health workers, saying he spent several hours in Antrim Area Hospital on Wednesday with one of his children. He said those in the emergency department were grateful for the ""professional medical care they were receiving"". Mr Aiken said some ""very misguided"" people thought it was appropriate to attack immigrants. ""It has to stop, it has to stop now,"" he stressed. The Northern Ireland Assembly was recalled following a successful petition, put forward by the Alliance Party. This meant MLAs have returned from their summer break to discuss recent disorder. It follows a spate of violence, with several businesses in the city attacked after an anti-immigration protest erupted into disorder. The first minister and deputy first ministers have said their joint priority is to face down racism and intimidation. There has been violent disorder in towns and cities across the UK since last Tuesday, the day after three young girls were killed in Southport. False claims on social media followed that someone who had arrived in the UK illegally was to blame. On Saturday, a cafe was set alight and several businesses were attacked after disorder broke out in Belfast. Violence also erupted on Monday, Tuesday and Wedsnesday night in the city. Assembly members debated a motion from the Alliance Party that called on the assembly to condemn the criminal damage and ""targeting of businesses"" at the weekend. It also called on MLAs to recognise that PSNI resources are stretched and ""could have been much more effectively deployed elsewhere"". The move by Alliance to recall the assembly from its summer break was backed by Sinn Féin, the SDLP and independent unionist Claire Sugden. On Monday, Sinn Féin's Deirdre Hargey said First Minister Michelle O'Neill was cutting short a family holiday to return to the assembly for the debate. Immigration is a matter largely reserved for Westminster, but there have been calls for the Executive Office to do more to help refugees living in Northern Ireland. The recall motion also called on the first minister and deputy first ministers to finalise a Refugee Integration Strategy by the end of this year, and replace an ""outdated"" Racial Equality Strategy. Unlike England, Scotland and Wales, Northern Ireland has no refugee integration strategy. A public consultation on a draft strategy took place in February 2022, but the power-sharing executive collapsed during that time and the institutions remained suspended for two years. On Thursday, an anti-racism rally also took place outside Parliament Buildings where politicians reconvened to discuss the recent disorder and racist attacks. The demonstration was organised by trade unions and community groups. Meanwhile, hundreds of people attended an anti-racism rally in Guildhall Square in Londonderry on Wednesday evening.  Organisers said it was held to show solidarity with the migrant community of the north west in response to some of the violent scenes seen in Belfast and some areas in England in recent days."

Former home secretary Dame Priti Patel, Labour MP Diane Abbott and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage are among the politicians urging Sir Keir to cut short the parliamentary recess. Dame Priti, who is running to be Conservative leader, said there were ""many practical things"" MPs could do if Parliament was recalled. But Sir Keir said his focus was on stopping the disorder and making sure the streets were safe.  The prime minister was speaking following an emergency Cobra meetings with ministers and law enforcement representatives. He said an ""army"" of specialist police officers were on standby and the criminal justice system would be ramped up to charge those involved in the disorder. He also emphasised that ""criminal law applies online as well as offline"". Earlier Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said social media firms were being too slow at removing ""criminal material"" from their platforms.  The House of Commons stopped sitting last week, but the government can ask the Speaker to recall MPs if there is an event thought to be of national importance Over the past decade, the House of Commons and Lords have been recalled from recess six times for events including western forces chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the death of Prince Philip. Following the 2011 riots in London and other English cities, Parliament was recalled for one day.  Speaking to Times Radio, Dame Priti said politicians needed to ""get some kind of grip on this, which is why I am calling for the recall of Parliament right now so that we can actually discuss these issues."" ""Local authorities are now under pressure, the police are under pressure to do more effectively, we need to find out what more do they need."" However, other Tory leadership hopefuls Kemi Badenoch and James Cleverly have said they do not back a recall.  Mr Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a recall was not necessary to ensure MPs were receiving a ""clear flow"" of information.  ""There's nothing that needs to be voted on, there are no additional powers (needed)."" Backing a recall, veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott said: ""This is an extraordinarily grave situation. You've got people trying to burn down hostels where asylum seekers are cowering. You've got people attacking black and Muslim people on the street. ""We need to be able to question ministers on what exactly is being done and we want to speak up for our communities."" Another Labour MP, Dawn Butler, said: ""It may be time to recall Parliament. This violence needs to stop."" Reform UK leader and MP Nigel Farage said there needed to be ""a more honest debate"" about immigration and policing was needed and that a recall of Parliament would be ""an appropriate start to this"".  Last week, Mr Farage rejected accusations he had ""whipped up"" rioters by asking whether ""the truth is being withheld from us"", after police said the Southport attack was not being treated as a terror incident. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey welcomed the measures taken by the government adding: ""People from all backgrounds and all walks of life have come together to condemn these riots and clean up the damage - it is they who truly represent Britain, not the rioters and those who have incited them."" Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP, has written to the home secretary calling for an urgent meeting to ""discuss what actions are planned to stamp out this racist terror"". In a joint letter with four other independent MPs Ayoub Khan (MP for Birmingham Perry Barr), Adnan Hussain (Blackburn), Iqbal Mohamed (Dewsbury and Batley) and Shockat Adam (Leicester South), Mr Corbyn urged the government not to ""give succour to those seeking to sow hatred and division"".  The Green Party said the disorder had been caused by ""racism and Islamophobia"" and urged the government to ""celebrate and defend our Muslim citizens and their place in our diverse society""."

It comes after two nights of violent protest in English towns this week, following a knife attack in Southport. In a statement, Ch Supt Stephen Murray said police are aware of social media posts calling for protests across Northern Ireland including ""specific calls to block roads using women and children"". ""It is unclear at this time what the actual provenance for these posts or appetite for this activity is,"" he added. ""We will continue to plan a proportionate policing response and will continue to engage with those groups likely to be affected by any protest activity."" The Bishop of Down and Connor, Alan McGuckian, said that in recent days there had been ""disturbing scenes of violence, rioting and protest, often motivated by Islamophobia, xenophobia and racism, organised and mobilised by social influencers"". ""It has come to my attention that there are also those in Northern Ireland, often cloaked with the anonymity of social media, that are similarly stoking the coals of fear and mistrust against Muslims,"" he added. ""I make an appeal calling for all to remain calm, to seek peace and to promote community harmony."" When asked about the potential protests at a meeting of the Policing Board on Thursday, Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said the police were still trying to establish who was behind them. ""There is no set organisation showing themselves on social media which defines the cowardly nature of the people who do this nonsense,"" he added. ""If there are to be any gatherings we will police them and we will police them effectively."" Rev Trevor Gribben, clerk of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said ""the pursuit of such hatred, and the incitement of others to hate and instil fear"" was ""abhorrent"". Mr Gribben added that it was his ""prayer"" that people ""seeking to undertake this misguided course of action think again"". Rev Dr John Alderdice, president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, also joined the criticism of those calling for protests. ""The shocking knife attack in Southport last Monday where three children were killed and many others injured, saddened, and horrified us all. ""However, to use this attack as a pretext for anti-immigration protests is abhorrent."" Speaking on the BBC’s Evening Extra programme Rev Alderdice said he was “gravely concerned that protests like this should take place that would stir fear and division and racism across our society”. Also speaking on the programme, the former moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Norman Hamilton said “we need to do a bit more than simply issue condemnations”. He said that “any group, any organisation, any church with self-respect would want to... put as much distance as they can between themselves and what’s proposed"". But he added that “we need to understand why people want to engage in these sorts of protests and deal with those underling angst and concerns”. More than 100 people have been arrested at demonstrations in England after violent disorder was sparked by the murder of three primary school age girls at a dance studio in Southport on Monday."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjww791xnlo,Police officer injured after second hotel targeted in Tamworth,"Missiles are thrown, windows smashed and fires lit at the Holiday Inn in Tamworth, police say.",5 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Three petrol bombs were thrown at a Holiday Inn Express hotel in Tamworth on Sunday night, Staffordshire Police said. One officer suffered a suspected broken arm in what the force described as ""targeted violence"", with projectiles and fireworks thrown from a ""hostile"" crowd. Extra officers were drafted in from neighbouring forces in order to deal with the incident - which ended after the crowd was ""successfully dispersed"", police said.  Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Ellison referred to the violence as ""despicable thuggery"" and said officers in Tamworth had shown ""tremendous courage"".  Mr Ellison added: ""The local community do not deserve to be subject to this behaviour, and neither do the brave officers putting themselves in harm’s way to keep everyone safe. ""We will be using footage from CCTV, air support and our officers’ body-worn video devices to identify those responsible and seek the toughest possible punishment for these acts of senseless violence."" No one inside the Holiday Inn Express was injured, police said, but added that windows were smashed and petrol bombs were used to start a series of fires. In July, Tamworth's MP Sarah Edwards told the House of Commons the Holiday Inn in the town had been ""used for asylum purposes for years"". A spokesperson for IHG, which owns the Holiday Inn Express brand, said: ""The safety and security of our guests and colleagues is always our priority."" A similar incident took place in Rotherham on Sunday when anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of a Holiday Inn Express before starting fires. Meanwhile, violence in Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday went against everything the city represents, according to the leader of the city council. Ten people were arrested and three police officers injured after hundreds of protesters gathered in Hanley in the wake of the Southport attacks, in which three girls were killed. ""We unequivocally condemn these protests and the violent behaviour associated with them,"" said councillor Jane Ashworth. ""Their message of division goes against everything we stand for in Stoke-on-Trent."" Two men were also treated in hospital after being struck by blunt objects that were thrown although their injuries were not believed to be serious. ""I'm furious, I'm horrified, I'm disappointed, we do not want this kind of thing going on in our city,"" said Ms Ashworth. She said it was fortunate there had been little physical damage in the city centre, which was partly down to ""an extremely good job"" by the police, but many businesses had seen their trade affected after closing early due to the ""horrendous physical violence."" The council leader said she was expecting to see prison sentences ""and some heavy ones"" for those found to be responsible. At least seven of those arrested are from the city or neighbouring Newcastle-under-Lyme. They include 15 and 16-year-old boys accused of violent disorder or possessing offensive weapons as well as men arrested on suspicion of attacking emergency workers or racially or religiously aggravated harassment. Islamophobic chants could be heard on footage posted online during the day but there have also been accusations of  double standards from police. Footage shared online appeared to show an officer with a loud hailer addressing a group outside a mosque in Stoke-on-Trent. ""If there's any weapons, get rid of them, we are not going to arrest anybody,"" he appears to say. In response, a spokesperson for Staffordshire Police said it recognised ""some edited footage"" shared on social media had ""gained traction"" and had an effect on public confidence.  ""We’re committed to fully investigating all of the material available, addressing any lessons to be learnt with proportionate action and continuing to reassure people in Stoke-on-Trent,"" they added. Videos shared on social media, along with police drone footage, were also being reviewed to identify those involved in the disorder, they added. As well as the violence on the streets, police have also had to contend with misinformation spread on social media platforms. The force said rumours of two men being stabbed on Saturday - perpetuated by videos shared online - were false.  It said no such stabbings were reported.  A special prayer vigil was held on Saturday for ""peace and all people of goodwill to do what they can to encourage mutual respect,"" said Lloyd Cooke from Christian charity Saltbox. Mr Cooke, who spoke on behalf of Stoke-on-Trent's Faith Leaders Forum following the protests in Stoke-on-Trent, said all faiths in the city were united in calling for peace and understanding. ""Ultimately, hate and violence will solve nothing,"" he said. Follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e5e59z49go,Police disperse protesters after missiles hurled,"Ten arrests are made and three police officers and two men are injured in the disorder, police say.",4 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Riot police were deployed in Stoke-on-Trent after hundreds of people protested in the wake of the Southport attacks. The demonstration was one of several across the UK on Saturday, some of which turned violent. Officers in Stoke-on-Trent city centre came under fire from missiles at one point and Staffordshire Police said two men were also hit by a blunt object that was thrown. Ten people were arrested in connection with the disorder and remained in custody on Saturday evening, the force said. The 10 arrested, aged from 15 to 52, were mostly from the Stoke-on-Trent or Staffordshire area, officers said. Three police officers were assaulted and suffered minor injuries. A crowd of about 400 people gathered at about 11:30 BST in Hanley along with other groups of counter-protesters, including one outside the now-closed Hanley Town Hall. Earlier in the day the protests were largely peaceful but Staffordshire Police said a number of demonstrators had been dispersed by officers during the day and a large-scale policing operation remained in place six hours on. A Section 34 dispersal notice was also authorised allowing police to disperse people who might return to the area. Misinformation had been common on several social media platforms during the day and in an evening update the force said claims of two stabbings were ""false"". It said no stabbings were reported to police ""despite videos fuelling speculation on social media"". One in particular, which showed a man being treated for an injury to his head, ""fuelled the speculation"", a spokesperson added. ""We would like to reiterate that two men involved in the incident were hit with a blunt object that was thrown in the air,"" they said and added their injuries were not thought to be serious. Islamophobic chants could be heard on some video footage while others showed officers coming under fire from missiles. Members of the North Staffordshire Campaign Against Racism staged a counter-protest. One of them, Sarah Breene-Crum, said: ""It's an insult to the families that have lost their children, the way that the far-right have behaved over the last few days."" Simon Crum added: ""There is a silent majority out there that are moderate and want a fairer society where we do allow immigrants and we look after refugees and we look after everyone."" As protesters made their way through Hanley, several buildings were closed for a time as well as a main route out of the city centre. A spokesperson for The Irish Woodman pub in Hanley said they and other firms in the area closed for the day due to the protests. ""Due to the terrible events in Hanley at the moment I've made the decision to close the pub for the rest of the day along with other businesses in Hanley,"" they said in a post on Facebook. Saturday’s protests, sparked by the death of three girls at a holiday dance session on Monday, came on the same day as a children’s dance production at Stoke-on-Trent's Regent Theatre. The presence of protesters outside following a matinee performance of Never Give Up forced the venue to go into lockdown, one parent said, to protect the children.  He said it was ""scary"" in the city centre, particularly knowing his daughter and other children were caught up in it. He added that while protesters had since moved on and the lockdown lifted, the evening performance was in the balance and might not go ahead. Another event, Summer Sounds at The Underground in the city centre ended early as a precaution. One person who was involved with the event said it was after taking advice from the police. On Saturday morning, the force had advised local people to stay indoors and if they needed to go out, not to do so alone.  Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Ellison said a large number of police officers would remain in Hanley on Saturday night. “Violent disorder of any form is completely unacceptable and those who are responsible will be met with the full force of the law,"" he added.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nggpp5nz7o,Police condemn violence and disorder on streets of Belfast,"Assistant Chief Constable Davy Beck said those who ""engaged in this behaviour bring nothing but shame to themselves and Belfast city"".",4 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has condemned the scenes of violence and disorder on ""the streets of Belfast"" on Saturday. The trouble happened after anti-immigration and anti-racism protesters faced off in tense scenes outside the city hall. Police are treating damage to several businesses as hate crimes.  Residents also had to leave an apartment block in south Belfast after it was set on fire.  The PSNI said four people have been arrested after 13 reports of criminal damage and five of arson. Three police officers were injured during the disorder - two remained on duty while the third was relieved from duty after suffering concussion. In a statement, First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said: ""Whilst people are entitled to peaceful protest, there is no justification for racism or the violence and intimidation that occurred on Saturday. ""Those involved should be quickly brought before the courts and we appeal to anyone with information to provide that information to the PSNI. ""We reiterate our joint commitment to a shared, peaceful and inclusive society."" After the protest outside the city hall some anti-immigration protesters had attempted to march to the Belfast Islamic Centre in south Belfast but were prevented by police. The crowd then made their way to Botanic Avenue, University Street, Lower Ormeau, Holylands and Donegall Road areas where sporadic violence developed for a number of hours. Disorder also broke out in the Sandy Row area and several cars were set alight and a business premises targeted. Assistant Chief Constable Davy Beck said those who ""engaged in this behaviour bring nothing but shame to themselves and Belfast city"". “This disorder, violence and destruction has no place in Belfast or anywhere else across the streets of Northern Ireland,"" he said. “I would strongly urge anyone who was involved in yesterday’s rioting and disorder to think long and hard about their actions and the devastating impact this has had on local communities."" A supermarket and a cafe in the Donegall Road and Sandy Row areas of south Belfast were also badly damaged by fire in overnight attacks. Abdelkader is the owner of the supermarket in the Donegall Road area that was targeted. He said he had shut the shop on Saturday afternoon and was surprised to see images of it burning on social media later that night. He said he was from Syria and had been living in Northern Ireland for eight years. “Everything we built from zero is destroyed,” he told BBC News NI. “Everything is done, my life is done.” He said he did not have the financial means to rebuild the property. Sam Yousef is a representative of the Syrian community in Belfast. He says that members of the community are “very afraid” and that he feels a bit unsafe as well. Mr Yousef says that on social media he has seen people telling each other not to leave the house because the situation is “very terrible”. “This is our country…we are trying to pay back, trying to work hard, pay tax, integrate into the society and contribute to the people here,"" he said. “Our children are growing up here and we want them to feel safe because we escaped an unsafe area."" Daniel Lannon, who attends a nearby church, said he was driving past on Sunday morning when he saw the destruction caused by the attack on the supermarket. He stopped to help with the clear-up. “I believe this is the right thing to do,” he added. “Some of the stuff that was going out on social media, with the protesters saying they were doing this in the name of Christianity, but that’s not Christianity. “Christianity is to love your neighbour, to help them, to help those who are different from you, so that’s what we are trying to do today.” A cafe on Botanic Avenue was also attacked by a crowd of anti-immigration protesters on Saturday afternoon as they made their way to the Holylands area of south Belfast. Protesters threw missiles at members of the media. Windows were smashed and furniture was broken in the cafe on Botanic Avenue. Rahmi, the owner of the cafe, who has been in Belfast for 35 years, told BBC News NI on Sunday that he ""could have been killed"". He reiterated that there could have been more of a police presence when ""the parade was walking"" through the area. “You watch the videos and you can see only me and these big, massive chairs that they keep throwing at me. “I’m sure if I had left the door open, they would do more damage or burn the inside.” On Saturday, the police said it was aware of a number of reports of criminal damage and were treating them as hate crimes. The Sinn Féin MLA for Belfast South, Deidre Hargey, said there are “concerns” around the police “operation that took place” because she had warned the PSNI about possible demonstrations. “We will be robustly following that up with the PSNI because lessons need to be learned,"" she added. “It was clear that there was no proper policing in the Botanic area, in the university area, and indeed into the Ormeau Road itself. These were issues that I had previously highlighted and flashpoints that could be sensitive areas.”  She also questioned if there had been ""enough action"" to even stop the crowds moving from city hall and throughout the streets in south Belfast. SDLP councillor Paul Doherty said his party would be requesting an urgent meeting with the PSNI. He said there were “serious questions for the police to answer”. Mr Doherty said “there was no police on” the Botanic Avenue when a business was damaged. “Why was that?” he asked. ACC Beck said the PSNI had a “significant policing operation” in place and that it was a “really challenging situation”. “It was a really dynamic and agile and fast-moving protest and I think my officers responded really well to that,” he said. “We will continue to work with any issues that we may face in the hours and the days ahead."" Mr Beck rejected criticism that the PSNI had fallen short in protecting businesses that had been attacked. “I do regret that people attacked businesses and that’s wrong and that’s where the fault lies,” he said. “It lies with those people that attacked and set out with violence in their mind and we will bring those people to justice.” Mr Beck said police officers had “responded to concerns right across Belfast” and that he had been in contact with community representatives. “We are working hard with the local community and will listen to the local community, we will respond to the concerns in the local community,” he added. Northern Ireland's Justice Minister, Naomi Long, condemned the violence. ""There can be no place in our community for hate: for xenophobia, racism and Islamophobia,"" she added. ""Neither can there be any place for such intimidation and intolerance.  ""My thoughts are with all those impacted by this disorder; those whose property was damaged, businesses attacked and who were intimidated, threatened or fearful as a result."" More than 100 people have been arrested after demonstrations organised by far-right groups descended into riots in UK towns and cities on Saturday. There was unrest in Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Blackpool, as well as Belfast, with missiles thrown, shops looted and police attacked in some places. Other smaller demonstrations elsewhere did not turn violent. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to give police forces the government's ""full support"" to take action against ""extremists"" attempting to ""sow hate""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1343eedzm6o,"'We're watching you,' far-right protesters warned",A home office minster says criminal activity will not be tolerated ahead of expected demonstrations.,2 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Home Office minister has warned those planning far-right protests this weekend that police are watching them. Demonstrations are expected in cities across the country, from Glasgow to Dover, following violent unrest around the Southport stabbing attack. Hundreds of mosques are strengthening security amid concern Islamic places of worship could be targeted. Lord David Hanson said police are monitoring organisers and would be using facial recognition technology to identify people. More than 100 people have been arrested at demonstrations after violent disorder was sparked by the murder of three primary school age girls at a dance studio on Monday. The BBC has identified at least 30 additional demonstrations being planned by far-right activists around the UK, including a new protest in Southport, this weekend. ""Nobody minds peaceful protest,"" Home Office minister Lord Hanson told BBC Breakfast.  ""But what happened this week in Southport, and what's happened elsewhere in the country, is organised individuals who have undertaken criminal activity to intimidate, to attack police, to break personal property, and that's not acceptable."" Highlighting how conspiracy to organise a riot is an offence, he added ""we are reminding people who are going to potentially commit this crime that we are watching them through intelligence-led policing"". Asked about the possibility of violent protests this weekend, he told LBC: “There is that potential, but I always say to anybody who's organising this, we will be watching you.""  Security staff are being hired at mosques in cities across the UK due to phoned-in threats about “targeted attacks”, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) reported. There is “deep-seated anxiety” and “palpable fear” among communities, MCB secretary-general Zara Mohammed said, urging mosques to work closely with police. Ms Mohammed said: “We go by what we’ve seen already and from what online posters are saying, but it sounds like far-right thugs and mobs are going to seek to intimidate congregations and mosques. “In Southport they were pelting stones and glass bottles, shouting Islamophobic slurs and abuse. “So it’s likely that we may again see groups of men and thugs coming together outside of the mosques to intimidate.” Protests are understood to be planned for areas such as Liverpool, Glasgow, Lancaster, Blackburn, Newcastle, Birmingham, Sunderland, Dover, Middlesbrough, Leeds and Hull, the MCB said. On Thursday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said groups seeking to incite disorder will be treated similarly to football hooligans, with more Criminal Behaviour Orders (CBO) to restrict the movement of offenders and stop them travelling. ""These thugs are mobile, they move from community to community, and we must have a police response that can do the same,"" he said. A former counter-terrorism police chief accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of helping incite the violence that broke out earlier this week, for a video he released on Tuesday in which he questioned “whether the truth is being withheld from us”. Neil Basu – who was in charge of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard from 2018 to 2021 – said there were “real world consequences” when public figures like the MP for Clacton failed to “keep their mouth shut”. ""That is a far-right politician once again trying to direct policing and law and order,"" Mr Basu told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Mr Farage insisted he had “merely expressed a sense of sadness and concern that is being felt by absolutely everybody I know – ‘what the hell is going on?’” He added: “I think it’s perfectly reasonable to ask what is happening to law and order in our country."" Civil rights campaign Big Brother Watch has expressed concern about the use of facial recognition technology, which the group's director Silkie Carlo described as ""alarming"" for democracy. ""Whilst common in Russia and China, live facial recognition is banned in Europe,"" she said. ""This AI surveillance turns members of the public into walking ID cards, is dangerously inaccurate and has no explicit legal basis in the UK."""

Northumbria Police said three of its officers were injured during the unrest and needed hospital treatment. Eight people have been arrested after a police building was ransacked and a Citizens Advice premises next door to it was set alight. Beer cans and bricks were thrown at riot police outside a mosque and cars were set on fire during the disorder. It is the latest episode of unrest to break out in towns and cities across England following the killing of three young girls in Southport on Monday.  Northumbria Police Ch Supt Helena Barron said officers had been met with ""serious and sustained"" levels of violence, which was ""utterly deplorable"".  She said a full investigation was under way to identify those responsible for any criminal behaviour. ""I want to make it absolutely clear that the disorder, violence and damage which has occurred will not be tolerated,"" Ch Supt Barron added. Of the three injured police officers, one has been discharged and two remain in hospital for further treatment, she said.  Some members of the crowd could be heard shouting Islamophobic slurs and chanting in support of far-right activist Tommy Robsinson, founder of the now disbanded English Defence League (EDL). Mr Yaxley-Lennon's X account has promoted false claims that the alleged Southport attacker had been an asylum seeker who recently arrived in the UK by boat.  Lewis Atkinson, Labour MP for Sunderland Central, said: ""Last night one of the flags on the street bore the reference to the North East Infidels, which is a Nazi offshoot from the North East chapter of what was the EDL."" Mounted police were deployed to Sunderland's city centre to push back demonstrators, some of whom were in masks. Officers also had beer barrels thrown at them, as young men shouted: ""Whose streets? Our streets"". Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said criminals attacking the police would ""pay the price for their violence and thuggery"". Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service confirmed it had been called out to the fire near the Sunderland Central Police office.  Rail and bus services were halted with Tyne and Wear Metro operator Nexus saying it had been asked by British Transport Police to close Sunderland Rail Station at around 22:15 BST. The Omniplex cinema in the city was also forced to close during the evening in the interest of public and staff safety, it said.  Residents said they could still hear police helicopters in the sky past midnight.  Mayor of the North East Kim McGuinness said rioters have caused ""significant damage"" to the city. ""They've set fire to a police station, to cars, they've looted shops, they've abused people in the street, they've attacked police officers and Sunderland will be feeling the effect of that,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""These people do need to be dealt with, with the full force of the law - you cannot use other people's grief to commit crime and violence"". Sunderland AFC posted on social media: ""Tonight’s shameful scenes do not represent our culture, our history, or our people.  ""Our great city is built on togetherness and acceptance, and Sunderland will forever be for all. We are stronger as one community."" Sunderland Central MP Lewis Atkinson said the police had his full support in response to the criminal ""thuggery"".  A crowd of about 200 anti-racist protesters also gathered outside the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque in Liverpool on Friday night after rumours of a far-right protest there. The group chanted: ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here"". Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said extra prosecutors had been called into work this weekend to deal with the disorder.  ""We have deployed dozens of extra prosecutors who are working round the clock this weekend, supporting the police, and ready to make immediate charging decisions so that justice is swiftly delivered,"" he said.  Towns and cities including London, Hartlepool, Manchester, and Aldershot have seen protests descend into violence following the Southport knife attack.  In response, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced a new national violent disorder programme to help clamp down on violent groups by allowing police forces to share intelligence. In a televised speech on Thursday, Sir Keir said: ""These thugs are mobile, they move from community to community, and we must have a police response that can do the same."" He also condemned ""violent disorder, clearly whipped up online"". ""We will take all necessary action to keep our streets safe"", the PM said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80x0gqvq7ro,Police separate crowds of protesters outside city mosque,Liverpool officers stepped up patrols amid more demonstrations in the aftermath of the Southport attack.,3 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Police moved to separate crowds of opposing protesters outside a mosque in Liverpool as more demonstrations began in the aftermath of the Southport attack. Merseyside Police formed a barrier between the two groups close to the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque on the city's Brougham Terrace from about 20:00 BST on Friday. A scuffle broke out between protesters at one stage as pro-refugee chants began from one side and others shouted ""go home"" in retaliation. Police had earlier insisted they were ""fully prepared for anyone intent on causing disorder"" as speculation built throughout Friday of protests being planned across the weekend. A short stretch of the road from the junction of Everton Road and Walker Street to the other side of the mosque was closed during the demonstration.  The gathering was among several which began around England in the wake of the knife attack at a children's dance workshop in Southport on Monday. Elsewhere, protesters clashed with police in Sunderland as they gathered for a planned demonstration, also outside a mosque. Stones and beer cans were thrown at police in riot gear, while mounted officers pushed back demonstrators, some of whom were in masks. Merseyside Police said extra officers were being deployed, with extra stop-and-search powers in place in both Southport and Liverpool into the weekend. Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, died after they were attacked by a knifeman at the Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Five children and two adults injured in the attack remain in hospital, while two other children have since been discharged from Alder Hey Children's Hospital. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer paid a visit to the hospital earlier as part of a second visit to Merseyside, where he thanked staff for their hard work and professionalism in responding to the attack. Merseyside Police Federation's Chris McGlade said more than 50 police officers were hurt in a ""sustained and vicious attack"" during violent protests in Southport on Tuesday.  ""Thugs"" who travelled to the town to use the attack ""for their own political purposes"" were to blame for the violence, the town's MP Patrick Hurley said. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said the disrespect that had been shown towards victims and grieving families and the community was ""despicable"". The officer praised the ""brilliant and heartening response"" from the people in the communities who had taken it upon themselves to help clean-up ""the destruction and mess left behind"" from the protests - with Southport Mosque being a target of the attack on Tuesday. She warned of the dangers of misinformation and speculation online, saying it could have ""real world consequences that put innocent people in harm's way"".  The chairman of a mosque that was attacked in Southport on Tuesday has said ""hate will never prevail"" as he joined other religious leaders on Friday to say hate ""must not be allowed to fester in our society"". Senior Imam Qari Asim read out a joint statement from Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders outside Southport Mosque. ""There are some who have chosen to use what should be a moment of collective grief to sow the seeds of division, spread Islamophobia and attack the mosque here in Southport,"" the joint statement said. ""People from all of our faiths live as minority communities in different places across the world and understand what it is like to be persecuted. ""And in times like this, we must all stand together and not let division destroy community cohesion in our cities and towns"". Imam Ibrahim Hussein, chairman of Southport Mosque, said he felt like ""the luckiest man in the whole country"" after seeing the support of the local community. ""But it is not about Southport Mosque, it is not about our suffering,"" he added.  ""We should have been focused all along about these poor people who have suffered in the most horrific way. ""Instead these people try to destroy what is so beautiful about our community."" Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Banks in Lancashire, appeared in court on Thursday charged with murder and attempted murder over the attack. Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said officers ""will not stand by and let criminals carry out unnecessary violence in our communities"". He continued: ""I'd like the public to know there is a robust and united response in place across the country, and police chiefs have agreed to step up resourcing this weekend. ""Our message to anyone thinking of getting involved in this type of criminality is clear - if you cause violence, you will face the full force of the law and we have the full backing of our criminal justice partners."" Det Ch Insp Tony Roberts said Merseyside Police had now made seven arrests following the disorder in Southport on Tuesday evening, adding that further arrests would be made over the coming weeks. He said the force was reviewing hundreds of hours of footage and images ""to identify everyone involved"". The disorder in Southport was followed by a number of incidents across the country on Wednesday. Eight people were arrested following disorder in Hartlepool, while two were arrested following an incident in Manchester, and over 100 arrests were made following disorder in central London. Several police officers have been injured in the incidents. On Thursday, Sir Keir announced that police forces across the country would be working more closely to tackle violent disorder. Home Office Minister Lord Hanson told LBC Radio that would-be protesters needed to ""be prepared to face the full force of the law on this criminal activity"".

Other smaller demonstrations elsewhere did not turn violent. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to give police forces the government's ""full support"" to take action against ""extremists"" attempting to ""sow hate"". Tensions have been high after the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday. In Liverpool, bricks, bottles and a flare were thrown at police, one officer was hit in the head when a chair was thrown, and another was kicked and knocked off his motorbike.  Around one thousand anti-immigration protestors, some of whom were shouting Islamophobic slurs, were confronted by counter-protesters.  A few hundred anti-fascist demonstrators gathered near Liverpool’s Lime Street station at lunchtime, calling for unity and tolerance, chanting “refugees are welcome here” and “Nazi scum, off our streets”. Police in riot gear with dogs struggled to keep the two sides apart and reinforcements were called to try and maintain order. The unrest continued into the early hours of Sunday morning, with fireworks launched towards police officers wearing riot gear. A library was set on fire in the Walton area of the city and rioters tried to prevent firefighters from putting it out, Merseyside Police said. Shops were broken into and a number of wheelie bins were set on fire, it added. The force confirmed a number of officers had been injured in what they described as ""serious disorder"", adding that two had been taken to hospital - one with a suspected broken nose and one with a suspected broken jaw. It said 23 people had been arrested. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Simms said: ""The disorder, violence and destruction has no place here in Merseyside, least of all after the tragic events that took place in Southport on Monday"". “Those who engaged in this behaviour bring nothing but shame to themselves and this city. "" More protests are expected on Sunday, though not as many as on Saturday. At a meeting of government ministers earlier on Saturday, a spokesperson for Sir Keir Starmer said the PM told those assembled that ""the right to freedom of expression and the violent disorder we have seen are two very different things."" He added: ""there is no excuse for violence of any kind and reiterated that the government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe"". On Saturday, the home secretary also warned that anyone engaging in ""unacceptable disorder” would face imprisonment and travel bans amongst other punishments, adding that ""sufficient"" prison places had been made available. ""Criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets,"" Yvette Cooper said. Police have the government's full backing in taking action against those engaging in ""thuggery"", she added. In Bristol, protesters and counter-protests were engaged in a standoff.  One group could be heard singing Rule Britannia, ""England 'til I die"" and ""we want our country back"". Beer cans were thrown at the anti-racism group, and some of the rival protesters were baton-charged by officers. Avon and Somerset Police said 14 people in the city had been arrested, with Chief Inspector Vicks Hayward-Melen anticipating there would be ""further arrests over the coming days"". In Manchester, there were scuffles with police, and at least two arrests.  While in Belfast, two people were arrested as protesters outside a mosque threw objects at members of the media and earlier smashed windows in a cafe. In Hull, protesters smashed a window at a hotel used to house asylum seekers, and bottles and eggs were thrown at police.  City Hall was placed on lockdown as the British Chess Championships took place inside. Humberside Police said three police officers had been injured and 20 people arrested after disorder in the city centre also saw shops ransacked and items set on fire. In Blackpool, protesters faced off against punks attending Rebellion Festival. There was little police presence as skirmishes broke out between the two groups, with bottles and chairs thrown.  Lancashire Police said it had arrested more than 20 people. The force said its focus had been on Blackpool but there had also been ""minor disruption"" in Blackburn and Preston. In Stoke-on-Trent, bricks were thrown at officers. Staffordshire Police said that two men at the centre of online claims they had been stabbed had actually been hit by an object that was thrown, and were not seriously injured. The force said 10 people had been arrested and three officers suffered minor injuries. Elsewhere Leicestershire Police arrested two people in Leicester city centre. And West Yorkshire Police said a protest on the Headrow in Leeds ""passed off largely without incident"", despite one arrest being made. Not all demonstrations held across the UK descended into violence on Saturday, and in some places protesters dispersed by the evening.  Saturday's protests follow a night of violence in Sunderland on Friday, which saw four police officers hospitalised.  Hundreds of people rioted, beer cans and bricks were thrown at riot police outside a mosque and a Citizens Advice office was torched. Twelve people have been arrested in connection with the violence. The BBC has identified at least 30 demonstrations being planned by far-right activists around the UK over the weekend, including a new protest in Southport. An extra 70 prosecutors are on standby this weekend to charge people arrested in connection with violent disorder. Shadow home secretary James Cleverly called on Sir Keir and the home secretary to ""do more"" to restore public order and ""send a clear message to the thugs"". Earlier this week, the prime minister announced a new national violent disorder programme to help clamp down on violent groups by allowing police forces to share intelligence. With additional reporting by BBC News reporters across England."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1e8d7llg9o,Did social media fan the flames of riot in Southport?,"False accusations about the attacker followed a familiar pattern, the BBC's Marianna Spring finds.",31 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"It’s become a familiar pattern of events: a violent, terrifying attack unfolds, innocent people are killed, and social media is set alight with unfounded - and often incorrect - accusations about the assailant's identity and what the motivation was. Think back to the stabbing attacks in Sydney earlier this year, falsely blamed on a Jewish student, or even the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July. It’s the same with Monday’s attack on a children’s holiday dance and yoga session in Southport, England. A false name - attributed to the 17-year-old accused of killing three little girls as well as injuring eight other children and two adults - spread like wildfire across X, formerly known as Twitter. The BBC is not repeating the false name here to avoid spreading misinformation. Media organisations cannot give the suspect's real name for legal reasons, but Merseyside Police have said the name shared on social media is incorrect. Nevertheless, posts on X sharing the fake name were actively promoted to users and racked up millions of views. Just as with the Sydney attacks and the attempted shooting of Mr Trump, X was the focal point for untrue claims before they spilled onto other sites. It wasn’t just this fake name either. There were false claims the attacker was a refugee who arrived in the UK by boat in 2023 and unfounded speculation he is Muslim. Some of these posts were accompanied by Islamophobic and racist hate. Merseyside Police have confirmed that the 17-year-old they have arrested was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, that he appears to have no known links to Islam, and that they are not currently investigating the attack as terror-related. This all contradicts lots of these claims - but it didn’t stop them poisoning an already toxic online atmosphere. So did these false and unfounded social media posts fan the flames of unrest in Southport? There are lots of different factors contributing to the riot - led by protesters who expressed anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views - not just social media. After all, protests and violence like this long predate the existence of the internet. Everything from political rhetoric, racism and wider anger about immigration to questions about government and police transparency and timing likely played a part. The fact that some of those at the rally decided to target Southport Mosque suggests that they may have been influenced by the unfounded online accusations that this had been an Islamist terror attack. The police themselves pointed to disinformation online as playing a part in the violence. There was discussion of the rally on regional anti-immigration channels on the Telegram app. Protest movements are often organised in closed chat groups we can’t access.  But false and unfounded claims about the attack expanded beyond the usual online spaces where these kinds of protests are organised. Content being seen by millions of X users, rather than just the fringes of social media, could also normalise some of the hate being pushed. Some of those amplifying these ideas included prominent political commentators and politicians. Others were less well-known, but with a reputation for promoting evidence-free conspiracy theories. Many of these accounts have purchased blue ticks, which means their posts feature more prominently on others' feeds. They are based all around the world too, with several right-leaning American profiles boasting hundreds of thousands of followers becoming very involved. They reshared variations of the false claims, using them to push anti-immigration views and ideas. That was in turn met by backlash denouncing the speculation - which also racked millions of views, but proportionally less than the original claims. Because the issue was picking up so much engagement, it was promoted further by X's algorithm, so that my own feed and those of several others who reached out to me were dominated with these posts as soon as they logged on to their X accounts. Some of the false claims seemed to originate not from these prominent political commentators or known conspiracy accounts though, but from anonymous profiles and pseudo-news accounts. Among the first accounts to share the false name, for example, was Channel 3 Now, which purports to be a legitimate news outlet, but whose origins are very unclear. The social media profiles belonging to the channel suggest it is based in the US or Pakistan, with little information about who actually works for the site. The site has since issued a “sincere apology and correction” following their article and posts, which says “we deeply regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused” and admitted their content was “not accurate”. They have not replied directly to the BBC’s questions. Other profiles - not using real names or images - copy-and-pasted the fake name to their own timelines across different, separate accounts to share the claim more widely. Some of these profiles seemed to belong to real users based in the UK, but others sharing this had the hallmarks of inauthentic accounts. These accounts can be automated or run by groups aiming to manipulate the online debate, and have a track record of posting only divisive content about issues like immigration. This isn’t just about pushing political agendas, either. Tragedies like this can also be exploited online to accumulate likes, views and follows - which in turn can be monetised. X has again been a focal point of this online frenzy, since the platform began allowing its paid blue-tick users to earn a portion of ad revenue for their posts. Their posts are more likely to be recommended on people's feeds, and they may be incentivised to post more controversial or sensational content to boost their views. This all seems to have had an effect on how attacks such as Southport are discussed in the hours and days after they have happened, since these kinds of frenzies are becoming more frequent and intense since the changes to X. On top of this, since Elon Musk took over the social media company, he has changed how it moderates false and hateful content - sacking dozens of employees who worked in these areas and introducing new measures like community notes provided by users to fact-check posts. X has not responded to the BBC’s request for comment. The social media company says publicly that it defends and protects users’ voices on the site. And while this is about a whole lot more than a tidal wave of social media posts, it's yet more evidence of the way the online world can inflame pre-existing tensions in the real world.  And that's a world where three little girls have had their lives cut short."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p20dl71jpo,"Rise in people fascinated by violence, police warn",UK and US officers say they are seeing threats from individuals who don't support a particular ideology.,31 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The threat from international and domestic terror presents a “breadth of challenge greater than it has ever been”, according to senior US and UK police officers who oversaw the successful prosecution of Anjem Choudary.  The Islamist preacher from east London is starting a life sentence for directing a group banned under UK terror law, and encouraging support for it online.  The officers say his case highlights the continuing danger posed by radicalisers - and the violent groups they support. But they also say counter-terrorism forces are now battling a wide diversity of threats - including from a worrying number of people who don't support an underlying ideology, but are simply drawn to violence. Young people being attracted to online extremism through conspiracy theories, the actions of “hostile states” such as Russia, and the “toxicity of our political environment” are also of concern, they warn. Following Choudary's trial, the BBC spoke exclusively to Matt Jukes, the UK’s head of counter-terrorism policing, and Rebecca Weiner, Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism at the New York Police Department. They told us that alongside extremist groups energised by events in the Middle East, the new security threats were sparking multiple investigations. It is a “palpably different picture than it was,” says Assistant Commissioner Jukes. Deputy Commissioner Weiner singles out online extremism as probably the most important aspect of what she terms an “everything, everywhere, all-at-once threat environment”. With two wars - Israel-Gaza and Ukraine - being fought in what Ms Weiner calls “a tsunami of disinformation”, she says it is hard for people to understand what is true and what is not - “and that is playing out in the realm of violence”. People are being “overwhelmed with false narratives” and fed conspiracy theories, she says. A disturbing aspect of this, says Mr Jukes, is the increasing number of those turning to terrorism because of a fascination for violence, rather than ideological fanaticism. He says in 20% of cases his officers now handle, terror suspects have no settled view of the world: “We are seeing people literally flip from searching for neo-Nazi material online to searching for Islamist material.” This is a real shift, he says, with people having previously gone from a single ideology, to extremism, and on to violence. Young people are viewing “dehumanising content”, including extreme pornography - says Mr Jukes - and being asked in online groups “to prove themselves by producing more and more extreme content”. This includes terrorist material created using artificial intelligence, he says, with gaming being one of the “gateways” into extremism online. The age profile of those drawn into this extreme environment is coming down - and he worries about “very young people who only need to take up a knife or use a vehicle as a weapon to carry out a deadly attack”. Nearly one in five of those arrested as terror suspects in the UK in the past year were under 18. Counter-terror police on both sides of the Atlantic have also been kept busy since last October’s attack by Hamas on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's health ministry. Fifty police investigations have been launched in the UK into support or encouragement of terrorism. There has also been a big increase in antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime. Government statistics for the year ending in March 2024 show terror-related arrests in the UK were up by 23% on the previous year (although they were lower than the period between 2013 to 2020). Five years ago, says Mr Jukes, he would have been kept awake primarily by fears of an IS attack in the UK, but now he says one of his main concerns would be the growing threat from “determined and shameless” state actors. For many years, he says “hostile actions of states” formed only a very small part of police and MI5 investigations. But this has grown more than fourfold since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings, says Mr Jukes, when a nerve agent was used to try to assassinate a former Russian spy and his daughter. The spy, who had defected to the West, and his daughter were badly injured - but a British woman died after coming into contact with Novichok. Russia has always denied involvement. There has also been an increased threat from parts of the Chinese state, he adds, and at least 15 foiled plots by Iran in the past two years to either kidnap or kill those in the UK it considers enemies of the regime. “If these authoritarian organs of the state feel like the UK or the US is fair [game] for them to pursue their adversities, then everything we stand for in terms of being a safe, liberal democracy is challenged,” says Mr Jukes. The two police chiefs also point to “toxicity” in the political environment, which has led to politicians becoming targets of violence - including two British MPs murdered in terror attacks, and the failed assassination of Donald Trump at a campaign rally on 13 July. I ask if there is any reassuring news amid this scary picture of dispersed danger. People can “take a degree of comfort”, says Mr Jukes, that since the attacks in London and Manchester in 2017, “that terrible year”, police have disrupted nearly 40 “terrorist plots”. “And we are doing that month-in, month-out, with real efficiency and effectiveness.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce93vlen9w6o,Australia appoints special envoy to tackle antisemitism,The government said the advisory role will help allay rising community tension over the Israel-Gaza war.,9 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Australia has appointed a special envoy to combat antisemitism and preserve ""social cohesion"", amid rising community tension over the Israel-Gaza war. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced lawyer and businesswoman Jillian Segal would consult with community leaders and discrimination experts to advise the government. It follows in the footsteps of countries like the US, Canada, Greece and the UK, which have all had similar positions for years. A special envoy for addressing Islamophobia will also be appointed soon, Mr Albanese added. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has become a volatile political issue in Australia. It has resulted in protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as a sharp uptick in Islamophobia and antisemitism. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.  More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. “Australians are deeply concerned about this conflict, and many are hurting. In times like this, Australians must come together, not be torn apart,"" Mr Albanese said on Tuesday. The appointment of Ms Segal - who has headed several key bodies representing the Jewish community and served in leadership roles in the education and banking sectors - is a ""critical step"" in easing friction, he said. Ms Segal said combatting the ""age-old hatred"" of antisemitism has never been more important, pointing to a 700% rise in incidences since the war began in October. “Jewish Australians want to feel free to live their day-to-day lives, and also want to feel safe to practice and express their religion without fear,"" she added. The announcement has been welcomed by the national peak body for the Australian Jewish community - a group Ms Segal led until last year - who say she will ""will bring deep knowledge of the issues and immense energy to the role"". However other groups - including The Jewish Council of Australia, which has been critical of Israel's actions in Gaza, and The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) - say they fear it will worsen division. ""It also risks further entrenching the concerning pattern of antisemitism being conflated with criticism of the state of Israel or with support for Palestine,"" APAN said. The Australian government supports a two-state solution, and in the wake of the 7 October attacks loudly supported Israel's right to defend itself. However in recent months it has increasingly voiced concerns about the country's military campaign in Gaza - including after an Australian aid worker was killed alongside six others in an Israeli air strike. Australia's governing Labor party has also experienced growing tensions, with one senator last week quitting its ranks over its stance on the war. Fatima Payman said she had been ""exiled"" after breaking party rules to vote against the government in support of a motion calling for the recognition of Palestinian statehood."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g37mk7vxlo,Are deep shifts in Muslim and Jewish voting here to stay?,"In the 2024 UK general election, Labour suffered some surprise seat losses over its stance on Gaza.",7 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"However big the headline change in the vote between the past two elections, drill down into two demographic pockets of Britain and you find staggering shifts. It all centres around the relationships between the Labour Party and not just Muslim voters, but Jewish voters too. It leaves a party in government that has made progress in winning back trust among people from one faith group while suddenly finding itself with a lot of work to do to win back many members of the other. The drop in the Labour vote share among British Muslims between 2019 and 2024 very obviously played out in several constituencies. This happened most dramatically in Leicester South, with a Muslim population close to 30%, where Shadow Paymaster General Jon Ashworth lost his seat to independent Shockat Adam. In the seat of Dewsbury and Batley, in Birmingham Perry Barr and in Blackburn, there were wins for independents in what had been safe Labour seats with large numbers of Muslim voters. In places like Bradford West and the seat of Bethnal Green and Stepney in east London, sitting Labour MPs clung on with startling reductions in their majorities. Mish Rahman, from Walsall, is not just any Muslim voter. He currently sits on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party, a body of fewer than 40 members. He is furious with the party’s response to the killing of tens of thousands of people in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there. “In my community it has got to the point where I am now embarrassed about my affiliation with Labour,” he says. “It was hard even to tell members of my own extended family to go and knock on doors to tell people to vote for a party that originally gave Israel carte blanche in its response to the horrific 7 October attacks,” says Mr Rahman. He lays the blame for the decline in Muslim voting for Labour squarely at the door of the Labour leader. Sir Keir Starmer was criticised by many in his party, including councillors, for an interview with LBC in October in which he suggested that Israel “had the right” to withhold power and water in Gaza. His spokesman subsequently suggested the Labour leader had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence. Then when Labour MPs were told by the party leadership in November to abstain from voting on an SNP-led motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, some Labour councillors resigned and, for many Muslims, trust in their Labour MP was lost. Faith communities are far from homogenous, of course. There are myriad factors that govern how a person will cast their vote, but faith does throw up a unique set of considerations that plays out in broad voting patterns. Muslims are estimated to form around 6.5% of the population of England and Wales, with around 2% in Scotland and 1% in Northern Ireland. Well over 80% of Muslims are believed to have voted for Labour in 2019. Research just ahead of the 2024 election suggested that had dropped nationally by up to 20 percentage points, and in some constituencies the Muslim vote for Labour clearly fell further. The contrast with Jewish voting data could not be more stark. In 2019, the proportion of British Jews (about 0.5% of the population) who voted for a Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn is thought to have collapsed to just single figures. Research suggests that figure could have climbed back to above 40%. “What we have seen is a huge bounce-back for Labour among Jewish voters,” says Adam Langleben, who was until recently the national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement. Mr Langleben, a former Labour councillor and now director of Progressive Britain (formerly Progress), points to Labour wins in London in the Finchley and Golders Green seat and also Hendon as well as Bury South in Greater Manchester, all constituencies with large Jewish populations. “Jewish voters returning to the party has undoubtedly delivered seats to the Labour Party,” says Mr Langleben. “You don’t need a majority of Jewish voters to win in these constituencies, but you also can’t only have 7% of them voting for you and expect to win,” he says. Mr Langleben had been a senior member of the Jewish Labour Movement but was one of many Jewish members of the party to give up their membership during the Corbyn era. When he left in 2019, he said it was on account of the party being “led by antisemites”, an accusation always strongly denied by those leading the party at the time. “It was a situation that was all-consuming. I would be canvassing for the Labour Party in a Jewish area and had people in tears on the doorstep saying there was no way they could vote for Jeremy Corbyn, and I was trying to juggle this huge personal tension,” he says. Mr Langleben puts Mr Corbyn’s problems down to both a lack of personal reflection about who he was associating with, and what he says was the party’s inability to deal with extreme elements in its base and tolerance of the use of antisemitic tropes. “From day one, Keir Starmer pledged to work with the Jewish community to try to deal with the issues inside the Labour Party. For him, fixing what went wrong was a personal mission,” he says. But given that Keir Starmer supported Jeremy Corbyn throughout his leadership, Jewish voters at hustings in synagogues and community centres around the country had been grilling Labour candidates as to why they should trust the current leader now. “The Jewish vote is now split and that’s how it should be. The results show there wasn’t a dominant party of choice, and that’s healthy, and still represents a huge transformation for Labour,” says Mr Langleben. So while mistrust clearly still remains, what is responsible for the transformation in the perception of the Labour Party among some British Jews? The fact that the current leadership’s criticism of Israel’s response to the 7 October attacks has been more tempered than it may have been under the previous leadership may have contributed. But long before that, Mr Langleben cites a change in the way complaints around “protected characteristics” like faith are dealt with by the party, but also refers to one thing that convinced him he was right to re-join the party. “The fundamental moment was Jeremy Corbyn being suspended from the Labour Party and then subsequently having the whip removed, because it showed Keir Starmer’s determination and his willingness to take on parts of the party that previously he had not been willing to take on,” he says. Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension is precisely identified by Mr Rahman too as the first major showdown between different wings of the party under Keir Starmer. Except, as someone who had been inspired by Mr Corbyn from the days of Stop the War protests in the lead-up to the UK-backed invasion of Iraq in 2003, Mr Rahman was on the other side, saying that was the moment when the alarm bells started ringing for him that the party leaders were not safeguarding the values he believed in. Mr Rahman does not see the party’s anti-Muslim slant as being limited to its response to events in Gaza. He does not question there have been serious cases of antisemitism but does not believe all accusations of racism are treated equally. “There is a clear hierarchy of racism in the Labour Party. Some instances of racism, including Islamophobia, aren't taken as seriously as they should,” he says. Mr Rahman cites the case of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the EHRC, who was suspended for alleged Islamophobia. Mr Phillips had said British Muslims were “a nation within a nation” and previously that their opinion was “some distance away from the centre of gravity of everybody else’s”, though later he suggested this had not necessarily been meant as a criticism. Mr Phillips was readmitted to the party in 2021 without it going to a panel inquiry. Mr Rahman, like many other Muslims, also points to Keir Starmer’s own comments, like those made in a Sun livestream during the election campaign, when he talked of migrants being sent back to the countries they came from. “At the moment, people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed because they’re not being processed,” the Labour leader said. “Can you imagine the Labour Party saying that about people of any other ethnicity? Saying they're going to deport people to Israel or Ukraine or Hong Kong? It wouldn’t happen and neither should it,” says Mr Rahman. Such is his disenchantment with Labour’s response that, coupled with wider concerns regarding the treatment of Muslims, he lays a serious charge against the party. “I don’t doubt for a minute that Labour is currently institutionally Islamophobic,” says Mr Rahman. Mr Rahman wants to use his voice to call out hypocrisy in the party while in government, in the hope that it will learn what he says is a lesson of this election - that no voter can be taken for granted. Mr Rahman did give up his membership of the Labour Party once before, in protest at Tony Blair’s role in the Iraq War. He, and other Muslims, felt persuaded to come back to the party in 2014 when the then-leader Ed Miliband condemned the scale of an Israeli operation in Gaza and the hundreds of civilian deaths. Once again, at the same moment, Mr Langleben was seeing things very differently on the doorsteps of Jewish voters. Even though Mr Miliband was himself Jewish, it was a time when polls were showing a rapid decline in Jewish support for Labour, particularly when the party’s 2015 manifesto talked about a parliamentary vote to recognise a Palestinian state. “There were sometimes quite horrible conversations with Jewish voters who really cared about the issue of Israel,” says Mr Langleben. “People in 2015 were accusing the Labour Party of antisemitism, but I think it fundamentally misread what antisemitism is. Then, it was a primarily about a foreign policy issue, Israel. That changed by 2019 when conversations were around a particular strain of far-left anti-Jewish racism,” says Mr Langleben. For some of those supportive of the Corbyn-era leadership, that sense that criticism of Israel was being conflated with antisemitism was also something they felt occurred while he was leader. The Hamas attacks of the 7 October 2023 happened during the week of the Labour Party conference and Mr Langleben says it was strange to see normal political business go on while he and other Jewish delegates were going through a difficult and upsetting period. Ultimately, Mr Langleben says he has been pleased with the way Keir Starmer has handled the crisis, seeing it as Labour realigning itself with UK and US government policy on Israel. This is precisely why during this election campaign, Mr Rahman had the hardest conversations on the doorsteps of Muslim voters he had ever had, with anger and frustration boiling over about Israel’s actions in Gaza. “If you look back at the history of the relationship between our communities and the Labour Party, it's always been a one-sided affair of loyalty from our communities,” Mr Rahman says. The Labour Party’s roots in his own family go back to his grandfather, who was a factory worker in the 1950s and 60s. Mr Rahman talks of feeling “betrayed”. Gaza of course is not just a Muslim issue, and not all Muslims ranked it is one of the key considerations on which they voted, but it had an impact. Similarly, Israel policy is not necessarily a major consideration for all Jewish voters, and even for those for whom it is, there are those who are highly critical of the Israeli government and are at odds with the response of Labour under Starmer. But while over the decades the Jewish vote has swung between the two main parties broadly in line with the general population, it would appear that if one puts to one side all of the rows over antisemitism, the party’s outlook on Israel does impact voting intention. Separately, both Mish Rahman and Adam Langleben are very clear that their accusations of discrimination levelled at the party in different eras do not just relate to party policy on the Middle East. Even if everyone can be satisfied that accusations of discrimination are dealt with equally, such are the modern tensions around Middle East policy that political parties may struggle to find a position that does not alienate some members of one of these faith communities. Labour has achieved much in winning back the levels of Jewish voters it has, but it has also left huge swathes of loyal Muslim voters in Britain feeling politically adrift, and large swings in culture and policy over recent years leave many in each community needing convincing of the true nature of the party.

The American, who last month was banned for a year from boxing following an anti-doping violation, made the comments on X's spaces platform, which allows people to have live audio conversations. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman said in a statement: ""Exercising my authority as president of the WBC, I am hereby expelling Ryan Garcia from any activity with our organisation. ""We reject any form of discrimination."" In a since deleted post on X, Garcia, 25, wrote: ""I was trolling, I want all the killing to stop. I love everyone, sorry if I offended you."" The American has not responded to the WBC's expulsion. After Garcia was handed a one-year doping ban by the New York State Athletic Commission, Sulaiman said the WBC would not issue its own suspension or ""punish"" him because of concerns about his mental health. It was not immediately clear what the expulsion from the WBC would entail. BBC Sport has asked the WBC for comment. Garcia failed multiple drug tests around his fight with Devin Haney in April. As well as a one-year ban, Garcia's upset victory over former undisputed lightweight champion Haney was overturned to a no-contest. Garcia's family released its own statement saying his comments ""do not align with his, or our family's, true character or beliefs"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c880l1ddpzgo,How a Gaza 'stunt' divided Australia's parliament,"A senator says she has been ""exiled"" for voting against her party to recognise Palestinian statehood.",2 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"When Fatima Payman crossed the Senate floor to vote against her government she knew it would come with consequences. The Australian Labor party has strict penalties for those who undermine its collective positions, and acts of defiance can lead to expulsion - a precedent with a 130-year history. The last time one of its politicians tested the waters while in power was before Ms Payman was born. But last Tuesday, the 29-year-old did just that - joining the Greens party and independent senators to support a motion on Palestinian statehood. Officially the Australian government supports a two-state solution, but did not back the motion after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be “as part of a peace process”. Within hours, Ms Payman had been temporarily suspended from her party room, by the end of the week it would become indefinite - after she publicly vowed to cross the floor again if given the opportunity. ""By her own actions and statements, Senator Payman has placed herself outside the privilege that comes with participating in the federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus,"" a government spokesperson said. Prime Minister and Labor leader Anthony Albanese was more concise: “No individual is bigger than the team.” On Monday, Ms Payman responded by saying she had been ""exiled"" – explaining that she had been removed from caucus meetings, group chats and all committees. The dismissal of the senator, elected in what was billed as Australia’s most diverse parliament to date, has drawn a mixed response and raised questions - mainly, whether it’s practical or fair for politicians to toe the line on issues affecting their communities. Ms Payman stands out in Australia’s parliament. The first and only hijab-wearing federal politician, she has been described as the embodiment of some of the nation’s most marginalised: a young woman, a migrant, a Muslim. She recounted crossing the Senate floor as ""the most difficult decision"" of her political career, adding that each step of her short walk had “felt like a mile”. However, the 29-year-old said she was “proud” of what she had done, and “bitterly disappointed” others hadn't followed. ""I walked with my Muslim brothers and sisters who told me they have felt unheard for far too long,"" she said. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 23 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. This has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. As has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as a sharp uptick in Islamophobia and antisemitism. The senator's move has drawn both praise and criticism. Anne Aly - who became the first Muslim woman to be elected in Australia’s parliament in 2016 - and has been a fierce advocate for an end to the conflict in Gaza, said she disagreed with Ms Payman’s approach. “I choose to do things in a way I think will make a material difference on the ground. Fatima chooses to do it her way,"" she told news outlet the ABC. But Josh Burns - a Jewish Labor MP from Melbourne - who has a different world view from Ms Payman when it comes to issues such as Palestinian statehood, has been one of her biggest supporters. “Parliamentarians come from different communities and backgrounds, and trying to balance all those perspectives isn't easy, but we must be an example to the Australian community about how to debate difficult issues respectfully.” The nation’s Islamic bodies have also issued a joint statement describing Ms Payman’s actions as “courageous” and calling on the Labor party to “echo the voices of the people it represents”. ""Political calculations and attempts to walk both sides have devastating consequences in Palestine and will ultimately end in failure,” it read. But Mr Albanese called the resolution a ""stunt"", adding: ""We need actually real solutions... this stunt from the Greens was designed to put Fatima Payman in a difficult position. It was designed to do that."" Mr Albanese’s penalty against Ms Payman has been more lenient than the complete expulsion that party rules require. And he’s left the door open for her to re-enter the fold if she’s willing to change course: “Fatima Payman is welcome to return to participating in the team if she accepts she's a member of it,” he said in an interview on Monday. Australian politicians have voted against their own beliefs to fall in line with party politics before. LGBTQ+ MPs - including current Foreign Minister Penny Wong - felt a similar conflict in the Labor caucus back in the days when it officially opposed gay marriage. It’s an issue that has opened Ms Wong up to personal attacks, but she’s remained adamant that quiet advocacy from within the party - rather than public criticism - is the preferred route. And she says it was a decade of doing just that which saw same-sex marriage legalised. “Even when we disagree, we have those arguments internally, as you saw over many years in the marriage equality debate. That’s what I did, and I think that’s the right way to go about it,” she told the ABC. But when asked whether she should have followed precedent, Ms Payman said: “It took 10 years to legislate same-sex marriage... These Palestinians do not have 10 years."" The contrasting approaches represent the changing demands of the Australian public, according to Kos Samaras - one of the nation’s leading pollsters. He says a growing cohort of young, multicultural voters are increasingly aligning themselves with politicians who aren’t afraid to take a stance on causes their constituents are “passionate about”. He also argues that migrant communities are no longer willing to accept political messaging that effectively urges them to “keep their head down”. “Australia has had a terrible history, whether from a societal perspective or political parties - that whenever someone from a diverse background expresses their view, overwhelmingly they’re told to pull their head in.” “That’s a formula that kind of works when a new group of people migrate to a country and want to keep a low profile as they’re establishing a new life – it’s not going to work with those migrant’s kids. And that’s exactly who we’re talking about. “These are people who have grown up in a country that has often made them feel like outsiders, and they’re no longer prepared to keep silent,” he adds, noting recent polling from his team which found that many young Australian-Muslim women feel they lack a political voice. A refugee whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, it’s a sentiment that Ms Payman says guides her politics. “I was not elected as a token representative of diversity,” she said after her temporary suspension last week. “I was elected to serve the people of Western Australia and uphold the values instilled in me by my late father.” Ms Payman says that she believes the government is freezing her out to “intimidate” her into resigning. But Mr Albanese is adamant that his decision is the right one, while emphasising that it is not about Ms Payman’s “policy position” but rather, her decision to “undermine” her party. For the time being at least, the young lawmaker has vowed to “abstain from voting on Senate matters… unless a matter of conscience arises where I'll uphold the true values and principles of the Labor Party.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck5g74jr59eo,SZA’s striking set failed to set Glastonbury alight,"The US R&B star shone, but drew the smallest-ever audience for a headline set on the Pyramid Stage.",1 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"After Dua Lipa and Coldplay's sleek and efficient sets, Glastonbury's Sunday night headliner had a tough act to follow. After a rumoured appearance by pop queen Madonna fell through, the slot eventually went to US R&B star SZA. One of the most-streamed artists in the world, she's a vibrant, confident performer, whose complex, messy dissections of modern relationships have endeared her to millennial fans. But their passion failed to ignite any magic on the Pyramid Stage. The star drew the smallest audience I've ever seen for a Glastonbury headliner, in more than 20 years of coming to the festival. It didn't help that, for at least the first half an hour, her microphone was both distorted and muffled - an issue for an artist whose appeal lies in the precision of her lyrics and the beauty of their jazzy vocal runs. The 33-year-old also committed the festival sin of failing to address the crowd. Her only interaction in the show's first act was to ask if any of her ""day one"" fans were present.  ""You know I need you, right?” she said, perhaps acknowledging that this was not her natural audience. By the time she got to her biggest hit - the darkly comic murder fantasy Kill Bill  (1.9 billion Spotify streams) - people had already drifted away to watch sets from The National, James Blake and London Grammar elsewhere on the site. That's not to say that SZA put on a bad performance, or that the thousands who stayed to the end of her set were disappointed.  She has spectacular vocal command, projecting to the back of the field without sacrificing intimacy. Towards the middle of her set, she played Nobody Gets Me - a devastating ballad about her struggle to let go after breaking up with her fiancé. It was by some distance the most vulnerable, moving performance I saw from a Pyramid Stage headliner all weekend. Young fans in the audience clasped their hands to their chest and mouthed along silently.  Other highlights included the brittle, rock-infused F2F and the 80s-infused pop smash Kiss Me More - which she fused with Prince's Kiss. It was a visual feast, too, divided into three distinct sections that mapped out the process of getting over a broken heart.  She started in a dingy cave, the metaphorical fortress of her own solitude, surrounded by stalactites and performing Drew Barrymore while perched on a giant ant. For the second section, dubbed ""robot world"", she struggled with conflicting emotions, simultaneously pining for her ex and wishing pain upon him, in songs like Snooze, Kill Bill and I Hate U. The final segment was titled ""Coming Home"". SZA, sprouted wings, climbed a tree, and played some of her more liberated, feel-good songs - including Saturn (about escaping the earth for a better life) and the self-explanatory Good Days.  Her final song was 20 Something, a declaration of solidarity for anyone else going through the turmoil of their third decade and she climbed down from her elaborate set and sang in communion with her fans in the front row. ""Glastonbury, I was so nervous about today,"" she said. ""I'm so grateful. You have my deepest love and my deepest respect. God bless you and please get home safely."" With sinuous choregraphy and a compelling stage presence, SZA's set was a sublime show in the wrong venue - a problem that has repeatedly blighted this year's Glastonbury. Beloved acts like Sugababes, Fred Again and Avril Lavigne were booked into areas too small to handle their fans; while the Pyramid Stage struggled to attract sufficient numbers for compelling, muscular sets by PJ Harvey and Janelle Monae. In the end, it's a shame that those performances, like SZA's will go down in history for the wrong reasons. After the set, the singer posted a message that seemed to acknowledge the negative response. ""The bravery required to be alive in public is remarkable,"" she wrote on X (formerly Twitter).  ""S/O [shout out to] everybody doing that."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Shania Twain played the coveted Legends slot, delivering big, brassy anthems like That Don't Impress Me Much and Man! I Feel Like A Woman! while conveying a wide-eyed disbelief at the size of her audience. ""I find moments like this very life-changing and I mean that very sincerely,"" she said, choking back tears towards the end of her set. Over on the Other Stage, Avril Lavigne was just as popular, causing major traffic jams as fans clamoured to hear era-defining pop-punk hits like Complicated and Sk8r Boi. She kicked off with the brilliantly snotty Girlfriend, and the cartoonish sneer remaining plastered across her face for the next hour. “I can’t believe it’s taken me 22 years to play Glastonbury,” she said. “It’s about time”. Janelle Monae played a tight, funky set on the Pyramid Stage - going through multiple costume changes, including a replica Michael Jackson suit. Lithe and limber, she celebrated her sexual freedom on songs like Pink, Yoga, Lipstick Lover and Make Me Feel, while dedicating her set to the queer community, in the final hours of Pride month.  Later, she expanded that dedication to other marginalised and persecuted groups around the world. “I am proud to stand with you as you fight back against genocide,” she said. “As you fight back against the criminalisation of homeless people. As [politicians] bring in laws to [regulate] our bodies.” She went on to call for an end to violence in Palestine, Sudan and the Congo - while also calling out anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. “These are our people. So when we see injustice, we know,” she declared. It was a powerful moment, expressed more eloquently than many of this weekend’s onstage protests. She was followed onstage by Nigerian star Burna Boy, in party-starting mood as he raced through Afro-fusion hits like Sittin’ On Top Of The World, Ye and Last Last. Flirting with the audience throughout, he eventually removed his top and invited everyone else to follow suit. If it had been warmer, they might have obliged. Headline sets came from French dance maestros Justice on the West Holts stage and indie-pop group London Grammar, who drew an enormous crowd to the hillside Park Stage, despite singer Hannah Reid's misgivings about being scheduled against SZA. But the biggest headliners, in terms of audience size, were US indie band The National, who immersed The Other Stage with epic guitars, rich horns, and Matt Berninger’s emotive confessional words.  From the intimate Light Years, to the pounding Abel, their grown-up sound and  intense delivery capped off an uneven Sunday, as Glastonbury prepared to shut up shop for another year. The festival will return in 2025, Emily Eavis has confirmed, before taking a fallow year in 2026."

The Traveller Movement added these communities faced ""chronic democratic underrepresentation"". Leeanne Morgan, 48, part of the Gypsy community, said people like her just want to be treated ""like everybody else"". The Electoral Commission is supporting a campaign to push more people from Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities to vote, saying they were ""less likely"" to be registered.  The mother-of-two said there were many barriers which her community faced, with many left feeling like ""second-class citizens"". ""There's only so long that you can stand up, you can ask and fight for things that you want,"" she added. Leeanne, who lives with her family on a site in south Pembrokeshire, said politicians did not visit sites while on the campaign trail. ""I think they forget that they are their constituents as well. I mean, historically, Gypsy and Traveller sites are out of the way and sort of push to the side.  ""Unless you've lived within the community for a long, long time, you wouldn't know that they're there,"" she said. There are about 3,630 Gypsy and Irish Traveller people living in Wales, with the highest proportions in Cardiff and Pembrokeshire. According to the latest census in 2021, 73% live in a house or flat and 27% live in a caravan or mobile home. Political rhetoric and language was also creating barriers, according to Leeanne. She has worked with officials to advocate for her community, and said too much jargon was used by political leaders and campaigners. ""I think they need to take into consideration how they're speaking to the people, to the people that are going to be voting them into power, so that they know, and everything is explained properly,"" she said. Grace Preston is one of those behind Operation Traveller Vote – a push to empower members of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities to vote in the upcoming election. ""Members of the community don't feel like constituents, but rather political footballs dragged out for politicians' campaigns,"" the senior policy officer added. The organisation behind the campaign, The Traveller Movement, said members of these communities' faced ""chronic democratic underrepresentation and huge levels of discrimination"". ""If you don't feel like an active constituent in a community, you disengage and don't get involved, our job is to show how you can use your vote and voice,"" she added. Alongside the campaign, the Traveller Movement has produced its own manifesto with recommendations on how all political parties can prioritise the communities' needs in areas such as health and education. The group has been visiting UK cities and knocking on doors at Traveller sites to help overcome any literacy or digital literacy issues. ""We have our own manifesto and questions that people should ask politicians... giving people that power to have a voice for themselves is super important,"" she said. The campaign has been supported by The Electoral Commission, the independent body which oversees elections. ""Everyone should be able to participate in elections, but our research shows that some groups are less likely to be registered to vote and to own an accepted form of ID, including Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities,"" a spokesperson added. Plaid Cymru said: ""Romani, [Gypsy], Roma and Irish Traveller communities are too often used as a political football."" ""We are committed to combating Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-migrant sentiment, anti-Gypsy and Roma Traveller sentiment, and all forms of racism and bigotry in politics and in wider society,"" a spokesperson added. The party said politicians of all parties had a duty to engage with all communities in their areas, and encourage everyone to participate in elections. Both Labour and the Conservatives have been asked to comment."

Secret recordings published by Channel 4 show a canvasser working to get Reform UK leader Nigel Farage elected as MP for Clacton using a racial slur to refer to the prime minister - who is of Indian origin. Reform UK said those making ""unacceptable comments"" will no longer be part of Mr Farage's campaign. Speaking to reporters, Mr Sunak said ""my two daughters have to see and hear Reform people who campaigned for Nigel Farage"" using racist language against him.  ""It hurts. And it makes me angry,"" he said. Mr Farage ""has some questions to answer,"" he added. ""When you see Reform candidates and campaigners, seemingly using racist and misogynistic language and opinions seemingly without challenge, I think it tells you something about the culture within the Reform Party."" In responding to the comments, Mr Sunak chose to repeat the racist term, saying: “I do it deliberately and I hate having to do it.  ""I chose my words deliberately and I hate having to repeat them, absolutely hate it but I also think it’s important to call this out for what it is and be clear about what it is."" Essex Police have confirmed they are ""urgently assessing"" comments made by Reform campaigners in Channel 4's footage ""to establish if there are any criminal offences"". Footage broadcast by Channel 4 shows racist and Islamophobic slurs apparently being made by Andrew Parker, identified as a canvasser for Mr Farage. Mr Parker tells an undercover reporter he has ""always been a Tory voter"" but he is ""annoyed"" by Mr Sunak, who he referred to using a racial slur. Mr Parker is also heard describing Islam as ""the most disgusting cult out"" and suggesting army recruits should carry out “target practice” by shooting at small boats bringing illegal migrants to the UK. At one point Mr Parker tells voters Reform would be ""kicking all the Muslims out of the mosques and turning them into Wetherspoons"". During campaigning, he advises the undercover reporter to use the term ""illegal"" when discussing immigration, especially when addressing non-white households.

Mr Parker said: “I have never discussed immigration with either Nigel Farage or the Reform Party and that any comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. “I would therefore like to apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention."" Mr Farage has claimed Channel 4's undercover filming was a ""total set up"", with Mr Parker a hired actor. He initially condemned the remarks as ""appalling"" and said anyone making  ""reprehensible"" comments will ""no longer be with the campaign"". But speaking to the BBC, Mr Farage said Mr Parker's behaviour in the Channel 4 report did not ""ring true"". He said Mr Parker ""came out with an endless stream of invective"", adding ""no one speaks like that, it went on and on and on"". ""I looked at his website, I saw some videos, he's a very well-spoken actor.... but he does what he calls ""rough speaking"".  From the moment he arrived in the office and he bowled up and spoke to me he was rough-speaking. He was acting from the moment he came into the office."" Responding to Mr Farage's comments, Channel 4 News said: ""We strongly stand by our rigorous and duly impartial journalism which speaks for itself. “We met Mr Parker for the first time at Reform UK party headquarters, where he was a Reform party canvasser. ""We did not pay the Reform UK canvasser or anyone else in this report. Mr Parker was not known to Channel 4 News and was filmed covertly via the undercover operation.” Mr Parker told the PA news agency that his comments were ""typical chaps-down-the-pub talk"". ""I’m not a racist. I’ve had Muslim girlfriends,"" Mr Parker added. He said he made the remarks in the ""heat of the moment"" because he was being ""goaded on"" - and asked whether he would like to apologise, he says: “Of course I’m sorry. They were off-the-cuff things that everyone says.” He says he has “a lot of Pakistani friends” and “Muslim friends”, and that he is “sick to death” of being asked about the footage. The secret recordings feature a conversation between what appears to be Reform UK organisers, including a man Channel 4 named as George Jones - longtime party activist who organises events for Mr Farage. In the footage Mr Jones calls a Pride flag on a police car as a ""degenerate flag"". He repeatedly suggests members of the LGBT+ community are paedophiles and criticises police attending Pride. He adds that, should Reform UK form a future government, “our police officers will be paramilitaries, they won’t be police” and should “bring back the noose”. Speaking to ITV's Loose Women, Mr Farage called the comments ""vulgar, drunk and wrong"" and claimed people in the group were ""gone"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11xxn833yo,Muslim millionaire gives major donation to Reform UK,"As well as being a donor, Zia Yusuf will also have a public role for Reform UK during the campaign.",20 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Muslim entrepreneur has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to Reform UK, claiming the UK has ""lost control of our borders”. The precise amount Zia Yusuf has given to the party has not been disclosed but Reform UK claims it is the biggest donation of their general election campaign so far. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has faced criticism from Muslim organisations after he said a growing number of Muslims do not share British values. When asked by the BBC about critics labelling some in Reform UK racist, Mr Yusuf said the party leadership ""feel very strongly that we should protect British values and put British people of all religions and creeds first."" As well as being a donor, the BBC understands the 37-year-old will have a public role for Reform UK during the campaign. In an interview with The Telegraph, which first reported the story of his donation, Mr Yusuf said: ""I love Britain and I'm a patriot, a British Muslim patriot, which I believe the vast majority of Muslims in the UK are."" Mr Yusuf, who earned an estimated £31m from selling his luxury concierge app Velocity Black last year, told the BBC he believed ""unsustainable"" net migration levels were making it harder for legal migrants to integrate and overwhelming the NHS. ""We have lost control of our borders. That's my view. And I think it's an objective statement,"" he told the BBC. The entrepreneur, whose parents came to Britain from Sri Lanka in the 1980s and worked in the NHS, told the BBC ""we need a grown-up discussion about immigration without name-calling"". He said it was his ""patriotic duty"" to fund Nigel Farage and Reform UK. Last month, Mr Farage told Sky News: “We have a growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values, [who] in fact loathe much of what we stand for.”  Asked if he was talking about Muslims, he said: “We are."" Zara Mohammed, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, accused him of deploying “horribly Islamophobic, racist and hate-filled rhetoric of misinformation”. Reform UK said Mr Yusuf's donation was given “very recently” as a single lump sum so it has not yet shown up in Electoral Commission donation figures. In the first week of the campaign, Reform UK raised £140,000, compared to Labour's £927,000 the Conservatives £575,000 and the Lib Dems £455,000, the Electoral Commission reported. Born in Scotland, Mr Yusuf moved with his parents to the south of England and won a partial scholarship to attend the private Hampton School in Middlesex. After working at Goldman Sachs, he quit his high-paying job to start Velocity Black with an old school friend. Until recently, he was a Conservative Party member but left due to Rishi Sunak's government's inability to ""make difficult decisions."" Despite parallels with Mr Sunak - both sons of migrants who entered finance after attending elite fee-paying schools - Mr Yusuf said the PM can no longer ""credibly govern"". ""Whatever is in the hearts of Conservative leaders, the reality is they are so disunited, and when there is so much infighting in the party,"" he said."

Keith Mason was due to represent The Workers Party of Britain, led by George Galloway, in Wakefield and Rothwell on 4 July in the general election.  Mr Galloway confirmed he had sacked the former prop for the messages, with Mr Mason issuing an apology.  ""I absolutely 100% respect all my Muslim brothers and sisters,"" he said.  Mr Mason, who played for Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, St Helens, Castleford Tigers and Huddersfield Giants, is reported to have insulted the religion in a number of tweets sent in reply to other X accounts.  In an apology, he posted: ""I’ve grown up with Muslims my whole life I see them as my brothers and sisters, and not one of them would say I was Islamophobic ever!"" He said he was a Roman Catholic who respected all beliefs, adding: ""I don’t have to agree with other religions like you wouldn’t with mine but I absolutely 100% respect all my Muslim brothers and sisters."" He concluded: ""I apologise to anyone who misinterpreted a conversation that came across that way."" Confirming his sacking, Mr Galloway posted: ""Mason apologised for his historic tweets which were published when he was indeed guilty of anti-Islamic bigotry. ""It seems repentance is not enough in the elections game however. So he's gone."" Mr Mason retired from rugby league in 2013 to pursue an acting career, appearing in the BBC crime drama series Peaky Blinders. His name will still appear on the ballot paper alongside The Workers Party of Britain as the deadline for candidates to be nominated has passed.

Demonstrators, some masked, have been camped outside Newcastle University since 4 May and occupied one of its buildings at the end of May. Members of the university's Jewish Society say they no longer feel safe on the site and some have resorted to hiding their traditional dress. A spokesman for the demonstrators said they did not intend people to feel ""intimidated"". The protest reached a climax on 29 May when a group of about 50 protestors occupied Newcastle University's Armstrong Building. Northumbria Police said a number of them caused ""considerable disruption"" in the city centre later that evening and three people were arrested. A representative of the university's Jewish Society, who wished to remain anonymous because of concerns for their safety, said: ""We are appalled at the recent escalations taken by the encampment, which has made it a terrifying time to be Jewish at Newcastle University. ""We avoid the camp where possible, but we refuse to be pushed out of our campus. ""We are here to study and that is what we would like to be able to do without hearing hate speech against us daily."" They added that ""those of us that are visibly Jewish are especially fearful"" and have taken to tucking their Star of David necklaces and traditional tassels into their clothes and wearing hats to hide their brimless kippah caps. A spokesman for the demonstrators, who was hiding his identify during the protest, said they only wore masks while on the encampment or while carrying out an action such as occupying a building. ""In day-to-day life and the running of the camp people are generally not wearing masks and, in the sense, we as a camp have very strict procedures and protocols on discrimination,"" he said. ""That's all discrimination - antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian discrimination. ""If any student is feeling intimidated we want to adjust that and we want to do some outreach for them.""

Sharifah Rahman was due to represent the party in the Cardiff South and Penarth constituency.  The party said the content of the social media posts ""do not reflect the views and values of Plaid Cymru"". BBC Wales has not been able to reach Ms Rahman for comment.  As this has happened so near to the close of nominations, Ms Rahman's name will remain on the ballot as Plaid candidate, but without support from the party. A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: “Plaid Cymru has consistently condemned both the actions of Hamas terrorists on October 7 and the subsequent horrific bombardment of Gaza by the Israeli Government.  ""We reaffirm our calls for an immediate ceasefire, the unimpeded distribution of humanitarian aid and the cessation of arms sales to Israel. “Plaid Cymru will continue to campaign for a just peace and a two-state solution – including the recognition of the state of Palestine, and a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7228qnz555o,Greens drop some candidates after online posts probe,"The party says it has blocked a ""small number"" of candidates after allegations of antisemitism online.",7 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Green Party says it has blocked a ""small number"" of election candidates after an investigation into their online activity.  The party was still examining previous social media posts hours before nominations closed at 16.00 BST on Friday. It was already known that four candidates are not running, after a probe into reports of antisemitic or extreme comments. But it is not yet clear whether, or how many any, other candidates have been dropped. Co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the BBC on Thursday that four candidates were ""no longer standing,"" without specifying whether they had been dropped or withdrew themselves.  It comes as The Times reports party officials were examining nearly 20 candidates over online material on Thursday night, less than 24 hours before the deadline.   In a statement, the party said it had taken ""decisive action"" against a ""small number of people who did put themselves forward"". ""We would never allow anybody antisemitic to stand for the Green Party,"" a spokesperson added. The Greens are hoping to field candidates in every seat in England and Wales for the first time at the surprise general election called last month. This requires the candidates to find 575 candidates in total, 103 more than at the last election in 2019. The Scottish Greens are a separate party. The party has defended its vetting processes, but has faced accusations some of its candidates have expressed or shared antisemitic statements online. The Greens have previously said they are working with Lord Mann, a former Labour MP and the government's advisor on antisemitism, ""to better educate Green representatives about anti-Jewish racism"". The Board of Deputies of British Jews accused the Greens of taking too long to act on ""such a clear problem"". ""Serious parties need to take candidate selection seriously - the Greens need to see this as a wake-up call,"" the community group added. On Thursday, Mr Ramsay defended the party's investigation process, saying it was independent of the party leadership and this was a ""matter of good governance"". “Like any other party, we have candidates who are selected and end up not standing. That’s no different to anyone else,"" he added. “If anyone has a situation where questions are raised about comments people have raised, those are properly investigated."" The Greens took a pro-ceasefire stance early on during the war in Gaza and are calling for tougher action against Israel, including boycotts and stopping UK arms sales to the Israeli military.  It has previously said it opposes ""any efforts to exploit the ongoing tragedy in Israel-Palestine to foster division, intensify antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of racism""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4475ld055o,Tory candidate linked to pastors accused of homophobia,"Darren Millar, who is standing in Clwyd North, says he does not share the views of Yang Tuck Yoong.",3 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservatives have selected a parliamentary candidate with links to preachers accused of homophobia and Islamophobia. Darren Millar, who is currently a member of the Welsh Parliament, has been selected to stand for the new parliamentary seat of Clwyd North in North Wales. Mr Millar has previously attracted controversy for his association with a pastor called Yang Tuck Yoong, who was criticised for homophobic views. Mr Yoong said homosexuality was an “abomination” and a “sin” and was reported to police in 2013 after saying it was “far more rampant, militant and organised than most of us actually believe it to be” in a sermon titled ‘The Sin of Sodom'. Mr Millar has said he does not endorse his views.  In 2019, it emerged that a charity Mr Millar was a trustee of – the Evan Roberts Institute – had financial links to Mr Yoong’s Cornerstone Community Church. He said at the time he did not share his views but human rights campaigners had called for him to cut ties with the church. The latest accounts of the Evan Roberts Institute show that the charity still leases a chapel it bought in 2014 to the Cornerstone Community Church, earning it income of £11,000 in ‘Freehold Reversionary Interest.’ Mr Millar told the BBC he did not endorse the views of the pastors and said “no one should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or religious beliefs"".  The refurbishment work on this chapel in Loughor, Swansea, was also paid for by the Cornerstone Community Church. In a video seen by the BBC from 2015, Mr Millar can also be seen at the opening of Mr Yoong’s Bible College of Wales pictured alongside two other controversial preachers. The footage shows Mr Millar at an event bowing with separate US preachers who have been accused of Islamophobic and homophobic views - Lou Engle and Dutch Sheets. A former Labour member of the Welsh Parliament, Edwina Hart, is also visible in the video. She is no longer an elected politician and is not running to be an MP in the general election. In 2018, Mr Engle allegedly told a conference in Singapore that Muslims were ""taking over the south of Spain"" and said he ""had a dream, where I will raise up the church all over Spain to push back a new modern Muslim movement"".  After the conference, hosted by the Cornerstone Community Church, police in Singapore reportedly investigated him over whether his comments could undermine religious harmony in Singapore. It was reported that Mr Yoong later apologised to Muslim community leaders for comments made by Mr Engle. Mr Engle has also reportedly called for ""martyrs"" to stop the ""homosexual agenda"" and accused Muslims of ""fuelling the demonic realm"" in sermons. Also pictured with Mr Millar in the footage is the pastor Mr Sheets - a Christian nationalist. Mr Sheets has previously said that America must ""refuse to give this nation to demons"" including ""Hinduism"" and said that ""Christianity will invade Islam"".  In a comment about the event at the time, Mr Millar said he was “delighted” to be at the event and said: “I thank God immensely how He shook a guy in Singapore and attracted him to this place in order to invest in what I believe is a project that would have ramification for the kingdom of God for many years to come. And I am delighted to be part of it.” A Conservative Spokesperson said: ""The Conservative Party does not condone homophobia or discrimination of any sort. Mr Millar has been clear that he does not share the views of these individuals."""

If not, this guide offers a summary of where the main parties stand on the issues most important to voters, based on the promises they have made during the campaign. Click on the drop-down list to select the nation, political parties and issues that interest you. A manifesto is the list of pledges parties make to voters, explaining what they would do if elected. This interactive has been put together by the BBC's Visual Journalism team, the BBC's political research unit in London and BBC journalists in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. Its aim is to summarise where the parties stand on key topics to help voters make informed decisions at the ballot box. We have selected issues highlighted in polling company Ipsos Mori's Issues Index, a monthly survey that measures the things the public believe to be the most important facing the country. We analysed surveys from the twelve months before the election was called and selected the issues based on their aggregate score over that period. In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, ""NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care"" are included under the one category of ""NHS and care"". ""Democracy"" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments. In order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria: Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here. This is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area. Because of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, ""health"" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33x9jm02ko,Labour’s Wes Streeting among victims of deepfake smear network on X,"The group also posts misleading comments to boost the credibility of its false, politically damaging videos.",7 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A doctored video of Labour's Wes Streeting has been pushed to X users - making it seem as though he called fellow politician Diane Abbott a ""silly woman"". A network of X accounts has been creating and sharing such clips of politicians ahead of the general election - and then posting misleading comments alongside to bolster the impression they are real. I have been tracking down some of the people behind the network and unpicking their tactics. Has their trolling gone too far? The doctored video of Mr Streeting features him on the BBC's Politics Live show. As the presenter discusses Ms Abbott, the footage is made to sound as though Mr Streeting is saying ""silly woman"" under his breath - but he never said those words. The clip was posted on X - formerly Twitter - by a user called Men for Wes who, in the comments, expressed outrage at the ""really nasty people"" in the Labour Party. Other users swarmed in the comments to endorse the clip as real. One account going by the name “Murray” falsely claimed to be a BBC Politics Live ""floor manager"" saying: ""This is legit"". Others said, “I can deffo hear Wes Streeting calling Diane Abbott a silly woman” or “You can clearly hear he said silly woman what an utter disgrace you are Wes Streeting”. One falsely suggested the BBC “pulled the episode” of Politics Live from iPlayer, which could discourage people from checking. This clip and several more about other politicians were recommended by X in the feed of one of the BBC's Undercover Voters - 24 fictional people with social media accounts, created to investigate what content is recommended to different types of voters during the election. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch relevant content. The videos recommended to the Undercover Voter profile have racked up tens of thousands of views and led to politicians such as Mr Streeting denouncing them as false. Some X users pointed out they believed it to be faked, some responded with abusive remarks - and others were clearly confused about what to believe. The BBC identified some of the users responsible for these videos, who describe their approach as ""shitposting"" - a term which usually refers to posting large amounts of ironic, low-effort content to derail productive discussion, distract people and provoke a reaction. This can come from people of all different political perspectives - and doesn’t have to be about politics. But while some of their fake clips are clearly absurd and satirical, others falsely portray candidates saying politically damaging things, while in the comments, the network of X users works to make them appear believable. Some of the clips make inflammatory comments related to the war in Gaza. As well as Mr Streeting, they have targeted Reform UK leader Nigel Farage and another Labour candidate, Luke Akehurst. An X user called chai_ste - who re-shared the clip of Wes Streeting with the question “is this real?” - also shared a different doctored clip of Mr Akehurst, whose outspoken support for Israel and its actions in Gaza has made him unpopular with the Labour left.  This clip falsely portrays him as bragging that he will be elected by ""thick"" Geordies who think Gaza is a footballer. The fake floor manager ""Murray"" was this time a “sound engineer” who again posted that “this is legit”. Other accounts, which seemed to be in on the joke, posted asking, “is this real?” and the original profile replied saying “I haven't seen any source to disprove it as of yet!” Another said: “I’m sure he just misspoke.” There’s also evidence several of these accounts were involved in another deepfaked clip of Sir Keir Starmer. It was about the Rochdale by-election earlier this year and falsely suggested Starmer called Labour supporters ""beyond thick"" and suggested that “as long as we’re scoring points with Israel they’ll be happy”. Several hours after they were originally shared, the doctored clips of Mr Streeting, Mr Akehurst and Sir Keir were labelled as fakes by X’s reader-operated fact check service, while X also applied a warning to the clip of Mr Akehurst saying it was “manipulated media”. Following my investigation, the Men for Wes account has been suspended by X and the videos from its account are no longer visible on the site. Some of the other profiles also appear to have been removed. This group of accounts regularly interact with one another, amplifying and engaging with each other’s posts in this way. Some appear to co-ordinate their posts on a Discord server - an instant messaging and chat community - which refers to them as a ""Shitposting Army"". Several of these X users post frequently about their concern for Palestinians in the war in Gaza, as well as posting in support of Jeremy Corbyn and left-leaning Labour politicians. At least two of the people who appear to be behind some of the accounts seem to be based in the UK and in their twenties and thirties. The Men for Wes account declined my request to speak on the phone several times and declined to disclose their identity, but agreed to answer my questions by messaging. They said they aimed to provoke attention and ""muddy the water"" for viewers. They described this as a ""corrective"" to the ways that politicians ""misrepresent who they really are"" and rejected allegations they were a threat to democracy. They condemned any hate directed at politicians shared by other accounts. They claimed a politician they supported had previously been targeted by misinformation, but in that case it had been spread by people in power and mainstream media outlets rather than ""random Twitter accounts"". The user running the chai_ste profile, who also declined to give their real name, poked fun at the question of whether this network of accounts had taken “shitposting” too far. They mockingly claimed to be following a “handbook from the Labour Party” and saying they were advised to post some “obviously fake videos” in among their “tasks” from the party, “so that it doesn’t become very obvious what we are really doing”. A doctored clip of Nigel Farage was one of the more obviously satirical creations of the network. The video edited the Reform UK leader's words from a clip making light of the incident where a milkshake was thrown over him, so that he appeared to make an obscene reference to bodily fluids. But the comments around other videos, bolstering their claims of authenticity, appear to be causing real confusion among some people. One user called Nigel, who responded on X to the post about Wes Streeting, told me he initially believed the video could be real. The 64-year-old said he intended to switch from Conservatives to Labour for the first time but said videos such as this could undermine their support. “This sort of thing is damaging. It seems everywhere you turn folks are out to get the Labour front team. I’ve been told by more Labour voters not to vote Labour than Tory voters!” he said. Another social media user - who asked to remain anonymous - contacted me to say he had been following several of these accounts with concern since the faked clips of Sir Keir emerged. He said: “Their tactics on how they'd push each fake were pretty calculated. It's frustrating as there are people in my life who have fallen for this kind of thing before."" Lots of the comments do feature users calling out the content as fake, however. X and Discord did not respond to the points raised by the BBC. X says publicly how “defending and respecting the user's voice is one of our core values”. Discord says online its guidelines ""ensure everyone can express themselves and find community — but not at the expense of anyone else"". The Undercover Voters are fictional profiles designed to represent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK. They follow, view and like content relevant to their character, informed by data and analysis from the National Centre for Social Research. For this story, I examined the feeds of the profiles of some of these fictional voters in Halifax, which has been a target for the Conservatives and is currently held by Labour. Kieran - a disillusioned voter in his twenties - is following lots of content about civilians killed in Gaza, as well as content about boycotting Israel. His feed on X was pushed these doctored clips of Mr Akehurst and then Mr Streeting. Another Undercover Voter called Patricia has viewed posts supporting Israel and opposing antisemitism. She has seen critical posts which reused old clips of politicians expressing support for Palestinians. These included abusive and Islamophobic remarks in the comments, but I found no evidence of a similar network of accounts sharing doctored clips or comments in the same way on her feeds. The third Undercover Voter character in Halifax is 44-year-old Maryam, who is quite disengaged in politics and undecided about who she wants to vote for. She has not been recommended this content so far."

Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out received a complaint on 4 January about Laura Wolfe liking material on X, formerly Twitter, regarding the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict. It was passed on to the FA who looked into the matter and subsequently issued the warning for her social media activity. In a memo sent to Kick It Out, which has been seen by BBC Sport, Burnley confirmed they had investigated the matter internally. The club also said they would review their diversity and social media policies as well as training for staff and contractors. The outcome of the FA investigation became public on Tuesday. The FA declined to comment but it is understood they issue warnings and/or reminders of responsibilities on a regular basis in relation to a wide range of alleged misconduct. Wolfe's legal team told BBC Sport she is disputing the outcome of the FA's findings. Burnley failed to respond when contacted for a statement. Activity on an X account under Wolfeâs name appeared to âlikeâ a post which stated âPalestinians are an invented peopleâ and âwere created to be the biggest Jew haters on Earthâ, while she also appeared to âlikeâ a comment which stated âgood riddanceâ to a poet that had been killed in Gaza. Burnley's investigation found ""on the balance of probability""  that there was ""insufficient evidence to substantiate"" the allegations against Wolfe were ""Islamophobic or discriminatory on the grounds of race or religion"". The club also told Kick It Out there was insufficient evidence to establish that Wolfe's activity on X brought ""Burnley Football Club into disrepute"". As well as her work as a consultant for Burnley, Wolfe is described on a business platform as having high-profile clients in the sports industry and as the owner of the Northwest Football Awards. She ran former Clarets boss Vincent Kompany's testimonial year while he was playing at Manchester City and lists Kick It Out as a client on her events website. Kick It Out said in a statement to BBC Sport the FA ""formally"" warned ""a contractor at a club about their social media activity"". The organisation added: ""From the outset, we passed the allegations to the FA and the club, and kept the complainant informed, as is our normal policy. ""As the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza continues, we urge all those involved in football to be cautious with their social media engagement, which could endorse words or have impacts that we do not intend. Kick It Out also said it was encouraging football to ""adopt the All Party Parliamentary Group Working Definition of Islamophobia so that all stakeholders are working to the same standard""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxeevlxex1lo,Why Nigel Farage’s return to the fray matters,"Nigel Farage has made it his life’s work to disrupt - and he reckons he is not done yet, writes Chris Mason.",29 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Nigel Farage is one of the most influential politicians of our time. Quite the achievement for a man who has never been an MP, despite trying to become one seven times. Would the UK have left the European Union, would people in the UK have ever had a say on EU membership, without him? Possibly not. Maybe you love him, maybe you really don’t. Nigel Farage has made it his life’s work to disrupt, delight, dismay, horrify, and he reckons he is not done yet. We reporters squeeze into an upstairs room of the Royal Cinque Ports Yacht Club, overlooking the English Channel. He had already announced that he wouldn’t try to win a seat in Parliament himself at this election, prompting a reporter from The Sun to tease him that he was a chicken. He argued that from the bitter experience of more than half a dozen defeats, he had little chance of success without working a seat for months in advance. Doing so would also tie him geographically to his chosen patch for much of the contest, which is why I reckon what he has said now is more significant than what he said last week. His capacity to be – potentially at least – a significant influence on this election is arguably greater by attempting to stride the national stage rather than plough a narrower and probably doomed personal furrow in a particular constituency. And stride the national stage is exactly what he is going to try to do. Mr Farage’s choice of backdrop, Dover, was intentional. Immigration, the topic that electrified the arguments around Brexit, arguably turning a relatively niche issue about sovereignty and governance into a mainstream concern, is the spine of his argument again. Little wonder: the Conservatives and Labour grapple about searching for solutions to the issue of small boat crossings, with numbers high. And legal migration numbers are sky high too. I have known Nigel Farage for the best part of 20 years. He is a master of the theatrics of politics, with a ready knack for oratory and a capacity to ad lib in fluent argument – and spot and capitalise on gaps in the political debate left by the Tories and Labour. He thinks illegal and legal migration amount to a colossal gap. He claims immigration poses a “national security emergency"". And he has been accused of Islamophobia for saying war in the Middle East is prompting a small but growing number of people in the UK to vote based on religion, along what he calls “sectarian” lines. But when I challenge him on the suggestion critics make that he is divisive, he argues: “I am willing to say things others aren’t"". Don’t some find this inflammatory, I push him. “No, they find it embarrassing. And difficult. And awkward. It is happening because there is no debate about it because, and they will all cry at me because, Labour started this, with a completely irresponsible immigration policy and the Conservatives have accelerated it.” His ambition is huge – and amounts to no less than seeking to replace the very party he joined then left, and then provoked, enraged and enthused for decades: the Conservatives. Right now that seems highly unlikely, however they perform in five weeks time. But then again, 20 years ago the UK leaving the European Union didn’t seem likely either. For now, it is the short term that matters. Can he neutralise that Conservative attack line that claims a vote for Reform UK, of which he is honorary president, is a vote to put Keir Starmer in Downing Street? Lots of Tories were already haunted by Reform and Nigel Farage grinning his way back to prominence will magnify their spooks. Mr Farage told me it was nailed on Labour would win the election and the Conservatives would be annihilated so people could vote Reform without fearing any wider consequence caused by them. Well, hang on: not a vote has been cast yet and Tories do fret that support for Reform UK disproportionately comes from people who voted for them in 2019. Let’s see. We are a week into the general election campaign. Each party is getting into its stride and finding its voice. The cacophony of voices grows louder and the pace will continue to quicken. The addition of Nigel Farage’s voice adds intrigue, personality, jeopardy, excitement and anger in roughly equal measure."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy00npvpmzpo,"Diane Abbott free to stand for Labour, says Starmer",The Labour leader endorses Diane Abbott to be Labour candidate in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.,31 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said Diane Abbott is ""free to go forward as a Labour candidate"", ending days of speculation about the veteran left-winger's future. Ms Abbott, the first female black MP, had claimed she had been banned from standing for Labour at the general election on 4 July. Sir Keir has now given Ms Abbott his blessing to stand in Hackney North and Stoke Newington - a seat she has represented since 1987.  Labour's National Executive Committee has the final say on Ms Abbott's candidacy - but a senior party source told the BBC the group will not block her from standing. Ms Abbott said: ‘“I will not be making any comment until next week but the narrative looks positive.” However, speaking at a rally outside Hackney Town Hall on Tuesday, she said: ""I promise you that as long as it is possible, I will be the Member of Parliament for Hackney North and Stoke Newington."" Left-wing Labour group Momentum called the decision ""a huge victory"" for Ms Abbott. A Momentum spokesperson said: ""Starmer tried to force her out. She held firm - and won. ""You come at the queen, you better not miss."" The last week has been dominated by a stand-off between Ms Abbott and the Labour leadership.  Sir Keir had repeatedly dodged questions on Ms Abbott's future, even after she appeared to confirm reports in the Times newspaper that she had been blocked from standing as a Labour candidate despite having the whip restored. On Thursday deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner raised the pressure on Sir Keir, telling Sky News: ""I don't see any reason why Diane Abbott can't stand as a Labour MP."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the episode showed ""Angela Rayner is in charge"" of Labour, instead of Sir Keir. ""If he's given into Angela Rayner on this, imagine what he'll give into when it comes to the union's demanding higher taxes, or indeed weakening our defence and security,"" he said. An SNP spokesman said ""the way Diane Abbott and other progressive candidates have been treated is shameful"". Lib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""Candidate selection for other parties is not an issue I get into."" Ms Abbott was suspended from Labour last year after suggesting Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experience prejudice, but not racism ""all their lives"", sparking a long-running process which saw her sit as an Independent MP. She apologised on X, formerly known as Twitter, and withdrew her remarks. Labour is in a bitter row with accusations that Sir Keir is carrying out a ""purge"" of left-wing candidates and placing his supporters in winnable seats. Ms Rayner has argued Sir Keir is not acting ""in a factional way"". Former Brighton MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle told the BBC he had been made a ""sacrificial lamb"" after Labour suspended him following a complaint about his behaviour. Overnight, Mr Russell-Moyle was replaced by Chris Ward, a former advisor to Sir Keir, as Labour's candidate for Brighton Kemptown. The BBC does not know the nature of the complaint made against Russell-Moyle.  On Wednesday after he was suspended, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken."" Speaking exclusively to Politics Live on BBC Two Mr Russell-Moyle claimed Labour were giving preferential treatment to Sir Keir's allies. When asked about whether there is a cull of left-wing candidates, Mr Russell-Moyle said: ""Quite clearly the timing for me is highly suspicious. ""The appointment of the person replacing me is highly suspicious. ""It would be better if the party made sure that if they are replacing MPs at the last-minute they are replacing MPs that are similar in terms of ideological belief or from local roots."" Shama Tatler, of the Starmer supporting Labour to Win group, has been selected as Labour candidate for Chingford and Woodford Green after Faiza Shaheen was barred, despite having already launched her campaign. Ms Shaheen, who fought the seat in 2019, has said she is considering legal action over the move and released a statement last night accusing some within Labour of a “systematic campaign of racism, Islamophobia and bullying”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckmm4lgm0l4o,German anti-Islam activist injured in knife attack,"The attacker stabbed several people including a policeman, before being shot by an officer.",1 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man has attacked six people, including a police officer, with a knife at a market square in the south-west German city of Mannheim, police say. One of the people injured was anti-Islam activist, Michael Stürzenberger, who had been preparing to hold a rally in the square, according to his group. The incident was caught on a YouTube livestream and showed the attacker stabbing a man, and then a police officer who went to help. The officer is in a critical condition. The attacker was shot and injured by another police officer. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described the incident as “terrible”, and that his thoughts were with the victims. He posted on X: “Violence is absolutely unacceptable in our democracy. The perpetrator must be severely punished.” Police in Mannheim tweeted about a ""major police operation"" in the city's market square and a rescue helicopter was sent to the scene. One person attacked several others with a knife, injuring them, at 11:35 (10:35 BST), police said in a follow-up statement. A firearm was then used against the attacker, it added. The attack is understood to have happened at the same time as a rally in the market square hosted by far-right anti-Islam activist, Michael Stürzenberger, and his organisation the Citizens' Movement Pax Europa (BPE). A spokeswoman for the city of Mannheim confirmed that the organisation had registered an event on the market square for Friday morning. BPE confirmed to Bild newspaper that Mr Stürzenberger was attacked in the leg and face.  His colleague Stefanie Kizina told the newspaper that Mr Stürzenberger has to undergo surgery, but his life was not in danger.  ""The attack happened before the event even started, it must have been planned well in advance,"" she said. Police have not released any further information about those injured in the attack. Local newspaper Mannheimer Morgen has reported that the attacker injured six people, including five BPE members and one police officer. According to DPA, the police officer was in a critical condition and will have to undergo emergency surgery. A livestreamed video from the event shows a man attacking people with a knife. At least one person is seen with a wound to the leg. A number of bystanders are seen grappling with the attacker, who later manages to break free and stab a police officer in the back.  Several police officers with firearms then surround him, before he falls to the ground. Police have not released the identity of the suspect, but German media outlets say he is a 25-year-old man who was born in Afghanistan but lives in Germany. Although a motive has not been confirmed, Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said there was a possibility that the attack could be Islamist-motivated. According to Bild, Michael Stürzenberger is the author of an Islamophobic blog, as well as a member of the BPE, an organisation which says it stands against the ""Islamisation"" of Germany. The 58-year-old is one of the authors of the anti-Muslim platform PI-News and is being monitored by the Bavarian domestic intelligence service. A former politician, Mr Stürzenberger once led a small right-wing populist party Die Freiheit, which was dissolved in 2016. Before that, he was a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - but left before he was kicked out."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cle0e0y4pyxo,Greens promise action over antisemitism allegations,"The party says it is working to ""better educate"" its representatives about ""anti-Jewish racism"".",16 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Green Party of England and Wales says it is taking action after complaints about antisemitic statements made or supported by its candidates. It comes after the Jewish Chronicle reported that three parliamentary candidates shared ""incendiary material"" online. The party says it is working with Lord Mann, the government's independent advisor on antisemitism, ""to better educate Green representatives about anti-Jewish racism"". Lord Mann, a former Labour MP, initially wrote to the party before 2 May's English local elections over posts allegedly made by candidates Mohamed Makawi and Abdul Malik from October 2023. The Green Party said Mr Makawi had has since apologised and undertaken social media training, while Mr Malik was ""unwittingly"" implicated by being tagged in the post. Mr Malik told the BBC he did not put up a post showing Hamas spokesmen, and said he completely condemns the attacks on Israel. The Green Party leadership confirmed they had met Lord Mann last week.  They have issued a joint statement with him, committing to a ""continued dialogue and working together to ensure that antisemitism, like all racism, has no place in Green politics"". The statement adds: ""The Green Party has taken a series of proactive steps towards these goals but understands that this will take consistent work going forward"". This week the Jewish Chronicle reported that three parliamentary candidates shared ""incendiary material"" online. The BBC has not been able to view the posts on social media, but has tried to contact all three people involved to ask if they wish to respond. According to the Jewish Chronicle, Elizabeth Waight, the Green candidate in Bethnal Green and Stepney, re-posted a video on Instagram in March this year in which a woman said: ""What's left for the Zionists [is] to eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Palestinians… I think this will happen soon."" The Jewish Chronicle also alleges that Chingford and Wood Green candidate Chris Brody uploaded links to an article that suggested that the 9/11 and October 7 terror attacks were ""false flag operations executed to open the path toward more slaughter and mayhem"". The newspaper also highlights Bristol East candidate Naseem Talukdar, who is said to have circulated comparisons between the Holocaust and the war in Gaza and ""liked"" a video clip in which anti-Israel activist David Miller says ""we have to destroy Zionism"".  Green Party sources say the allegations will be assessed as to whether disciplinary action, training or support would be the most appropriate response. A party spokesperson said: ""The allegations raised are serious and are being treated as such. At this stage it would be inappropriate for us to comment further on the examples raised."" It has been suggested to the BBC that the party machinery is stretched as it tries to sift through a number of cases of potential antisemitism that have been raised in recent weeks. Lord Mann believes all political parties must have robust systems in place to deal with complaints. The Green Party has taken a pro-ceasefire stance on the war in Gaza since October, and is now calling for tougher action against Israel, through boycotts, divestment and sanctions. In a further sign that the leadership is concerned about being seen to have become a haven for those with antisemitic views, the party released a joint letter from Jewish and Muslim Greens, saying they are ""united against antisemitism and Islamophobia"". ""Together, we oppose any efforts to exploit the ongoing tragedy in Israel-Palestine to foster division, intensify antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of racism"", it reads."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68982352,Modi's divisive campaign rhetoric raises questions,The Indian PM's remarks against Muslims on the election trail have puzzled many. What is going on?,10 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In the lead-up to India's general election, Narendra Modi was expected to frame it as a referendum on his  decade as prime minister.  He was expected to boast about achievements like generous welfare programmes and spaceflights. He was to reaffirm that the new Ram temple in Ayodhya represented a cultural assertion for India's majority Hindus. Even foreign policy was anticipated to influence the ballot, with the publicity boost afforded by Mr Modi's hosting of the G20 summit last September. Opinion polls have predicted a third, record-equalling landslide win for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But early in the gruelling six-week election, Mr Modi's campaign shifted gears, using divisive rhetoric that has raised questions about his tactics. He's been accusing the opposition, led by the Congress party, of appeasing the Muslim minority community. Muslims make up 14% of India's more than 1.4 billion people. Taking a cue from Mr Modi's campaign, social media posts by the BJP have, according to the opposition, ""demonised"" Muslims. He told a rally on 21 April that the opposition Congress wanted to distribute wealth to ""infiltrators"" and to ""those who have many children"". His remarks were widely seen as referring to Muslims.  At another rally, he warned women that the opposition would confiscate their gold and redistribute it to Muslims. He accused the Congress of orchestrating a ""vote jihad"", urging a ""certain community"" to unite against him. Mr Modi even said the Congress would select the Indian cricket team ""on the basis of religion"".  That's not all. In a recent interview Mr Modi said the ""whole world"" was trying to influence the elections. This week, Mr Modi blamed the Congress for taking ""truckloads"" of money from billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has long spoken about the close ties that Mr Modi shares with the country's two richest men.  ""For the first time you have spoken in public about Adani and Ambani. Is it your personal experience that you know they give money in trucks?"" Mr Gandhi responded in a video message. Neither businessman has reacted to the comments. India's opposition has also accused Mr Modi of Islamophobia, calling his remarks ""divisive, hate speech"". The Congress has demanded an investigation into a potential code of conduct violation. Since the BJP's rise to power, hate speech against India's 200 million Muslims has increased. But Mr Modi's fiery rhetoric on the stump has surprised many, as they expected a focus on highlighting his achievements instead.  ""To be honest, I thought Mr Modi's campaign would be much more about the rising India story, and about what they had done for the people,"" says Rahul Verma of the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), a Delhi-based think tank.  Others say Mr Modi's remarks are not unprecedented. They point to many such instances during his previous election campaigns, including what they call his ""inflammatory rhetoric"" after the riots in Gujarat in 2002 ahead of the state's assembly elections. ""So, it has not surprised me, but is has shocked me. We often refer to such rhetoric as dog-whistling but there was nothing subtle about the language being employed,"" says Milan Vaishnav of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. For one, many say, the BJP might have been spooked by a significant dip in turnout in early rounds of voting amid what has been a rather low energy election. In the previous two elections, won decisively by the BJP, high turnouts benefitted the party - 2014 was largely a vote against the Congress, and 2019 was a vote for Mr Modi.  Second, the opposition has been trying to reshape the narrative of the 2024 election, shifting focus from being solely a referendum on Mr Modi to campaigning on issues like unemployment, social justice and economic inequality. Political scientist Neelanjan Sircar suggests that the BJP excels in national elections when it focuses on overarching national issues. He told a podcast recently that the party's not ""playing its strongest game"" when elections become more regionalised, and local factors come into play. Mr Modi's party is targeting 370 seats this time, up from 303 in 2019. However, their rallying cry of ""Abki Baar, 400 par""  (This time, above 400), aiming for the party and its allies to secure a landslide, might have backfired. The opposition appears to have seized on the slogan, portraying the BJP as a dominating force set to reshape India with a massive majority. ""The opposition is using this slogan to say if they come with such huge majority, the BJP will change the constitution. And the opposition's narrative to empower poor and lower castes might have got some traction given there are high levels of economic anxiety evident in the pre-poll surveys,"" says Mr Verma. ""This might have provoked Mr Modi to take this narrative head on and give it a Hindu-Muslim twist."" Is Mr Modi's divisive rhetoric a sign of desperation?  Not really, says Mr Vaishnav. ""To me, it is designed to mobilise his cadres and perhaps to make up for an underwhelming performance in the first few phases. ""Desperation suggests that the BJP is losing, which I do not believe to be the case. Meeting the new target of 400 seats will be difficult unless the BJP can retain its seats from 2019 as well as expand into new areas."" Despite Mr Modi's rhetoric on the stump, he has sung a different tune in recent interviews with news networks. ""I am not anti-Islam, nor am I anti-Muslim,"" he told Times Now. He said his government's welfare benefits extended to all, irrespective of their community or religion, adding that ""social justice and secularism is a guarantee from Modi"".  Mr Modi criticised the opposition for using Muslims as political pawns and suggested that the community should reflect on its own situation. ""Muslims should introspect why there's a sense of shortcomings within the community."" He said the Muslim community was changing all over the world. ""When I go to the Gulf countries, India and I get so much respect. Here there's opposition,"" he said. Unravelling the complexity behind election victories in India is always a challenge. Gilles Verniers, a political scientist, believes they are rarely fought and won based on past accomplishments. ""Voters instead determine their choice according to what parties and candidates offer for the future. After building its past campaigns on welfare, security and nationalism, and having scored on these matters, the BJP does not have a lot of new ideas to offer to voters, hence the exacerbation of ethnic and religious nationalism,"" he says.  Mr Modi and his party will disagree. But one thing is evident: this election has not yet manifested itself as a sweeping wave favouring any side, regardless of which party stands to gain or lose from it. ""In politics,"" says political analyst Pratap Bhanu Mehta, ""never underestimate the power of boredom"". That could account for what many say is the BJP's ""nervousness""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68990672,MPs given guide to spotting conspiracy theories,The guide - commissioned by Penny Mordaunt - warns MPs and candidates of the main conspiracies in circulation.,10 May 2024,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A new guide to conspiracy theories that ""can pose a danger to democracy"" has been written for MPs and would-be politicians. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, commissioned the booklet to warn colleagues of eight of the biggest false claims. These include conspiracies around vaccines, 5G and ""15 minute cities"".  It came as Ms Mordaunt took a swipe at former Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, saying he ""promotes conspiracy theories"". As the Commons leader was introducing the guide in the Commons on Thursday, Mr Bridgen  - who was a Conservative MP but was expelled from the party for spreading ""dangerous"" anti-vaccine conspiracies in April last year and now sits as an independent - raised the issue of Covid 19 vaccines. It feels a bit like an episode of a Dystopian TV drama when elected politicians have to refer to a conspiracy theory handbook.  But really, this is an indication of the real-world harm disinformation, conspiracy theories and hate on social media have caused in recent months and years. Once the Covid-19 pandemic eased and restrictions were lifted, you'd be forgiven for thinking the proliferation of online conspiracy theories might have subsided. But now they emerge up every time something major happens - whether a violent attack, a war, a disappearance.  They're used to explain what's unfolding in the here and now, rather than historical events. And a committed conspiracy theory movement exists here in the UK.  These conspiracy theories often exploit valid questions or go far beyond legitimate concerns - instead suggesting elaborate plots for which there is no evidence.  This handbook is a reminder of how MPs are grappling with the social media world. And that feels particularly acute with an election on the horizon and AI-generated content further exacerbating the murky underbelly online.  Mr Bridgen said the original version of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been being withdrawn this week.  Describing how he had suffered vaccine side effects, he claimed there is ""huge and growing concern"" over ""a medical intervention that this House encouraged, coerced and, in some cases, mandated people to inject into their bodies"" and asked for a ministerial statement on ""why the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency failed to act to protect the public interest"". Highlighting how the Covid 19 vaccines had saved millions of lives, Ms Mordaunt remined the MP he had already had several Commons debates on the issue and, while side effects are a serious issue, ""that is quite another thing from promoting false information about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines"". Ms Mordaunt said the guide had a chapter on anti-vaccine conspiracies and encouraged Mr Bridgen to ""get a copy and read it, to think seriously when he comes to the House, as he does every week, and promotes conspiracy theories and to really think about the consequences of what he is doing."" The eight conspiracies are explained by different charity groups and fact-checking organisations in the booklet are:  Urging all MPs to read the guide to conspiracy theories on Thursday, Ms Mordaunt said: ""Such theories are a real threat not just to democracy, but to the wellbeing of our constituents.  ""They are a form of radicalisation, they are spreading and we must do everything we can to combat them."" The guide says many of the conspiracy theories are linked to anti-Jewish racism, with a shared belief around ""a secret cabal that seeks world domination by controlling world events, promoting conflicts and financial instability, [which] can find its roots in age-old antisemitism"". ""This risk is not only of conspiracy theories targeting governments and populations but also the active support and proliferation of conspiracy theories by government or other public officials,"" it states. Showing cross-party support for the move, Labour's Lucy Powell also welcomed the ""important guide"", adding: ""Although the existence of conspiracy theories is nothing new, their reach, risk and repercussions are ever increasing."" The SNP's Deirdre Brock was also supportive but criticised the the ""the malign influence"" of Facebook groups linked to Conservative party HQ staff and activists during the London Mayor campaign, which she said were ""forums full of vile racism, conspiracy theories and Islamophobic abuse of Sadiq Khan"". ""There is reason to suspect similar groups are quietly spreading their poison across the UK, including in Scotland,"" she said.  The guide was written jointly by the Antisemitism Policy Trust, Full Fact, Tell Mama, Global Network on Extremism and Technology, the Community Security Trust and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue."

So-called ""liberated zones"" were set up at Oxford's Museum of Natural History and King's College, Cambridge, earlier. The demonstrators called for the universities to cut financial ties with Israel following its offensive in Gaza. Oxford University has previously expressed ""profound sympathy for those suffering in Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank"". In the past week, Pro-Palestinian protesters have have set up tents outside university buildings in cities including Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle as well as at Goldsmiths, University of London. In a joint statement, Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine called for the universities to stop lending ""financial and moral support"" to the Israeli government. ""Oxbridge's profits cannot continue to climb at the expense of Palestinian lives, and their reputations must no longer be built on the white-washing of Israeli crimes,"" it said. Cambridge Jews for Justice in Palestine, a group of Jewish students at the University of Cambridge said it was also supporting the demonstration ""to oppose Israel's occupation of Palestine"".  More than 33,000 people have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry there says, the majority of them civilians.  Israel rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in its campaign in Gaza, and has insisted it has the right to defend itself following the armed incursion by Hamas on 7 October. On Thursday, the Union of Jewish Students said the encampments were creating a ""hostile and toxic atmosphere"" on campuses and called on universities to ""take their duty of care to Jewish students seriously"". In a statement, The University of Oxford said it was aware of the latest protests. It added: ""We respect our students and staff members right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests. We ask everyone who is taking part to do so with respect, courtesy and empathy. ""Oxford University's primary focus is the health and safety of the university community, and to ensure any impact on work, research and learning, including student exams, is minimised."" King's College Cambridge said: ""We ask everyone in our community to treat each other with understanding and empathy.

But one thing is evident: this election has not yet manifested itself as a sweeping wave favouring any side, regardless of which party stands to gain or lose from it. ""In politics,"" says political analyst Pratap Bhanu Mehta, ""never underestimate the power of boredom"". That could account for what many say is the BJP's ""nervousness""."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61311046,UK housing scheme called danger to Ukraine refugees,"Potentially violent and abusive men are offering accommodation to Ukrainian women, BBC News learns.",4 May 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Potentially abusive men are using a UK scheme to host Ukrainian refugees - to contact vulnerable women, BBC News has learned. The men, some with a reported history of violence, message the women on Facebook groups specially set up to connect sponsors and hosts. Some refugees have also become homeless after relations with hosts broke down or because housing was not well vetted. But a UK government official said safeguards were in place. These included ""Home Office security and background checks on all sponsors, before visas are issued"", and at least one council visit to a sponsor's property. A charity head labelled the Homes for Ukraine scheme dangerous and said she was ""shocked by the absence of safeguarding checks"". In March, the government announced the scheme would allow anyone to host a family or individual, if they agreed to housing, criminal-records and other background checks. The system is slightly different in Wales and Scotland. Numerous Facebook groups were set up by local support networks and individuals, in response. They have become one of the main ways of connecting families and sponsors. Last month the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, raised concerns about the system, highlighting what it called ""the need for adequate safeguards and vetting measures to be in place against exploitation"". In EU countries, accommodation is organised primarily by national authorities and charities. There are also some private arrangements. While some British charities have tried to match applicants with potential hosts, many refugees are using the informal Facebook  groups.  There is evidence predatory males are joining these groups. One whistleblower with knowledge of the official scheme told the BBC in some local authorities, as many as 30% of all registered would-be sponsors are single men over 40 - the majority of them offering to host single women in their 20s and 30s. The government says it does not recognise those figures.  The BBC findings were ""deeply concerning and undermine the sponsorship programme"", said Robina Qureshi, chief executive of Positive Action in Housing. She described the scheme as ""dangerous"". Her organisation would never place a woman with a single man, and the government, she said, ""has created chaos, no risk checks, no due diligence"".  On a Facebook group set up to help match Ukrainian refugees, BBC News found one would-be sponsor who appears to live in a one-bedroom flat posting multiple offers to host young women.  Someone who knew him well claimed he had multiple convictions, including for burglary and affray. Police records indicate he was reported for allegedly carrying a crossbow and threatening a former partner, although no further action is believed to have been taken. Another man, in Manchester, had joined several Facebook groups and was offering a spare room to a string of young, single, Ukrainian women. He was also a member of a dating site called Single Ukrainian Women. Elsewhere on his timeline, he had written Islamophobic comments. It is not known whether either of these men was approved under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  Councils are meant to approve each property and complete Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks on all potential hosts they know about, including those who make contact via Facebook.  But the basic DBS checks are limited. Enhanced checks are requested only if there are children involved. A basic DBS check had raised no concerns about a man in his 50s offering to host a young Ukrainian woman, a source told BBC News  But when staff performed a more detailed check of social services records they found multiple complaints against him, including for domestic abuse and harassment. The UK government has come under pressure to speed up the settlement of refugees from Ukraine, with many complaining visa and host approvals have been unnecessarily slow. But it's thought that some councils are struggling with a lack of resources. The BBC found numerous posts on Facebook from Ukrainians who had reached the UK, but found their accommodation unsuitable. In such cases, often local charities step in to find emergency accommodation. One post from a volunteer helping new arrivals said: ""I was contacted by a young woman who had arrived on Saturday. She wanted to change hosts. I asked what the issue was and she sent me videos. The home wouldn't pass an inspection to rehome a dog."" The refugee involved, who does not want to be identified, told BBC News: ""She is a kind person but her house is a very big cluster of mess. There are many repairs needed. I couldn't go in the kitchen. I couldn't live here."" That refugee had received a visa under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, but the squalid condition of the property suggests no-one from the local council appeared to have checked the host's accommodation. She has since been rehoused. BBC News also learned of a Ukrainian who said she had been shown pictures of the bedrooms she and her two young children would be using. But on arrival, her entire family had been expected to sleep in one small reception room next to the kitchen, with no privacy.  The property had not been inspected. There had been no DBS checks. And she says the house was filled with Nazi memorabilia. ""The family... have Nazi pictures and Soviet symbols,"" she said. ""I don't feel safe."" She left and found a better host through social media but feels deeply scarred by the experience. ""I do not want my children to feel unsafe again and we feel unsafe,"" she said. ""I think we will go back to Germany."" While offering to support a refugee in her own home, Mira Kozlowska, who is Polish but lived in the UK for 21 years, has found herself helping to match others with suitable sponsors on social media. ""So many people are arriving and wanting to change sponsor,"" she told BBC News. ""It's a huge problem on the horizon."" ""Just now, I saw a post about how the sponsor wants the family to be out all day and not in the house.  ""Another girl was talking about how she didn't even have a door on her room and no privacy."" Another newly arrived refugee said, through an interpreter: ""When we arrive, there is no bed, just a mattress on the floor. ""The apartment is cold and when I put on the heater he shouts. ""There is no food in the kitchen and we have no money.""  Under the Homes For Ukraine scheme, hosts receive £350 per month from the government. And Ms Kozlowska said: ""I'm basically wondering how many people are doing it solely for the extra £350 - very scary."" The government rejects those criticisms and said ""attempts to exploit vulnerable people [were] despicable"".  ""The Homes for Ukraine scheme has safeguards in place, including Home Office security and background checks on all sponsors before visas are issued. Councils also conduct checks and must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor's property."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64243344,Professor who lost job over Muhammad art sues,A university professor showed artwork depicting the founder of Islam. It touched off a debate.,19 Jan 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A professor who was let go from her job after showing a class an artwork depicting the Prophet Muhammad has sued her former university, alleging religious discrimination and defamation.  The case has raised issues of religious tolerance and academic freedom.  The basic facts are not being disputed.  Erika Lopez Prater showed a classical work depicting the Prophet in an art history class at Hamline University in St Paul, Minnesota.  One of her students complained, and Prof Lopez Prater's contract was subsequently not renewed at the end of the term.  But the details of the case and the university's response have prompted a wave of debate, media attention and conflicting public statements, culminating in a lawsuit announced Tuesday.  The picture that was shown was an illustration of Muhammad receiving a revelation from the angel Gabriel - part of A Compendium of Chronicles by Rashid-al-Din, a 14th Century Islamic scholar. Before presenting it, she warned students that they could choose to opt out of the lesson, as many Muslims consider images of Muhammad to be un-Islamic, although there is a variety of views within Islam on the subject. Despite the warnings, Aram Wedatalla, a student and president of Hamline's Muslim student association, was upset by the class and after a conversation with the professor, complained to university authorities.  ""I'm like, 'This can't be real,'"" Ms Wedatalla later told the university's student newspaper. ""As a Muslim, and a black person, I don't feel like I belong, and I don't think I'll ever belong in a community where they don't value me as a member, and they don't show the same respect that I show them.""  An administrator then called the professor's actions ""Islamophobic"" - a label that the university later recanted - and her adjunct contract was not renewed. The controversy was mostly confined to academia until the New York Times published a story about the incident earlier this month.  A number of academics and groups including PEN America, an organisation that supports free expression, came out in support of Prof Lopez Prater.  Amna Khalid, a history professor at nearby Carleton College, wrote in the Chronicle of Higher Education that she was ""appalled"" by the university's decision and that ""it is the students who pay the highest price for such limits on academic freedom."" Prof Khalid, who is Muslim, told the BBC that a number of junior academics in the area have been in touch with her, expressing fear about what they can or can't say in the classroom. ""I don't want to vilify the student,"" she said. ""The problem is the institution."" Muslim groups were divided. While many civil rights groups came down on the side of the professor, Ms Wedatalla, the student, was initially supported by the Minnesota branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair).  But the group's national leaders took a different view. The national Cair organisation has said there was no evidence Prof Lopez Prater was acting with ""Islamophobic intent.""  Another advocacy group, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, came out with a full-throated defence of the professor. ""Dr Prater was trying to emphasise a key principle of religious literacy: religions are not monolithic in nature, but rather, internally diverse,"" the group said. The range of opinion highlights longstanding disagreements among Muslims over the sensitivity of depicting images of the Prophet. There is no explicit rule against such depictions in the Koran, instead the idea arises in the Hadiths - stories about the life and sayings of Muhammad gathered in the years after his death.  The prohibition is aimed at preventing idolatry - the worship of images in place of a god - and it is thought that classical depictions of Muhammad were only viewed by a select elite.  Sunni Muslims tend to be more strict in their interpretation of a ban than Shia Muslims. For instance, images of the Prophet are more common in Shia-majority Iran.   Prof Lopez Prater said she attempted to address the issue of divergent ideas about representation in religious art during the class. Controversies of this nature have tended to flare up not in art classes but around displays of cartoons or other drawings by people attempting to make political points or promote specific ideas about freedom of speech. The debate over the Hamline University incident has been mostly confined to the campus and media debates. But on occasion depictions have led to anger and even violence by Islamist extremists - perhaps most notably the attack against the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015. Having initially defended its decision and its criticism of the professor, the university backtracked on Tuesday, saying that its use of the word Islamophobic was ""flawed"" and pledging to hold discussions in the coming months about academic freedom, student care and religion. ""We strongly support academic freedom for all members of the Hamline community. We also believe that academic freedom and support for students can and should co-exist,"" officials said. But in her lawsuit, Prof Lopez Prater's lawyers said she had suffered significant damage to her career and reputation.  In her first public comments since the New York Times story, made to a YouTube roundtable discussion on faith, Prof Lopez Prater outlined her thinking in showing the image. ""I was teaching a world art class that was meant to be global in its perspective and think about diversity and global connections throughout history,"" she said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-53606190,Lockdown rules mean 'spirit of Eid has gone',"Restrictions will not end Eid celebrations despite plans being cancelled, a Muslim leader says.",1 Aug 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"New ""last-minute"" lockdown rules mean ""the spirit of Eid has gone"", a Muslim leader has said. Bradford Council of Mosques President Zulfi Karim said Muslims were angry at the timing of the announcement - but he said it would not end Eid celebrations despite many having to cancel plans.  The restrictions ban separate households in parts of northern England from meeting each other at home. The government said ""immediate action"" was needed due to a Covid-19 spike. The festival of Eid-Ul-Adha began on Thursday night and finishes on Monday. Mr Karim said: ""Imagine it's Christmas and you get this bombshell? ""Coming together of friends and family is actually a major part of the day of Eid - it's a sharing of food and gifts and coming together."" He added: ""It's a disappointment because we've bought toys for our grandkids. Our nieces and nephews were due to travel up from Birmingham, but they won't be coming now. ""We've cancelled all plans."" He said the celebrations would continue even though plans had been ""scuppered"" for many Muslims. Saima Afzal, a Blackburn councillor, criticised the way the government imposed the new rules. ""Why did the government leave it so late? Two hours before Eid, giving them little time to reconfigure,"" she said. ""The issue for me is the timing, it's really unfortunate. ""The lack of clarity for every community, not just Muslims, it's so last-minute."" Qari Asim, a senior Imam in Leeds, urged people to ""remain safe"" by celebrating at home. He said it was ""just as effective as being in larger groups"". ""BAME communities have been disproportionately affected during Covid-19 and therefore we need to take extra precautionary measures,"" he said. ""There has been a sense of deflation and disappointment as restrictions have been placed on Hajj for the first time in such a manner. But we are not alone. Other faith communities have had to make sacrifices. We hope these spiritual sacrifices will enable us all to defeat Covid-19 together."" He said he did not want the situation ""to give rise to Islamophobia, hateful narratives that some groups will try to exploit when Eid celebrations commence"" and asked for people to be respectful during the celebrations. Aisha Hussain, who lives in Bradford with her family, said they had spent ""a lot of hours"" on preparations to celebrate Eid-Ul-Adha with other relatives at their home and called the timing of No 10's announcement ""not fair"". The family learnt the news during a family party on Friday, forcing her aunt, who had planned to stay with them, to book a hotel to stay at. She told the BBC: ""It's very disappointing. I feel like we should have been prepared, some consideration should have been taken."" She said that while she understood that ""scientific facts are facts"", it was ""the government's responsibility to consider all of us"".  ""It's not just a small number of people, it's a large number of people that this is affecting."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock has denied the new restrictions, which affect people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire, are aimed at curtailing Eid celebrations. He said: ""My heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are. ""I'm very grateful to the local Muslim leaders, the imams in fact, across the country who've been working so hard to find a way to have Covid-secure celebrations.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44384790,Voices from the procession,Here are some of the voices of women taking part in the procession to celebrate 100 years of the vote.,10 Jun 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Processions are being held in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast and London to mark 100 years since the first British women won the right to vote.  Many of the 10,000 women expected to take part in Cardiff will be carrying homemade banners brandishing the hopes and concerns of women in the 21st Century. Participants will also wear a wrap in green, white or purple - the Suffragette colours - and be choreographed into bands to create a moving artwork as they travel through the streets.   Here are the voices of some of the women involved.  Sally Evans, of Newport, Gwent, works part-time for the South East Wales Racial Equality Council (SEWREC) and Newport's Riverfront Theatre and Arts Centre. She has helped make banners for both places. She said:  In SEWREC, I work with refugees and asylum seekers, many of them women who have faced challenging situations in their lives.  The women made a felt banner around the phrase ""And so I rise"" from a Maya Angelou poem. Some individuals also chose to make flags from their home countries and smaller banners in their own languages.  At the Riverfront, the women made a banner in the design of a mandala - the symbol of peace - and added words or phrases about the rights of women or empowerment of girls. For me personally, I feel it is important that Newport has a good showing in the procession.  So much history stems from here - not just the Chartist movement, which sought political rights for the working classes - but also the suffragette Lady Rhondda.  Newport has a tagline - the ""city of democracy"" - so it is very important we express this during the procession.  For me, it is such a good opportunity to think about how far women have come but also how far we have to go. In my work I see the challenges refugees and asylum seekers face - particularly in terms of social isolation and feeling displaced.  Many of the women we help have been deeply traumatised by what they have been through.  They need to feel part of a community, and safe within their city. Making these banners, and bringing women together in a bond of sisterhood, has helped achieve that.  Tasha Middleton, of Swansea, set up the first WI in Swansea city centre. She runs Sew Swansea and teaches textiles to diverse groups across the city. She said:  The design of the banner I was involved in was based on the work of Thalia Campbell - a leading banner maker of the Greenham Common protests in the eighties.  She made wonderful banners for nuclear disarmament and women's rights. We - myself and five other artists - wanted to re-imagine her work, making it relevant to modern women.  In the centre of our banner is the slogan ""The Red Dragon Inspires Action"" to show the power of Welsh women.  During our research, we discovered that at one point during the Greenham Common protests, 70,000 women were holding hands around the perimeter fence.  So we put hands around the edge of our banner too. We wanted to highlight all the ways in which women have lent a hand in history - helping during the miners' strikes and in the war effort.  I think this procession is fantastically important to highlight problems women still face.  A lot of the women who come to my sewing groups have low confidence, depression and anxiety. They can feel like they have no voice and that they are powerless. Women still face big issues - a large amount of sexism and sexual assault.  Bringing together women for any occasion is a passionate, powerful thing.  It is really important that we see our worth and what we can achieve, especially together. Sahar Al-Faifi, of Cardiff, is a molecular geneticist and community activist. She said:  Even before the procession was announced, I had been involved in centenary events to mark the first women getting the vote in Britain. I helped organise a screening of the film Suffragette and a discussion panel to consider the inequalities faced by women today.  When I was invited to take part in the procession, I wanted to make a banner to represent women of faith and colour.  I'm a scientist, so I gathered six Muslim artists and began designing. We came up with two main messages.  Firstly, we wanted to show the diversity of Muslim women. So often we are treated the same and painted with the same brush.  Secondly, there is a famous Islamic phrase, which says, ""Women are one half of society which gives birth to the other half, so it is as if they are the entire society."" This is why women need to be represented in all aspects of life.  Our banner has been digitally designed and printed, with some handwork added afterwards. It has suffragette colours, Arabic calligraphy spelling out ""freedom"" and Andalusian geometry.   I'm really excited about attending the procession. I feel it's going to be a massive medium to meet other women and share stories.  One hundred years ago, we gained the right to vote, but there are still so many inequalities, such as the gender pay gap.  Women's issues are universal issues. But speaking as a woman of faith and colour, racism and Islamophobia, especially in the workplace, affect me more.  The six artists who helped create the banner were Mariya Zaman, Shaimaa Osman, Nabila Ahmed, Emmi Khan, Jaffrin Khan and Husna Hussain."

Joyce McCarty faced a probe into claims she made in a text message of a ""Muslim plot"", which ousted her ally and former leader Nick Forbes. Ms McCarty, who was re-elected in May, will sit as an independent. Newcastle Labour Party says it condemns ""any act of hate crime"" and will ""call out any such behaviour when seen"". It said: ""Joyce McCarty has been found guilty through investigation of Islamophobia and is suspended from the Labour Party with immediate effect."" Ms McCarty declined to comment when contacted by the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Labour indicated that the 12-month suspension includes the four already served since her initial suspension in March. ""The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken,"" a spokesman added. In a text message seen by LDRS and first reported by JOE, Ms McCarty said she was aware of a ""specific Muslim plot"" organised by councillors in Newcastle's West End to remove the leader and get more black, Asian, and minority ethnic candidates selected. Despite being suspended in March, she remained on local election ballot papers for Labour in May and was re-elected in her Wingrove ward with an overwhelming majority. She was first elected to the city council in 1994 and was deputy leader from 2011 to 2021. The veteran councillor also sat on the local authority's cabinet with responsibilities for issues including support for refugees and asylum seekers. In February, Mr Forbes was defeated in the contest for his Arthur's Hill ward when Labour members voted by 13 to four in favour of Abdul Samad. Mr Forbes has alleged an ambush by left-wing members and claimed the contest was ""clearly manipulated"", but has since stepped away from city politics.

Hope Not Hate's Nick Lowles asked for Brandon Lewis to clarify his claim that all complaints of Islamophobia by party members had been dealt with. The party has not said how many investigations there are but 14 members have been suspended for Facebook posts. Mr Lewis said ""swift action"" had been taken when complaints were made. He said there was ""absolutely no place"" for anti-Muslim discrimination in the party. Mr Lowles wrote asking for clarification after Mr Lewis said in November 2018: ""We deal with complaints, none outstanding."" He said he took that statement to mean there were ""no complaints of Islamophobia outstanding"", but said: ""We now know that this is not true."" He said: ""Were you trying to mislead us, and via the statement, members of the public? ""Or are your systems and processes so broken that you did not know your statement was untrue when you made it?"" In his reply, Mr Lewis said: ""Anti-Muslim discrimination undermines society from within and there is absolutely no place for it in this country or in the Conservative Party. ""We take swift action when complaints are made to Conservative Party headquarters (CCHQ), immediately referring them for investigation. ""That was the case in November 2018, and continues to be the case today."" The Conservative Party has not said how many investigations it has conducted into allegations of Islamophobia against party members in the last year, or how many people have been suspended or thrown out. ""Investigations are rightly kept confidential and may vary in length, so we cannot and will not provide a running commentary on individual cases,"" Mr Lewis said. ""However, as you have no doubt seen, sanctions include suspensions and expulsions."" Earlier this month, former Conservative Party Chairman Baroness Warsi accused Prime Minister Theresa May of ""burying her head in the sand"" over Islamophobia in the party.  Shortly after her comments, the party confirmed 14 members had been suspended for Islamophobic Facebook posts and said ""decisive action"" would be taken against anyone making offensive remarks. Speaking to the BBC Asian Network, Baroness Warsi repeated her criticism of the party and said it was essential there was a ""clearing of the rot of Islamophobia which is festering like an underbelly in my party"". She claimed the problem was ""widespread"" in the party and had been ""going on for years"". ""The party does not take complaints seriously and only does so when there is a huge public outcry,"" she said. ""And that to me makes this problem within the party an institutional issue rather than an issue of a few bad apples."" ""Every time I try to get answers, there is a wall of bureaucracy behind which people are hiding,"" Baroness Warsi said. Only ""a full and independent inquiry"" would get to the bottom of the issue, she said."

Laurence Kahn said Labour was once the natural home for the Jewish community but claimed the leadership team had allowed anti-Semitism to ""flourish"". Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in the party. Jeremy Corbyn responded saying the party had taken ""rapid and effective"" action against anti-Semitism. Responding to the chief rabbi's comments, Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""As I have said many times... anti-Semitism is a stain on our society and I am completely clear it has no place in our party or in Wales."" Mr Kahn, chairman of the South Wales Jewish Representative Council, told BBC Wales: ""The Labour Party was at one time the natural home for the Jewish community.  ""But Jeremy Corbyn and his team have expelled the Jews by allowing anti-Semitism to flourish and spread throughout the Labour party and supporting Jew-baiters.  ""We support the chief rabbi in his statement condemning Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party and thank him for his courage and support."" Labour has been asked to respond to Mr Kahn's comments. Allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour have dogged the party for three years, leading to an investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party after being the subject of anti-Semitic abuse on social media. In Wales, the Labour assembly member for Cardiff Central Jenny Rathbone was criticised for making ""extremely offensive"" remarks about Jewish people last year.  She given a formal warning by her party, after a six-week suspension from the Labour group. The chief rabbi, who is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, said Labour's claim it had investigated all cases of anti-Semitism in its ranks was a ""mendacious fiction"". In an article for the Times, he asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the election. In response, Mr Corbyn insisted there was no place for anti-Semitism within Labour and those guilty of anti-Jewish racism had been ""brought to book"". He urged the Jewish community to ""engage"" with him. During the election campaign, Welsh Labour candidate Maria Carroll has had to explain her membership of a Facebook group offering help to party members facing anti-Semitism investigations, as well as other disciplinary matters. Ms Carroll said she left when it took ""an anti-Semitic conspiratorial direction"", but screenshots suggest she was adding comments to it last October. UK Labour said it had not found any anti-Semitic comments by her. Former Welsh Labour minister Alun Davies, assembly member for Blaenau Gwent, tweeted that Labour ""urgently [needs] to respond"" to the rabbi's comments and ""not dismiss this as a smear or pretend that [UK Labour] does not have a serious and fundamental problem"". On the same day, the Muslim Council of Britain accused the Conservative Party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia. Mr Davies added: ""The fact that two major faith groups have spoken out today tells us a lot about our politics and the nature of our political parties. ""It appears that both of our two main parties are infected by a prejudice that isn't being addressed."""

Official results showed the measure had passed by 51.2% to 48.8% in Sunday's referendum. The proposal was put forward by the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) which campaigned with slogans such as ""Stop extremism"". A leading Swiss Islamic group said it was ""a dark day"" for Muslims. ""Today's decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority,"" the Central Council of Muslims said in a statement, adding that it would challenge the decision in court. The Swiss government had argued against the ban saying it was not up to the state to dictate what women wear. According to research by the University of Lucerne (in German), almost no-one in Switzerland wears a burka and only around 30 women wear the niqab. About 5% of Switzerland's population of 8.6 million people are Muslim, most originating from Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo. Swiss people are given a direct say in their own affairs under the country's system of direct democracy. They are regularly invited to vote on various issues in national or regional referendums. It is not the first time Islam has figured in a Swiss referendum. In 2009 citizens went against government advice and voted to ban the building of minarets - a proposal also put forward by the SVP which said minarets were a sign of Islamisation. The proposal in Sunday's referendum did not mention Islam directly and was also aimed at stopping violent street protesters from wearing masks. However, the vote was widely referred to as ""the burka ban"". The latest proposal predated the coronavirus pandemic, which has meant all Swiss adults having to wear masks in many settings. Analysis by Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Geneva Was today's vote about all face coverings, from niqabs and burkas to the scarves rioters sometimes pull over their faces?  That's what the Yes campaigners from the Swiss People's Party insisted - but their posters and literature said otherwise, showing threatening looking women in black niqabs, and warning of Islamic extremism.  So does the result mean the Swiss are becoming more extreme? Are they Islamophobic?  Perhaps not. In the end, the ban only just squeaked through. In the past the Swiss People's Party has had much bigger majorities for its populist initiatives, often aimed at restricting asylum and immigration.  It successfully pushed through a ban on minarets in 2009 with a similar campaign to this one. But the debate around face coverings touched all sorts of different nerves. Many Swiss feminists view the burka and niqab as oppressive to women but they also oppose laws telling women what they can and cannot wear. When it came to voting they were torn. A regular answer from women asked whether they would support the ban was ""Jein"", a cross between ""Ja"" (yes) and ""Nein"" (no). Today's close vote in Switzerland was probably very much a ""Jein"" as well. Sanija Ameti, a member of Switzerland's Muslim community, told the BBC that the campaign - and the depiction of Muslim women in the posters - had been upsetting.  ""So many Muslims in Switzerland will feel insulted and not part of this society, and pushed into a corner where they don't belong. We don't look like these women in the pictures, we just don't,""  she said. However, others in the Muslim community supported the ban.  Imam Mustafa Memeti, from the city of Bern, told the BBC he thought the motivation behind the campaign was ""probably Islamophobic"". But he said he supported the ban anyway because it could help to emancipate Muslim women in Switzerland. Ahead of the vote, Walter Wobmann, chairman of the referendum committee and an SVP lawmaker, described Muslim face coverings as ""a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland"". ""In Switzerland our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms,"" he said. Amnesty International spoke out against the proposed ban, calling it ""a dangerous policy that violates women's rights, including to freedom of expression and religion"". The wearing of Islamic veils in public has been a controversial topic in other European countries. France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 while the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria and Bulgaria have put in place full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public."

The black and minority ethnic (BAME) members of the Black and Green Ambassadors programme discussed the issues at a virtual seminar on Monday. The new ambassadors - Asia Yousif, Olivia Sweeney and Roy Kareem - were introduced at the event. Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said the scheme will ""rebuild a better Bristol."" The ambassadors discussed topics including their connection to nature, and the importance of visibility and opportunities for diverse voices to become more involved in environmental projects.  Ms Sweeney told the BBC that sustainability is something she has always been passionate about.  ""I remember learning the three Rs, Reduce ReUse Recycle at school and ever since then it has been my thing,"" she explained. ""As I have grown up I have become increasingly aware of the social justice and behaviour change angle of the environmental movement.  ""Talking about race is hard in certain settings so being able to find my voice within an understanding and supportive network is a rare privilege."" Mr Kareem said he got involved because he ""hadn't seen many people that looked like me represented in the environmental sector or the sustainability movement"". He applauded the programme for dealing with the ""intersection of sustainability, culture and fairness"". The Black and Green Ambassadors scheme is an Ujima Radio CIC and Bristol Green Capital Partnership initiative launched after the city won the European Green Capital award in 2015. Marvin Rees said: ""Working together with all of Bristol - in all of its diversity - and empowering communities is at the heart of our strategy to tackle the climate and ecological emergencies."""

Marvin Rees said it should not have been a shock his own council was found to have a racism issue because organisations ""reflect wider society"". In July, Bristol City Council admitted it was institutionally racist and needed to take drastic action. The mayor's comments came during a Facebook live broadcast where he was accused of ignoring the issue. After the institutional racism finding a series of recommendations, including the need for positive action when recruiting, were accepted by Bristol City Council. But in this week's Facebook Live event city resident Abs Ali asked Mr Rees: ""What changes have you made since Bristol City Council was found to be institutional racist? ""Based on my experience and others, institutional racism and Islamophobia is rife."" The mayor replied: ""That is the world. It's a racially-unequal world. ""There is no institution in this country that is free of institutional racism - and there never has been because they reflect wider society. ""There was no shocking moment when the council was found to be institutionally racist. ""It's in our economy, it's in our politics. It is rife."" Mr Rees said the 2017 Runnymede Report found Bristol was the seventh-worst city in which to be born black. ""We are a city of inequalities. We have led the city to a point where it faces up to that,"" he said. He added 150 people from underrepresented groups had taken part in the council's Stepping Up programme, aimed at improving leadership diversity, of which a ""very significant number"" had achieved promotions. Mr Rees said another scheme was aimed at helping Somali women while the authority's work on domestic violence and youth violence targeted specific communities."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-47453711,Top Labour activist defends suspended MP,An MP called on Labour to look into the behaviour of a senior party figure that issued a defence of a suspended MP.,5 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has called on his party's general secretary to look into the behaviour of a senior Welsh party figure. Darren Williams issued a statement on behalf of the Welsh Labour Grassroots pro-Corbyn group defending suspended Labour MP Chris Williamson. The Derby North MP said Labour had been ""too-apologetic"" over anti-Semitism. A WLG spokesman said Mr Williams had not made a public statement on the matter. Mr Williams - a staunch supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford - emailed the statement to colleagues earlier this week. Derby North's Mr Williamson was suspended from the party, pending an investigation, after the remarks came to light. The MP said he regretted the comments. Welsh Labour Grassroots (WLG) - the Welsh version of the pro-Corbyn Momentum faction of Labour - said his comments were ""surely well within the scope of legitimate debate"" and that Mr Williamson's suspension was ""unfair and unnecessary"". Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock sought advice from Jennie Formby on whether there are grounds for disciplinary action against the group's secretary ""because political interference in political disputes is not allowed."" Welsh Government Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Labour Grassroots stance was ""staggering"". In the statement, the group said there was ""no justification for suspending Chris Williamson"". It called for his suspension ""to be ended and the whip restored"". Mr Williamson's comments had been misinterpreted by Labour politicians and the media, the WLG claimed. Rather than suggesting that Labour has apologised too readily to people in the Jewish community, WLG said Mr Williamson was ""seeking to argue that Labour politicians have often been too quick to accept questionable claims about the scale of the problem"". ""WLG remains implacably opposed to anti-Semitism, along with all other forms of racism, such as Islamophobia, and bigotry and prejudice of any kind,"" the statement said, saying the group offered ""unconditional solidarity to all those who encounter such hatred"". All cases of anti-Semitic abuse should continue to be dealt with through the party's procedures, WLG said. But the public discussion on the issue ""often militates against the kind of frank and serious discussion needed to develop effective solutions"", the statement added. In response, several Welsh Labour MPs expressed concerns over the role of Mr Williams, who is a representative on Labour's ruling body the National Executive Committee (NEC) as well as the Welsh Executive Committee (WEC).  The MPs said it was worrying that such a senior figure in the party is commentating on a live investigation, and think distributing material critical of an ongoing investigation is incompatible with his role on the NEC.  Senior Welsh Labour sources believe Darren Williams should consider his position on the NEC and WEC, with one suggesting he has abused his position on both bodies. It is understood that the statement was agreed by the 28 members of the WLG steering committee and he sent it to members in his role as the group secretary.  Labour's General Secretary Jennie Formby has warned constituency parties, the NEC and other Labour Party bodies that disciplinary cases against individuals are confidential and should not be discussed.  Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor, said the WLG statement would appear to contravene this instruction.  In response, a WLG spokesman said the statement had been a collective one which had been unanimously agreed by the steering committee, and said Mr Williams had made no public statement about the issue. Welsh Labour Grassroots supported Mark Drakeford's bid to become Welsh Labour leader in last year's leadership contest, while the group has consistently supported Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. A Welsh Labour spokesman said: ""As the First Minister of Wales and the leader of Welsh Labour Mark Drakeford has said on many occasions, there is no place for anti-Semitism in Welsh Labour or in Wales."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61717423,How Islamophobia is hurting India's foreign policy,This is not the first time India's ruling party has faced global opprobrium for alleged Islamophobia.,8 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In April 2020 allegations about a Muslim congregation sparking a cluster of Covid-19 cases in India quickly took an Islamophobic turn. Thousands of preachers from home and abroad had attended the gathering in Delhi by the Tablighi Jamaat, a near-100 year-old Islamic missionary movement. Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government called it a ""super-spreader event"".  Islamophobic memes and hashtags blaming the group for spreading the virus trended on social media, and news networks broadcast incendiary headlines such as ""Save the country from Corona jihad"". India charged nearly a thousand people who attended the congregation for flouting lockdown protocols. (Eight months later, courts had acquitted the last of the detained preachers, saying they had been ""maliciously prosecuted"" under directions from the government.)  Most of the preachers came from Indonesia, a trading partner of India. Not surprisingly, Indonesia expressed its disquiet over the issue at regional summit meetings. The country's lawmakers alleged that the controversy was being used to taint Muslims in Hindu-majority India. A former Indian diplomat said this was an example of ""externalisation"" of domestic issues. India's ongoing diplomatic firefighting over offensive comments made by two senior members of the BJP about the Prophet Muhammad is not the first time that Mr Modi's party or government has faced global censure for alleged Islamophobia.  Two years ago BJP MP Tejasvi Surya found himself in the centre of a storm when his 2015 tweet on Arab women went viral. Prominent businesspeople, lawyers and commentators in Dubai and Kuwait condemned his remarks. (Mr Surya deleted the tweet later.) In a 2018 public meeting, India's interior minister Amit Shah said that Bangladeshi citizens who had entered India illegally were ""infiltrators"" who had ""eaten our country like termites"".  This whipped up a storm in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, where a senior minister described the remark by India' second most powerful leader as ""unwanted and uninformed"". A Bangladeshi columnist wrote that Mr Shah ""had a long history of making hateful, insulting remarks about Bangladesh"". Over the past year, India has been hit by a tsunami of hate speech by saffron-robed right-wing Hindu radical leaders against the country's 200 million-strong Muslim community. Some of them have openly exhorted Hindus to take up arms and spoken about genocide of Muslims.  In the past, the right-wing has raised the bogey of so called ""love jihad"", a baseless conspiracy theory accusing Muslim men of converting Hindu women by marriage. Vigilante Hindu mobs have lynched suspected Muslim cow smugglers and demanded a boycott of businesses owned by the community.  On social media, female Muslim journalists and social workers have been ferociously trolled. Muslim women have been put up for sale in fake online auctions. Partisan news networks have added fuel to the fire by provoking participants into taking up extreme positions during shrill talk shows.    Mr Modi's government has either maintained a studied silence, been slow to respond or blamed ""fringe elements"" for such actions. All this appears to have emboldened ordinary Hindus to go online and tarnish Muslims. There have been consequences. In 2018, a popular Indian-origin chef working in a Dubai hotel was fired for posting an anti-Islamic tweet. When Indians living in Dubai began posting anti-Tablighi Jamaat tweets in 2020, a local businesswoman with links to the ruling royal family tweeted that ""anyone that is openly racist and discriminatory in the UAE will be fined and made to leave"".  This time too, unsurprisingly, the blowback has been fierce - 15 countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Qatar, have lodged protests with India. Making derogatory remarks against the Prophet was clearly ""crossing the red line"", says Talmiz Ahmad, a former Indian diplomat.  Mr Modi's government has been forced to suspend its spokesperson for her remarks. It is a reminder that ""targeting minorities with impunity, and hate speech with official sanction, will have repercussions for India's global reputation,"" notes Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a leading scholar.  In private, many BJP leaders believe that the outrage will soon die down, and it will be business as usual.  After all, India has an old and deep relationship with the Gulf countries. Some 8.5 million Indians work in the six Gulf countries belonging to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), more than double the number of Pakistanis, the next highest expatriate workforce.  Indians also form the largest expat community in each of these countries. They send home some $35bn every year in remittances that support 40 million family members at home, many in some of India's poorest states such as BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh. Trade between India and GCC countries is about $87bn. Iraq is the largest exporter of oil to India, followed by Saudi Arabia. More than 40% of India's natural gas comes from Qatar.  Prime Minister Modi himself has made relations with Gulf countries a priority. ""India has a significant relationship with West Asian countries in terms of energy security, employment of people as migrants and remittances that they send back,"" says Srinath Raghavan, a professor of history and international relations at the Ashoka University. But India cannot be complacent and take things for granted. ""It's a myopic way of looking at things,"" says Mr Ahmad, the former diplomat who is also author of a new book, West Asia at War. ""Indians have built a reputation as an apolitical, law-abiding and technically proficient people in these countries. If such offensive talk continues, employers in the Gulf could quietly start moving away from hiring Indians. Why would they risk hiring a potential zealot?"" This time Mr Modi's government, experts believe, appears to have reacted late, but resolutely. ""There seems to be an acknowledgement that if these things happen there can be consequences. Domestic and foreign politics are not insulated. The government has to make up its mind. Does it really want to get into rabble rousing?"" Prof Raghavan says."

Zarah Sultana, Labour MP for Coventry South, recounted her experiences during a debate on Islamophobia. In an emotional speech, she said she had been called a ""terrorist sympathiser"", and described being treated by some people ""as if I were an enemy of the country I was born in"". She added she had also been addressed in a letter as ""scum of the earth"". Speaking at Westminster Hall on Thursday, the 27-year-old said: ""Before being elected I was nervous about being a Muslim woman in the public eye. ""Growing up, I had seen the abuse prominent British Muslims were subjected to - I knew I wouldn't be in for an easy ride. ""And today I would like to say I was wrong to be worried when young Muslim girls ask me what it's like. ""I would like to say 'there is nothing to worry about', that they would face the same challenges as their non-Muslim friends and colleagues, but I cannot say that because in my short time in Parliament that is not my experience."" In a tweet sharing a video of her speech, she said it was not an easy one to give, but, she added: ""I can't be silent about Islamophobia"". MPs were debating a definition of Islamophobia created by a cross-party group of MPs. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims is calling on the government to adopt it.  During the debate, Ms Sultana told other members about a series of hate letters she had received since being elected in 2019. ""One person for example wrote to me, and I quote, 'Sultana, you and your Muslim mob are a real danger to humanity'. Another wrote I am a cancer everywhere I go and soon, they said, 'Europe will vomit you out'. ""A third called me a 'terrorist sympathiser and scum of the earth' and that is sanitised of their unparliamentary language."" The MP broke down in tears as she told the hall: ""I have discovered that to be a Muslim woman, to be outspoken and to be left wing is to be subjected to this barrage of hate. It is to be treated by some as if I were an enemy of the country I was born in. As if I don't belong."" Communities minister Eddie Hughes said: ""We remain committed to there being a robust and effective definition [of Islamophobia] and we will outline our steps to achieve this in due course.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43071847,Sarwar reveals blueprint to combat racism,The MSP has written to the first minister with proposals to tackle Islamophobia in Scotland.,15 Feb 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour MSP Anas Sarwar has written to the first minister outlining a series of proposals to tackle ""everyday racism and Islamophobia"" across Scotland.   Mr Sarwar wants the Scottish government to take action on black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) representation in the public sector workforce.   He also called for a review of the legal framework surrounding racist and Islamophobic abuse on social media. The Scottish government said it would consider the proposals. Mr Sarwar's letter to Nicola Sturgeon comes after he was allegedly subjected to racist comments by a Labour councillor. Mr Sarwar said the Labour group leader at South Lanarkshire Council told him he could not support Mr Sarwar's bid to lead Scottish Labour during last year's campaign to replace Kezia Dugdale as ""Scotland wouldn't vote for a brown Muslim Paki"". Scottish Labour later confirmed that councillor Davie McLachlan had been suspended by the party pending an investigation. Mr McLachlan has denied making the comments. Mr Sarwar recently launched a Cross Party Group (CPG) on tackling Islamophobia, supported by MSPs from every political party and over 50 organisations.   In his letter to Ms Sturgeon, he said his proposals were about ""challenging a culture that impacts on workplaces, colleges, university campuses and playgrounds across the country"". The Glasgow MSP called on the Scottish government to put in place a requirement for at least one BAME candidate - where at least one had applied - to be shortlisted for an interview for a public sector job. His proposals also include a regular audit of the diversity of Scotland's workforce, the ability for public sector workers to report abuse anonymously, and a programme of equality and diversity training to be rolled out across the public sector. On social media, Mr Sarwar called for a review ""to ensure that the correct legal framework exists for the police to take action and that the appropriate legal framework is then enforced appropriately and correctly"". And he said Police Scotland should also establish a formal relationship with the organisation Tell MAMA, which works on tackling anti-Muslim hatred.   Mr Sarwar, one of only four BAME MSPs to have sat at Holyrood, said: ""I want to repeat what I have said in every conversation, in every piece of communication, and in every media comment - this isn't about one individual or one party or organisation.   ""It's about challenging a culture that impacts on workplaces, colleges, university campuses and playgrounds across the country. ""What I have set out are steps that I believe the Scottish government should take to challenge the consequences of everyday racism and Islamophobia. ""This would demonstrate to the public how seriously we - as a parliament and a country - take this issue and help us to tackle this culture head-on.""   A Scottish government spokesman responded: ""As stated in parliament, the first minister is committed to working constructively with the proposed cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia. ""We will consider the points raised by Mr Sarwar when we receive the letter and reply to him in due course. ""Everyday racism, Islamophobia or any form of prejudice and bigotry is completely unacceptable, and it is wrong for MSPs, or anyone in our society, to be the subject or victim of it. ""We are resolved to do everything that it takes to ensure that Scotland is a place where there is zero tolerance of racism in any form."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50588623,Decisive moments in UK election campaign,Was this the week when it became clear Boris Johnson's Conservatives were likely to win the election?,30 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Was this the week people will look back on as when it became clear Boris Johnson and the Conservatives were likely to win the general election?  I say this because this election was always going to be decided by three big issues. So how does all the above fit in with what's been happening in the campaign these last few days?      To take the Leave versus Remain vote first, the key moment was the launch of the Conservative Party's manifesto - what it's promising if it wins the election.   With its familiar title ""Get Brexit Done"", it was an unashamed pitch to Leave voters furious the UK hasn't left the EU yet, and undoubtedly to other voters just sick of the whole Brexit stalemate/mess/morass.     Crucially for the Conservatives, as the rest of their manifesto was largely a steady-as-she-goes approach in all other policy areas, ""Get Brexit Done"" was just about the only message that stood out.   One imagines that is exactly what the party's campaign managers were hoping for - as, no doubt, was the relatively limited journalistic and political scrutiny there has since been as to exactly what ""Get Brexit Done"" means, and the extent to which relations with the EU are in fact likely to dominate UK politics for the foreseeable future.  But if the launch of the Conservative Party was a unifying moment for Leave voters, the opposite has been true for the forces of Remain and/or a second EU referendum.  Despite the endorsement of several high-profile Conservatives, the biggest out-and-out anti-Brexit party nationally, the Liberal Democrats, have really been struggling. Opinion polling suggests the party and its leader, Jo Swinson, are failing to gain traction, with many party insiders now thinking it was perhaps a massive mistake to make their main policy to just stop Brexit rather than to hold a second referendum.  Why? Because it looks rather undemocratic.   More broadly it's becoming clear the Conservatives are benefiting from the failure or unwillingness of all the political parties who either oppose Brexit altogether - or at least Mr Johnson's vision of it - to form some broad electoral pact against him.  Indeed, that may come to be the big story of this election for historians wondering why Remain politicians were unable to block Brexit, given that most polls now show opinion has shifted somewhat against leaving the EU. This election is less about who is the most popular leader and party and rather more about who is the least unpopular.   Opinion polls consistently suggest Jeremy Corbyn is the most unpopular leader of the Opposition since the question was first asked by pollsters in the 1970s. So an attack on the Labour leader from the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, accusing Mr Corbyn of allowing the poison of anti-Semitism to drip into the party was never going to help. Although it's true the Conservatives were also accused of racism this week - in their case Islamophobia - the allegations are seen, fairly or not, more as involving individual acts of crass behaviour rather than as being something somehow to do with the world view of their party or their leader.  Labour has also been struggling to make this election about the government's record rather than about Brexit or Mr Corbyn.    Polls do suggest the party has had some success in focusing voters' attention on the funding and quality of public services such as health and education. But just not enough.    The party's case has not been helped by Mr Corbyn's struggles to explain exactly how the government would fund its promised huge increase in the size of the state, without increasing taxes on ordinary people.  That emerged in the face of a hostile interviewer on the BBC, the well-known terror of politicians, Andrew Neil. It should be noted, in passing, that Mr Johnson has so far avoided the ordeal of being grilled by Mr Neil.  If, as the polls are suggesting, Mr Johnson is on his way to victory, it'll be thanks to a probably sometimes overlapping coalition of voters who either backed Leave in 2016 and/or think Mr Corbyn is dangerously leftwing.  Of course, it's worth remembering these are just polls, not real votes, and there are still two weeks to go. But as of now the Conservatives are surely the happiest of the main parties.    One last thought: this was supposed to be the Brexit election. In many ways, of course, it is in terms of which party can capitalise best on a deeply polarised country.  What the election hasn't really featured so far is a detailed discussion of either what Brexit will really look like or what would be the consequences of not going ahead with the UK leaving.  And that lack of debate may come back to haunt whoever ends up the winner.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54937713,Working from home 'could lead to more prejudice',"Offices and workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, a study suggests.",16 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Widespread working from home could lead to an increase in racism and prejudice, a new report warns. Workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, the England and Wales study for the Woolf Institute suggests.  Institute founder Ed Kessler said as more people work from home they risk going ""back into isolated silos"".  He called on ministers to focus on offices and workplaces as a ""vital"" area for improving community relations.  The study, conducted by polling company Survation for the Woolf Institute, which researches interfaith relations, surveyed 11,701 people.  Hadiya Masieh, who is Muslim, became close friends with Samuel Rosengard, an Orthodox Jew, after working together. Samuel said that while he had never had racist or Islamophobic views in the past, he may have had ""misconceptions"" about Muslim communities.  ""Meeting Hadiya has really helped clarify where my thinking can be askew,"" he said. Hadiya agreed saying that for her ""it was more of a political thing about Israel and Palestine"". But through their work they have become close friends. ""It was just a very natural relationship that we formed because we had the exact same agenda and passions,"" Hadiya said. ""We were both from very different backgrounds and the idea of Israel and Palestine was a hot topic. But we were able to discuss that in a way that was understanding of each other."" Samuel added: ""Before Covid we would have regular discussions about these kinds of issues. And also identifying common cultural traits between Jewish and Muslim communities, and areas of agreement and disagreement. ""Hadiya and I would often start off conversations just bumping into each other in the open plan office and then head off for a coffee. But that just doesn't happen. So that is a loss."" The study suggests that of those who work in shared offices, three-quarters (76%) - regardless of ethnicity - were in a setting that is ethnically diverse. However, it suggests that unemployed people are 37% more likely to only have friends from their own ethnic group. And it warns that without alternative settings to offices being set up, opportunities for social mixing between different religious and ethnic groups will be greatly reduced.  The study also examined people's opinions on diversity.  Its findings suggest that while nearly three-quarters of non-black or non-Asian respondents were comfortable with a close relative marrying a black or Asian person (74% and 70%), less than half (44%) said they were comfortable with the idea of a close relative marrying a Muslim person.  ""The word 'Muslim' appears to trigger more negative sentiment than the word 'Pakistani',"" the report says. This is ""despite the fact that 90% of people of British Pakistani heritage are Muslim"". The report also indicates that a majority of Muslims were themselves uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish or Sikh person, or someone of no religion. Around a third of Muslim respondents (38%) said they were uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Christian person. ""Muslims were both the primary target for 'uncomfortable' responses, but also the primary source,"" the report said. The study estimated the level of prejudice in each local authority across England and Wales. Researchers used a technique known as Multilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP), which looks at the survey responses and the demographics of each area. As well as being the most common target of negative attitudes by other faith groups, the report indicates Muslims are the group most likely to hold negative attitudes towards people of other religions. The study also suggests that diversity of friendships and colleagues varies significantly around the country. Even after accounting for factors such as the age, educational attainment and ethnic makeup of an area, people in north-east England are 150% more likely to have only British friends and 68% more likely to have only British colleagues, compared with people in London. The report says any apparent prejudice toward religion could be due to people feeling it is more acceptable to express negative sentiment towards religion than ethnicity. Religion remains ""a place where individuals are willing to express negative attitudes,"" the report says. ""Being Muslim, in particular, appears to remain a 'trigger' for prejudice, making religion a 'final frontier' for prejudice in England and Wales,"" the report's author Dr Julian Hargreaves added.  Methodology The survey was undertaken by Survation on behalf of the Woolf Institute. Survation spoke to a nationally representative sample of 11,701 adults across England and Wales between 29 March and 5 April 2019. The results indicating the proportion of people in each local authority who would be happy with a friend or close relative marrying someone from various backgrounds use a technique called Multilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP).  MRP projects the results of the survey onto local authorities based on the demography of the area. However, some estimates contain wide margins of error and statistically non-significant differences between local authorities."

The Berlin labour court judge ruled that the city-state's neutrality law for teachers, police and court officials was constitutional. Germany's 16 states have differing laws on headscarves in schools.   Three years ago Germany's constitutional court overturned a blanket ban on teachers wearing them. The federal court cited religious freedom, although civil servants across Germany are barred from covering their faces. The full face-veil is not allowed on a national level but the hijab is. Since the 2015 federal ruling each state has devised its own rules for Muslim teachers. The teacher in Berlin worked at the primary school for only a day before being assigned to a college where she was allowed to wear the headscarf. And the headscarf issue has become controversial in several German states. Police were called in recently when a head teacher at a primary school in the state of Hesse provoked a storm of abuse. She had written to parents telling them that wearing headscarves and other coverings was not allowed in the classroom. In Bremen, in the north west, teachers are allowed to wear headscarves, while in North Rhine-Westphalia the issue is decided on a case-by-case basis. The western state is proposing a ban on girls under 14 wearing headscarves in schools. The Berlin case has prompted widespread reaction in the German capital. Wednesday's ruling has been welcomed by the founder of Berlin's liberal mosque, Seyran Ates, who has campaigned to keep religious symbols out of schools. But Zeynep Cetin of the Network Against Discrimination and Islamophobia argued that the ruling was like a professional ban on the female teacher involved. Berlin Mayor Michael Müller has expressed his support for Berlin's neutrality law but a Green party politician said he wanted it changed. A Muslim teacher won a separate case in Berlin last year, when the same labour court ruled that a school had broken anti-discrimination laws by refusing her a job. The school had been unable to prove that the headscarf was a ""threat to peace at the school""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56211065,Who is the new Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar?,Anas Sarwar takes charge of Scottish Labour just 10 weeks before the next Scottish Parliament election.,27 Feb 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Anas Sarwar has been elected the new leader of Scottish Labour, replacing Richard Leonard who led the party for three years. The Glasgow MSP takes over less than three months before the next Holyrood elections.  Anas Sarwar became a member of the Scottish Labour party at the age of 16, but politics was already in his blood.  His dad, Mohammad Sarwar, was the UK's first ever Muslim MP and held the Glasgow Central seat for Labour between 1997 and 2010  - until his son Anas succeeded him.  Graduating from the University of Glasgow, Mr Sarwar worked as a dentist in Paisley for five years prior to becoming a MP. The 37-year-old was the Glasgow Central MP from 2010 to 2015 and was firmly in the Gordon Brown camp of New Labour.  Mr Sarwar took an active role in the pro-Union campaign leading up to the 2014 independence referendum, touring Scotland in a bus with No activists.  After the Glasgow Central seat was won by the SNP's Alison Thewliss in the 2015 general election, Mr Sarwar turned his attention to Holyrood and was elected a list MSP for Glasgow in 2016. As has often been the case for Scottish Labour in the last decade, the party faced a leadership election in 2017 after Kezia Dugdale quit and Mr Sarwar was pitted against Richard Leonard.  It was a rancorous campaign and Mr Sarwar faced criticism over his children attending a fee-paying school in Glasgow, with questions also raised over his family's cash-and-carry firm advertising jobs that paid less than the ""real"" living wage of £8.45 an hour. Mr Leonard won the race, becoming the first Scottish Labour leader to come from the left of the party.  The victory firmly reflected the party's membership make-up at the time; Mr Leonard was a firm supporter of the UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn whereas Mr Sarwar had signed a letter opposing Mr Corbyn's bid for re-election.  Mr Sarwar's most high profile role as an MSP was as Scottish Labour's health spokesman and he played a key role in the concern over safety issues at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital which led to a public inquiry.  Mr Sarwar will be the first non-white leader of a major political party in the UK and has spoken in the past about the racism he has experienced as a politician.  This included death threats made against his family.  Following his unsuccessful leadership bid in 2017, Mr Sarwar claimed that one councillor had told him Scotland would not vote for him because of his religion and the colour of his skin. A party investigation ultimately found there was no case to answer but Mr Sarwar was critical of Scottish Labour's complaints system which did not allow him to give evidence at the hearing. In 2018, Mr Sarwar established the Scottish Parliament's cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia.  In his pitch to party members, Mr Sarwar said he wanted to ""rebuild Scottish Labour, and then rebuild Scotland"". The Glasgow MSP has also taken a firm stance against the prospect of another independence referendum which he claims is not credible as the country rebuilds after Covid. The immediate concern for Mr Sarwar is May's Holyrood election where party strategists are hoping the new leader can lift them from third to second place in Scottish politics."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48588604,Is it OK for civil servants to wear religious symbols?,Quebecers weigh-in on the province's new secularism law that sets a dress code for federal employees.,18 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"For a decade, Quebec has been debating the issues of state secularism and reasonable accommodation in the Canadian province. Now it has just passed a new law that bars civil servants in positions of ""authority"" from wearing religious symbols at work. Bill 21 prevents judges, police officers, teachers and public servants holding some other positions from wearing symbols such as the kippah, turban, or hijab while at work. Like similar legislation introduced by previous Quebec governments in recent years to bolster state secularism, it has led to a fierce debate.  Advocates call it a reasonable step, one with broad support in the province.  Critics say it is discriminatory, will make it more difficult for religious minorities to integrate into Quebec society, and that it unfairly targets Muslim women.  The provincial government says it is a ""logical continuation of the Quiet Revolution"", a period in the 1960s when Quebec society rapidly embraced state secularism.  The Quebec provincial legislature passed the bill late on Sunday in a 73-35 vote.  Six people who have been vocal about Bill 21 and its impact spoke to the BBC.  Furheen Ahmed has been a teacher in Quebec for over a decade, and says she feels both frustrated and angry about new law.  Her job will be protected because of a grandfather clause included in Bill 21, but the fact that ""a teacher who teaches 10 feet away from me has more opportunity than I do simply because of what I'm wearing"" is unfair, she says.  ""How can somebody sit there and say that is not the textbook definition of discrimination?"" she asks.  Proponents of the bill have been careful to note that it doesn't target any specific religion, but many critics have argued that Muslim women are most likely to be affected.   Ms Ahmed says: ""I wish this was about all religious symbols in some way but I don't think it is"".  ""I don't think if hijabi Muslim women weren't out there doing their thing, being successful in this society - but perhaps looking a bit different, dressing  a bit differently - I don't think this ban would have even come into the conversation.""  She says she felt ""proud"" when both her school's school board and the Montreal city council came out in opposition to Bill 21.  Zahra Boukersi teaches French at a private elementary school in the Montreal region where she would be allowed to wear a hijab at work. But despite her faith, she has always rejected wearing any kind of Muslim head-covering.  She doesn't see the need to wear an outward sign of faith. ""Religion is intimate - it's personal,"" she says.  ""It's between God and me. That's how I see things.""  And she has never felt comfortable with what she believes a hijab symbolises.  ""There are women who wear it truly by choice. But even when they do, I see it as an act of submission,"" she says.    Ms Boukersi has spoken frequently in the media in Quebec about her support for secularism - a conviction born from her youth in Algeria.  A civil war from 1991 to 1999 pitted Islamists against the government in the North African nation, and the Muslim veil - which already had a complicated history in the country - became mandatory.  ""In the '80s, I was a student. I was in a mini-skirt. No one cared,  it was normal, it was normal to wear tight-fitting pants or a tight-fitting shirt,"" she says.  ""Ten years later, it was a catastrophe - a radical change.""  So Ms Boukersi sees Bill 21 as a fair place to ""draw a line"" against any potential similar religious influence in Canada.  As a child, Amrit Kaur would watch her parents patiently helping other children with their school work, which sparked her interest in becoming a teacher.   But now, the Quebec vice-president at the World Sikh Organisation is wondering whether there's a place for her in Quebec as a school teacher as she finishes her education degree. For her, wearing a turban is ""just such an integral part of my ethos and my being that I can't [disassociate] from it"".  She adds: ""My faith is not something I can leave at the door. That's virtually impossible."" She rejects the idea the legislation would help integrate immigrants into society. ""The people prevented from doing their jobs are the people most integrated [into Quebec society]. They're not immigrants who just moved to the country - they're people who've studied, who know the language, who give back.""  She says for the first time in her life she feels like she is ""looked at like someone who's causing trouble - and that feels really strange"". Freedom of expression and of religion is a basic human right, she insists. ""And that's being looked down on.""  Nadia el-Mabrouk, a professor of computer science, has become a prominent advocate for secularism in Quebec.  She supports Bill 21 - in particular the provision that would ban teachers in Quebec public schools from wearing any religious symbols - and would like to see the law extended to daycare workers in the province.  ""I'm not opposed to the veil,"" she tells the BBC. ""I'm talking about at school, at work, when in contact with children - at that point we say they need to be neutral."" She has compared asking teachers to remove religious symbols to when cartoon illustrators were asked to replace the constant cigarette dangling from comic strip cowboy Lucky Luke's mouth with a piece of straw. ""Lucky Luke wasn't actively pushing cigarettes - it's a drawing - but it was seen as influencing children,"" she explains.  She says a woman wearing a headscarf in a classroom is ""passive proselytism"".  ""I'm not saying it's indoctrination,"" she says. ""I'm not saying the Montrealers who are not Muslim are being indoctrinated. I'm saying it's a conditioning mainly for young Muslim students. It transmits the idea that a Muslim woman is veiled.""  She rejects the idea that the lengthy debate in the province over secularism is due to an undercurrent of Islamophobia or xenophobia - a frequent refrain in criticism of the issue.  She contends many Canadians - where the idea of multiculturalism is, in her word, ""sacred"" - misunderstand Quebec's desire for secularism.  ""It's a debate between two very different visions,"" she says.    Taran Singh, Quebec Sikh community representative and member of the Coalition Inclusion Quebec, has a question. ""What is the underlying evidence beneath this need?"" He sees Bill 21 as a ""divisive solution"" in need of a problem and says advocates have presented no direct evidence that public servants wearing religious symbols undermine the separation of Church and state.  ""Here there is a presumption that is being made - that wearing a symbol is somehow proselytising,"" he says.  Previously proposed legislative secularism solutions by former provincial governments in recent years has caused ""social cohesion"" to suffer in Quebec, he says.  ""Bill 21 clearly sends me the message that I am not an equal participant citizen in this society."" David Rand, a staunch secularist and atheist, calls Bill 21 ""a perfectly reasonable restriction"" similar to those already in place for public servants when it comes to showing partisan political preference while at work.   And he has little sympathy for those who argue they have been given a difficult decision between their faith and their career.  There is a certain kind of reserve that is necessary when working for the state, a certain kind of discretion, he says.  ""I would not wear a T-shirt that says 'God does not exist' if I went to work in the public service and I expect the same savoir vivre of a woman who wears a hijab or a man who wears a kippah, that they would remove it if they go to work in the public service."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43544115,Mother run over twice 'thought I had died',Zaynab Hussein's attacker hit her with a car twice in a hate crime that has left her bed-bound for six months.,27 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In September last year, a 21-year-old man deliberately drove his car at a woman, and, having knocked her to the ground, returned to do so again. Left with life-changing injuries, Zaynab Hussein, who is still recovering, has spoken to the BBC about life before and after this horrific incident. Mrs Hussein, a mother of nine, had just dropped her two youngest children off at school in Leicester when a car mounted the pavement and ploughed into her. The 47-year-old was thrown against a nearby wall and fell to the ground after hitting her head. As she lay helpless, her assailant performed a U-turn, and, noting that she was still alive, made a second attack. He mounted the pavement and drove over her with all four wheels.  Reliving the events of the day, Mrs Hussein said that when she was hit the first time she ""started feeling sick and dizzy"". ""Since no-one was helping me, I thought I would help myself. I tried to reach for my phone and as I was looking for it, he came back a second time."" The injuries sustained from the second blow have left her confined to bed for the past six months. She has been receiving specialist treatment to heal and mend the severe fractures to her pelvis, spine and limbs. ""My leg has been destroyed in a way that you wouldn't think is humanly possible. It is entirely crushed. I had skin and muscle tissue removed from [my thigh] to patch my leg together,"" she said.  ""My [right] forearm snapped in half and folded in on itself so that my fingers were touching my elbow crease."" Recalling the attack, Mrs Hussein remembers falling into unconsciousness and fearing her life was about to end. She struggles to hold back the tears: ""I was screaming 'help me, help me!' to people but no-one came - everyone just left me to it. ""When he hit me again, I could hear people saying 'oh my God, he is back'... They were just watching me. ""I became conscious again when I was in the ambulance. My son was called from college and he was with me. I heard him crying and that's what brought me back.  ""I thought I had died, so I wasn't expecting to become conscious again. I couldn't believe that I was alive."" The most difficult thing for Mrs Hussein to come to terms with is the loss of her independence.  The youngest of her children is aged just three. ""I was someone who was raising her children, who was working and did everything for herself."" Now, she struggles to look after herself. Simple tasks such as using the lavatory are a challenge when no-one is around to help. ""I can't raise [my leg]. When I'm forced to go to the toilet by myself, I drag my damaged leg on the floor behind me. Sometimes I can't get up at all, so they put a pot with a chair in the room for me."" All of the good memories from her adopted home city are now overshadowed by a darkness. Prior to the attack, Mrs Hussein had lived a quiet life with family, in Leicester.  After escaping violence and instability in Somalia, she had moved to the East Midlands city in 2003 and worked as a cleaner. ""I was happy and loved it here. I've experienced something that has made me forget all the good memories,"" she said. She finds it incomprehensible someone could harm a complete stranger for no reason. ""I didn't do anything to him. He didn't know me, I didn't know him. I wasn't crossing the road. He hit me because he felt like it. It was arrogance... there was no other motive than to hurt me. ""If someone hits you once - it is horrible, but you can tell yourself it might have been an accident or a mistake. For him to come back a second time... that was very hard."" Mrs Hussein's attack was treated as a hate crime and her assailant, Paul Moore, also from Leicester, was found guilty of attempted murder, at Nottingham Crown Court in February. Jurors also convicted him of the attempted grievous bodily harm of a 12-year-old Somali girl - he tried to drive at the schoolgirl, who was wearing a headscarf, moments after Mrs Hussein's attack. Moore, 21, has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years. At his trial, his half-brother, Lewis Welsh, said Moore had used racist terms to describe the attack afterwards. ""I don't think he knew what he was saying or doing. But he did tell me that he had ran over a 'Paki',"" he said. ""He tried to put it down to the London 7/7 bombings. He said he was proud of himself. He was rambling. He was doing the country a favour."" Mrs Hussein believes Moore's attack was inspired by Islamophobia. ""He was looking for [points to her headscarf]. If we're being honest, that's what he was after. There were lots of other people he could've hurt - it was a busy time - but he sought out people with headscarves."" Moving forward, she says the only thing that matters to her is that an attack like this should never happen again.  ""I don't want any other human being to experience what I have been through,"" she said. ""To cruelly make someone, who was healthy, disabled within a matter of minutes is something that I wouldn't want to happen to anyone - not even the person who hit me.  ""Everyone - no matter their race, religion or whatever they are - should be protected from this."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-41178811,'Sorry' daubed on racist attack house,An apparent apology is left on a house which had earlier been daubed with racist and Islamophobic graffiti.,7 Sep 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"""Sorry"" has been daubed over a house owned by Hindus after Islamophobic graffiti was painted over. The apology was sprayed in black paint on a whitewashed wall on the front of the property in Liverpool on 28 August. The previous day it was covered with racist and Islamophobic graffiti and several windows were broken, police investigating the hate crime said. The owners are Hindus of Sri Lankan heritage rather than Pakistani Muslims referenced in the abusive messages. The graffiti on the property in Stapleton Avenue, Speke, contained references to both Pakistani people and Islam. The owners are due to move in at the end of September following the completion of renovation work. Det Sgt Phil Atkinson said: ""The victims in this case have been supported... Our community policing officers will be giving the area close attention in the coming days and weeks. ""I would like to urge anyone out there who may have been a victim of hate crime to get in contact, so we can take action."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-41917784,'I thought Remembrance was a white event',Remembrance serves to honour those who gave their lives for Britain - but do all those who fought get the recognition they deserve?,12 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Remembrance serves as a way to honour those who gave their lives for Britain in conflict, including during the two World Wars, but do all those who fought get the recognition they deserve?  It was a conversation with a patient researching the Commonwealth contribution to World War One that sparked Dr Irfan Malik's interest in finding out about his ancestors.  ""Before I knew how much the Indians had contributed, growing up I thought it was very much a white war,"" he said. ""We weren't taught about the Indians in school."" It's a sentiment researchers at think tank British Future regularly come across in their efforts to highlight Muslims' participation in World War One and Two. Some 1.3 million Indian soldiers who fought in the WW1, of whom 400,000 were Muslim. In World War Two, about 2.5 million Indian soldiers took part, including 600,000 Muslims. ""There is a large appetite for this story to be told,"" said Sunder Khatwala, director of British Future. ""Remembrance is such an important occasion for the whole country that it is important we can all take part in it. ""It is part of the tapestry of the country's history."" Growing up in Nottingham, Dr Malik was well aware of Britain's annual Remembrance Day celebrations. But as a Muslim, he says he did not feel a personal connection to the events. However, his chance conversation led to three years researching his ancestry, and the discovery that both of his great-grandfathers were Indian Muslim soldiers who fought in WW1 alongside the British army. Dulmial village in Punjab - then part of British India - sent 460 of its men to fight in WW1, the largest number from any village in South Asia. They included both of Dr Malik's great-grandfathers, Subedar Mohammed Khan and Capt Ghulam Mohammad. It was a contribution, he says, that finally made him feel he had a connection to Remembrance. ""I used to see the Remembrance functions happening and I didn't feel I could take part in them fully,"" he said. ""But now I actually take part in fundraising for the Poppy Appeal and lay a wreath each year for Remembrance Day to remember my ancestors."" But, says Dr Malik, not enough has been done to highlight the contributions of Muslims to the British war efforts - so he decided to take matters into his own hands. ""When I realised there was very little information on this, I decided to become a teacher myself; now I go into schools and other organisations. ""I think it reduces hate between communities and helps community cohesion. If soldiers of different faiths could fight side by side 100 years ago, why can't we get on as community groups now?"" Dulmial had a long history of producing soldiers.  During WW1, when it was part of British India, the village, approximately 100 miles south of Islamabad in the Salt Range region, sent 460 men to fight in the British army. Nine from the village lost their lives.  Among those who fought were Dr Malik's great-grandfathers, Subedar Mohammed Khan, an Indian officer in an infantry regiment of the British Indian Army, and Captain Ghulam Mohammad. When war broke out in 1914, Subedar Khan and Capt Mohammad were already soldiers able and willing to join the conflict, both having signed up in the 1880s. While little is known about Capt Ghulam Mohammad, Subedar Khan served in the 33rd Punjab Regiment. He received medals for fighting in the Tochi campaign in the north-west frontier of what is now Pakistan. Subedar Khan retired in 1918 after about 40 years of service, returning to farm in Dulmial. Dr Malik's comments are echoed by Rabia Mirza, from Derby, who recently learnt her great-grandfather Mirza Firoz Din served with the Bombay Engineer Group, building trenches and bases for the British army. ""I was never interested in history at school. All I saw were white faces I couldn't relate to,"" she said. ""Now I know about my great-grandfather, I feel much more in touch with Remembrance. ""I think the media could certainly do more to educate people about the contributions of the Indian soldiers."" Ms Mirza cited Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk as an example of a missed opportunity to highlight the contribution of minorities to war efforts. Answering his critics, Nolan argued he approached the film as a ""pure survival story"" rather than focusing on the politics of the battle, and the film's historical consultant Joshua Levine told the BBC it was a work of fiction, adding ""it isn't a film's job to tell the full story of Dunkirk... and nor, in the time available, could it even try to do so"". But Ms Mirza said: ""I think this kind of thing hinders the diversifying of Remembrance and if media like this were to be more representative it would help."" While the lines might be blurred regarding historical representation in film-making, the Royal British Legion says diversity is now an ""integral part"" of its Remembrance work. It says it has worked with community organisations, such as the Punjab Heritage Association, to co-create content and encourage further communities to seek out their stories. It also plans to run a campaign celebrating diversity and dual heritage that challenges and changes perceptions of World War One, during the centenary of the 1918 Armistice. Recently, Birmingham's and Leicester's Central Mosques, along with Nottingham's Karimia Mosque, signed an Armed Forces Covenant to strengthen links with the military. Muslim communities are also beginning to hold their own Remembrance events for the first time.  Sultan Bahu Mosque in Birmingham held a two-hour ceremony last weekend to honour fallen Muslims. Organiser Hafiz Shauket Fazil said it was important to show the young pupils of the mosque that ""they have a stake in the country"". In attendance was Jahan Mahmood, from Birmingham, who was inspired to become a military historian by his uncle Mohammed Zabir, who served in the British 14th Army in Burma in World War Two.  Zabir was kidnapped by army recruiters from his school playground at the age of 16 and forced to serve in the war, his family having no knowledge of where he had gone.  He served in Burma from about 1942 in the medical corps, but also saw action fighting against the Japanese. He was captured by the Japanese and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner, suffering severe malnutrition and being beaten badly, while watching his comrades go through similar ordeals. When he returned home he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and rarely spoke about the war. ""If I as a young boy had been aware of his story, I would [have had answers] to the racism I suffered,"" said Mr Mahmood.  ""People said to me 'what have you ever done for this country?' and 'you should go back home'."" While he accepts there has been an increase in acknowledgement of the service of Muslims, he said better education would improve tolerance in Britain today. ""I still don't think there is enough information out there,"" he said. ""British historians on the whole and the media just haven't highlighted this contribution. ""Historians of ethnic background and activists have had to bring this to the nation's attention. ""If more had been done, maybe we would not be in the predicament we are in today as there might be less racism and Islamophobia across society."" Mr Khatwala concurs. ""Highlighting the Muslim contribution dispels the far-right conception that Islam is a foreign or alien thing that can't be British."""

King Felipe VI joined the demonstrators, alongside Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The king is the first Spanish sovereign to join a march since the monarchy was re-established in the 1970s. Emergency workers and shop staff who helped during the attack at Las Ramblas also took pride of place. The procession set off behind a banner bearing the slogan ""I'm not afraid"". Other placards denounced Islamophobia.  During the march, the king and prime minister walked the streets in front of hundreds of Catalan flags - the emblem for the autonomous region's long-running independence claim.    Some protesters whistled and shouted ""out"" at the king.  Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capital, is due to hold its unrecognised independence referendum in October.  Prime Minister Rajoy had encouraged ""everyone"" to take part to show that ""Catalonia and the rest of Spain [are] united against terror"". The 17 August attack - which saw a van deliberately driven into people on the Las Ramblas boulevard - was claimed by the Islamic State group. The driver later stabbed and killed a man while hijacking his vehicle. Hours later, a car attack in nearby Cambrils killed another woman.  A cell of 12 jihadists has been blamed for the attack. Eight are dead, while four have appeared in court in Madrid. King Felipe has reigned in Spain since 2014, when his father, King Juan Carlos I, abdicated.    Spain's monarchy was restored after the death of military dictator Francisco Franco in 1975."

Colin Barton, standing in Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, was expelled from the party for sharing Islamophobic memes. Robin Popley, in Charnwood, Leicestershire, was suspended after endorsing posts, one of which criticised the Duchess of Sussex. Neither have responded to requests for comment. Mr Barton's case was highlighted by BBC Radio Nottingham. Mr Barton, who was standing for Worksop South East in next week's borough council elections, shared various Facebook posts, one of which implied two headscarf-wearing women would be stoned for kissing. He also shared another meme which linked the sexual exploitation of white girls with Labour seeking ""Pakistani Muslim votes"". Mr Popley, who was standing as a candidate for Shepshed East, was suspended following a report in The Guardian newspaper.  It said he had ""liked"" a Facebook post that said Prince Harry's choice of wife was ""way off"", describing the duchess as ""a divorcee of mixed race 'actress' who has shown her ass on HBO"". The article also said Mr Popley had ""loved"" a post which said the appointment of Home Secretary Sajid Javid was ""aimed at securing the ethnic vote"" and a ""purely cynical tactic"" from Prime Minister Theresa May.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-42650014,Schools urged to tackle Islamophobia,Young Muslims share their experiences to help schools in Wales teach issues around Islamophobia.,15 Jan 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Young Muslims in Wales say they have been frequently stared at in public, called ""terrorists"" at school and been told by strangers to take off headscarves. It comes as schools have been urged to raise awareness of Islamophobia. The Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland is focusing on the harm caused by religious hate crime.  Muslim pupils have shared their experiences to help shape resources for the classroom. The most recent UK Government statistics showed a 29% rise in hate crimes in England and Wales. Religious hate crime increased by 35% between 2016-17, during a time when a charity in Wales said teachers from 13 of the 22 local authorities reported incidents of racism in the last year. Ms Holland said: ""I've spoken to young Muslims from across Wales who've told me that they're often scared in their communities, that they've directly experienced abuse at school, and that they're tired of the way Islam is often portrayed by the media, and the effect this has on the views of their non-Muslim peers."" Young Muslims' views have helped shape the new resources for teachers to use in the classroom. Videos include contributions of pupils from Cathays High School in Cardiff where around three quarters are from minority ethnic backgrounds.  Shutha, 15, said has had ""a few racial comments"" directed at her. ""Stuff like 'go back to your country', stuff about what's on my head without knowing necessarily what it's for,"" she said. ""I used to think it was people being horrible but as I grew older I realised that people aren't really educated on the topic of Islam, the topic of what we do in our religion, why we do it and why we dress a certain way, why our beliefs are a certain way."" She added: ""And I feel like if people get more educated on that, there'll be less Islamophobia, there'll be just less hate in general."" Though Azeem, 16, has not had direct experience of Islamophobia, some of his friends have.  ""On the bus people wouldn't want to sit next to them because they're wearing headscarves,"" he said. Ibby, 17, considers himself lucky to attend a multi-cultural school which he describes as ""a cohesive community"". But outside the school gates friends have been ""verbally assaulted"" by people on the street, he said. ""Early intervention is what's needed before the problem becomes a serious problem"", he said. ""Teaching young people about religion, about culture is hugely important"". Lesson plans produced for the project have been trialled in schools in Swansea, Cardiff and Neath. Jo Bamsey, a religious education teacher at Pentrehafod Comprehensive, Swansea, said they had received positive feedback from pupils. ""The three lessons were well thought-out and allowed for honest discussion in an open and reflective environment,"" she said. Fiona Thomas, a teacher at Dwr-y-Felin Comprehensive in Neath, added: ""The resources conveyed the message clearly to our students that as humans we are all the same, enjoying playing football, listening to music and playing on the Xbox."" Anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card said that teachers in 16 of Wales' 22 local authorities had contacted them for support for help dealing with incidents of racism, or for help in delivering workshops. Sunil Patel, campaign manager, said: ""The number of inquiries our charity has received has trebled compared to the same period last year."" Ms Holland said she recognised the challenge faced by teachers in tackling sensitive issues. ""We know teachers can sometimes feel unsure and nervous about delivering lessons on topics like this, and I hope this resource gives teachers the necessary guidance and support."" she said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-50421218,Conservative resignation over Islamophobia claim,"Kyle Pedley says he was ""aghast"" at comments made during a local election selection meeting in October.",14 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A deputy chair of Stourbridge Conservative Association has resigned amid claims of Islamophobia within the party. Kyle Pedley said he was ""aghast"" at comments made during a local election selection meeting in October. The chairman of Stourbridge Conservative Association denies any Islamophobia in his party. Conservative central office says any claims of discrimination are always investigated thoroughly. Mr Pedley has been a deputy chairman since August 2019 and he participated in a selection for candidates for the local council. He says in his first meeting as an officer they interviewed a candidate for selection for the local council.  ""As soon as his two-minute pitch ended, he was faced with a barrage of questioning which was factored around one thing and one thing alone, and that was his religion and his race. ""It was 'Are you really a Muslim? Do you pray five times a day? How many times a year do you go to the mosque?'"" Mr Pedley added: ""When he went out of the room the first topic of conversation was not about his merit, it was along the lines of 'do we need an Asian?'""   Mr Pedley says he sent two complaints to Conservative central office, the first three weeks ago, including one to the Conservative chairman's office. Other than an acknowledgement he says the party has not followed up with an investigation. The chairman of the Stourbridge Conservative Association said there was no Islamophobia in his association and was ""mystified"" at Mr Pedley's resignation from the party. He said he did not remember or recall the details of the selection meeting as described by Mr Pedley. Politics Live has spoken to another member of the Stourbridge Association who is a Muslim, and he said he never witnessed any discrimination within the party. Baroness Warsi, the former co-chair of the Conservatives who has pushed for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the party, said she was ""shocked"" but ""not surprised"" by the allegations.  ""This is really a reflection of the kind of things that I've been hearing now over four years, happening in associations up and down the country.""  A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. Serious allegations such as these are always investigated thoroughly, which is testament to the seriousness with which we take such issues. ""Our complaints process is rightly a confidential one and there are a wide range of sanctions including suspension and expulsion which are applied on a case-by-case basis."" Update 27 November 2019: Since this article was first published the Conservative Party has told the BBC that a formal investigation was launched in response to Mr Pedley's complaint, and that they wrote to him three days later to confirm this."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-48356351,How disinformation spread in Brexit Facebook groups,Closed online groups were targeted by disinformation in run-up to European elections.,30 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Social media groups which encouraged support for UK political parties in the build up to the European elections were targets for fake news and polarising content with links to the far right, a Newsnight investigation has found. Closed Facebook groups, whose contents can only be viewed by approved members, saw users engage with and share content linked to far-right and potentially fake accounts, including some apparently US and Russian-oriented profiles.  While disinformation was more prevalent in groups promoting the Brexit Party, it was also being shared, to a lesser extent, in pro-Remain groups. The groups were not officially associated with any party.  Posts in the groups often contained abusive language aimed at MPs. The Brexit party told Newsnight: ""We were not aware of this and we cannot spend all of our time monitoring Facebook.  ""If any Facebook group is using our logo or infringing our copyright, without our permission, and is behaving suspiciously in any way, we act to close it down as we have done before and will do again."" Newsnight worked with William Dance, a linguistics and fake news expert from Lancaster University, to track disinformation campaigns. The content, history and administrators of the 30 largest and most active closed pro- and anti-Brexit Facebook groups were analysed. The administrators of closed groups often vet new members using questions to ensure they hold views compatible with the rest of the group.  New Facebook rules, introduced after accusations the company allowed interference in elections across the world, have forced public pages to be more transparent about who runs them and who advertises on them. But as closed groups are private, they are less likely to be flagged up to Facebook moderators for rules violations. Newsnight's investigation found that the largest group, called ""Brexit Party - supporters"" (it had no official link to the party) was the latest incarnation of a page setup in January 2017 under the name ""Libertarians and Chartists for Trump"". It has been renamed several times to support different causes, operating as ""#MBGA News >> Make Britain Great Again News"" and then ""South West England #FreeTommy"" - a reference to former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson - before taking on its most recent Brexit-themed name. The group was run by a Facebook profile page called ""Make Britain Great Again"", containing links to the website MBGAnews.com, which in turn redirects to another site, RedPillFactory.uk.  Red Pill Factory is registered in California and has been described by critics as offering a mix of partisan and false stories on subjects including the yellow vest movement, immigration, and Brexit.  Since Newsnight contacted the site, it has removed some content, including a story claiming German authorities ordered prostitutes to have sex with migrants. There is no evidence to support that the story was true. On Facebook, the ""Make Britain Great Again"" profile also shared fact-based stories from Red Pill Factory including one headlined ""BANNED: Tommy Robinson Page DELETED By Facebook.""  Media Bias/Fact Check, an independent website which rates the reliability of online content, describes Red Pill Factory as: ""extreme bias, consistent promotion of propaganda/conspiracies, poor or no sourcing to credible information, a complete lack of transparency and/or is fake news."" In response to our investigation, a writer for Red Pill Factory said that they would ""deem the notion of 'fake news' to be very subjective.  ""[We] dispute claims that the site peddled fake news, but actually articles were often fact-checked,"" the writer said. They added: ""Persons trolling the website with fake articles or presenting inaccurate, anti-Islamic (as opposed to anti-terrorist), or racist articles were barred from submitting future articles"" and said an editor was once dismissed for violating those rules. RedPillFactory has run articles heavily critical of the yellow vests movement as of late - one contributor was sacked for promoting yellow vests."" ""Brexit Party - supporters"" was shut down before the European elections, after a Sunday Times investigation into its administrators. In response to the Sunday Times story, The Brexit Party said it would formally approach Facebook to demand that the groups were taken down: ""We have no interest in these people at all, absolutely not."" Meanwhile, other closed groups continued to spread links to disinformation.  ""We Support Brexit"" closed group, which has around 3,900 members, included a number of posts from a user who appears to be Russian. The user repeatedly shared links from News Front, a website that the EU's anti-disinformation East Stratcom Task Force has identified as a source of pro-Kremlin fake news.  The picture associated with the user's profile appears to be of a former Russian Miss World and in all likelihood does not show the person behind the account. The profile is entirely in Russian, and the cover photo features Vladimir Putin.  Newsnight attempted to contact the user, but they did not respond. The user account and the News Front site formed part of a wider pattern of disinformation or polarising content with foreign links being shared in pro-Brexit closed Facebook groups, which was then shared and engaged with by other users.  This includes content from Infowars, a conspiracy site, and NewsPunch, which was previously known as YourNewsWire, a site which was also criticised by the EU's East Stratcom Task Force for ""publishing fake media stories that support Russia's policies.""  NewsPunch editor Sean Adl-Tabatabai told Newsnight: ""We are a news organization that publishes information from a variety of different sources on a wide variety of subjects. Sometimes this includes the BBC itself. To call us 'fake news' is libellous and damaging to our reputation.  ""We have no control over members of the public who choose to share our content on any platform, including Facebook. At the moment, it is still their prerogative to freely read and share things as long as they are not breaking the law."" The BBC has also tried to contact the people who run News Front, but has not received a response. Posts from a website called Brexit Betrayal News were also shared across a number of closed groups by a Facebook user who appears to be in the US. Mr Dance estimates that the posts targeted 50,000 people who belong to groups such as ""Brexit the Protest"" and ""We Are The 17.4 Million"". As well as listing Brexit Party MEPs, the site shared links to the QAnon conspiracy which was popularised by fringe and alt-right groups in the US.  The Brexit Betrayal News domain was registered in Chicago in April 2019. When contacted through the site, the user confirmed that the website was hosted in the US, but refused to confirm whether they are from the US.  Disinformation appeared less prevalent in the pro-Remain closed groups Newsnight analysed. Last year, groups with names such as ""Say NO to ""Brexit""!"" and ""Labour Against Brexit"" occasionally included links to polarising news stories, some of which came from sites hosting false stories.  In other large closed groups, including ""Remain Together"" and ""UK Citizens - Say Yes 2 Europe - Remain in the EU"", links led almost exclusively to mainstream news networks. In April, the Mueller report on potential interference in the 2016 US elections  flagged Facebook groups as a breeding ground for foreign interference. According to the report, as early as 2014 Russian users were setting up small Facebook groups designed to attract US audiences and look as if they were controlled by American activists.  Mr Dance explained: ""These groups may be set up and operated with honest intentions but then fall victim to people intentionally sharing disinformation and misleading news. ""Facebook groups can be manipulated to foment political resentment and to stoke social tensions. In the age of social media, it is simple and low-cost to reach tens of thousands of people with biased and false news,"" he said. Disinformation is not the only type of controversial content identified by Newsnight's investigation. Abuse ""aimed at politicians from all parties"" was also prevalent, said Mr Dance. The ""Brexit Party Supporters group"" (a different group to the one which was shut down) has more than 6,000 members and included language such as ""HANG THEM HIGH"" referring to Change UK candidates.  Extremely offensive language was also directed at former prime minister and Remain campaigner Gordon Brown and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. In pro-Remain groups, similar language could be found, albeit less frequently. In ""No To Brexit!"" one user referred to Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe, saying: ""Hanging is too good for Quitlings"". Another user, referring to Theresa May, wrote: ""she is barking mad and needs putting down"". Facebook told Newsnight it could not comment on individual groups. In a statement, the company said: ""In the run-up to the European elections we made major investments to help protect the integrity of the elections and prevent abuse of our platform.  ""Across the EU, we have removed a number of fake and duplicate accounts that were violating our authenticity policies, as well as pages for name change and other violations. We also have a continuous programme that identifies and removes coordinated inauthentic behaviour by anyone across our platform.""  Newsnight asked for comment from the administrators of the various groups which hosted posts spreading disinformation and abusive language.  One administrator of ""Labour Against Brexit"" said: ""We regularly remove posts which do not fall within our guidelines (and often the posters with them). We have very occasionally identified individuals who seem to be infiltrators or trolls, and removed them. And our members are quite assiduous in reporting dodgy content."" An administrator of ""Brexit The Protest"" said that the group ""moderates everything"" and that he had ""not seen any disinformation being shared on the group."" And an administrator for ""We are the 17.4 Million"" said: ""We are a small team of volunteer administrators. All initial posts must be approved by admins. At this stage we regularly weed out extremism, hate speech and profanity and ban people from the group.  ""We lack the resources to police proactively comments underneath posts but do take action when a member reports something unsavoury.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61956108,Indian police arrest journalist over tweets,Mohammed Zubair of Alt News has reportedly been accused of insulting religious beliefs on Twitter.,28 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Police in India have arrested the co-founder of a fact-checking website who has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Mohammed Zubair of AltNews has been accused of insulting Hindu religious beliefs on Twitter, a network of media organisations said. Opposition leaders and journalists have condemned the arrest.  They said it was a clear attempt by the Hindu-nationalist government to clamp down on those who expose hate speech.  Mr Zubair recently highlighted comments by a spokesperson of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) allegedly insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a television debate. His tweet was widely shared and led to several Muslim countries lodging strong protests with India. In recent weeks, Hindu nationalists have drawn attention to past comments made by Mr Zubair and demanded that he be prosecuted for hurting their religious feelings. A prominent Indian journalist, Mohammad Zubair started the fact-checking website AltNews with former engineer Pratik Sinha in 2017.  The website quickly rose to prominence for its diligent work in combating misinformation and fake news in the country. Fact checks from AltNews are frequently shared by Mr Zubair on Twitter where he has more than half a million followers. He monitors hate speech and his Twitter posts on comments made by supporters of the BJP have invited intense backlash. Last week, he posted an e-mail from the microblogging site telling him that his tweet criticising Islamophobic comments by the leader of a Hindu group was being ""withheld"" - which means it's no longer visible in India - on request from the law enforcement authorities. The letter added that this was ""in order to comply with Twitter's obligations under India's local laws"". He later received another e-mail saying that two of his other tweets - about provocative comments made by a Hindu priest threatening to kidnap and rape Muslim women - were also being ""withheld in India"" under the country's IT laws. On Monday, Mr Zubair was detained over a complaint from a Twitter account that said he insulted Hindus in a 2018 post commenting on the renaming of a hotel after the Hindu monkey god Hanuman, the ANI news agency reported, citing senior Delhi police officials. A statement by the police later said that the tweet had been amplified by Mr Zubair's Twitter followers and ""created a series of debates/hate mongering"". Police claim their investigation found Mr Zubair's conduct ""questionable"" which ""warranted his custodial interrogation"". Pratik Sinha, also a co-founder of AltNews, who accompanied him to the police, said neither he nor Mr Zubair's lawyers were provided with a copy of the complaint on which the arrest was made. They were also initially not told where he was being taken after being detained.  Mr Zubair was produced before a local magistrate late on Monday night who granted the police one day's custody. Following this, he was allowed to meet his lawyer. A court on Tuesday remanded him in custody for a further four days. Many journalists and activists have been demanding his immediate release. ""Zubair who routinely busted fake news, exposed the hate machinery in India has just been arrested,"" said Rana Ayyub, a Muslim journalist. ""The country is punishing those who reported, documented the decline."" Opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: ""Every person exposing BJP's hate, bigotry and lies is a threat to them. Arresting one voice of truth will only give rise to a thousand more."" Police said at the centre of the arrest was a 2018 tweet by Mr Zubair in which he had shared a photo of a hotel signboard, modified from 'Honeymoon Hotel' to 'Hanuman Hotel'. The photo was actually a screengrab from a 1983 Bollywood comedy by acclaimed director Hrishikesh Mukherjee. But a Twitter account called Hanuman Bhakt, meaning worshipper of the monkey god Hanuman, recently shared the four-year-old tweet and called it a ""direct insult"" to Hindus. The account also tagged the Delhi police, asking them to take ""immediate action"" against Mr Zubair. The anonymous account, created last October, had just one follower until Tuesday morning. It has since risen rapidly to cross 1,500 followers."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50830833,Tories appoint discrimination inquiry chief,A psychiatry professor will examine Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party.,18 Dec 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservatives have appointed a psychiatry professor to lead its inquiry into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party.  The party said Prof Swaran Singh would look at how it handles complaints, and tries to clamp down on discrimination. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously pledged the investigation would get underway before Christmas.  Tory party chairman James Cleverly said it would help the party ""stamp out unacceptable abuse"". Prof Singh is a former commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), the watchdog currently investigating anti-Semitism allegations within Labour.  He has been a professor in Social and Community Psychiatry at the University of Warwick since 2006.  Announcing the appointment, Mr Cleverly said: ""The Conservative Party has always worked to act swiftly when allegations have been put to us"".  ""There are a wide range of sanctions to challenge and change behaviour,"" he added.  ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind"".  The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), an umbrella group of various UK Muslim bodies, has accused the party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia, and said it had a ""blind spot for this type of racism"". The group has previously called for Islamophobia allegations in the Conservative Party to be investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. Mr Johnson has defended the party's processes for handling complaints, saying members guilty of Islamophobia ""are out first bounce"". However he has faced accusations of Islamophobia himself, after writing in a newspaper column last year that Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-45570907,'Anti-Islamic taunts' as car hits crowd,"Police say the incident at a Cricklewood Muslim prayer centre is being treated as a ""racist hate crime"".",19 Sep 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Three men were hurt when a car struck several people outside a north London Islamic centre. Witnesses described hearing the driver ""shouting anti-Islamic taunts"" at the Muslim prayer centre in Cricklewood. The Met Police said it was being dealt with as an Islamophobic hate crime but is not thought to be terrorist-related. The driver of the car failed to stop and two men were taken to hospital following the incident at about 00:35 BST. It happened at the Al-majlis Al-Hussaini centre at the junction of Oxgate Lane and Edgware Road. One witness said the driver ""was trying to kill people"". Ali Salman said he was ""milliseconds"" from injury as the car swerved into groups of people leaving the Islamic centre following a lecture. ""This was someone who was trying to take out as many people as possible. He swerved left right trying to hit people,"" he added. A man in his 50s remains in hospital and is being treated for a serious leg injury. Two other men, both in their 20s, suffered minor injuries. Before the attack a group of three men and a woman in their mid 20s were asked to leave a private car park at the premises by volunteer stewards, police said. The group had allegedly been behaving anti-socially, drinking and using drugs. Speaking at the scene, Ch Supt Simon Rose said when the stewards challenged the group, ""they were subjected to a tirade of Islamophobic and racist abuse"". The car then drove near the mosque and the group were involved in a confrontation with a large number of people outside. Their car was then reportedly damaged by some of the crowd before it sped off, colliding with three people. Ch Supt Rose said it was ""extremely fortunate"" that no-one was killed. ""It is being dealt with as an Islamophobic hate crime and it is being dealt with as a racist hate crime,"" he added. ""It is not at this time being dealt with as a counter-terrorism incident, as always subject to continuous review."" A spokesman for the Hussaini Association, which had been holding a series of lectures at the Islamic centre, said: ""We are in deep shock at such an attack taking place on our community. ""We remain proud to live in a diverse and tolerant society and as such we remain unintimidated."" Dawn Butler, MP for Brent Central, tweeted: ""This is a very sad and tragic event. There is no room for hate. ""Brent is the most diverse constituency in the UK and our diversity is our strength."" The Met has urged anyone with information to come forward and said inquiries are under way to trace the car. Det Sgt Kelly Schonhage said: ""Extra neighbourhood police patrols have been stepped up in the area and officers will be on hand to speak with those in the local community."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40328536,More armed policing around mosques,Police said patrols would be stepped up around Scotland's 84 mosques after the Finsbury Park attack.,20 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"High-visibility police patrols are to be stepped up near Scotland's mosques after the Finsbury Park attack in north London.  Police Scotland said it had no intelligence about a specific threat, but said armed response vehicles would carry out patrols. A man died and 10 people were injured after a man drove a van into worshippers near Finsbury Park Mosque. Eight people were taken to hospital after the terror attack. A 48-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Police said all the victims of the attack, which took place outside Muslim Welfare House, were Muslim. Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable Nelson Telfer said the force would be mounting additional patrols in the general vicinity of Scotland's 84 mosques and that could include armed response vehicles. He said hate crimes were being monitored on a daily basis, but had shown no increase.  He added the force would not tolerate any attempt by any group to target members of any community in Scotland. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon chaired a Scottish government resilience meeting following the attack.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney, Justice Secretary Michael Matheson, Communities Secretary Angela Constance, senior Police Scotland representatives and Scottish government officials took part in the meeting. Ms Sturgeon said: ""This was a horrific attack and my thoughts go out to everyone who has been affected. I know that everyone will be saddened to see yet another terrorist attack. ""I convened a resilience meeting this afternoon to ensure that we are closely monitoring the situation. While there is no intelligence of any specific threat to Scotland, Police Scotland remain vigilant and visible across communities to provide reassurance to members of the public. ""Muslim communities will understandably be anxious just now and it is in these moments that we must come together as a country and unite against extremism and hate from wherever it comes."" Speaking earlier on the John Beattie programme on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Telfer said: ""We don't have any specific information that Scotland is at risk of attack in any of our communities. I would ask everyone to go about their business as normal, remain alert but not alarmed. ""We have 84 mosques across Scotland and we have linked in with the Muslim Council for Scotland and it will be within the general vicinity of those sites that people will see increased patrols.  ""What they will see is high-visibility policing and that may well include armed response vehicles and they may well see armed police officers. ""People should not be alarmed that, they should be reassured by their presence."" He added: ""We have put our increased presence in place from the early hours of this morning and we will monitor that on a daily basis and our response will continue to be proportionate to the situation faced UK-wide."" Police Scotland said earlier this month it would increase its number of armed police officers by about a third following warnings that the country would not be able to cope with a major terror attack. Speaking earlier on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland radio programme, Nabeel Shaikh, a former general secretary of Glasgow Mosque, said the authorities should do more to tackle extremist behaviour targeted at the Muslim community. ""Far-right extremism is just as dangerous as what we term the 'Islamic extremism' within our community,"" he said. ""Islamaphobia is on the rise and I think the government need to do something more about the far-right extremism that is growing and festering within our communities."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-46228083,'Nobody seemed to care' about WW2 graves,"For over 70-years, one woman has been tending to the graves of Indian soldiers killed in Scotland during World War Two.",16 Nov 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"For more than 70 years, Isobel Harling has tended the graves of Indian servicemen who fought and died during World War Two.  In Kingussie, nine graves belong to men who served in Force K6, a Muslim transport corps who rode mules and delivered supplies to front-line soldiers.  Mrs Harling hopes the families of the men buried at this cemetery know that their final resting place is well looked after.   She lost her own brother during the war,  when he was shot down in Leuven in Belgium, and she has often thought about the people tending his grave.  Her own loss influenced her dedication to the graves of the Indian soldiers.  ""They came over from home and they gave their lives for us. It's only right that we should remember them. The people in Leuven look after their graves, so it's only right that we look after the boys that were buried here."" Mrs Harling first started visiting the graves in her early 20s, often cycling to the graveyard by herself. When the local gravedigger noticed her tending the graves, he told her not to bring any of her own equipment because she could use his while she was there.  With help from the gravedigger, she  has spent years cutting the grass, placing flowers on the graves and keeping the cemetery tidy. Now in her 90s, she regrets that she has had to slow down a little.  Mrs Harling has never met the families of the men buried at Kingussie but she hopes the families know the graves are being cared for in the Highlands.  ""Nobody seemed to care and that bothered me. So when I jumped on my bike and cycled down, no one knew where I was going,"" she recalled. ""They (K6 soldiers) used to come down into the village, and they would come to some of the functions and dances... they were very quiet, very nice and mannerly."" At the start of the war, 1,723 men from India disembarked at Marseilles with 2,000 mules, sent to France to help the British Expeditionary Force deliver supplies to the front lines. These were the Force K6: Punjabi Muslims of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps (RIASC). Five-months later, struggling with one of the harshest winters of that time, the men faced the German blitzkrieg, with two companies escaping from Dunkirk and another company via St Nazaire. A fourth ended up in a German POW camp.  It was a foreign terrain for these men. Having come from the Punjab region, the men were accustomed to a warmer climate.  After their escape from France, they spent three-and-a-half-years in Britain.  They were part of preparations for one of Churchill's plans to invade Northern Norway to help secure German airfields.  The plan was never approved, but the Force K6 still accompanied the British infantry brigades, training them in loading, and how to handle mules.  Some of the men were born in what is now Pakistan and others from Kashmir. During their time in Scotland, there were inevitable casualties.  The youngest of the nine men was Mushtaq Ahmad, who was only 21-years-old when he was killed in action on 19 October 1942. The oldest in the group was Ali Bahadur, who died aged 38.  Thirteen of the men are buried in four cemeteries across Scotland. Most of them buried in Kingussie, as their Indian General Hospital was nearby.  Omar Sheik the founder of the Colourful Heritage Project said: ""I think the contribution of the soldiers is over five million soldiers in the great wars, 2.5m British Indian soldiers just in World War Two. The largest ever volunteer army.  ""The reality is not enough has been done to remember them and their contribution. The fact we are here, doing an inaugural service in 2018, at the largest single gravesite of Force K6 soldiers says everything.  ""Many of their relatives don't even know where they are or where they are buried, that itself is very poignant."" For many people in the Highlands this would have been their first time seeing a person from India.  ""They were welcomed immensely by the local communities."" Organised by Colourful Heritage and the British Armed Forces, a multi-faith remembrance service took place on Thursday to honour those men who gave their lives for Britain.  Mr Sheik says its a unique story and demonstrates a special connection between Scotland and the British Indian Army.  ""In Churchill's own words, 'had the British Indian Army not arrived when they did, the course of the war might have been very different'.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40442878,Anti-Islam campaigner launches UKIP bid,UKIP distances itself from controversial campaigner Anne Marie Waters who is bidding to lead the party.,30 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group is launching a bid to be the next UKIP leader on Saturday. Anne Marie Waters was blocked from standing for UKIP at the election, with then leader Paul Nuttall saying her views made him ""uncomfortable"". She campaigns against Sharia law in the UK and has called Islam ""evil"". UKIP said the campaign launch was ""not in any way an official UKIP event"" and urged members to ""think very carefully"" before attending. A UKIP spokesman said all leadership candidates would be vetted by the party's National Executive Committee, who will decide which ones will be allowed to go forward to a vote of the membership. Waters had planned to launch her leadership bid at Rotherham football club but has been forced to find an alternative venue. ""There were concerns about my 'views' and no doubt, police were happy to add to such concerns"", she said in a statement on her website.  South Yorkshire Police has said the decision to cancel the event at Rotherham's New York stadium was taken by the club.  The launch will now take place at an undisclosed location in Rotherham. Waters took part in a ""silent protest"" march against grooming gangs in the town last year. In a joint statement, UKIP MEP Jane Collins and councillor Allen Cowles, leader of UKIP's Rotherham branch, said they supported the decision to cancel the planned stadium rally and urged the party's councillors to boycott Waters' campaign launch. Mr Cowles said: ""UKIP councillors wish to make it clear that they do not condone in any way the views Ms Waters has previously expressed, or what she stands for.""  Waters announced her plans to stand for the UKIP leadership at a rally in Manchester earlier this month, where she was introduced by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson.  She told the cheering crowd ""Islam is a killing machine"" and urged them to ""join UKIP and vote for me,"" adding that the party will ""try to stop me"". After the Brexit vote, UKIP's leadership was aware the party had to broaden its appeal.   The former leader, Paul Nuttall, backed a radical policy platform with social integration at its core.  He said the party would shape the debate around extremism and Islamism in the way it claimed to have done with immigration - daring to address topics other politicians wouldn't. But while some in UKIP welcomed the policies announced in the election manifesto - including a ban on face coverings - they caused disquiet among other members who feared the party was in danger of being seen as Islamophobic.   Mr Nuttall insisted that was not the case, saying the focus was breaking down barriers in society and improving integration.  But UKIP is sensitive to public perception about its policy and direction. Having been dogged by allegations of racism in the past, it's determined not to go there again. A former Labour Party activist, Waters set up a UK branch of anti-mass immigration organisation Pegida with Robinson, but is no longer thought to be involved with the group.  She founded Sharia Watch UK, which aims to ""to document the advancement of Sharia law in Britain,"" in 2014. She hit the headlines a year later when she announced plans for an exhibition of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, but was forced to cancel the event after police warned it could be ""a risk to public safety"". She has argued that UKIP could regain support if it had the ""guts"" to be ""honest about Islam"" and challenge the view that it has ""nothing to do"" with jihadist violence. Anti-fascist campaign group HopeNotHate has branded Waters a ""toxic figure"" and urged UKIP to expel her from the party. But she has been defended by former UKIP leadership contender Raheem Kassam, editor of the Breitbart London website, who wrote earlier this year: ""If UKIP ditches Anne Marie Waters, the party is over"". The UKIP leadership contest was triggered by the resignation of Paul Nuttall, when the party failed to win any seats at the general election and saw its share of the vote collapse. Mr Nuttall, who campaigned for a ban on burkas and Sharia courts, said in April that Waters' comments were ""way above and beyond party policy"" and some had made him feel ""a bit uncomfortable"".  London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Ben Walker, a former UKIP councillor in South Gloucestershire, have also announced leadership bids. MEP Bill Etheridge, who came third in the first of UKIP's two leadership contests last year, and Thanet council leader Chris Wells have both said they might stand if Nigel Farage cannot be persuade to return to the job he quit after last year's Brexit referendum.  The former UKIP leader has not ruled out a bid."

Hasina Khan, from the Tackling Islamophobia Working Group (TIWG) said it was ""in some aspects the first opportunity for some to meet Muslims"". She said it was a chance to ""ask questions, have fun trying on hijabs"" and talk about the rise in hate crime. Since 2017, 72% of religious hate crimes against women in Bristol were anti-Muslim, police said. Ms Khan, who said she had experienced hate crime, said: ""The people who have come over say 'this is really important what you are doing'.  ""I think it's because of the amount of hate crime and there's also a bit of mystery about Muslim people. ""There's a lot of positivity and awareness of what we're doing today, there'll be more harmony in the community."" Matthew Hamey, from Weston-super-Mare, said: ""We live in the 21st Century now and racism of any sort shouldn't be part of our society.  ""I spent the first eight years of my life in the Middle East, in Bahrain - it had an impact, most definitely.  ""You obviously come into contact with local Bahrainis and they treated us the same as they wanted to be treated. They didn't let religious differences get in the way."" Rachel Weeks said: ""I literally grew up in a village just outside Bristol and I had no idea there would be any hatred towards my friend. ""She's my only Muslim friend, so just to have an idea that this sort of thing would happen to her - it's nice to support her.  ""I've been very lucky not to have been exposed to horrible things. It still shocks me that people are like that."" Heather Staniforth said: ""I lived in Malaysia and Singapore, so I have Muslim friends and obviously living in Singapore, everything is set up for that religion. Events like this are important because it shows love.""  Sukhi, from Bristol, said: ""Because people have a negative view with all different walks of life, it's very important to have people from minorities, from BME groups and they can interact and make people understand.  ""We need to break these walls and these barriers that are dividing people."" Alex Raikes, from Stand Against Racism and Inequality said the group was ""doing all we can to combat negative and destructive perceptions of Muslim communities and Islam"".   ""A big aim of the group is to take part in positive activities that challenge myths and stereotypes and break down fear and division.   ""TIWG joining the Christmas Market and engaging with local shoppers in conversation and fun activities is one great way to do this."""

Rev Richard Cameron, the minister at Scotstoun Parish Church in Glasgow, shouted at Mr Corbyn as he entered a local community centre. It later emerged that Rev Cameron had made Islamophobic and homophobic comments on his Twitter account. The church said there had been ""significant concern"" about the posts. In one tweet, Rev Cameron compared homosexuality to incest, describing them as ""unnatural"".  ""Both cause harm by breaking sensibly held taboos,"" he added.  In September, he tweeted: ""Christ has the power to help and change anyone. Obviously many gays hate this because want to carry on their perversion.""  He also shared a series of controversial views on Islam, describing terrorism as ""a problem Islam needs to deal with"", a full face veil as ""oppressive and unBritish"" and the Prophet Muhammad as ""a violent man"". In another post, he said: ""The best way to defeat Islam is to preach Christ"".  In response, a spokeswoman for the Church of Scotland said it deplored comments which were Islamophobic or homophobic.  ""At this stage all we can say is that there is a formal complaints process and that any complaints we receive in relation to this matter will be taken seriously and addressed,"" she added.  Rev Cameron, who worked in pharmaceutical sales before joining the church, has been minister at Scotstoun since 2000.  Earlier, he heckled Mr Corbyn during a trip to Glasgow, branding him a ""terrorist sympathiser"".  As Mr Corbyn was telling reporters about a scarf given to him by the Who Cares? Scotland charity, Rev Cameron shouted that he thought the Labour leader would be wearing an ""Islamic jihad scarf"". ""Do you think the man that's going to be prime minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?"" he added. ""Who's going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you're prime minister?"" The Labour leader did not react and he was ushered into the community centre by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.  Mr Cameron then accused Mr Corbyn of ""running away"". The Church of Scotland rebuked Rev Cameron for the way he approached the situation, saying: ""Whilst we may occasionally robustly challenge policy issues with which we disagree, we always intend to do that in a way that is polite and measured and allows for reasoned debate."" Meanwhile Who Cares? Scotland, which works with care experienced young people, criticised the minister for taking the focus away from their clients."

Police found a hoard of Nazi-era daggers, far-right literature and a framed Ku Klux Klan certificate in Nicholas Brock's bedroom in Berkshire. The 53-year-old was found guilty in March of three counts of possessing materials which could be of use in preparing terrorist acts. He was jailed for four years at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court. Brock's collection included a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf manifesto and a video of a white supremacist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019, the court heard. Prosecutors described the hoard as materials suitable for ""an undergraduate degree"" in the far-right. The stash and a hard drive containing the terrorist manuals were found in 2018 at Brock's home in Maidenhead, which he shared with his mother. Judge Peter Lodder QC told him: ""It is clear from the wide range of other material found on your computer and your hard drive that you are a right-wing extremist. ""Your enthusiasm for this repulsive and toxic ideology is demonstrated by the graphic, racist, Islamophobic and white supremacist iconography which you have stored."" Edward Butler, defending, said there was no evidence his client intended to carry out an attack. Brock, of Lancaster Road, previously told police he had an interest in military memorabilia which stemmed from his love of Action Man as a child. Police said Brock was likely to have been self-radicalised through browsing online. Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, said: ""The material Brock had in his possession is dangerous and concerning.  ""He had books which would provide techniques on how to fight, assisting someone who was potentially preparing a terrorist act.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38029336,Mike Pompeo - Trump's loyalist diplomat,The US Secretary of State previously was the director of the CIA and a conservative Republican senator.,27 Apr 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"This video can not be played Claims about Trump 'dangerous and false', says ex-CIA director Mike Pompeo was a hardline Republican congressman before President Donald Trump appointed him to direct the CIA and later to lead the US Department of State. The former Tea Party representative from Kansas was handpicked by Mr Trump to be the top US diplomat after he fired former state department chief Rex Tillerson. Hours before Mr Trump announced that he would meet the leader of North Korea, Mr Pompeo was seen in the Oval Office with Mr Trump during a meeting with a South Korean delegation at the White House. In April it was revealed that Mr Pompeo had secretly travelled to Pyongyang over the Easter holiday to meet North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. Mr Pompeo is seen as a Trump loyalist who performed a delicate balancing act at the CIA in managing frayed relations between the spy agency and a commander-in-chief who compared America's intelligence services to Nazis. He has in the past played down findings by the CIA that the Russians attempted to influence last year's US election. But when push comes to shove, he has shown a willingness to contradict the president on the issue. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? After Mr Trump said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials, Mr Pompeo firmly stood by US assessments of Moscow's alleged meddling. Mr Pompeo is seen as more hawkish on the Kremlin than the president, and has previously warned that President Putin is a dangerous leader. This video can not be played Pompeo on Russia, North Korea and Trump During his time in Congress, the 53-year-old former-three-term Republican from Wichita, Kansas, was a vehement critic of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran. He has previously defended the National Security Agency's bulk data collection programme and opposes shutting the prison at Guantanamo Bay. What does the future hold for Guantanamo? After visiting the detention facility in 2013, he remarked that some inmates who had declared a hunger strike looked like they had put on weight. Mr Pompeo also defended the CIA after the 2014 release of a Senate report on torture, which detailed such practices as waterboarding. He declared: ""These men and women are not torturers, they are patriots."" The CIA tactics, he said, ""were within the law, within the constitution"". Mr Pompeo opposes shutting the prison at Guantanamo Bay Mr Pompeo graduated first in his class at West Point and graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of its Law Review. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 with the support of the Republican mega-donors Charles and David Koch. Mr Pompeo became a member of the House intelligence committee and its energy and commerce panel. Before joining Congress, he founded an aviation parts firm and an oilfield supply company. He was accused of Islamophobia for remarks he made following the deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing. Mr Pompeo had taken to the House floor to suggest some Islamic faith leaders might be tacitly encouraging terrorist attacks. ""When the most devastating terrorist attacks on America in the last 20 years come overwhelmingly from people of a single faith and are performed in the name of that faith a special obligation falls on those that are the leaders of that faith,"" he said. ""Instead of responding, silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow."" Mike Pompeo is sworn in as CIA director by Vice President Mike Pence (R) While he was a congressional candidate in 2010, one of his campaign aides sent a tweet linking to an article that labelled his Indian-American Democratic opponent Raj Goyle a ""turban topper"". Mr Pompeo apologised, though his campaign also sent out billboard ads urging everyone to ""vote American"".  He also served on the House Select Benghazi Committee, a special panel created in 2014 to investigate the deadly attack two years earlier on a US diplomatic compound in Libya. Democrats described it as a political witch-hunt against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr Pompeo released a report afterwards accusing her of intentionally misleading Americans about the nature of the attack to help President Barack Obama's re-election bid.

Videos on social media show scores of pupils chanting ""we want change"" after walking out of Pimlico Academy early on Wednesday. It follows students' claims Pimlico Academy discriminates against Muslim and black pupils. The Westminster-based school said there was ""regret"" in the way matters ""came to a head"" publicly. A statement purportedly on behalf of students railed against ""racism, Islamophobia and transphobia"" and said pupils were angry at a lack of recognition of the Black Lives Matter movement. Tensions between Pimlico Academy's senior leadership and its parents and pupils, began in August 2020 when a new uniform policy was imposed. Among the new rules affecting all pupils were a ban on afro haircuts which could ""block the views"" of other pupils in class. The new policy also required Year 12 and 13 students to sport ""formal business suits"" where previously they were allowed to wear chinos and a collared casual shirt  The Local Democracy Reporting Service reported parents complained this placed a financial burden on them while many people had been put on furlough or been made redundant. The Guardian newspaper reported up to 30 members of staff are considering whether to leave the school. Futures Academies, which runs the school in Pimlico, Westminster, did not comment on the reported mass exodus of staff, but said ""the majority of students"" were in classrooms studying throughout the protest. It added: ""We want to take this opportunity to reassure parents that this is an isolated event, and we are working to resolve the issues raised.  ""We apologise to all children, families and staff for the disruption today."" On Tuesday the National Education Union (NEU) passed a motion of no confidence in head teacher Daniel Smith and moved towards balloting for industrial action. Regional secretary Pauline Buchanan said the decision was not taken lightly. ""This vote is in response to serious failures of management which members believe are bringing the school into disrepute,"" she said. ""As well as NEU members' trade dispute over the industrial issues, members have strongly expressed their solidarity with students' concerns and their desire for an anti-racist school."""

Glynn Martin, of Greater Manchester Police, also shared images of explicit sexual violence and discriminatory jokes with fellow officers. He resigned in March ahead of a misconduct hearing, the full details of which have now been released. Mr Martin said he had sought counselling for pornography addiction. The sergeant, who worked for the force for 14 years and was based in Rochdale, told the disciplinary panel he was ""deeply ashamed"" of his actions.  The hearing found the case would ""harm public confidence in the police"" at a time when there was ""national concern about policing in respect of issues including racism, sexism, and Islamophobia."" Allegations against Mr Martin arose in November 2017 and he was arrested, but no criminal proceedings were brought against him.  His behaviour was then investigated by Greater Manchester Police's professional standards branch. During the hearing, he admitted to sending offensive content about disabled people. One clip showed sex acts performed on an unconscious woman, while another featured an image containing a paragraph advocating sexual violence. Some of material was sent to fellow police officers. Mr Martin also received anti-Semitic and Islamophobic images, but said he could not recall viewing them or being aware they were on his phone.  Explaining his actions, Mr Martin said he often forwarded images and videos without viewing them properly or in full.  ""This was part of my compulsion. I would never make the types of jokes I forwarded over WhatsApp out loud to anyone,"" he said. Mr Martin said the images did not reflect his ""thoughts, values or morals"". Though he had resigned a month before the hearing, the panel ruled the only appropriate action would have been dismissal. They concluded his behaviour amounted to gross misconduct and described the videos sent by Mr Martin as ""obscene and deeply offensive"".

The philosopher was appointed as the unpaid chair of the Building Beautiful architecture Commission in November.  He has now been dismissed after claiming Islamophobia was ""a propaganda word"" and ""each Chinese person is a kind of replica of the next one"".  Downing Street said the comments were ""deeply offensive"".  Sir Roger's appointment to head the new body was criticised at the time by Labour, who said his past comments on race and sexuality made him unsuitable to hold the post.  The author has now left his position ""with immediate effect"" after an interview with the New Statesman in which he questioned the definition of Islamophobia and speculated on the influence of Jewish financier, philanthropist and liberal political activist George Soros in his native Hungary.  He said he stood by comments he has made in the past that Islamophobia was a ""propaganda word invented by the Muslim Brotherhood in order to stop discussion of a major issue"". He said ""anybody who doesn't think that there's a Soros empire in Hungary has not observed the facts"" - a statement that critics have condemned as a conspiracy theory and an anti-Semitic trope.  In a wide-ranging interview, he also said the Communist regime in China was ""creating robots out of their own people"" which he said was a ""frightening thing"". The Conservatives have been under pressure to deal with anti-Muslim prejudice in the party amid claims by a former chair Baroness Warsi that they have turned a blind eye to it.  Communities Secretary James Brokenshire defended Sir Roger at the time of his appointment, saying his views had evolved and many of the attacks on him were ""misinformed and ill-judged"". It is understood Mr Brokenshire personally informed Sir Roger of his dismissal on Wednesday. No 10 said the comments were ""deeply offensive, completely unacceptable and it's right that he's been dismissed"". ""He was appointed because of his expertise in a particular field but it's clear that his comments are distracting from that work,"" a spokesman said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57020697,German call to ban 'Jewish star' at Covid demos,"The anti-Semitism commissioner urges officials to stop protesters ""relativising"" the Holocaust.",7 May 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Germany's anti-Semitism commissioner, Felix Klein, has urged authorities to stop protesters using the Nazis' yellow star forced on Jews in World War Two. Some protesters have replaced the word ""Jude"" (Jew) with the phrase ""ungeimpft"" (unvaccinated), equating Covid restrictions with the persecution of Europe's Jewish population.  The yellow Star of David has also been seen in protests in London. Mr Klein said he hoped German cities would follow Munich in banning it. ""If people pin so-called Jewish stars on themselves in demonstrations, thereby drawing comparisons that relativise the Holocaust, then the means provided by law should be applied against them,"" he told Tagesspiegel newspaper. The Nazis made wearing the yellow Star of David badge mandatory throughout territories they occupied, dehumanising Jews by marking them out as different. Anyone found without one faced a fine, prison or death.  Anti-lockdown protesters argue that the ruling liberal establishment is violating their personal freedom and exaggerating the Covid health risks. However, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, said last year it was ""unspeakable"" that Germans were comparing restrictions on their lives with the abuses of the Third Reich. The yellow star has appeared at protests beyond Germany too. British comedian David Baddiel drew attention to its use in London last month, and it was condemned by the Auschwitz Museum. The head of the UK-based Centre for Countering Digital Hate, Imran Ahmed, said anti-vaxxers in particular had ""instrumentalised"" anti-Semitism as it had given them new audiences, and he was angered by the use of the yellow Star of David.  ""I cannot think of many things more disgusting than comparing vaccines that will save countless lives to the industrial slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust,"" he told the BBC. When the yellow star appeared in January at an anti-lockdown protest in the Czech capital, Prague, the Israeli ambassador condemned it as an insult to the millions murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. Anti-Semitic offences in Germany rose to 2,300 last year, which the government's commissioner said was frightening but unsurprising, as in times of crisis people were more open to ""irrational explanations, including anti-Semitic stereotypes"".  He said they were espoused by the far right, conspiracy theorists as well as by the left. It is not just the yellow star that has appeared at German protests. Far-right regalia and Imperial War Flags have been used during rallies close to the Reichstag parliament building. Last month, the domestic BfV intelligence agency said some parts of the anti-lockdown movement were being placed under observation amid fears they were trying to undermine the state. It highlighted parts of the ""Querdenker"" (lateral thinkers) movement, which has drawn from the far-right AfD party, anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Although not all Covid protesters were anti-Semitic, Mr Klein warned that diverse groups were finding common cause and anti-Semitism was the ""cement that binds them together"". In a separate development, German intelligence said it was extending surveillance of an Islamophobic protest group in the eastern state of Saxony. It said Pegida had become ""extremist"" and ""anti-constitutional"" and was acting as a hinge between extremists and non-extremists."

Elliot Brown, 25, from Bath, shared a video of his Alexa speaker reading out a recipe for the explosive thermite. Brown denied collecting information that could be of use to a terrorist and disseminating a terrorist publication. He was found guilty after a week-long trial and jailed at Bristol Crown Court on Tuesday. Brown was sent to prison for three years and three months on each charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.  Judge Anthony Leonard KC also ordered Brown spend an extra year on licence after his release due to his offences ""being of particular concern"".   During the trial the jury heard how Brown, who has no previous convictions, held ""extremist views"". Brown was a member of a far-right group chat in which he exchanged racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic messages with other members. The group chat also contained photos related to the support of neo-Nazism and white supremacy. Brown recorded a 30-second video on 22 March 2020 in which his Amazon Alexa speaker responded to his question - ""how do I make thermite?"" Alexa read out instructions from a website which Mr Brown recorded and sent into the chat via the messenger app Telegram. Three days later fellow group member Dean Morrice purchased materials that could be combined to make thermite. In August 2020 police raided Morrice's home and found enough aluminium powder, iron oxide, and magnesium ribbon in the kitchen to make the explosive substance. Morrice was later convicted of 10 terrorism related offences, including stockpiling explosive materials. Brown was subsequently arrested in February 2021 for the dissemination of a terrorist publication but he told police he made the video ""as a harmless joke"". He said he had ""a dark sense of humour"" and was being ""ironic"" and had ""made comments"" to gain others group members' approval because he was significantly younger than them. Giving evidence, Brown said he was ""ashamed and angry"" of ""extremist"" comments he had made in the group chat. ""My views, at the time, were uneducated, far-right, anti-Semitic, racist and homophobic and I was in a vulnerable place at the time and had become more right-wing,"" he said. He said he had abandoned his extremist views, adding he was ""saved by becoming a Christian"" after Morrice's arrest. Det Supt Craig McWhinnie, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), said: ""While there is no evidence that Brown planned to commit any terrorist attack, his actions went beyond just casual talk and are a criminal offence under the Terrorism Act."" Supt Steve Kendall, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""People like Elliot Brown, who hold extremist views, can live absolutely anywhere and, although these instances are rare, they remind us we all need to be vigilant.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-48069763,The British Victorians who became Muslims,The stories of three pioneers who defied societal norms by converting to Islam.,19 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"At the height of the Empire, a select band of British people renounced Christianity and converted to Islam. These are the stories of three such pioneers, who defied Victorian norms at a time when Christianity was the bedrock of British identity. Solicitor William Henry Quilliam became interested in Islam after seeing Moroccans pray on a ferry during a Mediterranean break in 1887. ""They were not at all troubled by the force of the strong wind or by the swaying of the ship. I was deeply touched by the look on their faces and their expressions, which displayed complete trust and sincerity,"" he recalled. After inquiring about the religion during a stay in Tangiers, 31-year-old Quilliam became a Muslim, describing his new faith as ""reasonable and logical and, personally, I felt it did not contradict my beliefs"".  While Islam doesn't oblige converts to change their names, he adopted the name of Abdullah.  On his return to England in 1887, he became a preacher, and was said to be instrumental in the conversion of about 600 people across the UK. He also established the country's first mosque that year in Liverpool - regarded by many at the time as the ""second city of the British Empire"". Queen Victoria, who ruled over more Muslims than the Turkish Ottoman Empire, was among those who ordered his pamphlet ""Faith of Islam"", which summarised the religion and was translated into 13 languages. She is said to have ordered six more copies for her family. But her willingness to learn was not always matched by a wider society which believed Islam to be a violent religion. In 1894, the Ottoman sultan - with the approval of the Queen - appointed Quilliam as Sheikh al-Islam of the British Isles, a title reflecting his leadership in the Muslim community. Despite the official recognition, many Liverpudlian converts faced resentment and abuse over their faith, including being assaulted with bricks, offal and horse manure.  Quilliam believed the attackers had been ""brainwashed and led to believe that we were bad people"". He was known locally for his work with the underprivileged - advocating trade unionism and divorce law reform - but his legal career came to ruin when he tried to help a female client seeking a divorce.  A honey-trap was set up for her allegedly adulterous husband - a practice not uncommon at the time - but the attempt failed and Quilliam was struck off.  He left Liverpool in 1908 to minimise the scandal's impact on the Muslim community. He resurfaced in the south as Henri de Leon, although many knew who he was, according to Prof Ron Geaves, who has written a book about Quilliam. Although his profile diminished, he became involved with the country's second oldest mosque, built in Woking in 1889, and was buried in the Surrey town after his death in 1932. The Liverpool mosque bears his name to this day. It wasn't uncommon for members of the upper classes to be fascinated by Islam, often inspired by travels in Muslim lands. From an aristocratic family, Edinburgh-born Lady Evelyn Murray spent much of her childhood switching between life in Scotland and north Africa. ""There, I learnt to speak Arabic and my delight was to escape my governess and visit the mosques with my Algerian friends, and unconsciously I was a little Muslim at heart,"" she wrote. At her ancestral estate of Dunmore Park, she excelled at deer-stalking and salmon-fishing. Her explorer father, the 7th Earl of Dunmore, was often away in destinations including China and Canada. Her mother, later a lady-in-waiting to Queen Victoria, was also a keen traveller.  Lady Evelyn inherited her parents' wanderlust and it was in Cairo where she met and married her husband John Cobbold - a businessman who was part of the brewery dynasty that ran Ipswich Town FC. It is not known when she converted to Islam. The seed may have been sown by her childhood travels, but Lady Evelyn's faith was apparently cemented after a holiday in Rome, where she met the Pope. ""When His Holiness suddenly addressed me, asking if I was a Catholic, I was taken aback for a moment and then replied that I was a Muslim,"" she later wrote.  ""What possessed me I don't pretend to know, as I had not given a thought to Islam for many years. A match was lit and I then and there determined to read up and study the faith."" It was the religion's spiritual aspect that attracted many converts, according to historian William Facey, who wrote the foreword to Lady Evelyn's memoirs. He says they followed a ""belief that all the great religions shared a transcendent unity… behind the superficial doctrinal detail that divides them"". In the Middle East, Lady Evelyn - referred to as ""Lady Zainab"" by her Arab friends - often had access to areas reserved for women and wrote about the ""dominating influence of women"" in Muslim culture.  At the age of 65, she embarked on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca - the first British woman on record to complete the feat.  It offered her ""endless interest, wonder and beauty"" and her account was later published in a book, Pilgrimage to Mecca. Little is known about her life afterwards other than she travelled for a short period in Kenya. She died in an Inverness nursing home in 1963 at the age of 95, having instructed that a bagpiper play at her funeral and a Koranic passage, known as the ""verse of light"", be inscribed on her gravestone. The marker, located in her Glencarron estate in the Highlands, was later slashed with a knife - perhaps testament to the strong views her conversion drew. ""I am often asked when and why I became a Muslim,"" she wrote in her memoirs.  ""I can only reply that I do not know the precise moment when the truth of Islam dawned upon me.   ""It seems that I have always been a Muslim.""  The narrative of Victorian Muslim history is usually dominated by those from society's upper echelons, whose accounts have been better preserved. Keeping written documents, such as diaries, was ""generally more a sign of being middle class"", says Christina Longden, who only found out her ancestor became Muslim after her father researched their family tree. Robert Stanley rose from working-class grocer to Conservative mayor of Stalybridge - a mill town near Manchester - in the 1870s.  According to Ms Longden, who has written a book and play about him, he was also a magistrate who set up a fund for workers sacked for not voting in line with their bosses' views. She also found he regularly wrote about British colonialism to the newsletter of Quilliam's Liverpool mosque. Stanley met Quilliam in the late 1890s after he had retired from his political career, and they became close friends.  ""Robert was 28 years older than Quilliam so I think there may have been a bit of a father-son relationship there,"" says Ms Longden.   It wasn't until he was 70 years old however, in 1898, that Stanley became a Muslim and adopted the name Reschid.  Ms Longden believes from her research that there were ""no other Muslims"" in Stalybridge at the time. Stanley later moved to Manchester and died in 1911.  His conversion was kept quiet by his immediate descendants and was only discovered by the Longdens in 1998. ""Quilliam's granddaughter said this was 'an age when, if you didn't conform, your picture was turned to the wall for all time',"" says Ms Longden. Coincidentally, Ms Longden's brother, Steven, became a Muslim in 1991 after studying in Egypt as part of his university degree - seven years before finding out about Stanley. When he heard about his ancestor's conversion, he recalls finding it ""incredibly shocking, in a good way"". ""The fact there was a man who chose to be Muslim at a time when you couldn't possibly imagine someone would do something so unorthodox... when you sit and think about it, well yeah, it's Manchester.  ""People aren't afraid to stand up and say what they believe in, whether that's politically or religiously."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40119103,Corbyn 'failing to grasp anti-Semitism',"Jeremy Corbyn has failed to combat anti-Jewish discrimination, a senior Labour figure says.",2 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has failed to combat anti-Jewish discrimination, according to a senior figure in the party.  The chairman of the Jewish Labour movement, Jeremy Newmark, would not say whether Labour's track record on dealing with anti-Semitism would cost the party a significant number of votes at the general election. But he does see it as a cause for concern. ""Jeremy Corbyn appears to have failed to understand the nature of contemporary anti-Semitism in the same way that it's understood by most of its target group,"" he said. Labour MP Wes Streeting - a frequent critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership - has also criticised the party's record on the issue. ""I don't think many Jewish voters in my constituency have been very impressed with the way the Labour party as a whole have responded,"" said Mr Streeting.  Mr Corbyn has previously said the party does not tolerate anti-Semitism in any way. The Labour leader's record on handling anti-Semitic behaviour has the potential to cause problems for the party at the ballot box. While fewer than 0.5%, or 263,000, of Britons described themselves as Jewish at the last census, a majority of them live in just 10 parliamentary constituencies, including some of the most tightly contested in the country.   Since Mr Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour Party, there have been allegations that he has failed to do all he can to tackle anti-Semitism. Having repeatedly refused to apologise for calling the Islamist Lebanese militia, Hezbollah ""friends"", he has also had to deal with a string of anti-Semitic comments from Labour councillors, an MP, and party stalwart Ken Livingstone. In April, Mr Livingstone was suspended from the party for standing by his claim that Hitler supported Zionism in the 1930s. The party decided to conduct a report into its handling of the issue.  At the launch of Labour's race and faith manifesto this week, Mr Corbyn reaffirmed the party's commitment to ""build a society free from all forms of racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. ""We will stand up to and take effective action against hate crime, notably, but not only in Muslim, Jewish and non-Abrahamic faith communities,"" he said.  In June last year, an inquiry led by Shami Chakrabarti - now a Labour peer - a former director of human rights group Liberty - concluded that the party was not overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism but there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". As with any community, a range of issues will influence Jewish voters' decisions, said Simon Johnson, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council. But he says ""this is probably the first election at which this has been an issue"" to such a big extent.  ""People within the Labour party leadership are in no doubt about the concerns of the Jewish community,"" he said. One early indication is a Jewish Chronicle opinion poll published this week, which suggested just 13% of British Jews plan to vote for Labour, compared with 77% backing the Tories. The poll by Survation, which polled a sample of 515 British Jews, also suggested Labour would do better with Jewish voters if Jeremy Corbyn was not the leader. One of the most marginal seats in the country is the leafy north-east London suburb of Ilford North, home to a Jewish community of about 6,600.  Two years ago, Labour's Wes Streeting won it by just 589 votes. He says he is taking no votes for granted. He is relying on his track record to impress voters, including the ones who, he says, have brought up Labour's anti-Semitism record on the doorstep. He says they have not been impressed by the party's reaction as a whole, ""but they have seen that I have been unflinching in my condemnation of anti-Semitism within the party.""  He also points to his record of trying to tackle the issue within wider society, which dates back at least as far as his time as NUS president more than a decade ago. The seat won't be decided on a single issue. On its border sits the large, modern King George hospital whose A&E is threatened with closure. The NHS, social care and schools will be on voters' minds too. However, another reason Labour's record on anti-Semitism could be an important issue is that UKIP is not running, in the hope of boosting Conservative candidate Lee Scott's chances.  Born locally, Mr Scott held the Ilford North seat from 2005 until 2015. He said ""a number of people"" he has met during the campaign have cited Labour's ""reluctance to tackle"" anti-Semitism as a reason ""they cannot vote Labour any longer"". On the other side of the capital is the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency. Crucially for Labour it's also home to the sixth biggest Jewish population in the country - 8,482 according to the 2011 census. However, it's almost certainly grown since then as younger Jews move to congregate around the wider area's Jewish schools, kosher restaurants and other amenities.  Labour's Tulip Siddiq, who has worked hard to build ties with the Jewish community, is defending a majority of just 1,138. In what could be interpreted as a sign that the Conservatives also see the importance of that relationship their candidate, Claire-Louise Leyland, was selected in a meeting at a local synagogue. According to Marcus Dysch, political editor of the Jewish Chronicle, it's one of a handful of seats around the country, including Bury South, where this issue has made Labour vulnerable. ""Anti-Semitism has become the number one topic of political discussion amongst the Jewish community nationwide,"" says Mr Dysch. ""It is the issue people are talking about above and beyond Brexit, the economy or healthcare."" Other candidates standing in Ilford North are Richard Clare, Liberal Democrat; and Doris Osen, Independent. In Hampstead and Kilburn: Kirsty Allan, Liberal Democrat; Hugh Easterbrook, Independent; John Mansook, Green Party; and Rainbow George Weiss, Independent."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-64925333,Flynn backs Humza Yousaf in SNP leadership race,SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn is the latest senior party figure to endorse the health secretary.,11 Mar 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has backed Humza Yousaf in the race to replace Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Flynn is the latest high-profile figure in the party to endorse the Scottish health secretary. On Saturday Mr Yousaf will join fellow contenders Kate Forbes and Ash Regan for a hustings event at Strathclyde University. SNP members will start voting for the new leader on Monday, with the winner to be announced on 27 March.  Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Flynn said: ""I think, for all of us, we need a big bit of hope at the moment. ""We have had a difficult few years with Brexit, with Liz Truss crashing the economy in October, with the cost of living crisis, and I think that Humza can provide that hope.""  The Aberdeen South MP praised Mr Yousaf's plans to expand childcare and provide help with the cost of living.  He also said the health secretary understood the necessity for energy security and green jobs. During last week's STV debate, leadership rival Kate Forbes delivered a sharp critique of Mr Yousaf's recording in government, telling him: ""You were a transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times."" Asked about that scathing criticism, Mr Flynn said: ""It is inevitable that when you are having a contest people will perhaps overegg things. ""When it comes to health Humza has overseen the NHS obviously in a very difficult spot. I don't think anyone is ever going to try and undersell that. ""But our NHS is performing better than any of those on these isles."" Challenged about record waiting times, Mr Flynn blamed a backlog from the Covid pandemic and an ageing population.   He also said Mr Yousaf's record in transport and justice was one to be ""proud of"", citing examples such as the delivery of the Queensferry Crossing under budget and falling crime figures. Asked if divisions in the party had been exposed since Ms Sturgeon announced she was standing down, Mr Flynn said there were disagreements within every political party. But he added: ""I think when colleagues are having debate they need to remember that whilst you can disagree you don't necessarily need to be disagreeable."" SNP Westminster deputy leader Mhairi Black had already announced her support for Mr Yousaf, criticising Ms Forbes, who has said she would not have voted for same-sex marriage if she had been at Holyrood when the legislation was passed. Bruce Crawford, a former parliamentary business secretary in the Scottish government, also endorsed Mr Yousaf. The former MSP tweeted: ""I have thought long and hard about who should be the next leader of the SNP. I believe that Humza Yousaf is the candidate who has best demonstrated the qualities and attributes to be that leader."" Veteran SNP MSPs Annabelle Ewing and Christine Grahame are among those to have announced they will be voting for Ms Forbes. One of the party's best known MPs, Joanna Cherry KC, has given her support to Ms Regan.  Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf has revealed he was forced to call in Police Scotland over abuse he experienced in the early days of his campaign. Mr Yousaf spoke of his fears that running to be first minister could impact his family, and his children in particular. He said: ""It's one of the long conversations, the hard conversations, that I had with the family who know about the racial and Islamophobic abuse that I get. ""Ultimately you don't really worry about yourself too much - you worry about your kids."" A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed a 25-year-old man and 35-year-old woman were arrested and charged in connection to reports of abusive and threatening behaviour in the Dundee area last month. The three leadership candidates will take part in an hour-long Debate Night programme from Edinburgh at 20:00 on Tuesday 14 March on BBC One Scotland."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50511329,Corbyn: I'd stay neutral in Brexit referendum,"Boris Johnson asks how the Labour leader could agree a new EU deal and then be ""indifferent"" about it.",23 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Jeremy Corbyn has said he would remain neutral in a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins power. He told a BBC Question Time leaders' special he would not campaign for Leave or Remain so it would allow him, as prime minister, to ""credibly"" carry out what the voters then decide. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later asked how Mr Corbyn could be ""indifferent"" on such a vital issue. But Mr Johnson faced questions of his own about whether he could be trusted. The prime minister was the fourth party leader to answer the audience's questions, with the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson also taking to the stage for 30 minutes each on Friday evening. Pressed on whether politicians should be relied upon to tell the truth, Mr Johnson said this was ""absolutely vital"".  While trust was a crucial issue for voters, he argued the biggest threat to public confidence was the ""corrosive"" effect of Parliament trying to block Brexit. He said the Labour, SNP and Lib Dem leaders wanted to ""basically frustrate"" the result of the 2016 referendum, which the public had been waiting more than three years to see delivered, by ""absurdly"" holding another one.  He said that the Labour leader's views seemed to have ""mutated"" and Mr Corbyn's ambition to negotiate an improved agreement would be totally undermined if he did not care whether the public backed it or not. ""He is now going to be neutral on the deal he proposes to do. I don't see how he can do a deal when he is going to be neutral or indifferent."" The four leaders all appeared individually and faced a mixture of audience questions and follow-up questions from host Fiona Bruce at the event in Sheffield.  The first to take the stage, Mr Corbyn, faced tough questioning about his economic polices, with one member of the audience suggesting his ""reckless socialist"" agenda ""terrified"" him and his family.  The Labour leader said his plans to take Royal Mail, the railways, the water industry and broadband delivery into public ownership had been ""set out"" very clearly and were aimed at ""delivering an economy that works for all"". He insisted business had ""nothing to be frightened of"" by his plans, saying his ""fully prepared and costed manifesto"" would bring the country together and help reduce inequality.  Mr Corbyn was criticised for what several audience members suggested was a lack of clarity on whether he personally would support or oppose Brexit in a new referendum in 2020, with one questioner saying: ""Why would anyone vote for Labour without knowing the answer to that question?"" Mr Corbyn said it was ""entirely reasonable"" to put the question back to the people as another referendum represented a sensible middle ground between those who wanted to cancel Brexit entirely and those backing the PM's deal. Asked to clarify his own position, he said: ""I will adopt, if I am prime minister at the time, a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring our communities and countries together rather than continuing an endless debate."" He later told the audience: ""You heard it here first on Question Time."" In doing this, he would follow in the footsteps of Harold Wilson - who allowed Labour ministers to campaign on both sides in the 1975 Common Market referendum and took a back seat during the campaign - although he personally backed staying in.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock attacked Mr Corbyn's position, saying he had ""decided to be indecisive"" and it ""won't wash with the voters"".  But shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock defended Mr Corbyn's stance as ""brave"". ""What we are saying is we trust the people to have the final say,"" she told Today.  It's not clear if the lively grilling of major politicians will shift the dial at this election.  But it certainly marked a shift in Jeremy Corbyn's position on Brexit. He had been put under pressure by his opponents to say whether he would support Leave or Remain in the new referendum Labour is promising. So he tried to eliminate a negative by providing clarity, of a sort: a clear commitment to stay neutral. Labour's strategists are suggesting he could now be seen as an honest broker that can bring a divided country together. In truth, though, behind the scenes there are fears that the party may have over-estimated the threat from the Lib Dems and underestimated the importance voters in Leave areas attach to delivering Brexit.  So his neutrality is in part an attempt to reassure those voters that his promised referendum isn't the means of cancelling Brexit by the back door. His followers will say he has risen above the fray; his critics - that he has become more decisive about sitting on the fence. Questioned on the issue of tackling incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Mr Corbyn was accused of failing to intervene when one of his own Jewish MPs, Ruth Smeeth, was heckled by an activist at a party event in 2016.  Mr Corbyn said Ms Smeeth and others had ""suffered terrible abuse"". He insisted that all forms of racism and misogyny were ""unacceptable"" and party activists who had abused MPs had been disciplined or expelled. When Mr Johnson took the stage, he dismissed suggestions he was trying to suppress the findings of a report into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 referendum vote as ""Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""There is no evidence whatsoever, that I know of, to show any interference in any British electoral event,"" the Conservative leader said. He insisted his party had ""zero tolerance"" towards Islamophobia and said he regretted any offence he had caused in articles about race during his journalistic career - including a piece in 2018 in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers. But he defended the right to freedom of speech and did not accept an audience member's invitation to say ""sorry"" for writing them. Labour's economic plans would be ""ruinous"" for the country, he argued, but he also acknowledged his plan to cut national insurance bills for low-earners - expected to be the main tax announcement in the Conservative manifesto - would only have a modest impact.  On the NHS, Mr Johnson stuck by his claims that the health service was receiving the biggest cash injection in its history. He added: ""Of course I understand that things have been tough in the NHS and understand the pressures the NHS is under. I know the massive demand the NHS faces but we can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said voting for her party in Scotland was the best way of ""depriving"" the Tories of a majority across the UK. Asked about what she would do in the event of another hung Parliament on 12 December, she said she would not work with the Tories but was prepared to deal with Labour if Jeremy Corbyn committed to end austerity and agreed to hold another Scottish independence referendum. ""In terms of what I would seek to win from a minority Labour government, obviously I would ask for and expect Jeremy Corbyn to respect the right of the Scottish people to choose their own future. ""It is not for Westminster to decide. It is for the people of Scotland."" When it was pointed out to her that Mr Corbyn had just stated to viewers that he would not sanction another independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government, she said she was predicting what he might choose to do after the election, rather than dwelling on what he was saying now. She said: ""Do you think he's going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants, for a couple of years, to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?"" The first minister said more needed to be done to reduce the number of drug deaths in Scotland, saying, ""I don't want to be citizen of a country where people are dying from drug issues."" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was immediately asked by an audience member whether she regretted saying she could become prime minister and ""how ridiculous this sounded"" - given that her party only had 20 MPs at the end of the last Parliament. She said she recognised it was a ""big ask"" for her to make it to No 10 but she believed many people were ""dismayed"" at having to choose between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and there had to be a ""better alternative"". She faced awkward questions over her plans to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50, being asked by one audience member whether she regarded all 17.4 million Leave voters as ""stupid"". Ms Swinson said this was not the case and they clearly disagreed over the benefits of being in the EU, to which she was told ""you can disagree with me but you lost"". She was also challenged over austerity and what one audience member called her party's backing for ""harsh and cruel benefit cuts"" while in coalition with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015. She conceded the Lib Dems had made mistakes during their time in government and should have done more to limit the scale of austerity - although she said she remained supportive of the principle of the Universal Credit system - which Labour has pledged to scrap. It was not a comfortable ride for any of the four who appeared in front of the audience in Sheffield who were pressed on issues as broad as the economy, austerity, Brexit, Bolivia, the Russia report, racism, the NHS and plenty more.  It was particularly uncomfortable for the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who was pummelled by the audience over her promise to stop Brexit by simply halting the process altogether in the unlikely event she won a majority. There were moments of real challenge too for Boris Johnson first on a very simple question - can he be trusted? The audience's attitude made it clear they have a big question about that, and about him. Read more from Laura here. The two-hour show came after recently-screened Question Time specials with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley. The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff."

The Ricketts family, which owns the Chicago Cubs, has made the shortlist of bidders to buy the club. But there are concerns over the bid after it emerged that the family's patriarch, Joe Ricketts, was accused, external of Islamophobia three years ago. The Chelsea Supporters' Trust (CST) said it is against the family's bid. The CST said it had conducted a snap survey of its membership on 1 April to see if ""they had confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club"" and ""whether they supported"" the bid. It did not say how many members took part but that ""72% of those who responded do not currently have confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, with 5% of respondents believing they would"". The CST added: ""Similarly, 77% of members who responded do not support the Ricketts family's bid for Chelsea FC and 3% of respondents are in support. ""The CST board is guided by our membership, and thus we do not currently believe it is in the best interests of our members for the Ricketts family's bid to succeed."" Chelsea were in action against Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday and and some Blues fans protested against the Ricketts family's bid before the game. ""Over the past fortnight, our bid team has met with several supporter groups to explain our vision for Chelsea Football Club,"" said Tom Ricketts. ""In those meetings, and by letter to all groups, we have shared a set of specific commitments we will make to fans, if our bid is successful. ""We believe these are far-reaching and certainly include an absolute commitment on the part of the Ricketts family and the bid team to put diversity and inclusion at the heart of the club. ""We look forward to more meetings - including with the Chelsea Supporters' Trust - over the coming days and to making a public reiteration of our values and commitments.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43246496,Driver guilty of hate crime car attack,Paul Moore knocked over a Somali woman in his car and then went back to run her over as she lay on the ground.,2 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man has been convicted of the attempted murder of a Somali woman after knocking her over in his car and then going back to run her over as she lay helpless on the ground.  Mother-of-nine Zaynab Hussein suffered life-changing injuries in the attack in Leicester last September. Her life was saved after extensive specialist surgery but she remains confined to a bed. Paul Moore, 21, from Leicester, was found guilty at Nottingham Crown Court. Jurors also convicted him of the attempted grievous bodily harm of a 12-year-old Somali girl, for trying to drive into her minutes after the first attack. Moore - who has previous convictions and was on bail for a charge of causing grievous bodily harm when he was arrested for the attack - looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out. In the hours leading up to the attack, which happened five days after the Parsons Green attack in London, Moore had been drinking heavily with friends.  Mrs Hussein was returning home after dropping off her two youngest children at school when she was knocked down.  She was thrown by the force of the impact into the wall of a house in the Beaumont Leys area of Leicester.  In two witness statements provided from her hospital bed, she said she could feel blood on her forehead and had lost sensation in her limbs, believing them to be broken.  She tried to reach her mobile phone to call family and was crying for help. Two drivers stopped to ask if she needed help, but then drove on.  Mrs Hussein was left with a fractured pelvis, spine and multiple other injuries including severe breaks to her limbs.  Two young men who had been in the car told police that Moore, who is unemployed, had told them he wanted to run someone over. After he first hit Mrs Hussein, sending her flying, the pair jumped out of the still-moving car.  Moore performed a U-turn to return to the scene. He drove past Mrs Hussein and seeing her on the ground, he turned the car around, mounted the pavement and drove over her with all four wheels.  He then drove off again and spotted a 12-year-old Somali girl, identified by him as a Muslim because of her headscarf, walking to school with her cousin. Moore drove at her, apparently mounting the pavement again, but this time he clipped her side, sending her bag flying. The girl was unharmed but shaken.  During the trial, the jury heard that after the attack Moore turned up severely drunk at the home of his half-brother, Lewis Welsh, and told him in offensive, racist terms, why he had attacked the woman.  ""I don't think he knew what he was saying or doing. But he did tell me that he had ran over a 'Paki',"" said Mr Welsh. ""He tried to put it down to the London 7/7 bombings. He said he was proud of himself. He was rambling. He was doing the country a favour."" Mrs Hussein remains in pain and is still receiving medical treatment for her injuries - including returning to hospital for more surgery.  She and her husband are too scared to talk publicly about what happened but the wider Muslim community in the Beaumont Leys area remains in shock.  ""Everyone has been talking about how this happened - and why,"" said Zuleika, a community activist in Leicester.  She, like all the others the BBC spoke to, asked to remain anonymous because they are scared there could be another attack.  ""We are just asking ourselves who is going to be next. We have found out about other parents who have been insulted because they are Muslim. Some of them are scared and afraid to raise their voice - for every woman in this community, we now have the same fear."" Paul Moore pleaded denied attempted murder but gave the court no defence to the accusation that his crime was motivated by hate.  National statistics show that hate crime appears to have been rising over the last two years:  Part of the rise was down to better reporting but police were also sure there were spikes after major moments of tension.  The most significant of these were the EU Referendum in June 2016 and the terrorism attacks at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena and London Bridge. The Parsons Green London Underground attack came outside of the period for these statistics - but Moore's attempted murder of Mrs Hussein occurred five days later.  Azhar Qayum of Mend, a campaign organisation tackling Islamophobia, said women were particularly vulnerable to attacks, alongside elderly men, because they tended to be more visible.  ""What's happened to Mrs Hussen is very serious - but it is not an isolated case,"" he said.  ""There has been a long line of very serious crimes like this. We have had the Islamophobic murder of Mohammed Saleem in Birmingham, we have the Islamophobic murder of Mushin Ahmed in Rotherham, an 81-year-old grandfather.  ""And we have had the attack last year on worshippers at Finsbury Park. Although this is very serious, this level of seriousness is not isolated."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61976836,India state on edge after Prophet row beheading,Two Muslim men in Rajasthan killed a Hindu tailor who backed controversial remarks about the Prophet Muhammad.,30 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"India's Rajasthan state continues to be on alert following the beheading of a Hindu man by two Muslim men. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has appealed for calm and promised to take strict action against the attackers.  The victim, a tailor named Kanhaiya Lal, was killed in Udaipur district in north India on Tuesday by the men, who filmed the act and posted it online. They said the act was in response to his support for a politician's dividing remarks about the Prophet Muhammad. The National Investigative Agency - India's top anti-terrorism agency - is carrying out a probe. A senior police officer told reporters that the police had found early evidence that one of the accused men had links with a group in Pakistan. Islamabad, however, has denied such reports, calling them ""mischievous"". The BBC's Nitin Srivastava, who's in Udaipur, said the streets were empty and communities were living in fear of religious violence.  He added that there was heavy deployment of police forces across the city and senior officers were constantly appealing for peace. Most people were unprepared for a curfew, with many now struggling to get hold of even basic rations.  ""Daily wagers are worst affected,"" said Mukesh Gardiya, a local man. ""All that's happened is a big shock.""  The government has suspended internet services and banned large gatherings. Police have arrested the two men, who had identified themselves in the video. In another video, the accused boasted about the murder and also issued threats to Prime Minister Narendra Modi while brandishing cleavers. A top Rajasthan police official asked media outlets not to broadcast the video of the murder as it was ""too grisly to watch"". The men posed as customers to enter Kanhaiya Lal's shop, and attacked him while he was taking their measurements.  The victim had allegedly put up a social media post supporting former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nupur Sharma, who made controversial comments about the Prophet Muhammad last month. Her comments sparked a diplomatic row with several Islamic countries registering strong protests with India. The BJP subsequently suspended Ms Sharma from the party. The controversy also led to religious protests in India which turned violent after demonstrators threw stones and damaged public property. Three weeks before his murder, Kanhaiya Lal had been arrested by the police for allegedly hurting religious feelings, the Indian Express reported. He had asked for police protection after his release, citing threats to his life. The police then called some Hindus and Muslims for a peace meeting, after which Kanhaiya Lal said he didn't ""need any more action against any one"", a police official told the newspaper. The incident has been condemned by prominent politicians across party lines in India.  Former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who belongs to the BJP, blamed Mr Gehlot's Congress party government, saying ""a situation of communal frenzy and violence has arisen in the state"". Some BJP leaders have said they will march in the national capital Delhi to protest against the killing.  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the murder and called for immediate punishment for the attackers. Some prominent Muslim organisations have also condemned the murder. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board called the incident ""highly condemnable"", adding that it was against both Indian law as well as Islamic strictures. ""Nobody can be allowed to take the law into their hands and declaring someone a criminal and then murdering them is a highly condemnable act,"" the board said in a statement."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45114368,Criticism grows of Johnson's burka jibe,A former minister says he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became leader.,8 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is facing growing criticism over his remark that Muslim women wearing the burka ""look like letter boxes"". Dominic Grieve, the ex-attorney general, said he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became leader. Ex-Tory chairwoman Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's remarks could trigger a rise in hate crime. Senior Tories have urged him to apologise but he has not done so, and has stood by his comments. In a Daily Telegraph article, he said full-face veils should not be banned, but it was ""absolutely ridiculous"" women chose to ""go around looking like letter boxes"". He also compared them to looking like ""bank robbers"". A source close to the former London mayor has said: ""We must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues. ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" But, speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Mr Grieve - a former Remain campaigner who has previously clashed with Mr Johnson over Brexit - said his behaviour was ""very embarrassing"". Mr Grieve said he would ""without the slightest doubt"", quit the Tories if Mr Johnson became leader, ""because I don't regard him as a fit and proper person to lead a political party"". The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, has also backed calls for an apology over what she called ""gratuitously offensive"" comments.  Speaking at an event in North Berwick, East Lothian, she said: ""This wasn't an off-the-cuff slip, he wrote a column, he knew exactly what he was doing and I think it crossed from being provocative and starting a debate and actually it became rude and gratuitous. ""It's also not been shown through history that when men make sweeping statements about what women should or shouldn't wear that it goes well for them. ""I think he should apologise for them."" Earlier Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said there was no reason not to have a ""robust conversation"" about the subject, but added: ""We're not talking to our friends in the pub. We are public figures and we have an additional obligation to be careful."" A former Tory chairman, Lord Pickles, said Mr Johnson, who was foreign secretary until resigning last month over Brexit, risked ""closing down"" the debate with his ""illiberal language"". Supporters of Mr Johnson say the row is politically-motivated and that other senior Tories have made similar remarks without such criticism. By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent  By saying what he did, in the way he said it, Boris Johnson was guaranteed to provoke a reaction.  The question of what Muslim women choose to wear in public is a sensitive one, around which most politicians tread very carefully.  But Boris Johnson is not most politicians. And by using language you rarely hear in the normal course of political debate, the former foreign secretary has attracted attention and criticism.  If it was his intention to remind everyone that Boris is still Boris, not afraid to say what he thinks, despite being out of government and away on holiday, it was not without risk.  Figures show a rise in Islamophobic attacks and the Conservative party faces criticism for not addressing anti-Muslim prejudice in its own ranks.  In this context, many feel he has picked the wrong time to tackle the wrong issue.  But as ever, being outspoken is at once appealing to Boris Johnson's supporters and distasteful to his detractors.  Mr Johnson, who is the current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, has long been seen as a potential candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He fronted the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, and resigned as foreign secretary last month in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plans. Writing in the Guardian, Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""indefensible"" and ""have no place in the modern Conservative Party"". She said, although he was setting out a liberal position on the burka, he was doing it in an ""alt-right"" way, and using Muslim women as ""political fodder… to stake out a leadership bid"". ""Johnson's words… send out a message that Muslim women are fair game,"" she wrote.  But mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, said it was ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments showed a ""lack of knowledge"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""In today's day and age, the majority of the women who wear the burka are born and brought up in this country, are educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters and none of them wears a burka, adding: ""It's not a must, it's not an obligation."" Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, who wears the niqab, told BBC News: ""I absolutely have no problem with anyone disagreeing with my choice to wear it and criticising it.  ""But when you demonise and dehumanise a minority, who happen to be women of colour, I have a problem with this. ""It's not for the state, it's not for the government and it's definitely not for middle-aged white men to tell me what to wear and what not to."" Tory MP for Mansfield, Ben Bradley, said it was not the language he would have used, but added: ""Ultimately he is a journalist... and journalists want their pieces to be read.  ""They want people to talk about what they have written [and] I would say that is probably the motivation.""  Mr Johnson's former adviser Munira Mirza said Mr Johnson's views on the burka had been ""entirely consistent"" and other Conservative politicians had expressed the same view, without being called Islamophobic. In 2013 former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke - who also opposed a ban on the public wearing of burkas - said they should not be worn while giving evidence in court. He referred to burkas as a ""peculiar costume"" and a ""kind of bag"". Ms Mirza added: ""The reality is there is a political fight here. People who frankly couldn't care less about the issues that Muslim women face are piling into Boris because Boris said it."" Conservative MP Conor Burns also defended Mr Johnson, accusing his political colleagues of ""bandwagon jumping"". The member for Bournemouth West tweeted those who criticised the former foreign secretary ""clearly didn't understand"" his comments. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Last year, Zaynab Hussein, a mother from Leicester, was left fighting for her life after a man she didn't know smashed into her with his car - and then ran over her again. She was attacked because she was a Muslim.  Tell Mama, the national organisation that collects anti-Muslim attack statistics, says that the majority of street victims of such abuse and violence are women, for the same reason that Mrs Hussein was singled out: some Muslim women are easily identifiable by their mode of dress - and therefore easy to target.  Seven years ago Baroness Warsi said prejudice against Muslims had passed the ""dinner table test"".  And Mr Johnson's critics regard his ""letter box"" and ""bank robber"" comments as part of the problem the peer defined: normalising prejudice and dehumanising women, rather than calmly debating the complexities of the veil in an open society.  Since Baroness Warsi's warning, there has been the launch of a cross-departmental working group to tackle anti-Muslim hate. But it has been criticised as toothless, not least because the government can't agree a definition for Islamophobia.  In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West, and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-12375175,Eyewitness: EDL return to Luton,"What happened when the English Defence League staged a ""homecoming"" demonstration in Luton?",6 Feb 2011,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"This video can not be played Abdul Salaam supports the EDL even though he says he is a Muslim Abdul Salaam is not exactly the kind of person the English Defence League expected to recruit. But there he was, a Muslim willing to stand in the middle of a crowd chanting ""Muslim Bombers off our Streets"".  We found Glaswegian Abdul in Luton's St George's Square - and he explained why he, a follower of Islam, was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with an organisation accused of Islamophobia.  ""The EDL are supporting England, supporting Britain, and I'm British, so why can't I support my country?"" he said.  ""Have you seen me getting any racist abuse? They applauded me. Why are other Muslims not here? This demonstration is nothing to do with colour or religion. These are people who have watched their country being bombed and they are angry. These are patriotic Englishmen, red-blooded Englishmen."" EDL divisions: Groups from all over the UK Mr Salaam said he wasn't particularly assiduous about praying five times a day - and that he probably didn't get to a mosque as much as he should. But he insisted he was a true Muslim who thought deeply about his faith - and it was his duty to speak out alongside the EDL.  ""I'm here to support Britain and to defend Islam as well,"" he said. ""There are people who, under the name of Islam, blew up trains. They're not Muslims, they're hypocrites. When people have dragged Islam through the mud, it's my duty to speak out as a Muslim."" This was not the demonstration the EDL hoped it would be.  The police say there were 1,500 EDL supporters in the town, plus another 1,000 in the Unite Against Fascism counter-demonstration.  What had been billed as a demonstration ""Back To Where It All Began"" did not have the air of a triumphant movement sweeping all before it.  The EDL is almost two years old - but police forces have now developed tactics to prevent a repeat of some of the early three-way violent clashes between EDL supporters, anti-racism campaigners and fired-up young Muslim men.  The risk of those clashes disappeared behind massive steel barriers that the police used to seal the EDL in to St George's Square. They wanted to make a show in the hometown of their founders - but there was nobody around to see it.  On the streets of England: Police barrier in Luton Luton was a ghost town. Large parts were deserted from 10am. Police had warned businesses what to expect - and owners shut up and boarded up. The massive Â£800,000 police operation worked - but at some cost to the local economy.  But many of the EDL's supporters who turned out for the speeches thought it was still a day well spent. Their leaders described the movement as a bulwark against terrorism. They praised Prime Minister David Cameron's speech earlier the same day, in which he attacked multiculturalism.  Stephen Lennon, aka Tommy Robinson, one of the movement's founders, looked on chuffed as the crowd sang about joining ""Tommy's revolution"".  The EDL's leaders say the movement isn't racist - but many of the placards were pretty offensive to the few ordinary Muslims who saw them. And with the British National Party suffering internal battles, the organisation is now attracting the attention of a wide spread of international far right anti-Islamic activists.  Among those who had flown in was the bearded figure of Nachum Shifren, a controversial Los Angeles Rabbi.  ""I'm a supporter of the EDL,"" he said, standing next to a group of cropped-haired men from the EDL's Walsall, Leeds and Essex ""divisions"".  ""I see radical Islam popping up, I see governments caving in to it. I see a lot of lawlessness going on because of political correctness. ""I believe in the EDL and I don't want England to go the way of Paris. Do you realise there is a mile down the street where I cannot walk and get out alive?"" He was referring to Bury Park, the heart of Luton's Muslim communities - and this claim of ""no go"" areas for white people around the country was repeated time and time again by EDL members we interviewed.  Communities in fear But when we went to Bury Park, it was fairly clear that it was the local Muslim residents who were scared.  Standing by in Bury Park: Young men on the watch Just like in town, entire parades of shops had closed. Women and children were nowhere to be seen on what should have been the busiest day of the week.  Men and teenage boys were out in some force, nervously looking in the direction of the town centre and the police lines at the bottom of the hill.  Conspicuous by their absence, though, was the small group of hardcore Islamists whose 2009 protest against soldiers returning to Luton from Afghanistan had caused so much anger across the town. Stewards - one of whom was a local Christian clergyman - politely asked visitors to identify themselves - but also asked anti-racist campaigners to keep out to avoid inflaming tensions.  Jangir Khan, chairman of the Bury Park Business Association, was among those involved in organising the community's security - but like everyone else, he wasn't happy.  ""This is the busiest day of the week for the local economy,"" he said. ""If you close, then you lose 100% of income. Those who've stayed open have probably lost 90% because nobody is coming out. They are stuck in their homes.  ""We asked for the EDL to be banned from this town and the police said it couldn't be done. Well what about our human rights to go about our daily lives without fear?"" Some young men had travelled down from Birmingham, presenting themselves as the ""Muslim Defence League"". They were small in number and did not attempt to stage a public show of strength.  Overall, the Bury Park community had decided, in the words of one local leader, to make a dignified stand together, rather than to puff out their chests and make confrontational noises.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-46566836,Week ahead in Parliament,"The week will see another punishing session for the prime minister in the Commons, as she reports back on the EU summit.",14 Dec 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Will the aftershocks of a tumultuous Westminster week reverberate through what looks like quite a humdrum end of term agenda in Parliament?  One persistent rumour is that angry Tory Brexiteers may strike back at the government by failing to turn up to a vote at some point in the week - they could, for example, go on strike during the vote on the second reading of the Mental Capacity Bill, on Tuesday, where the bill would be lost if Labour's fatal amendment is passed.  This would be an alarming signal that the government had effectively lost the ability to govern - but it would not take many Conservatives to go AWOL to ensure defeat, if things really have got that embittered.  In an interview for Friday night's Today in Parliament on BBC Radio 4, I asked one senior Brexiteer, Mark Francois, an ex-whip, about this idea. His response? That no good whip disclosed their strategy in advance. So watch out. In that spirit, the prime minister's statement on Monday, reporting back on the latest EU summit, will return her to her Commons Groundhog Day, assailed from all sides by her critics.  Until now the key voice has always been the DUP Leader Nigel Dodds - without his support she will not have a majority for her Brexit deal -  so look out for signs that she is seeking support elsewhere, perhaps from Labour MPs who fear the consequences of a No-Deal Brexit. Another big Brexit event will be the publication of the long-awaited Immigration white paper - and the accompanying Commons statement from the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid.  This is probably the single most sensitive policy area arising from Brexit and the focus will be on how the home secretary balances the conflicting priorities of cutting immigration and providing workers for key industries - and he can expect both sides of the argument to be put by Conservative colleagues, as well as by opposition MPs.  And in the background there are increasing numbers of important statutory instruments being put through Parliament to prepare for the possibility of no deal; in the financial services area alone, 70 will go through between the end of October and February 2019..... Here's my rundown of the week ahead: The Commons begins its final week of term (2.30pm) with Education questions, but the big event will be the prime minister's report back on the latest EU summit - and any concessions she has achieved which might defuse some of the critics of her Brexit deal. Another day, another long, gruelling Commons statement for the PM.  Then MPs debate a series of motions to approve a series of regulations on online pornography, including on age verification and ""Ancillary providers"" - ie pornography delivered via social media. There is 90 minutes set aside to discuss each of these orders, and the result may be an unusually substantial debate.   My committee pick is Public Accounts Committee hearing on the Windrush generation and the Home Office (4pm).  Since the PAC mandate is to examine the effectiveness and efficiency with which policy is implemented, this hearing will not carry the emotional charge that this issue would bring to an inquiry by another select committee - but the officials and lawyers due to give evidence can expect a searching interrogation about how well they have performed their roles.   Meanwhile, increasingly important business is being done in obscure bodies called Delegated Legislation Committees. It all sounds horribly technical and bureaucratic but at 4.30pm the First Delegated Legislation Committee is discussing something called the Draft Markets in Financial Instruments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 - this turns out to be something like 30,000 pages of financial regulations which will have to be in place to keep the financial services industry running, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  They cover things like the concept of ""best execution"" the requirement for the industry to secure the best price for their clients when selling shares. Labour wanted this debated on the floor of the Commons, arguing that it is simply too sprawling to be dealt with off-stage in a committee, but the government is not keen.  And a little later, down the corridor, the Tenth DLC is discussing the Draft Gaming Machines (miscellaneous amendments and revocation) order, which looks suspiciously like the legal mechanism for implementing the government's retreat on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals. You will remember that the Sports Minister Tracy Crouch resigned over the slowness with which they were acting to remove FOBTs from the High Street. In the Lords (2.30pm) the normal half hour of questions to ministers is followed by a debate on the Privileges and Conduct Select Committee's Further Report on the conduct of Lord Lester of Herne Hill - this antiseptic title hardly does justice to the angst around this subject.  The Further Report is an eviscerating rebuttal of the arguments used to reject the previous report on the sexual harassment allegations against the former Lib Dem peer (he resigned the party whip).  The rejection was based on the argument that the woman who made the complaint should have been cross examined - the committee's retort is worth quoting: ""In arriving at this conclusion, we reflected on the cogent argument of Lord Lester himself in this House in 2009 in a case where the lawyers for Lord Taylor of Blackburn argued that Lord Taylor had been denied basic procedural safeguards guaranteed by domestic and international law, including the right to test the evidence against him through cross-examination. Lord Lester then argued that it was entirely misguided to say (amongst other things) that cross-examination was an essential safeguard in proceedings involving possible suspension from the House. Lord Lester was right in that case, and it is equally true of the present case."" But part of the reason this debate will be so charged is that many women peers (and a group of House of Lords staff whose letter to the committee is quoted in the report) believe the dry arguments about proper process shaded into outright misogyny - and they're furious, with a number of male peers likely to face strong criticism for their speeches in the previous debate.  I'm told a group of women peers have organised to make sure this report is approved and one will be asking if, having retired, rather than face the proposed sanctions, Lord Lester will still be allowed to come into the House and use its facilities.  After that, peers turn to the detail of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Bill in the second day of report stage consideration. Labour have a three-line whip on for the amendments about the Prevent programme and the proscription of terrorist organisations.  And the Green party peer, Jenny Jones, has an amendment down about not allowing journalists' material to be seized by border guards. MPs open (11.30am) with Justice questions. The Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour's Geraint Davies - the European Union (Revocation of Notification of Withdrawal) Bill - does what it says on the tin; it requires the PM to revoke Britain's Article 50 Notice of with withdrawal, unless a Brexit deal is approved by Parliament by January 21st, and the deal has been approved in a referendum.  Then MPs turn to the second reading of the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill, which deals with the protections and safeguards around the deprivation of cared-for people.  It has already been through the House of Lords, where extra protections and rights to raise concern were added in, but not enough, it seems, for Labour, who have put down an amendment acknowledging some improvement but still declining to give it a second reading.  In particular they complain that the bill does not do enough to deal with a ""substantial backlog"" of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Assessments. If this is pushed to a vote, the results might be interesting.  In Westminster Hall debates on Traidcraft and the future of fair trade (9.30am) and mental health support for firefighters (2.30pm) caught my eye; the latter is led by Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad, so it will undoubtedly address the consequences of the Grenfell Tower disaster for the emergency services personnel who were on the scene. On the committee corridor, the Justice Committee (10am) hears from Lisa Osofsky, the director of the much-criticised Serious Fraud Office.  And the Defence Committee continues its inquiry into Mental Health and the Armed Forces, with evidence from one of its own members, the former army officer Johnny Mercer, and the Veterans Minister, Tobias Ellwood, another ex-army officer. The committee is increasingly concerned that veterans are waiting for a year or more for mental health treatment, in some parts of the country. Their report, due next year, looks set to be, in the words of one committee member, ""a humdinger"". In the Lords (2.30pm) questions to ministers include the Conservative historian Lord Lexden continuing his campaign to clear the name of the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath - by asking whether the government has received any new information about the seven allegations against him left open at the end of Operation Conifer.  He will be pressing for a debate on a motion to convene an independent inquiry, if answers are not forthcoming. Then comes report stage consideration of the Upskirting Bill - formally, the Voyeurism (Offences) (No. 2) Bill. This is likely to be brief with no amendments submitted at the time of writing.  Peers then turn to two statutory instruments, both with motions attached. The first is from Labour's Lord Foulkes on the Operation of Air Services SI - it expresses concern over the effect of a no-deal Brexit. The second SI has a regret motion from Labour peer Lord Beecham on non-contentious probate fees. But it also has a fatal motion from the Lib Dems on which Labour will abstain - peers find it much easier to sound warning notes against SIs than to reject them outright.  There are six further SIs, on gaming machines; accounts and reports; and statutory and third country auditors; and then three on human fertilisation and embryology, human tissue and safety of transplant organs, which will be taken as a job lot The Commons day begins (11.30am) with the de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington, taking a mini-question time in his role as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and minister for the Cabinet Office. Then comes the boss, at noon, for the final Prime Minister's Questions of 2018.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative ex-nurse, Maria Caulfield would require defibrillators to be placed in schools, leisure centres and other public facilities.  The main debates are on two motions chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - first calling on the government to produce a cumulative impact assessment of changes to disability support, and then a motion calling on the government to change the law to ""provide clarity that an employers' first aid responsibilities cover both physical and mental health.""  Both could be pushed to a vote. My committee pick is Treasury Committee's joint session with the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee (2.15pm) to look at the package of measures announced in the Budget, last month, to help the High Street.  The key witness is Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride. It's another example of the increasing trend for cooperation between committees, where an issue cuts across their territories, and the resulting report (which will doubtless also draw on the HCLG Committee's parallel inquiry into the future of the high street) could carry some considerable clout.  In the Lords (3pm), peers will be discussing two private members' bills - first the detail of the Age of Criminal Responsibility Bill, proposed by the Lib Dem peer, Lord Dholakia.  This would raise the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales from 10 to 12. At the moment, children under 10 cannot be arrested or charged with a crime, while children aged between 10 and 17 are dealt with by youth courts, given different sentences if convicted, and sent to special secure centres for young people, not adult prisons. Lord Dholakia has attempted to pass similar measures in previous years.  The government line during his earlier attempts was that children of that could, mostly, distinguish between bad behaviour and serious wrong-doing, and should be held accountable for their actions.  The government has also argued that the public must have confidence in the youth justice system and know that offending will be dealt with effectively.  Next, what will probably be a brief, ritual third reading for the Crossbencher Baroness Deech's Divorce (Financial Provision) Bill, which would introduce, as a fair starting point, the equal division of all the property and pensions acquired by the couple after marriage, make provision for short-term maintenance, give the flexibility to allow the marital home to be retained for the carer and children, and allow binding pre-nuptial agreements. Then come debates on subjects chosen by backbench Conservative peers -  firstly, on sports, recreation and the arts' contribution to society wellbeing, led by the former sports minister, Lord Moynihan; and secondly, on the threat of plastic to the environment and the case for improved recycling, led by Baroness Neville-Rolfe.  It's the last day of term, when, by tradition, MPs are allowed to bring in games.....proceedings open (9.30am) with half an hour of International Trade questions, followed by Women and Equalities questions, and then the weekly Business Statement, from the Leader of the House.  The key point of interest is whether and when the government will schedule the resumption of the ""Meaningful Vote"" debate, on the prime minister's Brexit deal.  The main debate will be on the UN report on the Rohingya refugee crisis, on a motion calling on the government to put pressure on the UN to prevent refugees from Myanmar being repatriated back into unsafe conditions - Conservative Anne Main and Labour MP Rushanara Ali lead proceedings,  In an interesting move, the traditional general debate the forthcoming adjournment, in which any MP can speak about any subject, has been bumped from the Chamber to Westminster Hall - where a minister will painstakingly note down a galaxy of different issues and promise responses from the relevant ministers.  By its very nature the debate never produces a vote, and with very limited chamber time available to the Backbench Business Committee, they have clearly opted to prioritise voteable motions for chamber debate.  In the Lords (11am), question time includes the crossbench or independent peer Baroness Boycott asking ministers what steps they've taken to ensure healthy and nutritious food does not become more expensive after Brexit.  Then there are balloted debates on subjects chosen by backbench peers.  First, Lord Sheikh on the Impact of Islamophobia in the UK; the second Lord Campbell-Savours on the remit and arrangements for handling of evidence by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse. The lunch time mini debate led by Lord Berkeley is on the tendering process for the building of five new Type 31e frigates and the impact on the Appledore Shipyard. Then, unless plans change, and they might, Honourable Members and Noble Lords depart for the Christmas break - and will return on Monday 7 January."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57404388,Canada truck attack: Muslim family victims named,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned Sunday's attack as authorities weigh terrorism charges.,8 Jun 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has identified the four members of a Muslim family killed in a ""premeditated"" attack on Sunday. Madiha Salman, 44, her husband Salman Afzaal, 46, their 15-year-old daughter Yumna Afzaal and Mr Afzaal's 74-year-old mother were hit by a vehicle while on an evening walk in London, Ontario. Mr Trudeau condemned the attack as an act of terror.  The couple's nine-year-old son survived and is in hospital with injuries.   The attack was the worst against Canadian Muslims since six people were killed in a Quebec City mosque in 2017. A 20-year-old Canadian man has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. Police said the family is believed to have been targeted because of their Muslim faith. Authorities are weighing possible terrorism charges for what is thought to be a hate crime.  Speaking in the Canadian House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Trudeau decried ""a terrorist attack motivated by hatred, in the heart of one of our communities"".   ""If anyone thinks racism and hatred don't exist in this country, I want to say this: how do we explain such violence to a child in a hospital? How can we look families in the eye and say, 'Islamophobia isn't real'?"" he said.  A vigil has been planned for Thursday evening at the London mosque the family attended.  Three generations of the Afzaal family were killed on Sunday while out for an evening walk. Five family members were waiting to cross an intersection along London's Hyde Park Road when the truck mounted the curb and hit them, police said.   Family and friends told CBC News that the family had been deeply involved in their community and committed to their faith.  After graduating from the London Islamic School last year, 15-year-old Yumna was in the ninth grade at Oakridge Secondary School.  At Oakridge, Yumna was slated to become a Grade 10 representative on the Muslim Students Association, the organisation's president told CBC.  Yumna's mother, Ms Salman, had recently completed a post-graduate degree in civil and environmental engineering at Western University in London, according to her LinkedIn page. Her goal was to work on solving ""geo-environmental issues"" and ""contribute towards reclamation of our natural environment"".  Salman Afzaal was ""humble"" and loyal to his community, a friend told CBC.  The name of Mr Afzaal's 74-year-old mother has not yet been released.  The couple's nine-year-old son was the only family member present who is expected to survive. He remains seriously injured in hospital.  Police named the alleged attacker as Nathanial Veltman, 20, of London, Ontario. He was arrested without incident at a shopping centre about 6km (4.8 miles) from the crime scene.  It is not yet known if the suspect has ties to any hate groups, said Det Supt Waight.  ""There is no known previous connection between the suspect and the victims,"" Det Supt Waight said, adding that the suspect was wearing a vest that appeared to be ""like body armour"".  Police said Mr Veltman had no previous convictions. Officials added that there was good weather and high visibility conditions when the black truck was seen mounting the kerb on Hyde Park Road at around 20:40 local time on Sunday. One witness told CTV News she had to shield her young daughter's eyes from the bodies. ""There were people everywhere and running,"" said Paige Martin. ""Citizens were trying to direct the emergency vehicles where to go. There was a lot of pointing and screaming and arm waving."" A 2016 census found that London - a city about 200km (125 miles) south-west of Toronto - is growing increasingly diverse. One in five people was born outside of Canada, with Arabs being the area's largest minority group, and South Asians coming in a close second. Mr Trudeau addressed parliament in the wake of the attack, describing a ""brutal, cowardly, and brazen act of violence"". The perpetrator ""does not represent us as Canadians"", the prime minister said, but he dismissed the notion that this type of violence is not ""Canadian"" - a sentiment echoed by Canada's opposition leaders.  ""We need to look this in the face - this hate does exist in our country,"" Mr Trudeau said.  London Mayor Ed Holder was among those who paid tribute to the victims, saying: ""This was an act of mass murder, perpetrated against Muslims, against Londoners, and rooted in unspeakable hatred.  Mayor Holder said he was speaking ""on behalf of all Londoners when I say our hearts are broken"".  ""We grieve for the family, three generations of whom are now deceased."" The mayor's statement added that he had ordered flags outside London City Hall to be lowered for three days of mourning. It is not the first time members of the Muslim community in Canada have come under attack. In January 2017, a Canadian man fatally shot six worshippers at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre, and seriously injured five others. The perpetrator was sentenced to life in prison.  Canada's deadliest vehicle-ramming attack happened in 2018, when a self-described ""incel"" (involuntary celibate) ploughed his van into a group of pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 people."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47633067,'No place' for Islamophobia in Tory party,"The party chairman responds to Islamophobia claims, saying swift action is taken on complaints.",20 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservative Party's complaints process is ""robust"", the party chairman has said, after a campaign group wrote to him about claims of Islamophobia. Hope Not Hate's Nick Lowles asked for Brandon Lewis to clarify his claim that all complaints of Islamophobia by party members had been dealt with. The party has not said how many investigations there are but 14 members have been suspended for Facebook posts. Mr Lewis said ""swift action"" had been taken when complaints were made. He said there was ""absolutely no place"" for anti-Muslim discrimination in the party. Mr Lowles wrote asking for clarification after Mr Lewis said in November 2018: ""We deal with complaints, none outstanding."" He said he took that statement to mean there were ""no complaints of Islamophobia outstanding"", but said: ""We now know that this is not true."" He said: ""Were you trying to mislead us, and via the statement, members of the public? ""Or are your systems and processes so broken that you did not know your statement was untrue when you made it?"" In his reply, Mr Lewis said: ""Anti-Muslim discrimination undermines society from within and there is absolutely no place for it in this country or in the Conservative Party. ""We take swift action when complaints are made to Conservative Party headquarters (CCHQ), immediately referring them for investigation. ""That was the case in November 2018, and continues to be the case today."" The Conservative Party has not said how many investigations it has conducted into allegations of Islamophobia against party members in the last year, or how many people have been suspended or thrown out. ""Investigations are rightly kept confidential and may vary in length, so we cannot and will not provide a running commentary on individual cases,"" Mr Lewis said. ""However, as you have no doubt seen, sanctions include suspensions and expulsions."" Earlier this month, former Conservative Party Chairman Baroness Warsi accused Prime Minister Theresa May of ""burying her head in the sand"" over Islamophobia in the party.  Shortly after her comments, the party confirmed 14 members had been suspended for Islamophobic Facebook posts and said ""decisive action"" would be taken against anyone making offensive remarks. Speaking to the BBC Asian Network, Baroness Warsi repeated her criticism of the party and said it was essential there was a ""clearing of the rot of Islamophobia which is festering like an underbelly in my party"". She claimed the problem was ""widespread"" in the party and had been ""going on for years"". ""The party does not take complaints seriously and only does so when there is a huge public outcry,"" she said. ""And that to me makes this problem within the party an institutional issue rather than an issue of a few bad apples."" ""Every time I try to get answers, there is a wall of bureaucracy behind which people are hiding,"" Baroness Warsi said. Only ""a full and independent inquiry"" would get to the bottom of the issue, she said."

Marvin Rees said it should not have been a shock his own council was found to have a racism issue because organisations ""reflect wider society"". In July, Bristol City Council admitted it was institutionally racist and needed to take drastic action. The mayor's comments came during a Facebook live broadcast where he was accused of ignoring the issue. After the institutional racism finding a series of recommendations, including the need for positive action when recruiting, were accepted by Bristol City Council. But in this week's Facebook Live event city resident Abs Ali asked Mr Rees: ""What changes have you made since Bristol City Council was found to be institutional racist? ""Based on my experience and others, institutional racism and Islamophobia is rife."" The mayor replied: ""That is the world. It's a racially-unequal world. ""There is no institution in this country that is free of institutional racism - and there never has been because they reflect wider society. ""There was no shocking moment when the council was found to be institutionally racist. ""It's in our economy, it's in our politics. It is rife."" Mr Rees said the 2017 Runnymede Report found Bristol was the seventh-worst city in which to be born black. ""We are a city of inequalities. We have led the city to a point where it faces up to that,"" he said. He added 150 people from underrepresented groups had taken part in the council's Stepping Up programme, aimed at improving leadership diversity, of which a ""very significant number"" had achieved promotions. Mr Rees said another scheme was aimed at helping Somali women while the authority's work on domestic violence and youth violence targeted specific communities."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-47453711,Top Labour activist defends suspended MP,An MP called on Labour to look into the behaviour of a senior party figure that issued a defence of a suspended MP.,5 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has called on his party's general secretary to look into the behaviour of a senior Welsh party figure. Darren Williams issued a statement on behalf of the Welsh Labour Grassroots pro-Corbyn group defending suspended Labour MP Chris Williamson. The Derby North MP said Labour had been ""too-apologetic"" over anti-Semitism. A WLG spokesman said Mr Williams had not made a public statement on the matter. Mr Williams - a staunch supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford - emailed the statement to colleagues earlier this week. Derby North's Mr Williamson was suspended from the party, pending an investigation, after the remarks came to light. The MP said he regretted the comments. Welsh Labour Grassroots (WLG) - the Welsh version of the pro-Corbyn Momentum faction of Labour - said his comments were ""surely well within the scope of legitimate debate"" and that Mr Williamson's suspension was ""unfair and unnecessary"". Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock sought advice from Jennie Formby on whether there are grounds for disciplinary action against the group's secretary ""because political interference in political disputes is not allowed."" Welsh Government Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Labour Grassroots stance was ""staggering"". In the statement, the group said there was ""no justification for suspending Chris Williamson"". It called for his suspension ""to be ended and the whip restored"". Mr Williamson's comments had been misinterpreted by Labour politicians and the media, the WLG claimed. Rather than suggesting that Labour has apologised too readily to people in the Jewish community, WLG said Mr Williamson was ""seeking to argue that Labour politicians have often been too quick to accept questionable claims about the scale of the problem"". ""WLG remains implacably opposed to anti-Semitism, along with all other forms of racism, such as Islamophobia, and bigotry and prejudice of any kind,"" the statement said, saying the group offered ""unconditional solidarity to all those who encounter such hatred"". All cases of anti-Semitic abuse should continue to be dealt with through the party's procedures, WLG said. But the public discussion on the issue ""often militates against the kind of frank and serious discussion needed to develop effective solutions"", the statement added. In response, several Welsh Labour MPs expressed concerns over the role of Mr Williams, who is a representative on Labour's ruling body the National Executive Committee (NEC) as well as the Welsh Executive Committee (WEC).  The MPs said it was worrying that such a senior figure in the party is commentating on a live investigation, and think distributing material critical of an ongoing investigation is incompatible with his role on the NEC.  Senior Welsh Labour sources believe Darren Williams should consider his position on the NEC and WEC, with one suggesting he has abused his position on both bodies. It is understood that the statement was agreed by the 28 members of the WLG steering committee and he sent it to members in his role as the group secretary.  Labour's General Secretary Jennie Formby has warned constituency parties, the NEC and other Labour Party bodies that disciplinary cases against individuals are confidential and should not be discussed.  Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor, said the WLG statement would appear to contravene this instruction.  In response, a WLG spokesman said the statement had been a collective one which had been unanimously agreed by the steering committee, and said Mr Williams had made no public statement about the issue. Welsh Labour Grassroots supported Mark Drakeford's bid to become Welsh Labour leader in last year's leadership contest, while the group has consistently supported Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. A Welsh Labour spokesman said: ""As the First Minister of Wales and the leader of Welsh Labour Mark Drakeford has said on many occasions, there is no place for anti-Semitism in Welsh Labour or in Wales."""

The book, Welcome to the Woke Trials, had been due to be published by Little, Brown in April. But Burchill got embroiled with a row with fellow writer Ash Sarkar. Little, Brown said her comments were ""not defensible from a moral or intellectual standpoint"" and ""crossed a line with regard to race and religion"". A statement from the company said: ""We will no longer be publishing Julie Burchill's book. This is not a decision we have taken lightly.  ""We believe passionately in freedom of speech at Little, Brown and we have always published authors with controversial or challenging perspectives - and we will continue to do so. ""While there is no legal definition of hate speech in the UK, we believe that Julie's comments on Islam are not defensible from a moral or intellectual standpoint, that they crossed a line with regard to race and religion, and that her book has now become inextricably linked with those views."" Writing on Facebook, Burchill said the publishers had told her there was ""also a concern that the line might be crossed again during the promotion of the book"", to which she added: ""I'LL SAY!"" Sarkar accused Burchill of Islamophobia after the Sunday Telegraph columnist made comments about the age of one of the Prophet Muhammad's wives. According to Little, Brown's official description, Welcome to the Woke Trials was inspired by the ""vitriolic reaction"" Burchill received in response to an article she wrote for The Observer in 2013, after which she was ""pursued by the outrage mob"". The publisher billed it as ""part-memoir and part-indictment of what happened to Burchill between then and now, as the regiments of the woke took over""."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56325254,French teen admits lying about murdered teacher,The student admits she was not in class when Samuel Paty showed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.,9 Mar 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A French schoolgirl has admitted to spreading false claims about a teacher before he was murdered last year. Samuel Paty was beheaded in October after showing students cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The girl, whose complaints sparked an online campaign against Paty, has now admitted that she was not in the class. Mr Paty's killing stunned France and led to an outpouring of support at memorial ceremonies and marches around the country. The 13-year-old girl, who has not been officially named, originally told her father that Paty had asked Muslim students to leave the classroom while he showed the cartoon during a class on free speech and blasphemy. According to evidence given by the girl seen by French media she said: ""I didn't see the cartoons, it was a girl in my class who showed me them."" ""She lied because she felt trapped in a spiral because her classmates had asked her to be a spokesperson,"" her lawyer, Mbeko Tabula, told AFP news agency. The girl's father filed a legal complaint against the teacher and began a social media campaign over the incident based on his daughter's account. He identified Paty and the school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, west of Paris. Prosecutors said shortly after the killing that there was a ""direct causal link"" between the online incitement against Paty and his murder. The perpetrator, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack. It then emerged that the campaign against the history and geography teacher had been based on a distorted account of what had happened in class days earlier. As he had done in similar lessons on free speech in previous years, Paty warned students that he was about to show a depiction of Muhammad. He said anyone who thought they might be offended could close their eyes.  The girl had originally claimed the teacher had asked Muslim pupils to leave the room. When she objected she was suspended from school, she said. It now appears that the girl was suspended the day before the class was given, according to Le Parisien newspaper, because of repeated absence from school. The girl explains in her leaked testimony that she made up the story so as not to disappoint her father. He posted two videos on social media in response to the allegations. Speaking on French radio on Tuesday, the Paty family's lawyer said the girl's family knew that she had not been in class on the day in question and why she had been suspended. ""So to come and say now, sorry, I believed my daughter's lies, that's really weak,"" Virginie Le Roy told RTL radio. In a separate development, two university professors have been given police protection after they were accused of Islamophobia by student protesters.  An investigation has begun after posters were put up last week at Sciences Po university in Grenoble that read ""Fascists in our lecture halls, Islamophobia kills"", naming the two professors. Junior Interior Minister Marlène Schiappa said their lives were in danger and the campaign was reminiscent of the harassment of Samuel Paty. ""We can't tolerate this kind of thing,"" she said. After Paty's murder, President Emmanuel Macron presented the teacher's family with the nation's highest honour, the Légion d'honneur. Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are considered highly offensive by Muslims. The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet.  Twelve people were killed by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015 after the images were published. Both the Charlie Hebdo murders and Samuel Paty's beheading struck a deep chord in a country where secularism - or laïcité - is central to national identity. Under that principle, the state cannot intervene in matters of religion, and thus should not curb expression to protect the feelings of a particular community."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65650435,What's happening in Parliament this week?,MPs and peers gear up for a whole lot of haggling over new laws over the next few weeks.,19 May 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"There's going to be a whole lot of ping-pong going on in Parliament in the next few weeks.  The process of getting agreement between the two houses of Parliament on new laws is an exotic-sounding exercise, which involves bills bouncing between them until the final wording on critical details is agreed.  It may be hard for outside observers to follow - particularly because much of the real action is in behind-the-scenes talks between the parties - but it matters a lot.  This week's ping-pong involves the Retained EU Law Bill and the Strikes Bill, but there will be plenty more to come, when peers grind their way through some of the biggest draft laws before them, including the Illegal Migration Bill, the Levelling Up Bill, and the Online Safety Bill.   MPs are invited to accept or reject changes made in the Lords - sometimes rejection can be a flat ""no"".  Sometimes, the government majority in the Commons offers an ""amendment in lieu"" - a compromise proposal.  Peers then decide whether to take rejection of their amendments on the chin, accepting the will of the elected Commons, or to offer an alternative, usually watered down, version of their original change. There's no limit to how long this can go on; it tends to go to a couple of rounds, but where positions are entrenched, ping-pong can grind on for quite a while.  Grizzled veterans of the Commons still shudder at the memory of the seven rounds of ping-pong over the 2007 Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act - and there is no doubt that on the Strikes Bill, the Illegal Migration Bill and on retained EU law, positions are very entrenched. So this week's ping pong may just be Act One. It's been an odd little on-off interlude in Parliament, with MPs and peers breaking for Easter, then the Coronation, and, at the end of the coming week, for their Whitsun Recess.  They then have a decent run of unbroken legislating, with eight weeks from their return on 5 June to the start of the Summer Recess at the close of business on 26 July. Commons: (14:30 BST) Home Office Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements (a report-back on the G7 Summit by the prime minister?) following at 15:30. Main debate: Committee of the Whole House on the Non-Domestic Rating Bill. This introduces more frequent valuations for business rates - every three years rather than every five - and creates a new business rates improvement relief. That's followed by consideration of Lords amendments to the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill.  The government will be seeking to overturn four defeats in the Lords: on limiting the application of the bill to England only; on removing protections from unions that fail to take reasonable steps to ensure their members comply with work notices (peers took that bit out); on making failure to comply with a work notice a breach of contract and grounds for dismissal, and on requiring consultation before the government can specify minimum service levels to be maintained during industrial action.  Expect all of these to be bounced back to the Lords. Westminster Hall: (16:30) MPs debate two e-petitions on the cost of living for people with disabilities. The first calls for an energy grant to people with a disability or serious medical condition, on the argument that there are millions of people whose condition means they use a lot of energy, for example to power ventilators, wheelchairs, stair lifts or bath seats. The second argues that disabled people should be included alongside carers in the £650 one-off payment as part of the Cost of Living support package.  Lords: (14:30) A brief Third Reading rubber stamping of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill (expect the Lords amendments limiting the government's powers to revoke inherited EU law to be reversed in the Commons on Wednesday). Then peers resume their long march through the detail of the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill, with day 14 of its marathon Committee Stage. Commons: (11:30) Energy Security and Net Zero Questions. Ten-Minute Rule Bill: Conservative MP Anna Firth wants to require people in charge of dogs to take all reasonable steps to ensure that their dog doesn't fatally injure another dog. Main Debate: A Labour Opposition Day motion or motions, to be announced.  Westminster Hall: Former minister Kevin Foster has a debate on short-term holiday lets and the planning system (09:30). Committees: Health (10:00) quizzes minister Maria Caulfield on declining vaccination uptake. Treasury (10.15) has one of its regular sessions with Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, where they will examine the latest interest rate increase. Business and Trade (10:30) hear from representatives of the UK's car and electric vehicle battery manufacturing sector. Foreign Affairs (14:30) hears evidence of the possibility of war crime charges relating to the Ukraine war from Andriy Kostin, the country's prosecutor-general.  Lords: (14:30) Peers complete their consideration of the Northern Ireland (Interim Arrangements) Bill, the latest measure to fill the gaps left by the lack of devolved government there. Then it's back to the detail of the Online Safety Bill - with the eighth of 10 Committee Stage days. Commons: (11:30) Wales Questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time. Ten-Minute Rule Bill: Conservative Gareth Johnson wants courts to be able to ban disruptive passengers from flying.  Main Debate: Consideration of Lords amendments to the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill - the law to reprocess or revoke laws inherited from the UK's 40 year membership. The government will be seeking to reverse four Lords defeats: two involved the creation of a committee of MPs and peers to refer major changes for debate; another is about allowing Parliament and the devolved legislatures to prevent the automatic revocation of retained EU rights, powers and liabilities and to require that environmental protections and food standards must not be reduced. The Commons would normally deal with Lords amendments at quite a brisk pace - suggesting there may be room for some late addition to the agenda.  Westminster Hall: Labour MP Fleur Anderson, whose Putney constituency is directly under the flightpath, leads a debate on the future of Heathrow Airport (16:30).  Committees: Science, Innovation and Technology (09:30) look at the Metropolitan Police's use of live facial recognition technology, during the Coronation, and potential future AI-based tools. Transport (09:30) questions Rail Minister Huw Merriman on how the Strikes Bill applies to rail services. Human Rights (15:00) holds a one-off session on the legal status of assisted dying in the UK and elsewhere, and how the human rights legal framework applies.  Lords: (15:00) Another day, another bill facing a long committee stage. This time it's the Illegal Migration Bill and this is day one of five. Commons: (09:30) Environment Food and Rural Affair Questions, and Questions to the Attorney General, followed by the weekly update on the forthcoming Commons agenda from the Leader of the House. Main Debate: Backbench debate on recognition of the 1930s Great Famine in Ukraine, known as the Holodomor, when millions of Ukrainians died during the forced collectivisation of farms by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. That's followed by a general debate on tackling Islamophobia.  Committees: Public Accounts (09:30) questions the main players in the administration and eventual acquisition by Octopus Energy of Bulb Energy - the largest of the many UK energy supplier collapses as the energy crisis took hold in 2021, with the taxpayer and bill payers on the hook for the £3 billion costs of the process.  Lords: (11:00) Online Safety Bill - day nine of committee stage. Neither House sits on Friday 26 May - and with Parliament taking its Whitsun Recess, MPs and peers will not return until Monday 5 June."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55095956,Court reduces sentence of Quebec City mosque shooter,"Alexandre Bissonnette will be eligible for parole after 25 years, down from 40 years.",27 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Canadian court has reduced the sentence of the man behind a 2017 shooting at a Quebec City mosque. Alexandre Bissonnette was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences last year for killing six people and seriously injuring five others. Quebec's highest court struck down the consecutive sentences, calling it ""cruel and unusual"". The appeal court's ruling means he will be eligible for parole in 25 years, instead of 40. Bissonnette turns 31 this week. In January 2017, he stormed into the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre and shot at those gathered for prayers. The attack shook the nation, and raised questions about Islamophobia in Quebec as well as in other parts of the country. He pleaded guilty to the attack. ""I am ashamed of what I did,"" Bissonnette told a Quebec courtroom at the time. ""I am not a terrorist, I am not an Islamophobe."" In Canada, a life sentence allows for parole eligibility after 25 years.  In 2011, the law was amended to allow judges to impose consecutive sentences instead of concurrent, for multiple murders. That means that judges could extend the period before parole eligibility beyond 25 years. Consecutive sentences have only been applied a handful of times in Canada since the law was amended, including a judge handing down a 75-year prison sentence for a man who pleaded guilty to killing three police officers in 2014. Thursday's ruling could have widespread repercussions. In a unanimous and sharply written decision, the Quebec court found they violated the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically the sections that protect the life and security of a person and against ""cruel and unusual"" punishment.  The justices wrote that the possibility of sentencing someone to a prison term longer than their life span was ""absurd."" ""This nonsense cannot survive and constitutes, in itself, cruel and unusual punishment, degrading because of its absurd nature,"" they wrote.  The ruling only has jurisdiction in Quebec, but if it were to be appealed and go to the country's supreme court, the sentencing issue could find a national stage."

Our investigation found it possible to target users who had shown an interest in keywords including ""transphobic"", ""white supremacists"" and ""anti-gay"". Twitter allows ads to be directed at users who have posted about or searched for specific topics. But the firm has now said it is sorry for failing to exclude discriminatory terms. Anti-hate charities had raised concerns that the US tech company's advertising platform could have been used to spread intolerance. Like many social media companies, Twitter creates detailed profiles of its users by collecting data on the things they post, like, watch and share. Advertisers can take advantage of this by using its tools to select their campaign audience from a list of characteristics, for example ""parents of teenagers"", or ""amateur photographers"". They can also control who sees their message by using keywords. Twitter gives the advertiser an estimate for how many users are likely to qualify as a result. For example, a car website wanting to reach people using the term ""petrolhead"" would be told that the potential audience is between 140,000 and 172,000 people. Twitter's keywords were supposed to be restricted.  But our tests showed that it was possible to advertise to people using the term ""neo-Nazi"".  The ad tool had indicated that in the UK, this would target a potential audience of 67,000 to 81,000 people.  Other more offensive terms were also an option. We created a generic advert from an anonymous Twitter account, saying ""Happy New Year"".  We then targeted three different audiences based on sensitive keywords. Twitter's website said that ads on its platform would be reviewed prior to being launched, and the BBC's ad initially went into a ""pending"" state.  But soon afterwards, it was approved and ran for a few hours until we stopped it.  In that time, 37 users saw the post and two of them clicked on a link attached, which directed them to a news article about memes. Running the ad cost £3.84. Targeting an advert using other problematic keywords seemed to be just as easy to do.  A campaign using the keywords ""islamophobes"", ""islamaphobia"", ""islamophobic"" and '#islamophobic' had a potential to reach 92,900 to 114,000 Twitter users, according to Twitter's tool. Advertising to vulnerable groups was also possible.  We ran the same advert to an audience of 13 to 24-year-olds using the keywords ""anorexic"", ""bulimic"", ""anorexia"" and ""bulimia"".  Twitter estimated the target audience amounted to 20,000 people. The post was seen by 255 users, and 14 people clicked on the link before we stopped it. Hope Not Hate, an anti-extremism charity, said it feared that Twitter's ads could become a propaganda tool for the far-right. ""I can see this being used to promote engagement and deepen the conviction of individuals who have indicated some or partial agreement with intolerant causes or ideas,"" said Patrik Hermansson, its social media researcher. The eating disorder charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care added that it believed the ad tool had already been abused. ""I've been talking about my eating disorder on social media for a few years now and been targeted many times with adverts based on dietary supplements, weight loss supplements, spinal corrective surgery,"" said Daniel Magson, the organisation's chairman. ""It's quite triggering for me, and I'm campaigning to get it stopped through Parliament. So, it's great news that Twitter has now acted."" The social network said it had policies in place to avoid the abuse of keyword targeting, but acknowledged they had not been applied correctly. ""[Our] preventative measures include banning certain sensitive or discriminatory terms, which we update on a continuous basis,"" it said in a statement. ""In this instance, some of these terms were permitted for targeting purposes. This was an error. ""We're very sorry this happened and as soon as we were made aware of the issue, we rectified it.  ""We continue to enforce our ads policies, including restricting the promotion of content in a wide range of areas, including inappropriate content targeting minors."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51709197,Tory members suspended over Islamophobia claims,A report by Hope not Hate appears to show anti-Muslim online comments made by Tory members.,2 Mar 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservative Party has suspended a number of its members following allegations of Islamophobia. A dossier compiled by the campaign group Hope Not Hate appears to show anti-Muslim online comments made by Tory members, including six councillors. It lists more than 20 names, but it is understood not all belong to the party. The Tories say they have suspended all of those who were party members, pending investigation. But the Conservatives have not confirmed how many members have been suspended. The Conservatives launched an inquiry into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party at the end of last year - following repeated calls for it to do so. It came after incidents had been highlighted to the party and in the media. In Hope Not Hate's dossier, an online post allegedly from an ex-councillor says: ""Moslems do not deserve 'Human rights' as we understand them, partly because of their animal-like behaviour."" Another online post from a council candidate suggested that it was ""not a bad thing"" if Muslims left the UK. Hope Not Hate said it was calling on the Conservative Party to ""take immediate action"" against the individuals and it will ""continue to demand that they take proper steps to tackle the Islamophobia crisis that has gripped the party at every level"". The group's campaigns director, Matthew McGregor, said the Tories ""need to take much more seriously its obligation to Muslim members, and to the wider community"". ""That means tougher sanctions, and more transparency about its processes and decisions,"" he added. In response, a Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""All those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation. ""The swift action we take on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of any kind is testament to the seriousness with which we take such issues."" In September last year, a number of Conservative Party members were suspended for posting or endorsing Islamophobic material online after the BBC highlighted more than 20 new cases. And in November last year, another group of party members were suspended over claims of Islamophobic social media posts."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44619976,Trump says travel ban ruling 'tremendous',"The president says his policy is best for the US, arguing European countries have been ""over-run"".",27 Jun 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"US President Donald Trump has hailed a Supreme Court ruling upholding his travel ban which covers people from several Muslim-majority countries. Lower courts had deemed the ban unconstitutional, but the US top court reversed the decision in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. At a White House meeting to discuss Mr Trump's proposed border wall he lauded the decision as ""a tremendous success"". The court's reversal is viewed as a victory for the Trump administration. The ban prohibits most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. Mr Trump said the Supreme Court decision was a ""great victory"" for the nation and constitution. ""We have to be tough and we have to be safe and we have to be secure,"" the Republican president said in Tuesday's meeting with lawmakers.  ""The ruling shows that all the attacks from the media and the Democrat politicians were wrong, and they turned out to be very wrong,"" he added. He added: ""If you look at the European Union, they're meeting right now to toughen up their immigration policies because they've been over-run, they've been over-run. ""And frankly, a lot of those countries are not the same places anymore."" The travel ban, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect in December, has been widely criticised by refugee and human rights groups. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion, which said the travel ban was ""squarely within the scope of Presidential authority"". He also rejected arguments that the ban discriminated against Muslims.  ""The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,"" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ""The text says nothing about religion."" Shortly after the Supreme Court released its decision, President Donald Trump shared the news from his Twitter account. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the dissenting opinion, which argues the court failed to uphold the religious liberty guaranteed by the first amendment of the US constitution. ""It leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States' because the policy now masquerades behind a facade of national-security concerns,"" Justice Sotomayor wrote. The dissent also states that ""a reasonable observer would conclude that [the ban] was motivated by anti-Muslim animus"". The travel ban has been in place since December, when the Supreme Court ruled that it could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.  The ban prevents most immigrants, refugees and visa holders from five Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - as well as North Korea and Venezuela from entering the US.  But the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela were not part of the legal challenge.  The ban allows for waivers on a case-by-case basis, but applicants who cannot afford an attorney to go through the waiver process will likely be unable to immigrate to the US, immigration advocates say.  Justice Stephen Breyer noted in his dissenting opinion that the State Department reported that only two waivers were approved out of 6,555 applicants during the first month of the travel ban. The high court has been issuing a number of decisions this week, including a ruling against a California law that required clinics to inform women of the availability of abortions paid for by the state.  The Court ruled that the law violated the free speech rights of Christian facilities. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News - at the scene Despite the controversial nature of Donald Trump's travel ban, there were more abortion rights activists outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday morning than immigration protesters.  Perhaps it's because abortion has been a contentious legal battle for decades, while the president's travel directive had been in effect, and out of the headlines, for months.  Attention in recent weeks has been on migrants coming across the southern US border, not visitors and prospective residents from countries like Libya, Iran, Yemen and Syria.  Nevertheless, this marks a significant victory for Mr Trump - and for presidential power to set immigration policy in general - albeit by the narrowest of margins.  The five court justices said they took the president's order on its face, and separated it from his more bombastic anti-Muslim comments made on the presidential campaign trail and via Twitter. The travel ban was implemented haphazardly at the start of the Trump administration and faced repeated setbacks from the US legal system. In the end, however, the president got his way - or at least enough of his way to claim success.  The third time turned out to be the charm. The White House issued a statement saying the ruling was ""a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution"". ""In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country."" Immigration lawyer Cyrus Mehta told the BBC that the majority opinion ""gave in to President Trump's hate and bigotry and will be viewed as a blemish"". He added that Congress could overrule the decision ""so that a future president will not have a blank cheque to block the entire people of a nation - from babies to grandmothers - out of hate, fear or bigotry. That is our only hope for redemption as a nation"". Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the decision was ""critical to ensuring the continued authority of President Trump - and all future presidents - to protect the American people"". Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrant Rights Project called the ruling one of the court's ""great failures"". ""We must make it crystal clear to our elected representatives: If you are not taking action to rescind and dismantle Trump's Muslim ban, you are not upholding this country's most basic principles of freedom and equality."" Mr Trump's ban has seen several iterations. Iraq and Chad were banned in previous versions. Iraq was removed for having ""a close co-operative relationship with the US"" and Chad for having ""sufficiently improved its practices"". The administration said that the ban was the result of carefully considering national security interests, but critics argued it was fulfilling his campaign promise for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". The state of Hawaii had challenged the ban and a federal judge blocked its implementation. Critics have noted that major attacks such as the 9/11 New York attacks, the Boston marathon bombing and the Orlando nightclub attack were carried out by people from countries not on the list, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kyrgyzstan, or by US-born attackers."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40710165,Richard Dawkins in US Islamophobia row,"A California radio station accuses the celebrated biologist of ""abusive speech against Islam"".",24 Jul 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has denied Islamophobia after a US radio station cancelled his forthcoming speech. The best-selling author had been due to address an event hosted by KPFA Radio in Berkeley, California, in August. Organisers accused him of ""abusive speech against Islam"" when scrapping his appearance, an allegation he denied. He called on the station to review his past remarks and apologise. In a letter to ticket-holders, the publicly funded radio station wrote: ""We had booked this event based entirely on his excellent new book on science, when we didn't know he had offended and hurt - in his tweets and other comments on Islam, so many people."" The station, which is not affiliated with the University of California, said in a letter - which Mr Dawkins published online - that it does not support ""hurtful"" or ""abusive speech"". It also apologised ""for not having had broader knowledge of Dawkins views much earlier"". Local media report that Bay Area residents had brought attention to statements made by the author of the anti-religion book The God Delusion, including a 2013 tweet saying ""Islam is the greatest force for evil in the world today"". In an open letter to organisers, Professor Dawkins wrote that he ""never used abusive speech against Islam"". He said harsh statements he has made in the past have been directed at ""IslamISM"" - apparently referring to those who use the religion for political objectives - and not adherents of the faith. ""I have criticised the appalling misogyny and homophobia of Islam, I have criticised the murdering of apostates for no crime other than their disbelief,"" Professor Dawkins writes. He also pointed out that he has been a ""frequent critic of Christianity but have never been de-platformed for that"". He describes listening to KPFA ""almost every day"" during the two years he lived in Berkeley, adding that ""I especially admired your habit of always quoting sources"". ""You conspicuously did not quote a source when accusing me of 'abusive speech'.  ""Why didn't you check your facts - or at least have the common courtesy to alert me - before summarily cancelling my event?"" Professor Dawkins' book about the study of evolution, The Selfish Gene, was named last week by the Royal Society as the most inspiring science book of all time. Known as the home of the Free Speech moment in the 1960s, Berkeley has recently left that reputation in doubt as far-left protesters have sought to silence speakers and academics with whom they disagree. Conservative authors Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos have each clashed with the University of California after events where they were due to speak were cancelled by the college administration out of fear for public safety."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-40476923,Anti-attack bollards turned into 'boll-art',"Melbourne installed grey barriers to prevent vehicle threats, but some locals decided to add colour.",4 Jul 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"When authorities in Melbourne installed concrete blocks hoping to prevent vehicle-based attacks, some observers noted they looked a bit dull. So locals in the Australian city began adding colour, covering the bollards with bright fabrics and paint. The effort, given the name ""boll-art"" on social media, even appears to have won over authorities. ""It's really just a response to these massive concrete blocks,"" one bollard decorator, David Gray, told the BBC. ""Melbourne is very drab right now and I have heard a lot of people say, 'that just made me smile'."" The grey barricades have been appearing in more and more locations around Melbourne. The security measures were approved after six people died when a man drove a car into pedestrians in Bourke St in the city centre in January. Last month, after the London Bridge attack, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said there was ""no time to be wasted"" in installing the bollards. ""We were not going to wait around for six months or 12 months while plant boxes are built so they look better,"" he said.  ""The threat of terror, the threat of hostile vehicle attacks, the threats to public safety are all too real."" Mr Gray, who describes himself as a ""lapsed artist"", said he was not making light of any tragedies. ""I have consciously not gone to Bourke St because I believe that is a sacred site - even six months on, it is too raw,"" he said.  Rather, he said he had been motivated by passersby complaining about the bollards' appearance, and concern they could turn into advertising space. Using his mother's sewing machine, the 54-year-old stitched together colourful patterns and placed them outside Southern Cross railway station. Some of the art has been removed, but the City of Melbourne tweeted: ""We're not removing art from the bollards"". On Tuesday, Mr Andrews described the artwork as ""great"". Melbourne Lord Mayor Robert Doyle tweeted that it was an example of when ""good things happen"". The barriers will ultimately be replaced by permanent bollards, but authorities have not said when that will happen."

The party said it will conduct an investigation into historical social media comments made by Sahar Al-Faifi. Ms Al-Faifi appeared in Plaid Cymru's party political broadcast for the general election, which aired on BBC Wales, ITV Wales and S4C on Thursday.  The party said it will not tolerate anti-Semitism or racism ""in any form"". Ms Al-Faifa has been asked to comment on the posts, which were deleted some time ago. In the broadcast, she said: ""Activists, it's us,"" in a reference to Plaid's slogan for the election campaign: ""Wales, it's us."" Since the party election broadcast, Sahar Al-Faifi has been accused on social media of making anti-Semitic Facebook and Twitter comments between 2012 and 2014. Plaid Cymru said: ""We have taken immediate action to suspend the person in question. We will investigate all allegations.  ""Plaid Cymru will not tolerate anti-Semitism, racism or intolerance in any form. That includes the appalling abuse the individual has been subject to. It is not a part of the Wales we want to build."" She has also appeared on broadcasts for BBC Wales discussing her faith. On Thursday, Plaid Cymru posted a picture on Twitter of Ms Al-Faifi, who wears a face-veil or niqab, to promote the party election broadcast later that evening.  Plaid Cymru sent a tweet saying the post received ""abusive Islamophobic responses"" that are ""unacceptable and will not be tolerated."" The party's tweet continued: ""We stand with Sahar and all Muslim people in Wales and beyond. ""Wales is rich in its diversity. We are all Welsh citizens. We are all equal."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54972389,Minority voters who changed their minds about Trump,"Joe Biden won the election, but support for Donald Trump increased among black and Latino voters. Why?",22 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Despite his election defeat, President Donald Trump can boast a success that has intrigued pollsters - he was more popular with ethnic minority voters than in 2016. Some might find this surprising given that his critics so accused him of racism and Islamophobia. Trump denies the charges and has accused Democrats of taking African Americans voters for granted. The Republican president gained six percentage points among black men, and five percentage points among Hispanic women. It means some voters changed their minds, after either not voting or voting for another candidate in 2016.  But it tells us something about Trump's unique appeal.  ""I was definitely more liberal growing up - my grandmother was big in the civil rights movement here in Texas during the 60s, and I grew up with that ideology."" Mateo Mokarzel, 40, is a graduate student from Houston, Texas and is of mixed heritage, Mexican and Lebanese. He didn't vote in 2016, and he isn't loyal to either major party - but this time around he decided to cast his vote for the Republicans.  ""The first time Trump ran I really wasn't convinced. I just thought, here's this celebrity talk-show host guy that wants to run for president, I didn't take him seriously - so I was not a Trump supporter the first time he ran. To be honest, I thought he was a ringer for Hillary, so I just wasn't interested,"" he tells BBC News. But Mokarzel says his upbringing in Texas influenced his view of both political parties. ""People forget that Texas used to be a blue [pro-Democrat] state,"" he says. ""The blue here wasn't like the ideological progressives that we think of now. They were more the old-school 'southern Democrats' - very racist, very intolerant. So, it was a totally different party, and I had experiences growing up of a lot of racism."" Mokarzel brushes off accusations of racism levelled at the president. Instead, he says he was attracted by Trump's isolationist foreign policy and economic policies. ""He really delivered on his anti-globalisation policy,"" he says. ""Neoliberal expansion has really hurt both Mexico and the US, and when you have family that live there, and you can see how it's hurt people living, their jobs, their wages, it really has increased the narco-war, and this is one of the things Trump came in saying - 'hey, we're going to tear apart these trade deals' - and then he actually did it. That was for me the first sign that he actually meant some of the things he was saying."" Mokarzel's wife Lily, a teacher, first-generation Mexican-American and also a Trump supporter, adds that she voted for him for economic reasons - ""our salaries have increased"" - and because she likes his ""genuine self"", despite colleagues and her union supporting Biden. ""The way I've been seeing him attacked, the lies,"" she says. ""I never used to vote, because I never felt my vote counted… And I feel like, since Trump has been in office our lives have improved.""  Elizabeth, 27, also changed her mind about the president over the course of his four years in office. She's a Mexican-American voter from Laredo, one of Texas's majority-Latino border cities in which Trump over-performed with voters this year. She didn't vote in 2016, and initially wasn't convinced by Trump. But when it came to casting her vote, she felt the Republican party best reflected her socially conservative, Catholic beliefs - particularly on abortion. Trump recently nominated anti-abortion judge Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, and said it was ""certainly possible"" they could revisit Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court case that legalised abortion nationwide in 1973. ""My family were all Democrats, it was a huge line of Democrats in my family - but this time I did see a difference,"" Elizabeth says. ""A lot of presidents make promises but they never keep them, including [former President Barack] Obama. With Trump, when he came into office he came in promising, and at first I was like, 'oh yeah more empty promises' - but then I started seeing the results… I do love that he's pro-life and pro-God, and for me that's very important."" In 2020 Latinos overtook the black community to become the largest minority voting bloc in the country - and are therefore a politically powerful group. But it is also diverse, made up of people from very different political and cultural backgrounds.  Even on issues such as immigration, on which President Trump has been notoriously hardline, the Latino community is less monolithic than some assume. A 2017 Gallup poll, for example, found that 67% of Hispanic people said they worried a great deal or a fair amount about illegal immigration - higher than the proportion of non-Hispanic whites (59%) who answered the same way. There was surprise on election night when it emerged that Miami-Dade County - the largest county in Florida - had lost a chunk of the Democratic support it had in 2016. Democratic analysts wondered whether the party had done enough to appeal to Cuban-Americans, who make up a large proportion of that county's voters. The Trump campaign's painting of Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris as socialists would have also been successful among Cuban-Americans and Venezuelan-Americans.  Cuban-American journalist Paola Ramos wrote in Vogue magazine: ""I come from a family of Cuban exiles and grew up around dinner tables that discussed the crumbling of Fidel Castro's regime - among family discussion that plotted the awaited return to an island that was overtaken by communism in the early '60s. Like many young Cuban Americans in Florida, we knew the meaning of Castro, socialismo, and comunismo before we even learned how to add or subtract."" The group that saw the biggest increase in support for Trump compared to 2016, however, was black men. The black community has long been seen as the most solidly Democratic voting bloc. This year was no different.  Sam Fulwood III - who this year conducted the Black Swing Voter Project, a survey - tells BBC News that the rise in support for Trump among black voters is ""more hype than reality"". ""No other demographic in US society voted for Joe Biden in higher numbers than black men, except black women,"" said Fulwood, who has been highly critical of Trump.  But although black voters tend to overwhelmingly vote Democrat, they are not a monolith. According to a Pew Research Center study from January 2020, a quarter of black Democrats identify as conservative, and 43% as moderate.  A 2018 Harvard-Harris poll also found that 85% of black Americans favour reducing legal immigration, more than any other demographic - 54% chose the strictest options available, allowing fewer than 250,000 immigrants per year, or even say they want to no new immigrants at all. In an article in the Los Angeles Times that same year, former diplomat Dave Seminara suggested this was because young black men in the US ""often compete with recent immigrants for low-skilled jobs"". In their recent book Steadfast Democrats, Ismail White and Chryl Laird suggested the reason black voters have so consistently voted Democrat in the past was not because of a unified ideology, but because of ""social pressure from other black voters"". Organisations such as Blexit, headed up by right-wing personality Candace Owens, gained increasing prominence too. And this year, several black celebrities appeared to voice their support for Trump, including rappers Curtis Jackson (aka ""50 Cent"") and Ice Cube - although 50 Cent later rowed back his endorsement, and Ice Cube, who had backed Trump's Platinum Plan, distanced himself from the president's actual campaign.  Black Entertainment Television (BET) founder Robert Johnson also voiced the frustration of black voters with the Democrats, when he told US broadcaster CNBC: ""I think black Americans are getting a little bit tired of delivering huge votes for the Democrats, and seeing minimal return in terms of economic wealth and closing the wealth gap, job creation and job opportunities. Joe Biden was not an inspiring candidate for many black Americans."" Fulwood tells BBC News that although most black voters he spoke to for the Black Swing Voters Project overwhelmingly believed President Trump was ""racist"" and ""incompetent"", they also admired how he ""shows strength and defies the establishment"". ""Because Americans are fiercely independent, they like strong leadership, and Trump projects the image of being a strong leader,"" he says.  The president seems to defy authority, he adds. ""I think that resonates with a great number of, particularly young, African-Americans, who already feel that the establishment is weighted against them. So his rhetoric taps into their antipathy. They don't like him, they don't like his policies, but they like the idea that he sticks it to the establishment."" Stephanie Muravchik, author of a new book entitled Trump's Democrats, also suggests President Trump's appeal to some voters was down to his image as a ""boss politician"" - an old-style local bigwig who she says would be personally familiar with their town's residents. ""It's a culture where men are absolutely required to defend themselves against any kind of insult,"" she tells BBC News. ""Trump really intuitively understands that culture and adopts it as his own. He says things like, 'never show fear, it's all about strength' - when he got Covid and then recovered, he whipped off his mask. That may seem absurd and childish to some, but it reads differently in these communities."" The Covid-19 stimulus cheque sent to US citizens, with a letter personally signed by President Trump, was an example of so-called ""boss politics"" in action.  ""Trump really wanted to sign the cheques,"" she adds. ""As mine was automatically deposited, I got a letter from the US government signed by Trump, saying 'Hello Stephanie, I have given you this money, I'm looking out for you. Sincerely, Trump'. It was really absurd, but it was brilliant, because it was invoking that model of politician as protector."" But even with all of this in mind, are the racism accusations putting off minority voters? For Mateo Mokarzel, these claims have only strengthened his resolve to support Trump, and push back against what he calls ""media bias"". ""He has a strong nationalist stance, and they try to portray that as racist,"" Mokarzel says. ""Protecting your borders and building up your economy is something most Americans want. I don't see how that's racist or some kind of dog whistle."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-42049814,Pupils hijab questioning 'discriminatory',Campaigners condemn Ofsted decision to ask girls in primary schools why they wear the headcsarf.,20 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Muslim campaigners have condemned ""discriminatory"" plans for school inspectors to question girls who wear hijab in primary school.  Head of Ofsted Amanda Spielman said pupils would be asked why they wear the headscarf, which ""could be interpreted as sexualisation of young girls"". But some have asked why the pupils and not the schools will be challenged. Ofsted said the move was in line with its current practice of assessing whether a school promotes equality. The hijab is traditionally worn as a sign of modesty once a girl reaches puberty. Research by the National Secular Society in September suggested 59 of 142 Islamic schools, including 27 primary schools, in England have a uniform policy which states a head-covering is compulsory. ""The hijab in primary schools should be something that is dealt with via the schools uniform policy,"" said Sajda Mughal, head of JAN Trust, a charity working with BAME and Muslim women. She called the move by Ofsted ""nonsense and discriminatory"" and said it will be used by extremists to advance their narrative of ""them and us'"" and could fuel marginalisation. ""I know as a Muslim mother of young girls, I'd be alarmed and horrified if I found that my daughters were questioned if they wore the hijab,"" she said. This was echoed by human rights campaigner Aisha Ali-Khan, who said the primary schools should be held to account ""rather than quizzing little girls"".  Oftsed should instead ask ""why are primary school uniform policies allowing hijab for girls under the age of puberty when Islamic laws state otherwise,"" she added. But Amina Lone, from the Social Action and Research Foundation, was one of those who lobbied Ofsted to take action. ""As a second generation Muslim woman and a parent, I have huge concerns about the increasing encroachment of gender inequality in public spaces for women of faith,"" she told the BBC's Asian Network.  ""The hijab is absolutely not required for children. ""Gender equality was hard fought for in this country and we shouldn't be diluting that.""  She said it was ""absurd"" to be having this debate in 2017 and stressed this was not about secondary school children or adults. There is no ban on Islamic dress in the UK, but schools are allowed to decide their own dress code. Current government advice states: ""Pupils have the right to manifest a religion or belief, but not necessarily at all times, places or in a particular manner."" Shereen, a hijabi, said the choice should be between the parents and the child.  The mother-of two, whose own daughters do not wear a hijab, said the headscarf has been misrepresented. ""It has nothing to do with sexualising children. That claim is ridiculous,"" she told the BBC Asian Network. Vlogger and mother, Nilly Dahlia agreed. She started wearing hijab aged 22.  ""Hijab is not about sexualisation. It is a sign of submission to our faith,"" she said. ""I do feel like the government are trying to control Muslims."" But blogger Hifsa Haroon-Iqbal said the issue was simply a school uniform one.  ""If schools do not want young children in primary education to wear hijabs in school, this needs to be made explicitly clear within the school uniform policy.  ""This is not about racism, being islamophobic or discriminatory. It is common sense,"" the mother-of-three wrote. ""To subject a young child to questioning about why they are dressed in a particular way is ludicrous as it will always warrant the same response, 'because my mother dresses me'."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-63699881,Racism furore reignites scrutiny of Australian media,"High-profile Aboriginal presenter Stan Grant left Australian TV this week, citing ""relentless"" abuse.",24 May 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"After a prestigious career of more than three decades, trailblazing Aboriginal journalist Stan Grant hosted his final show on Monday and walked away from Australian TV screens indefinitely.  ""Racism is a crime. Racism is violence. And I have had enough,"" Grant wrote in a column last week explaining his decision.  The Wiradjuri man made history in 1992 when he became the first Aboriginal presenter on prime-time commercial TV in Australia. He went on to win a slew of awards in Australian media, and was an international correspondent for CNN and Al Jazeera before returning home to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).  The ABC describes him as one of Australia's most respected and awarded journalists.  But on Monday night he looked defeated, visibly shaking as he signed off from his political panel show Q+A.  ""To those who have abused me and my family, I would just say - if your aim was to hurt me, well, you've succeeded,"" he said.  Grant's decision to leave has reignited fierce conversations about racism and media diversity in Australia.  ""If one of the few Indigenous presenters on television with a career that took him all over the world can't be protected from racism... what will that mean for anyone who walks down a similar path?"" ABC journalist Ryma Tchier wrote on Twitter.  Australia's Indigenous people have over 60,000 years of history, and half of Australians were either born overseas or have a parent who was. But the media representing such a multicultural population remains disproportionately white.  A 2022 study found more than three quarters of the reporters or presenters on Australian TV were from an Anglo-Celtic cultural background. The difference was even more pronounced at the leadership and board level.  The Media Diversity Australia report prompted the five TV networks examined to acknowledge their lack of diversity. But the channels also questioned the report's findings, criticising how it had determined cultural background, and criticising the short, two-week research window of the study. Several pointed out they had increased diversity in other areas of their output or tried to increase representation through targeted roles and recruitment.  But the broader issue has long been a problem in Australian media, and critics cite it for contributing to high-profile controversies. In 2019, a newspaper was widely accused of using racist tropes in a cartoon depiction of Serena Williams - the image was ultimately deemed acceptable by media regulators. And in 2020, Australia's most watched breakfast show, Channel Seven's Sunrise, settled a racial discrimination case over an all-white panel where a pundit suggested Aboriginal children should be forcibly removed from their families.  The Seven Network initially defended the segment, which sparked protests outside their studio, saying ""editorial opinions… are a vital part of journalism"", but later apologised for causing offence after the broadcast regulator found they had breached industry standards. A prestigious media award - the Kennedys - was also criticised in 2021 for not having a single person of colour on the 60-person judging panel.  The cultural diversity in Australia's media industry is shocking compared to many other Western countries, says Antoinette Lattouf, who in 2011 became one of the first Arab-Australian women to be a commercial television reporter.   As a result, she says, many Australian communities' stories go untold and vital perspectives are missed.  ""Each nation has their own challenges… [but] anybody who has… seen BBC, CNN, ITV, even broadcasters in New Zealand, will note they're far more diverse than our screens,"" says Lattouf, who co-founded the Media Diversity Australia group to improve the situation.  Culturally diverse journalists say they face more barriers to entering the Australian media industry than their peers.  But cases like Stan Grant's expose the problem outlets have in retaining them when they do make it.  Former ABC reporter Rhianna Patrick says the reason she joined the industry was the same reason she left it.  ""I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a journalist… because I recognised that the only time I ever saw people from my community reflected in the media was in a negative way,"" the Torres Strait Islander tells the BBC.  She built an impressive career over two decades - first in Indigenous radio then at the ABC, where she came to headline her own, self-titled national radio show.  But Patrick was the only Indigenous person in her unit, sometimes her entire floor. The impact of that fact hit her all at once in 2020 as she watched the Black Lives Matter movement sweep the globe, including Australia.  ""All of these things I had buried… were starting to come to the surface and I realised… I just couldn't go back into a mainstream media space and do my job anymore,"" she said.  Non-white journalists have regularly reported racial abuse from audiences. In the wake of Grant's exit, even more disclosed experiences.   ""Maybe once a week, I get called a racial slur [or] I get told I'm not Australian … I've also thought about leaving because of racist abuse,"" said news presenter and comedian Michael Hing, who is Chinese-Australian.  He said he had also considered departing the ABC because ""all-white management teams are too often incapable of understanding"".   There is racism from peers too, Lattouf and Patrick recount.  ""If ever there were crimes committed by people of Middle Eastern backgrounds, people [in the newsroom] would say things like 'oh, what did your cousins get up to?'"" Lattouf says.  ""I've been told that 'I'm one of the good ones' from the Lebanese community - a backhanded compliment that suggests that the rest of my community isn't good.""  There's also the pressure that comes with often being the sole person from their community in a newsroom, and feeling disproportionately responsible for coverage of an issue or advocating for their people.  And covering topics such as police brutality, racism and violence can be feel personal and traumatic, they say. Patrick says she knows the work she did was important. ""But you also want to be able to have times when you can do stories about Indigenous excellence, about Indigenous joy.""   It all adds up. And so - like Grant - many culturally diverse journalists leave. When Grant announced his departure, he accused the ABC of an ""institutional failure"" to protect or defend him.  He said racism had been ""relentless"" throughout his career, but it reached a new level of intensity after he covered the King's Coronation for the ABC, when he spoke about the impact of colonisation on his people.  Grant said the ABC had invited him to be part of coverage specifically to offer that perspective, but when the backlash came, he was left to fend for himself. He also pointed out the role some conservative media outlets played in amplifying the outrage. In the days since his decision, there have been 'I Stand with Stan' protests, and the ABC has apologised and pledged to do better.  ""I'm incredibly sorry that he felt let down by our organisation... we will do all we can to make up for it,"" ABC News director Justin Stevens told a rally.  The ABC has promised to review how it deals with racism directed at staff. It follows other reviews it has had in recent years aimed at impoving diversity.  Some commentators hope the anger over Grant's exile could mark a turning point, but others are sceptical.  ""You go through these cycles of reckoning - reforms are introduced, you have a couple of new hires - but the actual underlying structures don't change that much,"" one Aboriginal reporter who didn't wish to be named told the BBC.  In his final speech on Monday, Grant said he had spent his career trying to represent his people with pride and love. ""I've just wanted to make us seen and I'm sorry that I can't do that for a little while,"" he said. ""I've had to learn that endurance is not always strength. Sometimes strength is knowing when to say stop. ""I am down right now. I am. But I'll get back up and you can come at me again. And I'll meet you with the love of my people."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49089209,Reports of racist abuse rise by 43%,"Reports of racist abuse in English football rose by 43% during the 2018-19 season and can be linked to Brexit, says anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.",24 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Manchester City and England forward Raheem Sterling frequently spoke out against racism last season The rise in reports of racist abuse in football can be linked to Brexit, Kick It Out chief Roisin Wood has claimed. Statistics gathered by the anti-discrimination charity showed reports of racism in English football rose by 43% - from 192 to 274 - last season. ""I think you can't not link them together,"" Wood told BBC Sport. ""We're seeing a lot of reports of 'go back to where you came from' which we haven't seen for a while which seems to be on the back of Brexit."" Factoring in all forms of discrimination, reports of abuse in professional and grassroots football increased by 32% to 422, up from 319 during 2017-18. A further 159 reports were received via social media. Reports of faith-based discrimination - including Islamophobia and anti-Semitism - rose by 75% from 36 to 63, a higher percentage than any other form of abuse during the period. It is the seventh consecutive year reported incidents of discrimination within football have increased, and the 581 total reports is more than double the figure from five years ago. ""If we're seeing a rise in hate crime, the Home Office is seeing a rise in hate crime and other bodies are seeing a rise in hate crime, it's linked because that's what is going on in society at the moment. If it's there, we'll see it in football,"" Wood added. ""In some of the cases we have seen, there is a real hatred there which we haven't maybe seen as much of in the past where it's really violent and very targeted, particularly on social media. ""Some of the social media reports we've seen you wouldn't want anyone to see. ""We're talking to people all the time that feel, post-Brexit, that 'maybe this country isn't for me'. ""[Politicians] have to take that responsibility very seriously, they are the leaders of the country and they need to set the tone. Society is reflected in football."" Responding to the figures, which also showed that reports of abuse in the professional game had increased by 46%, the Football Association said it had made ""huge strides"" in recent years to ensure English football is a ""diverse and inclusive"" game. This includes a new inclusion plan - 'In Pursuit of Progress' - which aims to ""create opportunities in football, both on and off the pitch, for people of all backgrounds"", as well as funding two extra grassroots officers, based at Kick It Out, who work directly with the County FA network. ""We strongly condemn all forms of discrimination and encourage all fans and participants who believe that they have been the subject of, or witness to, discriminatory abuse to report it through the appropriate channels: the FA, our County FA network or via our partners at Kick It Out,"" the FA's statement added. Kick It Out says the FA has not informed them of the outcome in 79% of the 109 discrimination cases reported in grassroots football - 40% of which were from under-18 football. Incidents of racism marred the 2018-19 season, with Raheem Sterling and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang among several players to face abuse. In December, Manchester City and England forward Sterling suffered alleged racist abuse from Chelsea fans during City's 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge, and followed that the next morning with an Instagram post in which he questioned newspapers' portrayal of black players and said it fed prejudice and aggressive behaviour. In March, Sterling was vocal in condemning the racist abuse received by England players during their 5-1 win in Montenegro as well as offering support to his younger team-mate Callum Hudson-Odoi. And in April he was quick to call out Leonardo Bonucci when the Juventus defender suggested that his team-mate Moise Kean was partly to blame for the racist abuse he received from Cagliari fans. He was presented with his Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award in the same month, with FWA chair Carrie Brown citing his public stance on racist abuse as being just as important as his exploits on the pitch. This video can not be played December 2018: Former Liverpool & England footballer John Barnes on racism in football Dan Roan, BBC sports editor Just over two weeks before the start of the new season, these figures serve as a stark warning to English football's authorities.  They know the game here cannot afford a repeat of the high-profile incidents that marred last year, especially with the government urging them to put tackling abuse ""at the top of their agenda"".  Six months ago the outgoing Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley criticised the sport for a lack of leadership and collaboration on the issue. So some will be encouraged by the measures announced today, including a review of FA sanctions and education, and a renewed attempt to improve football's dismal record on job opportunities in coaching and senior administrative roles for BAME candidates.  But others will look at the Â£800,000 total annual funding that Kick It Out has to rely on from the FA, Premier League, Football League and Professional Footballers' Association, and ask whether these bodies should be investing significantly more if such a wealthy sport is serious about making the game more inclusive.  December: Banana skin thrown on to the pitch during the north London derby at Emirates Stadium, after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored for Arsenal December: Raheem Sterling suffers alleged racial abuse during Manchester City's defeat at Chelsea. Sterling later says newspapers are helping to ""fuel racism"" by the ways in which they portray young black footballers March: Chelsea lodge a complaint with Uefa over racist abuse aimed at Callum Hudson-Odoi during Europa League last-16 second leg win at Dynamo Kiev March: England report racist abuse of players during their 5-1 win over Montenegro in Podgorica April: Juventus' 19-year-old Italian forward Moise Kean suffers racist abuse from the stands during a match at Cagliari - with team-mate Leonardo Bonucci's suggestion that Kean was partly to blame called ""laughable"" by Raheem Sterling April: Two incidents of alleged racist abuse, towards Derby winger Duane Holmes and Wigan defender Nathan Byrne, are reported in the Championship  April: Troy Deeney and Watford team-mates Adrian Mariappa and Christian Kabasele receive racist abuse on social media April: Ashley Young receives racist abuse online following Manchester United's Champions League defeat in Barcelona In April, the Professional Footballers' Association asked players to send them evidence of racist online abuse in order to demonstrate to governing bodies the severity of the issue. The PFA planned to show the posts to the sports minister and a number of football bodies at a meeting in May, while meetings with Twitter and Facebook were also requested after a number of high-profile incidents. Players were previously encouraged to boycott social media for 24 hours as part of the #Enough campaign. The release of Kick It Out's figures came as the FA, Premier League and EFL published a joint letter to sports minister Mims Davies, in which they outlined measures they are taking to tackle discrimination in football next season. This includes a review of how both clubs and the FA sanction discrimination, improved steward training, improved reporting methods and providing more opportunities for BAME people in coaching, refereeing, management and administrative positions. In a statement, an EFL spokesman said it is ""committed to working collectively to ensure football is a game for all"". ""While today's announcement suggests more work needs to be done, the results of our recent supporters survey demonstrates clubs are working hard to make football as inclusive as possible. The survey stated 86% of respondents believed their club offered a 'welcoming and inclusive matchday experience for all supporters."""

Mariama, 15, from Bristol, is a trustee of the charity Integrate UK, set up by young people in the city. It uses videos and workshops to raise awareness of radicalisation, female genital mutilation (FGM), sexual exploitation and Islamophobia. Mariama said it was ""amazing"" to win the Young Hero Award from the National Lottery. Integrate UK, which benefits from lottery funding, was founded in 2009 by a group of girls from Bristol. It now works across the UK providing workshops to schools, often using videos and other creative media. Mariama joined the charity, which tackles the topics of gender and racial inequality in particular, in 2018. Amaal Ali, project manager at Integrate UK, said: ""Mariama has been an amazing part of the charity and she is also part of the trustee team, which means she is taking direction of what Integrate UK does next and how it continues to support young people in Bristol and the UK."" Mariama said: ""I'm Gambian, so outside of Integrate and school things I'm part of an organisation called Senegambia Hidden Talent where we basically organise different events, fundraisers and educational trips. ""We've taken trips to the Houses of Parliament, the University of Bristol and Buckingham Palace."" In the future, Mariama said she wanted to be known as someone who kept speaking out on issues. ""I want to be known as that person who is confident enough to speak for everybody,"" she said. ""You can always be that one person to make a change."" She said she was ""proud"" of her work with Integrate UK and hoped the award would inspire other young people to ""make the world a better place"". ""This National Lottery Award is a real testament to the extraordinary work that Integrate UK does and it feels amazing to receive this recognition,"" she said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-59246434,MPs may face votes to remain Labour election picks,"The two MPs are at risk of facing ballots that could see them deselected, the BBC understands.",11 Nov 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Two Coventry MPs could face battles with their own party to remain Labour candidates at the next general election. The BBC understands Taiwo Owatemi and Zarah Sultana are at risk of facing votes that could see them deselected. Party members in their constituencies are organising to try to meet the required threshold to trigger a vote. Labour's National Executive Committee signed off the rules around candidate selection this week. Local parties can force a full selection process if a majority of local party and affiliate branches vote to trigger a contest. It comes as the party gears up for a general election - possibly as soon as 2023. Some constituency Labour Party (CLP) members in Coventry were left deeply unhappy at the candidate selection process during the 2019 snap general election. There were claims it was a ""stitch-up"" and suggested the national Labour Party had imposed candidates loyal to then leader Jeremy Corbyn in the two Coventry seats left vacant by the retirements of long-serving MPs Geoffrey Robinson and Jim Cunningham. No local councillors were on the party's shortlists in Coventry South, where Zarah Sultana is the MP, and Coventry North West, Taiwo Owatemi's constituency. Some members claim the election results were an indicator that Coventry voters were also unhappy with the choices of Labour candidates as they held on to the two seats by a whisker. In 2017 Coventry North West had a Labour majority of 8,580 and Coventry South had a Labour winning margin of 7,947 - but in 2019 that fell to 208 in Coventry North West and 400 in Coventry South.  However, those drops came on an election night that saw Labour's share of the vote nationally drop from 40% to 32% and the party lose 60 seats. Some senior members of the CLP in Coventry South have also grown increasingly frustrated at Ms Sultana's habit of speaking out against the party leadership and causing controversy, such as when she was pictured with anti-police banners at a rally recently, something she later apologised for. Local organisers have told the BBC the original plan was to try to force trigger ballots - votes to decide if they should remain as the party's candidate - as soon as December, but that could now be pushed back after a by-election was called in North Shropshire for 16 December. Four local councillors have been named locally as possible challengers to the incumbent MPs, Earlsdon councillors Becky Gittins and Antony Tucker, Jim O'Boyle, the cabinet member for jobs and regeneration at Coventry City Council, and Kindy Sandhu, the authority's cabinet member for education.  All four failed to rule themselves out when approached by the BBC. Ms Sultana has yet to comment on the selection process, but Ms Owatemi said: ""I have loved being the Labour Member of Parliament for Coventry North West for nearly two years now.  ""Standing up for my constituents both in our city and in Westminster is a real privilege and a role I take incredibly seriously."" She added she would ""very much like to continue in my role"" and ""restand as the Labour parliamentary candidate at the next general election"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-51150517,Journalist attacked because of his sexuality,A judge rules Guardian columnist Owen Jones was targeted due to his sexuality and political views.,18 Jan 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man launched an unprovoked attack on Guardian columnist Owen Jones because of his sexuality and political views, a judge has ruled. James Healy, 40, admitted assaulting Mr Jones by The Lexington pub in Islington last year but claimed it was because the 35-year-old had spilled his drink. However, Mr Jones said he ""absolutely did not"" spill the drink. At the end of a two-day hearing, the judge ruled the attack could only have been due to his media profile. Recorder Judge Anne Studd QC said Healy, of Portsmouth, would have had ""plenty of opportunity to remonstrate"" with Mr Jones in the pub if he had spilled the drink but made no attempt to do so. ""This was a deliberate and targeted attack on Mr Jones personally,"" she said. Following Healy's arrest, a search of his home revealed a photograph of him performing a Nazi salute. The court heard the photo showed him as a teenager but had been printed out in 2015. Healy, who has admitted affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, faced a trial of issue to determine his motivation for attacking Mr Jones. In her ruling Judge Studd said that while it could not be proven Healy had been performing a Nazi salute in the photograph, she was ""sure that [Healy] holds particular beliefs that are normally associated with the far right wing"". ""I therefore propose to sentence Mr Healy on the basis that this was a wholly unprovoked attack on Mr Jones by reason of his widely published left-wing and LGBTQ beliefs by a man who has demonstrable right-wing sympathies,"" she said. Mr Jones suffered cuts and swelling to his back and head and bruises all down his body in the assault which happened on his birthday night out on 17 August. In his evidence at Snaresbrook Crown Court, the journalist said: ""I'm an unapologetic socialist, I'm an anti-racist, I'm an anti-fascist and I've consistently used my profile to advocate left-wing causes."" Mr Jones has almost one million Twitter followers, 125,000 followers on Instagram and 350,000 followers on Facebook. ""What I use these platforms for is to advocate left-wing ideas and a passion and unwavering commitment to opposing racism, fascism, Islamophobia and homophobia,"" he told the court. ""Almost every single day I am the subject of an unrelenting campaign [of abuse] by far-right sympathisers. ""They've come to see me as this hate figure in their ranks."" Mr Jones said he received death threats on a daily basis, adding: ""It's the combination of being left-wing, gay, anti-fascist - that's everything the far right hate."" Describing the evening of the attack, Mr Jones said: ""My recollection is that I was saying goodbye to a friend and then I was on the floor completely disoriented. ""In those 10 seconds, I don't really remember what happened because I was attacked from behind, I had no sense of what was going to happen."" When asked about the claim he had knocked Mr Healy's drink, he said: ""That absolutely did not happen. ""If I thought I had accidentally spilled someone's drink, I would apologise profusely, I would say, 'I'm so sorry' and I would insist - whether they liked it or not - on buying them another drink."" The court heard Healy has a string of convictions for football violence and is currently subject to a football banning order for encroaching on a pitch. He also allegedly had a football hooligan flag adorned with SS symbols and a collection of pin badges linked to white supremacist groups. Healy told the court: ""I'm a hoarder. I never throw anything away. I just had them all that time tucked away in the back of a drawer. ""Bearing in mind they came into my possession in 1998, there was no internet back then, the information now is easily available. ""As far as I knew, they were connected to football and football violence."" A date has yet to be set for Healy's sentencing."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40658243,US senator defends attacked Muslim rival,Jeff Flake expresses his support for a Democratic challenger after she is abused online.,19 Jul 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has come to defend a woman who wants to unseat him after she received hateful messages about her Muslim religion.  Democratic candidate Deedra Abboud, 45, came under attack after she posted a campaign message on Facebook with an image of the US Constitution. The post prompted an onslaught of cyberbullying, including comments about Ms Abboud's religion. Mr Flake, 54, expressed his support for Ms Abboud on Twitter. ""Hang in there @deedra2018. Sorry you have to put up with this. Lots of wonderful people across AZ. You'll find them,"" he tweeted on Tuesday. The senator also posted a link to an op-ed in The Arizona Republic calling out the online attack on Ms Abboud, which came after she posted a message about separation of church and state.  ""Almost 250 years ago a group of dreamers came together and sketched out a revolutionary vision. No longer would they be shackled to the whims of a distant government, nor bound to the religion of an idiosyncratic king. They set out to forge their own futures, determine their own destinies, and follow their own faith,"" she wrote.  ""In their infinite wisdom, the Founding Fathers decreed that this nation would separate church and state, and in doing so protect both institutions. Government would be free from religious overreach, and religion would be free from government interference."" Facebook users began flooding her page with comments saying there was ""no room for Muslims in our government. Nice try though you are quoting the Muslim brotherhood"". Another user wrote: ""Nice try but your first love is Satan (AKA Allah) and your second love is to a litter box your 'people' come from. You are as American as Chinese checkers."" ""BAN ISLAM IN THE USA…WE HATE YOUR FILTHY DEATH CULT,"" another Facebook user said. Ms Abboud, a Phoenix-based lawyer, thanked Mr Flake for his response.  ""Thank you @JeffFlake for leadership in rejecting behavior that doesn't reflect our American values. AZ's amazing people deserve more than this"", she tweeted.  Ms Abboud, a native of Little Rock, Arkansas, is running for Mr Flake's seat in the August 2018 Democrat primary. If she wins, she would challenge Mr Flake in the general election that autumn. Mr Flake has come to the defence of Muslims in Arizona before.  In the wake of President Donald Trump's executive order in January, which targeted seven Muslim-majority countries, the Republican said in a Medium post the White House was right to be concerned about national security, but that it was ""unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry"". ""Enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims,"" wrote Mr Flake, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees.  He also attended a service at a Scottsdale mosque in December 2015 to show his support amid harsh, anti-Muslim rhetoric from then-Republican presidential candidate, Mr Trump.  ""My hope and prayer today is that isolated voices calling for division are overwhelmed by the chorus of voices in this room today calling for acceptance, tolerance and inclusion,"" he said at the time."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50552068,Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour,"Ephraim Mirvis urges voters to consider Labour's ""inadequate"" response to anti-Semitism allegations.",26 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The chief rabbi has strongly criticised Labour, claiming the party is not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism - and asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the general election.  In the Times, Ephraim Mirvis said ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in the party. Labour's claim it had investigated all cases of anti-Semitism in its ranks was a ""mendacious fiction"", he added. But Jeremy Corbyn said the party had taken ""rapid and effective"" action.  At the launch of the party's ""race and faith manifesto"", the Labour leader said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"" and would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government.  He said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism cases were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Rabbi Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street.  Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.  A number of prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party after being the subject of anti-Semitic abuse on social media while others have accused Mr Corbyn of personally endorsing anti-Semitic tropes and imagery.  In his article, the Orthodox chief rabbi of Great Britain and Northern Ireland - who is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, the largest umbrella group of Jewish communities in the country - says raising his concerns ""ranks among the most painful moments I have experienced since taking office"". But he claims ""the overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety"" at the prospect of a Labour victory in 12 December's general election. He writes: ""The way in which the leadership of the Labour Party has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people.  ""It has left many decent Labour members and parliamentarians, both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired."" He adds that it was ""not my place to tell any person how they should vote"" but he urged the public to ""vote with their conscience"".  The chief rabbi claimed the response of Labour's leadership to threats against parliamentarians, members and staff has been ""utterly inadequate"" and said it ""can no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism"". Mike Katz, the chair of the Jewish Labour Movement group which is officially affiliated to the party, said the chief rabbi was ""absolutely right"" and there had been a failure of leadership over anti-Semitism in Labour. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the chief rabbi's ""unprecedented"" intervention ""ought to alert us to the deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews"". In a statement, he said everyone should be able to ""live in accordance with their beliefs and freely express their culture and faith"". The Labour peer Lord Dubs, the child refugee campaigner who fled Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in the 1930s, said he regretted some of the language Mr Corbyn had used in the past about Israel and the fact he had met with groups who denied its right to exist.  But he told BBC Radio 4's Today these episodes were ""quite a long time ago"" and had to be seen ""in the context"" of Mr Corbyn's support for peace in the Middle East.  ""I think things have happened under his leadership which should have been stopped way back,"" he added. ""I believe the Labour party is moving forward. It is not good enough what has happened in the past."" This is a sweeping and unequivocal condemnation of Labour's leadership, its treatment of Jewish parliamentarians and its handling of allegations of anti-Semitism.   It's also highly unusual for such an intervention by the leader of a religious denomination during a general election campaign. The chief rabbi has pastoral oversight for a large proportion of people who identify as Jewish in the United Kingdom. Last week, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York appealed to voters and politicians to ""honour the truth"" and ""challenge falsehoods"" but there was no specific criticism of individual candidates nor their party leaders. But the chief rabbi's article asks if Jeremy Corbyn is fit for high office and calls on voters to consider what the result of this election ""will say about the moral compass of this country?"" Last year, three Jewish newspapers, - The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish News and The Jewish Telegraph - published exactly the same front cover on 25 July - arguing that a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn would prove ""an existential threat"" to British Jewry. The chief rabbi, in this highly critical column, is saying much the same. The Labour leader faced criticism from Jewish groups when he said in last week's general election ITV leader's debate that the party had ""investigated every single case"" raised by complainants. The chief rabbi takes issue with Mr Corbyn's claim, citing figures from the Jewish Labour Movement of ""at least 130 outstanding cases"". At an event in Tottenham, north London, the Labour leader did not directly address the number of outstanding cases but defended the party's disciplinary processes as being ""rapid and effective"". ""Anti-Semitism in any form is vile and wrong, it is an evil within our society,"" he said.  ""There is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism in any shape or form or in any place whatsoever in modern and Britain and under a Labour government it will not be tolerated in any form whatsoever."" He added: ""In government our door will be open to all faith leaders. Chief Rabbi welcome. Archbishop of Canterbury welcome. Those from the Hindu community are all very welcome."" South-African born Rabbi Mirvis became chief rabbi in 2013. In a Facebook post in July, he congratulated Boris Johnson on his election as Conservative leader, describing the new prime minister as a ""long-standing friend and champion of the Jewish community"". According to the British Board of Deputies, there are between 260,000 and 300,000 Jews in England and Wales. Around half belong to the Central Orthodox denomination which includes the United Synagogue, led by the chief rabbi.  Measures to combat anti-Semitism were among a number of policies unveiled by the party, including: The Muslim Council of Britain, which has repeatedly criticised the Conservatives for failing to address anti-Muslim prejudice amongst their members, said not enough was being done to tackle racism ""whether from the left or the right"".  It said British Muslims would ""agree on the importance of voting with their conscience""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55132098,Muslims under pressure to sign French values charter,"A ""charter of values"" is the latest effort by the French state to win Muslim hearts and minds.",1 Dec 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"France's Muslim Council is due to meet President Emmanuel Macron this week, to confirm the text of a new ""charter of republican values"" for imams in the country to sign. The Council (CFCM), which represents nine separate Muslim associations, has reportedly been asked to include in the text recognition of France's republican values, rejection of Islam as a political movement and a ban on foreign influence. ""We do not all agree on what this charter of values is, and what it will contain,"" said Chems-Eddine Hafiz, vice-president of the CFCM and Rector of the Paris Grand Mosque.  But, he said, ""we are at a historic turning point for Islam in France [and] we Muslims are facing our responsibilities"". Eight years ago, he said, he thought very differently. The Islamist Mohamed Merah had just carried out attacks in Toulouse.  ""[Former French] President Sarkozy got me out of bed at 5am to talk about it,"" he remembers. ""I told him: 'His name may be Mohamed, but he's a criminal!'  I didn't want to make the connection between that crime and my religion. Today, I do. The imams of France have work to do."" The plan is for the CFCM to create a register of imams in France, each of whom would sign up to the Charter, in return for accreditation. President Macron spoke in October about putting ""immense pressure"" on Muslim authorities.  But this is difficult territory in a country that cherishes state secularism.  Mr Macron is trying to stop the spread of political Islam, without being seen as interfering in religious practice, or singling out one particular faith. Integrating all groups of Muslims into French society has become a pressing political issue in recent years. France has an estimated five million Muslims - Europe's largest Muslim minority. Olivier Roy, an expert in French Islam, says the Charter raises two problems. One is discrimination because it targets only Muslim preachers, and the other is the right to freedom of religion. ""You are obliged to accept the laws of the state,"" he told me, ""but you are not required to celebrate its values. You cannot discriminate against LGBT, for example, but the Catholic Church is not obliged to accept same-sex marriage."" Fashion designer Iman Mestaoui receives regular abuse from those she calls the ""haters"" - hardline Islamists who say her brand of scarves and turbans does not always cover a woman's hair enough. But, she says, the idea of getting imams to sign up to ""French values"" is a problem, when Muslims are already seen by many as not fully French. ""It's putting us in a strange place where you have to show people that you subscribe to the republican values; where you feel French, but they don't feel you are,"" she explained. ""We feel like nothing we do - pay taxes, do [national service] - will be enough.  You have to prove that you're really French: you have to eat pork; drink wine; not wear hijab, wear miniskirts. And it's ridiculous."" But Hassen Chalghoumi, imam of the Drancy mosque on the outskirts of Paris, says that after years of terrorist attacks, the government has been forced to act.  Mr Chalghoumi is now in hiding, following a spike in death threats over his reformist views. ""We have to go the extra mile, to show that we are well-integrated, that we respect the law,"" he told me. ""This is the price we have to pay because of the extremists."" Outside the Paris Grand Mosque, Charki Dennai arrives for prayers, his rolled-up mat and Koran tucked under his arm. ""These young [extremist] people are time bombs,"" he says.  ""I think the imams are a bit too nice to them.  We can respect French law and also Islam, it's feasible. That's what I do."" But there are questions over how much influence imams have among younger Muslims, especially when it comes to extremist violence. ""It won't work,"" says Olivier Roy, ""for a very simple reason: the terrorists don't come from Salafi mosques. If you take the biographies of terrorists, none of them is a product of Salafi preaching."" Salafism is a hardline, ultra-conservative movement identified with political Islam. The charter is one part of a wider government strategy to curb foreign influence, prevent violence and threats from extremists, and win back young people who feel forgotten by the state. Mr Macron has proposed more Arabic-language teaching in state schools and more investment in run-down areas, and has emphasised that he is targeting Islamists who reject France's laws and values, not Muslims as a whole. Hakim El-Karoui is a specialist in French Islamist movements at the Institut Montaigne who regularly contributes to government thinking. ""I'm a real fan of the strategy,"" he told me. ""It's comprehensive.  It's cultural, and also about organisation and funding."" But, he says, Muslims themselves should be included by the government in projects like this, ""because they can do a lot in terms of spreading the enlightened version of Islam on social networks - the government is not able to"". And without the buy-in of ""grassroots Muslims"", says Olivier Roy, the new Charter will be hard to enforce. ""Let's suppose that the local Muslim community decides to ignore the CFCM and appoints its own imam,"" he told me. ""What will the government do?  Either we change the constitution and give up the concept of freedom of religion [or] the government cannot impose certified imams on local Muslim communities."" In a Paris studio, shooting pictures for her new catalogue, Iman Mestaoui tells me she made her whole family vote for President Macron in 2017. Since then, she has noticed a ""huge shift"" to the right on issues like immigration and security.   ""I was pro-Macron,"" she said. ""He was a real hope in our community, but we feel like we've been abandoned."""

Joyce McCarty faced a probe into claims she made in a text message of a ""Muslim plot"", which ousted her ally and former leader Nick Forbes. Ms McCarty, who was re-elected in May, will sit as an independent. Newcastle Labour Party says it condemns ""any act of hate crime"" and will ""call out any such behaviour when seen"". It said: ""Joyce McCarty has been found guilty through investigation of Islamophobia and is suspended from the Labour Party with immediate effect."" Ms McCarty declined to comment when contacted by the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Labour indicated that the 12-month suspension includes the four already served since her initial suspension in March. ""The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken,"" a spokesman added. In a text message seen by LDRS and first reported by JOE, Ms McCarty said she was aware of a ""specific Muslim plot"" organised by councillors in Newcastle's West End to remove the leader and get more black, Asian, and minority ethnic candidates selected. Despite being suspended in March, she remained on local election ballot papers for Labour in May and was re-elected in her Wingrove ward with an overwhelming majority. She was first elected to the city council in 1994 and was deputy leader from 2011 to 2021. The veteran councillor also sat on the local authority's cabinet with responsibilities for issues including support for refugees and asylum seekers. In February, Mr Forbes was defeated in the contest for his Arthur's Hill ward when Labour members voted by 13 to four in favour of Abdul Samad. Mr Forbes has alleged an ambush by left-wing members and claimed the contest was ""clearly manipulated"", but has since stepped away from city politics.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50588623,Decisive moments in UK election campaign,Was this the week when it became clear Boris Johnson's Conservatives were likely to win the election?,30 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Was this the week people will look back on as when it became clear Boris Johnson and the Conservatives were likely to win the general election?  I say this because this election was always going to be decided by three big issues. So how does all the above fit in with what's been happening in the campaign these last few days?      To take the Leave versus Remain vote first, the key moment was the launch of the Conservative Party's manifesto - what it's promising if it wins the election.   With its familiar title ""Get Brexit Done"", it was an unashamed pitch to Leave voters furious the UK hasn't left the EU yet, and undoubtedly to other voters just sick of the whole Brexit stalemate/mess/morass.     Crucially for the Conservatives, as the rest of their manifesto was largely a steady-as-she-goes approach in all other policy areas, ""Get Brexit Done"" was just about the only message that stood out.   One imagines that is exactly what the party's campaign managers were hoping for - as, no doubt, was the relatively limited journalistic and political scrutiny there has since been as to exactly what ""Get Brexit Done"" means, and the extent to which relations with the EU are in fact likely to dominate UK politics for the foreseeable future.  But if the launch of the Conservative Party was a unifying moment for Leave voters, the opposite has been true for the forces of Remain and/or a second EU referendum.  Despite the endorsement of several high-profile Conservatives, the biggest out-and-out anti-Brexit party nationally, the Liberal Democrats, have really been struggling. Opinion polling suggests the party and its leader, Jo Swinson, are failing to gain traction, with many party insiders now thinking it was perhaps a massive mistake to make their main policy to just stop Brexit rather than to hold a second referendum.  Why? Because it looks rather undemocratic.   More broadly it's becoming clear the Conservatives are benefiting from the failure or unwillingness of all the political parties who either oppose Brexit altogether - or at least Mr Johnson's vision of it - to form some broad electoral pact against him.  Indeed, that may come to be the big story of this election for historians wondering why Remain politicians were unable to block Brexit, given that most polls now show opinion has shifted somewhat against leaving the EU. This election is less about who is the most popular leader and party and rather more about who is the least unpopular.   Opinion polls consistently suggest Jeremy Corbyn is the most unpopular leader of the Opposition since the question was first asked by pollsters in the 1970s. So an attack on the Labour leader from the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, accusing Mr Corbyn of allowing the poison of anti-Semitism to drip into the party was never going to help. Although it's true the Conservatives were also accused of racism this week - in their case Islamophobia - the allegations are seen, fairly or not, more as involving individual acts of crass behaviour rather than as being something somehow to do with the world view of their party or their leader.  Labour has also been struggling to make this election about the government's record rather than about Brexit or Mr Corbyn.    Polls do suggest the party has had some success in focusing voters' attention on the funding and quality of public services such as health and education. But just not enough.    The party's case has not been helped by Mr Corbyn's struggles to explain exactly how the government would fund its promised huge increase in the size of the state, without increasing taxes on ordinary people.  That emerged in the face of a hostile interviewer on the BBC, the well-known terror of politicians, Andrew Neil. It should be noted, in passing, that Mr Johnson has so far avoided the ordeal of being grilled by Mr Neil.  If, as the polls are suggesting, Mr Johnson is on his way to victory, it'll be thanks to a probably sometimes overlapping coalition of voters who either backed Leave in 2016 and/or think Mr Corbyn is dangerously leftwing.  Of course, it's worth remembering these are just polls, not real votes, and there are still two weeks to go. But as of now the Conservatives are surely the happiest of the main parties.    One last thought: this was supposed to be the Brexit election. In many ways, of course, it is in terms of which party can capitalise best on a deeply polarised country.  What the election hasn't really featured so far is a detailed discussion of either what Brexit will really look like or what would be the consequences of not going ahead with the UK leaving.  And that lack of debate may come back to haunt whoever ends up the winner.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50552068,Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour,"Ephraim Mirvis urges voters to consider Labour's ""inadequate"" response to anti-Semitism allegations.",26 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The chief rabbi has strongly criticised Labour, claiming the party is not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism - and asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the general election.  In the Times, Ephraim Mirvis said ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in the party. Labour's claim it had investigated all cases of anti-Semitism in its ranks was a ""mendacious fiction"", he added. But Jeremy Corbyn said the party had taken ""rapid and effective"" action.  At the launch of the party's ""race and faith manifesto"", the Labour leader said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"" and would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government.  He said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism cases were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Rabbi Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street.  Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.  A number of prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party after being the subject of anti-Semitic abuse on social media while others have accused Mr Corbyn of personally endorsing anti-Semitic tropes and imagery.  In his article, the Orthodox chief rabbi of Great Britain and Northern Ireland - who is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, the largest umbrella group of Jewish communities in the country - says raising his concerns ""ranks among the most painful moments I have experienced since taking office"". But he claims ""the overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety"" at the prospect of a Labour victory in 12 December's general election. He writes: ""The way in which the leadership of the Labour Party has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people.  ""It has left many decent Labour members and parliamentarians, both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired."" He adds that it was ""not my place to tell any person how they should vote"" but he urged the public to ""vote with their conscience"".  The chief rabbi claimed the response of Labour's leadership to threats against parliamentarians, members and staff has been ""utterly inadequate"" and said it ""can no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism"". Mike Katz, the chair of the Jewish Labour Movement group which is officially affiliated to the party, said the chief rabbi was ""absolutely right"" and there had been a failure of leadership over anti-Semitism in Labour. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the chief rabbi's ""unprecedented"" intervention ""ought to alert us to the deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews"". In a statement, he said everyone should be able to ""live in accordance with their beliefs and freely express their culture and faith"". The Labour peer Lord Dubs, the child refugee campaigner who fled Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in the 1930s, said he regretted some of the language Mr Corbyn had used in the past about Israel and the fact he had met with groups who denied its right to exist.  But he told BBC Radio 4's Today these episodes were ""quite a long time ago"" and had to be seen ""in the context"" of Mr Corbyn's support for peace in the Middle East.  ""I think things have happened under his leadership which should have been stopped way back,"" he added. ""I believe the Labour party is moving forward. It is not good enough what has happened in the past."" This is a sweeping and unequivocal condemnation of Labour's leadership, its treatment of Jewish parliamentarians and its handling of allegations of anti-Semitism.   It's also highly unusual for such an intervention by the leader of a religious denomination during a general election campaign. The chief rabbi has pastoral oversight for a large proportion of people who identify as Jewish in the United Kingdom. Last week, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York appealed to voters and politicians to ""honour the truth"" and ""challenge falsehoods"" but there was no specific criticism of individual candidates nor their party leaders. But the chief rabbi's article asks if Jeremy Corbyn is fit for high office and calls on voters to consider what the result of this election ""will say about the moral compass of this country?"" Last year, three Jewish newspapers, - The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish News and The Jewish Telegraph - published exactly the same front cover on 25 July - arguing that a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn would prove ""an existential threat"" to British Jewry. The chief rabbi, in this highly critical column, is saying much the same. The Labour leader faced criticism from Jewish groups when he said in last week's general election ITV leader's debate that the party had ""investigated every single case"" raised by complainants. The chief rabbi takes issue with Mr Corbyn's claim, citing figures from the Jewish Labour Movement of ""at least 130 outstanding cases"". At an event in Tottenham, north London, the Labour leader did not directly address the number of outstanding cases but defended the party's disciplinary processes as being ""rapid and effective"". ""Anti-Semitism in any form is vile and wrong, it is an evil within our society,"" he said.  ""There is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism in any shape or form or in any place whatsoever in modern and Britain and under a Labour government it will not be tolerated in any form whatsoever."" He added: ""In government our door will be open to all faith leaders. Chief Rabbi welcome. Archbishop of Canterbury welcome. Those from the Hindu community are all very welcome."" South-African born Rabbi Mirvis became chief rabbi in 2013. In a Facebook post in July, he congratulated Boris Johnson on his election as Conservative leader, describing the new prime minister as a ""long-standing friend and champion of the Jewish community"".

If Mr Corbyn became PM, the UK ""could end up with the first anti-Semitic leader of a Western nation since the Second World War"", Mr Hancock said. Labour called the health secretary's remarks a ""baseless political attack"". A number of Labour MPs have left the party in protest at what they say is its tolerance of anti-Semitism.  The Labour party has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism since mid-2016, with its leadership accused of tolerating a culture of anti-Jewish prejudice.  Mr Corbyn has insisted he is getting to grips with the issue and has beefed-up the party's internal disciplinary procedures. Mr Hancock made the remarks at an event held by the One Nation group of Conservative MPs.  Responding to his comments, a Labour source said they ""ring hollow from a minister in a party that has supported governments that actively promote anti-Semitic policies in Hungary and Poland and has spent the week wooing Trump, the man who refused to condemn neo-fascists in Charlottesville who chanted 'Jews will not replace us'"".  ""Numerous candidates in the Conservative leadership contest have been accused of racism, Islamophobia, homophobia and misogyny, one of whom may be the next prime minister"", the source added.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the comments were a ""disgrace"". Mr Hancock is not the first Tory leadership contender to highlight the issue, Dominic Raab recently saying that anti-Semitism in Labour was a ""stain on our country""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50416768,Lib Dems 'to protect worshippers from attacks',"The party promises tougher sentences for hate crimes, improved gender rights and less stop and search.",14 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Liberal Democrats have promised to protect places of worship from hate crimes and terror attacks if they win the general election.  The party is promising more funding for security - and also says it would bring in tougher sentences for hate crime. The Remain-supporting party has been criticised for running candidates against other pro-EU politicians. But Lib Dem health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said people wanting to stop Brexit ""have to back"" her party. The Conservatives say they want to ""get Brexit done"" by 31 January, while Labour is promising another referendum after the election, on a revised deal it hopes to reach with the EU. In other developments on Thursday: Home Office figures released last month showed a 10% rise in hate crimes - offences motivated by hostility towards someone's race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity - in England and Wales in 2018/19. The Liberal Democrats say they will turn all such crimes into ""aggravated offences"", meaning maximum sentences would rise. Currently, crimes committed for homophobic, disablist or transphobic reasons carry lower maximum jail times than those for aggravated by race or religion. By BBC Reality Check Hate crime statistics provide a breakdown of religiously motivated acts of criminal damage or arson, but these don't necessarily indicate whether they were on a place of worship.  These show that in 2018-19, there were roughly 850 reported cases of criminal damage - a rise from 570 five years ago.  Under 5% of these crimes resulted in someone being taken to court, lower than for other types of hate crime, such as assault.  The highest numbers of religious hate crimes are aimed at Muslims and Jews, who represent three-quarters of known victims.  Just under half of religious hate crime offences were targeted against Muslims in 2018/19, the Home Office said, and 18% were targeted against Jewish people. The Lib Dems are promising more funding for security at places of worship, schools and community centres ""vulnerable to hate crime and terror attacks"". The party says it wants ""complete data"" to be collected on the ethnicity of people going through the justice system, and an end to ""disproportionate"" use of stop-and-search powers by police on people from ethnic minorities. It is pledging to ensure ""equal marriage"" for all, including allowing the Church of England and the Church of Wales to carry out same-sex weddings. It wants to amend the Gender Recognition Act, so it no longer includes a requirement for medical reports to be submitted and recognises non-binary gender identities. Applicants for passports would be able to fill in an ""X gender option"" under its plans. Ms Berger said: ""Discrimination has no place in 21st century Britain. Unfortunately this is not the reality for too many in the UK."" She criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, for having ""inexcusably failed to root out anti-Semitism"" in the party and having ""betrayed the values of equality and anti-racism against all"". The Conservatives, Ms Berger added, were ""encouraging ugly nationalism"". Mr Corbyn has described anti-Semitism as a ""poison and and evil"", adding that his party has taken action to root it out. Earlier this week, the Conservatives expelled a number of members alleged to have posted Islamophobic content on social media, saying it would ""never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination"". The Lib Dems have entered a ""Remain alliance"" with the Green Party and Plaid Cymru in dozens of constituencies, meaning only the party with the best chance of a win will run in them. Ms Berger, who quit Labour earlier this year and joined the Lib Dems in September, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her old party had ""refused to engage"" in talks aimed at creating a wider anti-Brexit alliance. The Lib Dems are still contesting the seat of Canterbury, in Kent, despite their candidate quitting this week, saying he did not want to divide the Remain vote between himself and an anti-Brexit Labour rival. He has since been replaced. The Lib Dems are also fielding a candidate in South West Hertfordshire, where former Tory cabinet minister David Gauke - who was expelled from the Conservative parliamentary party after voting to block a no-deal Brexit - is running as an independent. Ms Berger said: ""I know and like David very, very much but, as I understand it, David would like a soft Brexit. People want a choice at this election."" For Labour, Mr Corbyn has said that, if he becomes prime minister, he would ""get Brexit sorted"" within six months, after getting a new deal with the EU and putting it to voters in a referendum. Conservative leader Boris Johnson says his agreement is ""oven-ready"" and can get through Parliament if he wins a majority at the election."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-50603395,'Faith is the number one thing influencing my vote',Some first-time voters feel they have to choose between religion and policy.,10 Dec 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Faith and politics.  Two things you've probably heard a fair bit about in this election period. From claims of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia within the biggest parties, to accusations that religion is influencing policies. ""Faith is deciding my vote,"" Josh Collins tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Josh is an 18-year-old student at the University of Nottingham - voting in his first election. He's Jewish and says he would like to vote for Labour, but can't because of what he calls, ""Labour's anti-Semitism crisis"". There are lots of Labour policies that impress Josh like their environmental commitments and pledge to end tuition fees. But he criticises Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for his handling of anti-Semitism, saying he's been too slow to stamp the problem out of the party. Labour are ""campaigning for him to get into Number 10, and as a Jewish person, I'd be genuinely scared if he got anywhere near the door"". ""I think, even though I don't want it to be, faith is the number one thing which is influencing my vote. I don't want a tolerance of abuse against religious minorities."" But not everyone shares the same fear. Alice Brostoff, 18, is also Jewish, but unlike Josh, will be voting for Labour. ""I feel like the Labour Party are the people that represent my views in a way I would want. No other party does that."" The issues which Alice feels passionate about include the NHS and austerity. She won't be voting for the Conservatives because she says they have ""handled Brexit really badly - though I don't believe there should be another [referendum on the EU]."" The University of Sheffield student thinks that anti-Semitism ""is a big thing"" but says ""it's not isolated to the Labour Party"". And she doesn't think faith will ever affect the way she votes, for her it's a political issue rather than anything to do with her identity. Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour party on several occasions and said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"". For Bilal Malik, a 24-year-old Muslim, faith ""will play a massive role"" in this election. He says he can't vote for the Conservatives because of their alleged issue with Islamophobia. Bilal says he's frustrated by the party's denial of the problem. ""Even within the Tories, there've been complaints in the past by legitimate Muslim voices, like Sayeeda Warsi. But the response to that has been so dismissive,"" he tells Newsbeat. He cites the Conservative leadership contest where candidates pledged to have an independent inquiry into Islamophobia - but nothing has yet materialised. The party says it will have an inquiry into all forms of prejudice and discrimination before the end of the year. ""It's that lack of willingness to take responsibility on Islamophobia that causes distrust of the Conservatives on the part of Muslims."" ""It's never been so bad,"" Bilal says. He feels comments made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past have encouraged people in society to be Islamophobic.  ""The lack of consequences for comments he's made speaks volumes. And because of the power he now holds in office, there is legitimacy in whatever he says."" He feels Islamophobia has an impact on his everyday life and now takes protective measures when using the tube, after hearing of incidents where Muslims have been targeted on train platforms. ""I don't get close to the yellow line until the doors fully open, just in case.""  ""It's worrying because you don't want to live in that kind of society."" Boris Johnson has apologised for the ""hurt and offence"" that has been caused by Islamophobia in the Tory Party. The chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, and the Muslim Council for Britain have both urged people to vote with their conscience, while emphasising it's not their place to tell people how to vote. Aaminah Saleem, 18, is Muslim, a member of the Conservatives and planning to vote for the party. She says it's been ""a struggle to put aside my feelings"", but ""religion and politics are separate right now"".  ""It's not hard for me to vote Conservative but at the back of my mind there are moral issues."" ""I'm trying to set them aside and focus on my local candidate; I'm sort of separating the national party from my local one."" The University of Birmingham student tells Newsbeat: ""I know we have a problem [with Islamophobia]. I think our two main parties have discrimination issues and the election has highlighted what a serious problem it is."" ""Both policies and my faith are very important, but for me, if I was to vote for Labour there would be moral problems as well.""  Aaminah says she's always felt welcome in the Conservatives. ""Most of my experience in the party has been positive, I've never felt my religion has disadvantaged me"". Aaminah, Josh and Bilal are all concerned by the parties' records when dealing with minority groups. Josh says the Conservatives record on Islamophobia will ""definitely impact"" his vote. Being able to live a normal life ""without fear of intimidation or abuse"" is his main priority.  ""I'd definitely put that above any issues like Brexit or climate change. I care about each party's record and how they deal with religious groups."" Bilal is unimpressed by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, saying both have major flaws. But other issues hold weight for him too. ""In an ideal world, you want leaders who are amazing and accepting. So alongside Islamophobia, things like education and the NHS will also play a role."" He says he'll most likely vote Labour as ""their vision resonates more with me than what the Conservatives are offering"". While Tory voter Aaminah wishes the issue of racism hadn't been ""politicised"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51112238,Twitter sorry for letting adverts target neo-Nazis,Social network apologises for allowing the use of discriminatory ad keywords it had meant to ban.,16 Jan 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Twitter has apologised for allowing adverts to be micro-targeted at certain users such as neo-Nazis, homophobes and other hate groups. The BBC discovered the issue and that prompted the tech firm to act. Our investigation found it possible to target users who had shown an interest in keywords including ""transphobic"", ""white supremacists"" and ""anti-gay"". Twitter allows ads to be directed at users who have posted about or searched for specific topics. But the firm has now said it is sorry for failing to exclude discriminatory terms. Anti-hate charities had raised concerns that the US tech company's advertising platform could have been used to spread intolerance. Like many social media companies, Twitter creates detailed profiles of its users by collecting data on the things they post, like, watch and share. Advertisers can take advantage of this by using its tools to select their campaign audience from a list of characteristics, for example ""parents of teenagers"", or ""amateur photographers"". They can also control who sees their message by using keywords. Twitter gives the advertiser an estimate for how many users are likely to qualify as a result. For example, a car website wanting to reach people using the term ""petrolhead"" would be told that the potential audience is between 140,000 and 172,000 people. Twitter's keywords were supposed to be restricted.  But our tests showed that it was possible to advertise to people using the term ""neo-Nazi"".  The ad tool had indicated that in the UK, this would target a potential audience of 67,000 to 81,000 people.  Other more offensive terms were also an option. We created a generic advert from an anonymous Twitter account, saying ""Happy New Year"".  We then targeted three different audiences based on sensitive keywords. Twitter's website said that ads on its platform would be reviewed prior to being launched, and the BBC's ad initially went into a ""pending"" state.  But soon afterwards, it was approved and ran for a few hours until we stopped it.  In that time, 37 users saw the post and two of them clicked on a link attached, which directed them to a news article about memes. Running the ad cost £3.84. Targeting an advert using other problematic keywords seemed to be just as easy to do.  A campaign using the keywords ""islamophobes"", ""islamaphobia"", ""islamophobic"" and '#islamophobic' had a potential to reach 92,900 to 114,000 Twitter users, according to Twitter's tool. Advertising to vulnerable groups was also possible.  We ran the same advert to an audience of 13 to 24-year-olds using the keywords ""anorexic"", ""bulimic"", ""anorexia"" and ""bulimia"".  Twitter estimated the target audience amounted to 20,000 people. The post was seen by 255 users, and 14 people clicked on the link before we stopped it. Hope Not Hate, an anti-extremism charity, said it feared that Twitter's ads could become a propaganda tool for the far-right. ""I can see this being used to promote engagement and deepen the conviction of individuals who have indicated some or partial agreement with intolerant causes or ideas,"" said Patrik Hermansson, its social media researcher. The eating disorder charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care added that it believed the ad tool had already been abused. ""I've been talking about my eating disorder on social media for a few years now and been targeted many times with adverts based on dietary supplements, weight loss supplements, spinal corrective surgery,"" said Daniel Magson, the organisation's chairman. ""It's quite triggering for me, and I'm campaigning to get it stopped through Parliament. So, it's great news that Twitter has now acted."" The social network said it had policies in place to avoid the abuse of keyword targeting, but acknowledged they had not been applied correctly. ""[Our] preventative measures include banning certain sensitive or discriminatory terms, which we update on a continuous basis,"" it said in a statement. ""In this instance, some of these terms were permitted for targeting purposes. This was an error. ""We're very sorry this happened and as soon as we were made aware of the issue, we rectified it.  ""We continue to enforce our ads policies, including restricting the promotion of content in a wide range of areas, including inappropriate content targeting minors."""

The Ricketts family, which is aiming to buy Chelsea, says it will meet fans to allay concerns about its potential ownership.   They are one of six groups who have made their bids for Chelsea public. The bidders are all waiting to hear if they have made a shortlist.  Fans have criticised the Ricketts family's ownership of the Chicago Cubs baseball franchise, as well as anti-Muslim comments made by the family's patriarch Joe Ricketts in 2019. Paul Canoville, Chelsea's first black footballer, said on social media, external: ""So I've seen and heard enough. I'm backing Chelsea Supporters' Trust and saying a big fat anti-racism NO to the Ricketts bid."" On Wednesday the Ricketts family issued a statement, which said: ""Our family rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms. Racism and Islamophobia have no place whatsoever in our society. We have developed deep and abiding partnerships with the Muslim community in Chicago, as well as with all communities of colour.  ""Respect for diversity and inclusion are central to our family's values. If we prevail in our bid for Chelsea, we commit to the club and to the fans that we will actively promote these values."" Brian Wolff, the head of Chelsea's Chicago official supporters group and a Cubs fan, has also urged those handling the sale to reject the Ricketts bid in favour of other options after he claimed it had been met with ""universal disdain"" by fans in the US and worldwide.   He questioned the political allegiances of the family and said other bids would ""commit to not only building upon the last two decades of investment in players and infrastructure but, equally important, the investment in supporters and the values which we hold dear.""  Centricus bid to buy club intends to 'maintain existing management' Chelsea set for full semi-final support after talks between FA and government Is this a moment of reckoning for English football ownership? Investment firm selling club expects sale could happen this month Multiple bids lodged to buy Premier League club Life after Abramovich - what's next for Chelsea and English football? However, sources close to the Ricketts family said Joe Ricketts would have no role or involvement in the bid for Chelsea, which is being headed up by his children Tom, Todd and Laura, who - unlike her Republican family - is a Democrat. The family took over at the Cubs in 2009 and led the team to a World Series win in 2016, their first in 108 years. The family also redeveloped the Cubs stadium, Wrigley Field, and the surrounding area, costing about Â£750m. It is understood the family want to speak to the Chelsea Supporters' Trust and Chelsea Pitch Owners, who hold the freehold to Stamford Bridge, and have already spoken with Chelsea and Fulham MP Greg Hands.  The CST is willing to meet any prospective owners and said on Monday it wants the government to ""discount any bid which is unwilling to issue a golden share to fans"".  That would mean special veto rights to block key decisions such as Chelsea moving stadium, changing its club colours or its badge. In a statement the CST added: ""We will continue to reaffirm that any new owner must share the inclusive views of Chelsea football club and our diverse support base.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43071847,Sarwar reveals blueprint to combat racism,The MSP has written to the first minister with proposals to tackle Islamophobia in Scotland.,15 Feb 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour MSP Anas Sarwar has written to the first minister outlining a series of proposals to tackle ""everyday racism and Islamophobia"" across Scotland.   Mr Sarwar wants the Scottish government to take action on black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) representation in the public sector workforce.   He also called for a review of the legal framework surrounding racist and Islamophobic abuse on social media. The Scottish government said it would consider the proposals. Mr Sarwar's letter to Nicola Sturgeon comes after he was allegedly subjected to racist comments by a Labour councillor. Mr Sarwar said the Labour group leader at South Lanarkshire Council told him he could not support Mr Sarwar's bid to lead Scottish Labour during last year's campaign to replace Kezia Dugdale as ""Scotland wouldn't vote for a brown Muslim Paki"". Scottish Labour later confirmed that councillor Davie McLachlan had been suspended by the party pending an investigation. Mr McLachlan has denied making the comments. Mr Sarwar recently launched a Cross Party Group (CPG) on tackling Islamophobia, supported by MSPs from every political party and over 50 organisations.   In his letter to Ms Sturgeon, he said his proposals were about ""challenging a culture that impacts on workplaces, colleges, university campuses and playgrounds across the country"". The Glasgow MSP called on the Scottish government to put in place a requirement for at least one BAME candidate - where at least one had applied - to be shortlisted for an interview for a public sector job. His proposals also include a regular audit of the diversity of Scotland's workforce, the ability for public sector workers to report abuse anonymously, and a programme of equality and diversity training to be rolled out across the public sector. On social media, Mr Sarwar called for a review ""to ensure that the correct legal framework exists for the police to take action and that the appropriate legal framework is then enforced appropriately and correctly"". And he said Police Scotland should also establish a formal relationship with the organisation Tell MAMA, which works on tackling anti-Muslim hatred.   Mr Sarwar, one of only four BAME MSPs to have sat at Holyrood, said: ""I want to repeat what I have said in every conversation, in every piece of communication, and in every media comment - this isn't about one individual or one party or organisation.   ""It's about challenging a culture that impacts on workplaces, colleges, university campuses and playgrounds across the country. ""What I have set out are steps that I believe the Scottish government should take to challenge the consequences of everyday racism and Islamophobia. ""This would demonstrate to the public how seriously we - as a parliament and a country - take this issue and help us to tackle this culture head-on.""   A Scottish government spokesman responded: ""As stated in parliament, the first minister is committed to working constructively with the proposed cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia. ""We will consider the points raised by Mr Sarwar when we receive the letter and reply to him in due course. ""Everyday racism, Islamophobia or any form of prejudice and bigotry is completely unacceptable, and it is wrong for MSPs, or anyone in our society, to be the subject or victim of it. ""We are resolved to do everything that it takes to ensure that Scotland is a place where there is zero tolerance of racism in any form."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-49143822,Payout after preacher's wrongful arrest,Footage of the street preacher's arrest has been viewed online almost three million times.,28 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Christian street preacher who had his Bible confiscated as he was handcuffed by police has been awarded £2,500 for wrongful arrest. Footage of the arrest of Oluwole Ilesanmi pleading with police to not ""take my Bible away"", has been viewed online almost three million times. He was detained outside Southgate Tube station in February after a 999 call claimed he had been Islamophobic. The Met said it had a right to investigate a potential hate crime. In a video posted online, Mr Ilesanmi, 64, is seen telling police: ""Jesus is on the way.""  An officer, who arrested him for breach of the peace, can be heard replying: ""I appreciate that but nobody wants to listen to that. They want you to go away.""  When Mr Ilesanmi tries to keep hold of his Bible, an officer says: ""You should've thought about that before being racist."" Mr Ilesanmi admits describing Islam as an ""aberration"" but said he was expressing his point of view as a Christian rather than denigrating Muslims. On Tuesday, Mr Ilesanmi will hand a petition to the Home Office, signed by 38,000 people, asking for greater protection for street preachers. Scotland Yard has since agreed to pay Mr Ilesanmi £2,500 for wrongful arrest and his humiliating and distressing treatment. Mr Ilesanmi said: ""I am glad that the police have recognised that it was not right to arrest me for preaching from the Bible.  ""It was traumatic being arrested. But I'm was determined to get back to Southgate and start preaching the gospel again."" Supt Neil Billany, of the force, said: ""The Met respects and upholds the rights of all individuals to practice freedom of speech, and this includes street preachers of all religions and backgrounds.  ""However, if the language someone uses is perceived as being a potential hate crime, it is only right that we investigate.  ""That is the role of the police, even if a decision is subsequently made that their actions are not criminal. In this case, it was deemed appropriate to remove the man from the area."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-40340803,'No British problem with Islamophobia',"In the wake of the Finsbury Park attack, UKIP's Neil Hamilton claimed there are no reliable hate crime figures.",20 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Britain does not have a problem with Islamophobia and there are no reliable statistics on hate crime, UKIP assembly group leader Neil Hamilton has said. Mr Hamilton said the majority of British people are ""tolerant and welcoming"". His comments come after the Finsbury Park terror attack in London. BBC Wales understands that the man suspected to have driven a van into Muslim worshippers on Monday is from Cardiff. Mr Hamilton also suggested that ""firm control"" of immigration would ""at least"" alleviate problems of fundamentalist terrorism. In February it was reported that all police forces in Wales saw hate crime rise in the first full three months following the EU referendum. Greater Manchester Police said there was a significant rise in hate crimes after a terror attack in the city in May.  Asked if Britain has a problem with Islamophobia, Mr Hamilton told a press conference: ""No I don't, actually. ""The overwhelming majority of the British people are tolerant and welcoming.  ""Inevitably there is a minority that is prepared to resort to violence and abuse. That's not acceptable."" He added: ""There are no reliable statistics on hate crime for example."" Mr Hamilton added: ""There isn't a general problem with Islamophobia in the United Kingdom or Wales"". Mr Hamilton opened the press conference by talking about a Senedd debate on immigration, to be held by the party on Wednesday. The debate calls for a ""controlled and fair immigration system"". ""For the last few years we've been adding a city the size of Cardiff to the population of the UK every single year,"" he said. ""That's undoubtedly had an impact upon the provision of public services in different parts of the UK"". Asked how to ensure rhetoric on immigration does not divide communities, Mr Hamilton said: ""We've seen now the results of years of ignoring the problem, deliberately suppressing discussion of the issue."" ""There are massive difficulties the country now faces as a result of this uncontrolled inflow,"" he said. ""The case of Salman Abedi is a case in point,"" Mr Hamilton said, referring to the perpetrator of the recent attack in Manchester. ""They came from Libya in 2008. We now know that family was known to have connections with Islamic fundamentalist groups in Libya. ""No system of immigration control is full-proof,"" he said. But he added: ""We have to get our border control system fit for purpose and we have to be more alert to the need to scrutinise the background of those who are coming here."" ""This is a composite problem, which goes way beyond the immigration problem"", he said. ""A firm control of immigration and in particular a proper appraisal of asylum seekers qualifications is an essential part - it will not solve the problem completely no doubt - but at least alleviating the problems of fundamentalist terrorism."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43920227,Labour expels activist over remarks to MP,Marc Wadsworth accused Ruth Smeeth at an anti-Semitism event of working with the media to hurt Labour.,27 Apr 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour has expelled an activist for bringing the party into disrepute after he criticised a Jewish MP at the launch of an anti-Semitism report. Marc Wadsworth accused Ruth Smeeth of working ""hand in hand"" with the media to undermine Labour. Labour's National Constitutional Committee found he breached the party's rules and should be thrown out.  Mrs Smeeth welcomed the result but Mr Wadsworth said he would see whether he could launch a legal challenge.  The announcement followed a high-profile disciplinary hearing in which Mrs Smeeth gave evidence against him.  Before Wednesday's hearing, Mr Wadsworth - an anti-racism campaigner and Momentum activist - suggested that he was being ""hung out to dry"".  Mrs Smeeth branded his comments, at the launch of the Chakrabarti report into anti-Semitism, ""vile conspiracy theories"" while a group of MPs who accompanied her to the hearing had demanded action.  A Labour spokesman said: ""The National Constitutional Committee of the Labour Party has found that two charges of a breach of the Labour Party's rule 2.1.8 by Marc Wadsworth have been proven."" ""The NCC consequently determined that the sanction for this breach of Labour Party rules will be expulsion from membership."" The MP thanked all those who had supported her throughout what she said had been a two-year ""ordeal"", saying there was no place for ""bullying and intimidation"" within the party. ""I am relieved that after nearly two years this matter has finally been resolved,"" she said.  ""I hope that this decision represents the first step towards a return to the values of decency and respect throughout the Labour Party."" The Jewish Labour Movement also welcomed the outcome, saying the case was ""symptomatic of the ongoing delays in resolving disciplinary matters"".  Mr Wadsworth said in a statement that he had been ""overwhelmed by the support I've received"" and intended to look at ""all my options to legally challenge the decision"". He added: ""I deplore anti-Semitism, anti-black racism, Islamophobia and all forms of prejudice, bigotry and discrimination that I have campaigned against all my political life and will continue to do so."" He later told reporters that Mr Corbyn, whom he described as an ""old friend and comrade"", had ""had a go"" at him after the incident and told him he could have used ""kinder language"". But he said Labour's leader had been supportive since then and had told mutual friends he ""doesn't see I did anything wrong"". He suggested a member of Mr Corbyn's team had contacted him on the morning of the hearing to say they were ""working behind the scenes"" on his behalf but would not say who this was.  The activist was supported by Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, who said he was ""astonished"" by the ""absurd"" decision to expel the activist. ""It flies in the face of the evidence presented and offends against the principles of natural justice,"" he said, in a statement on Facebook. ""The NCC's [National Constitutional Committee] decision has all the hallmarks of predetermination and tramples on Labour's record of standing up for fairness."" The MP for Derby North said he would help Mr Wadsworth in his efforts to ""clear his name"". But Labour MP Anna Turley, one of those who accompanied Mrs Smeeth to the hearing, said the decision was the right one as Labour should be in the ""vanguard of the fight against prejudice and hate""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40323769,Finsbury Park attack: What we know so far,One person has died and nine people were taken to hospital after a van was driven into people in north London.,20 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of terror offences after he drove a van into a group of worshippers close to a mosque in north London. One man, who had taken ill before the attack began, died and nine others were taken to hospital, some of whom were critically injured.  The terror attack happened shortly before 00:20 BST on Monday, 19 June, when the vehicle mounted the pavement outside Muslim Welfare House - which is also a community centre - on Seven Sisters Road. Here is what we know so far. A number of worshippers from Muslim Welfare House and nearby Finsbury Park Mosque were on the streets at the time, having just taken part in evening prayers after breaking the Ramadan fast.  A group were helping an elderly man who had fallen down in Whadcoat Street - a short road off Seven Sisters Road - as they waited for their next set of prayers.  It was then that a white van came down the street, mounted the pavement and drove into people.  Calls were made to the emergency services at about 00:20 BST. A police van arrived within one minute and a cordon was raised around the area within 10 minutes.  The man who was driving the van was restrained by people at the scene, and an imam stopped some of the crowd from attacking the suspect. More than 60 medics went to help the injured, including ambulance crews, advance paramedics, specialist response teams, and a trauma team from London's Air Ambulance. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack was ""declared a terrorist incident within eight minutes"" of the first emergency call being received.  As a result, officers from the local borough are being supported by armed police and the Territorial Support Group, which is deployed to events that may involve public disorder. The Counter Terrorism Command is leading the investigation. Police confirmed early on Monday that the elderly man who was receiving first aid before the attack had later died.  He has not yet been named, and police said they were still investigating whether he died as a result of the attack or something else. The London Ambulance Service said nine people were being treated in three hospitals in the capital, with some in a serious condition. Two other people were treated at the scene for minor injuries.  The police confirmed that all the victims were Muslims.  Witnesses reported seeing one man giving CPR to a victim in the street, while another man's head injury was treated with a makeshift dressing. The BBC understands Darren Osborne, a 47-year-old man from the Cardiff area, was initially arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He grew up in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset and has four children. He was later also arrested for the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism. Immediately after the attack he was detained by members of the public as they waited for police to arrive on the scene.  Eyewitness Abdul Rahman told the BBC: ""When the guy came out from his van he wanted to escape, run away, and he was saying 'I want to kill Muslims. 'I want to kill Muslims.'"" Police said he was taken to hospital as a precaution. Security minister Ben Wallace said the man was not known to the police or security services, and it is thought he acted alone.  Some witnesses said there was more than one person involved in the attack, but a statement from the police said there were no other suspects.   Forensics officers are now examining the white van, which has Pontyclun Van Hire - a firm from Rhondda Cynon Taff in Wales - written on it. A residential address in the Cardiff area is being searched in relation to the terror attack.  Mr Osborne's family released a statement, which said: ""We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in.  ""We're devastated for the families, our hearts go out to those who've been injured. ""It's madness, it must just be complete madness."" Mrs May said the incident was a terror attack. She said the man arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack ""targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives"".  She reiterated remarks that were made after an attack near London Bridge, saying ""there has been far too much tolerance of extremism over many years."" She added that there would be nowhere left for extremism to hide. Labour leader and local MP Jeremy Corbyn said on Twitter that he was ""totally shocked"" by what had happened.  ""I've been in touch with the mosques, police and Islington council regarding the incident. My thoughts are with those and the community affected by this awful event."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan promised additional policing to reassure communities, especially those observing Ramadan. He has also asked people to ""remain calm and vigilant"". ""We don't yet know the full details, but this was clearly a deliberate attack on innocent Londoners, many of whom were finishing prayers during the holy month of Ramadan,"" he said.  ""While this appears to be an attack on a particular community, like the terrible attacks in Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge, it is also an assault on all our shared values of tolerance, freedom and respect."" Imam Mohammed Mahmoud, who protected the alleged attacker from an angry crowd, said: ""This demonisation of the Muslim community at the hands of people with ulterior motives... have succeeded to some extent [by] influencing the vulnerable and the impressionable.  ""It's on a par with the London Bridge attack... and we just hope that in times of tragedy people come together and unite.  ""The fabric of this society is not torn but we have to continue to keep the fabric of this society intact, and come together."" General secretary of the Finsbury Park mosque Mohammed Kozbar said: ""An attack on one faith is an attack on all faiths and communities.  ""They will try to divide us... they will not succeed."" The secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), Harun Khan, tweeted that the van had ""intentionally run over worshippers"" and that he was ""shocked and outraged"". In a statement, the MCB added that it was a ""violent manifestation of Islamophobia"" and called for extra security around mosques. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid spoke briefly to concerned residents before being led through the police cordon as he visited the scene. He said ""the attacker will not succeed in his efforts to divide British society"".  The Jewish Community Council of North London called the attack ""barbaric"" and tweeted that members shared their ""thoughts and prayers with our friends and neighbours"". Speaking on his first state visit as Irish prime minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: ""I think pretty much everyone in Ireland has somebody who lives [in London] who's a relative or a close friend. ""And when there's an attack on London, we feel in Ireland that it's almost an attack on us as well."" Police have asked witnesses or anyone with information to call them on 101 or contact them via Twitter @MetCC. Information can also be provided anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or visiting its website."

The sentencing was announced just before prayers started at Finsbury Park mosque on Friday. In an announcement to worshippers, its trustee Khaled Omar said the community must react with ""relief but not happiness"". He asked them to think of Mr Ali's family as well as the family of Mr Osborne, who he said must be suffering too. ""Our thoughts now are with the victims who've lost dear ones, and those who were injured,"" he told Newsbeat. ""We're totally focused now on trying to help them rebuild their life. We know that this is a scar that will stay with them forever."" Nine people were also injured in the attack.  ""It's something you can't forget, and it's definitely affected the area,"" said Merium Bhuiyan, who attends the mosque. ""People were a lot more concerned in terms of going out after the attack. ""We had a few incidents of Islamophobia, like women having their headscarves ripped off and feeling uncomfortable and unsafe, especially on public transport,"" she says. The 30-year-old says local police have worked with the community to try and make them feel safer. ""The message of hope and positivity that's come out of it is that people have come together. There's been a stronger sense of community."" 30-year-old Ibrahim agrees: ""The fact that he's been sentenced to prison shows us that our voice has been heard.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-45640506,PM faces roadblocks in Birmingham,Theresa May has little room for manoeuvre in Birmingham's traffic.,26 Sep 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"That's always been the standing joke about Birmingham.  But these days, there's many a true word.... No-one would argue it will be a very good thing indeed when we see an end to the grinding disruption caused by one of the biggest building sites in Europe.  There is a double meaning here. Will this gigantic project culminate in a city centre showpiece that really is genuinely ""good when it's finished""? There will be no avoiding the question when about 11,000 people converge on the city for next week's Conservative Party Conference.  Looming high over the convention centre are the giant cranes constructing the project entitled, with not a trace of irony, Paradise.      It's more hellish than heavenly for anyone enduring the traffic jams, cones and road closures surrounding the site.  And there could be no more appropriate metaphor for how little room for manoeuvre Theresa May has as she struggles to steer a course to keep her show on the road.  A party conference less than six months before Britain leaves the EU was always bound to be a bumpy ride.  But the events of recent days leave Mrs May just as tightly boxed in as Birmingham's long-suffering drivers. The rebuff to her Chequers plan in Salzburg has, on her own admission, increased the chances of a no-deal Brexit.  In a region where more than 50,000 people work in car making, no deal would cost tens of thousands of those jobs, according to the Chief Executive of Jaguar Land Rover, Dr Ralf Speth.  He also warns a ""hard Brexit"" would wipe out the £1.2bn a year profits he needs to invest in the next generation of low and zero-emission vehicles.  These are essential if Mrs May's prescription for ""zero emissions mobility"", which she set out in the self-same Birmingham conference centre three weeks ago, is to be realised over the next 30 years.  Yes, all roads lead to Birmingham: Dr Speth made his speech there as well. If she hopes to give him what he wants, frictionless access to European markets and just-in-time delivery of goods and components, while also equipping the UK to sign trade deals around the world, she would inevitably be thwarted yet again by further accusations of cherry picking. But her Common Rule Book to enable Dr Speth's car parts to be moved across the EU is derided by Brexiteers as ""the Euro Rule Book"".  Maybe they feel she has already listened too much to business leaders like Dr Speth.    And then there are the voters themselves.  Many thousands of them, especially in the Black Country and Stoke, supported Leave and switched from Labour to the Conservatives in Stoke South and Walsall North in last year's general election.  How can Mrs May make the compromises she needs in pursuit of a Brexit deal without appearing in places like these to be backtracking on Brexit?  On the other hand, the Conservatives lost Warwick and Leamington to Labour and had their majority squeezed in Worcester, apparently on the strength of Remain sentiment in these and other areas which have long been considered safer Tory territory.       And all this while holding together a party whose rival factions are breathing fire.  We hear Boris Johnson will make another of his rock star entrances into Birmingham to address about 1,000 activists on the eve of Mrs May's conference speech. The question mark will hang over Mrs May's leadership whatever happens in Birmingham.   Brexitologists among you will say there are infinitely more complications which narrow the road for her and ensure every time she steers one way she is open to an equal and opposite reaction.  There is just nowhere to park the awkward questions which previous leaders have so often contrived to avoid.    And it's not just the back-seat drivers in her party she needs to worry about. Other traffic hazards can come unexpectedly, from the Left.  After a summer in which the damaging row over anti-Semitism has dogged the Labour Party in general and Jeremy Corbyn in particular, his party's Deputy Leader of Birmingham City Council, Brigid Jones, conceded to me during last weekend's Sunday Politics Midlands it had not been Labour's finest hour: An example of English irony perhaps?  But she went on to tell me the Conservatives needed to confront a no less serious challenge in their own ranks: Islamophobia. I was contacted after our programme by viewers suggesting I should ask Theresa May about this.  And ask her I will, when I join her in Number Ten during the run-up to this first party conference since last year's car crash in Manchester: falling stage logos, coughing fits and all. I hear, incidentally, to avoid any embarrassing repeats this time, all the words and logos displayed on the set will be projected on rather than stuck.  But there's no legislating against the perennial curse known to politicians, activists and journalists alike as the conference cold. To find out how she answers this and other questions, you'll have to join me for this weekend's Sunday Politics Midlands at 11.00 BST on BBC One Midlands and, this week, across the UK on BBC One HD.  Joining me in the studio will be Education Minister and Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon Nadhim Zahawi and former shadow Treasury chief secretary and Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood Shabana Mahmood. And by the way, if proud Brummies among you are about to berate me on Twitter and elsewhere for those comments about the Paradise development and the traffic logjam in the city where the concrete never sets, relax. Bring it on, I say. A city devoid of cranes and building sites is a city without a future. I just hope it'll be good when it's finished."

It said the Swedish government's decision to allow the protest to go ahead was ""completely unacceptable"". It comes amid growing diplomatic tension between the two countries. Turkey, which had appealed to Sweden to stop the protest, earlier called off a visit by Sweden's Defence Minister, Pal Jonson, saying the trip had ""lost its significance and meaning"".  It was hoped the trip could dispel Ankara's objections to the Scandinavian country joining the Nato military alliance. Turkey has so far held up both Sweden and Finland's Nato applications. Turkey wants political concessions, including the deportation of critics of its President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Kurds that it claims are terrorists. Turkey is already a Nato member, which means it can block another country from joining. Sweden and Finland both applied to join Nato after Russia invaded Ukraine.  Rasmus Paludan, a politician from the Danish far-right Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, burnt a copy of the Quran during the protest on Saturday afternoon outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Turkey is a majority Muslim country. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement denouncing the act, which it said happened despite ""repeated warnings"". ""Permitting this anti-Islam act, which targets Muslims and insults our sacred values, under the guise of 'freedom of expression' is completely unacceptable,"" it said. It added that the burning of the Quran was another example of the ""alarming"" extent to which Islamophobia, racism and discrimination had reached Europe, and it called on the Swedish government to take ""necessary measures"".  Sweden's Foreign Minister, Tobias Billstrom, called the act ""appalling"".  ""Sweden has a far-reaching freedom of expression, but it does not imply that the Swedish government, or myself, support the opinions expressed,"" he wrote on Twitter. Separate protests both in support of and against Turkey were also held in Stockholm. After Turkey cancelled the Swedish defence minister's trip, Mr Jonson tweeted: ""Our relations with Turkey are very important to Sweden, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue on common security and defence issues at a later date."" Demonstrators in Stockholm last week hung an effigy of President Erdogan from a lamppost in what Sweden's Prime Minister said was an effort to sabotage Sweden's Nato application.  Mr Paludan held rallies last year at which he threatened to burn the Quran, sparking riots."

And Steve Rotheram, mayor of Liverpool City Region, says the 26-year-old Egyptian's impact as a high-profile Muslim has ""broken down barriers"". ""His legacy will be much more about what's happened off the field,"" Rotheram added. Salah was named both PFA Player of the Year,Football Writers Footballer of the Year and Premier League Player of the Season after his 32 goals set a new record for the most in a 38-game season. He scored 44 in 51 games in all competitions, though his season ended in disappointment when he left the field injured as Liverpool lost 3-1 to Real Madrid in the Champions league final. 'Salah is bringing communities together' Is Salah improving engagement with Muslim fans? Before Salah's Â£34m arrival from Roma last summer, police figures showed Merseyside had had the third-highest increase in recorded hate crimes against mosques, external in the country, after London and Greater Manchester. A chant by Liverpool fans about their player includes the line ""sitting in the mosque, that's where I wanna be""  - and was praised on social media, external by Salah himself. ""To have that breakdown of Islamophobia caused by one person is an absolutely phenomenal achievement,"" Rotheram told BBC Radio 5 live's Mo Salah: Football is Life. ""I think what Salah's done is what John Barnes did for the black community in the '80s.""

The apology was sprayed in black paint on a whitewashed wall on the front of the property in Liverpool on 28 August. The previous day it was covered with racist and Islamophobic graffiti and several windows were broken, police investigating the hate crime said. The owners are Hindus of Sri Lankan heritage rather than Pakistani Muslims referenced in the abusive messages. The graffiti on the property in Stapleton Avenue, Speke, contained references to both Pakistani people and Islam. The owners are due to move in at the end of September following the completion of renovation work. Det Sgt Phil Atkinson said: ""The victims in this case have been supported... Our community policing officers will be giving the area close attention in the coming days and weeks. ""I would like to urge anyone out there who may have been a victim of hate crime to get in contact, so we can take action."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-49905168,Police encourage Muslim women to report hate crime,Avon and Somerset Police say some Muslim women get so used to harassment they regard it as normal.,14 Oct 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Some Muslim women suffer hate crime on an almost daily basis and police must make them aware they do not need to accept it, an officer has said.  Avon and Somerset Police said three-quarters of recorded hate crimes towards women in the past two years in Bristol were anti-Muslim.  Supt Andy Bennett said: ""It is a crime and you don't have to put up with it"". Aaliyah Hussain, founder of campaigning organisation We Rise, said ""all women face barriers"" when reporting crime.  Supt Bennett and Ms Hussain said some victims got so used to being abused they treated it as normal, racial harassment tended to be carried out by young white men and that some people assumed Muslim women would not be allowed by men to report crimes. Supt Bennett, Avon and Somerset Police's hate crime lead, said: ""Islamic women in particular are suffering, often almost daily, verbal harassment and persistent name calling and intimidation - and this is the area where we really want to smash it. ""They are normalising this behaviour because it's part of their everyday life and I want to say 'the police absolutely don't want you to put up with this behaviour'."" Ms Hussain, from We Rise, which aims to empower Muslim women, said: ""Sometimes there's a tendency to treat Muslim women differently than women in general when it comes to issues such as not reporting crime.  ""The assumption made by many authorities is that Muslim women are under the control of men and therefore aren't able to report crimes, when actually if you look at the wider statistics relating to all gender-based violence such as sexual harassment, rape, domestic violence - you can see that the reporting rates are very low.""  Supt Bennett said, based on results from The British Crime Survey, police knew there was ""still a substantial gap between reported and unreported crime and in some crime categories it can be as much as 50%"". ""The survey unsurprisingly shows even higher levels of under-reporting for hate crime. Every time I talk to Muslim groups, I can never find anybody who hasn't suffered from some form of hate crime and therefore my gut tells me that under-reporting is probably off the charts,"" he said.  He said officers had to ""work much harder"" to get the message through to women because ""they're not as overtly present on prayer days as the men"".  Sheila el Dieb, 72, from Bristol, has been a Muslim for 20 years. She said her experiences ranged from verbal abuse to physical abuse and damage of her property in previous homes.  ""Sometimes I feel that women may be reluctant to report incidents and run the risk of upsetting family members who have been unable to protect them and risk changing the normal pattern of life,"" she said. ""I think most of the hate crime is perpetrated in the street by people passing by. Often we go into shock when it happens because it's unexpected and we don't know what to do.  ""Generally it's opportunist. If your first language is not English, you think 'did I really hear that?'."" Supt Bennett said the abuse his force dealt with was not just confined to Bristol.   ""There are mosques in Bridgwater, Yeovil, Taunton, Street, Glastonbury,"" he said. ""It's not unique to Bristol but amplified by the size of the Muslim community.  ""An incredible amount of hate crime is perpetrated by a stranger to the victim. Our positive outcomes in hate crime are incredibly low and if we don't have CCTV or witnesses it can be difficult. ""The perpetrators of racial harassment tend to be young white men under the age of 25. Perpetrators of hate crime tend to be cowards. They pick on people when they're vulnerable, on their own. It's the psychology of the bully. ""Why young white men? Hate crime is driven by ignorance. If you were to profile that 'young white man', they would tend to be what I'd call right wing."" Aaliyah Hussain said she had not experienced anti-Muslim crime because she was not ""visibly Muslim"".  ""I don't wear the headscarf. I've endured racism but not Islamophobia. But women who do wear the headscarf are far more likely to be abused because they're considered fair game - and it's because of the pervasive hostility towards Muslims that is encouraged by the right wing media,"" she said. Alex Raikes, from Stand Against Racism and Inequality (SARI), said they ""encouraged Muslim women to come forward to them when they suffer anti-Muslim abuse"".  ""SARI will support any victim whether they want to report to other agencies or not - 35% of SARI's clients are Muslim so many people are coming forward and clearly Islamophobic abuse is happening all too often.  ""If it's not reported, it can't be stopped. SARI has also set up the Tackling Islamophobia Working Group (TIWG) to ensure agencies such as the police and local authority and Muslim communities work together."""

Mr Hamilton said the majority of British people are ""tolerant and welcoming"". His comments come after the Finsbury Park terror attack in London. BBC Wales understands that the man suspected to have driven a van into Muslim worshippers on Monday is from Cardiff. Mr Hamilton also suggested that ""firm control"" of immigration would ""at least"" alleviate problems of fundamentalist terrorism. In February it was reported that all police forces in Wales saw hate crime rise in the first full three months following the EU referendum. Greater Manchester Police said there was a significant rise in hate crimes after a terror attack in the city in May.  Asked if Britain has a problem with Islamophobia, Mr Hamilton told a press conference: ""No I don't, actually. ""The overwhelming majority of the British people are tolerant and welcoming.  ""Inevitably there is a minority that is prepared to resort to violence and abuse. That's not acceptable."" He added: ""There are no reliable statistics on hate crime for example."" Mr Hamilton added: ""There isn't a general problem with Islamophobia in the United Kingdom or Wales"". Mr Hamilton opened the press conference by talking about a Senedd debate on immigration, to be held by the party on Wednesday. The debate calls for a ""controlled and fair immigration system"". ""For the last few years we've been adding a city the size of Cardiff to the population of the UK every single year,"" he said. ""That's undoubtedly had an impact upon the provision of public services in different parts of the UK"". Asked how to ensure rhetoric on immigration does not divide communities, Mr Hamilton said: ""We've seen now the results of years of ignoring the problem, deliberately suppressing discussion of the issue."" ""There are massive difficulties the country now faces as a result of this uncontrolled inflow,"" he said. ""The case of Salman Abedi is a case in point,"" Mr Hamilton said, referring to the perpetrator of the recent attack in Manchester. ""They came from Libya in 2008. We now know that family was known to have connections with Islamic fundamentalist groups in Libya. ""No system of immigration control is full-proof,"" he said. But he added: ""We have to get our border control system fit for purpose and we have to be more alert to the need to scrutinise the background of those who are coming here."" ""This is a composite problem, which goes way beyond the immigration problem"", he said. ""A firm control of immigration and in particular a proper appraisal of asylum seekers qualifications is an essential part - it will not solve the problem completely no doubt - but at least alleviating the problems of fundamentalist terrorism."""

The footage, taken by a fellow fan, shows expletives directed at Salah, including about his Muslim religion. In a statement, West Ham said they have ""a zero tolerance policy to any form of violent or abusive behaviour"". It continued: ""We are an inclusive football club.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-46557076,Wales a 'hunting ground' for far right,"Young, poor, vulnerable people are being recruited by the far right, says an anti-radicalisation expert.",16 Dec 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Wales has become a ""hunting ground"" for the far right, the leader of an anti-radicalisation project has warned. Young, poor, vulnerable people are most susceptible to recruitment, said Tony Hendrickson, co-ordinator of the lottery-funded Resilience project. He explained teachers need to be better at spotting and reacting to racism in order to ""counter the narrative"". The Welsh Government said it expects schools and local authorities to comply with counter-terrorism legislation. Mr Hendrickson, 54, who grew up in Llanrumney, Cardiff, is the new co-ordinator of Resilience, which is run by charity Ethnic Minorities and Youth Support Team (EYST). His warning comes as new figures reveal a 36% rise in people referred to the UK's terrorism-prevention programme, Prevent, over right-wing extremism. A lack of diversity in large parts of Wales makes it easier for the far right narrative to take hold ""because it is easier to alienate people if you don't know them"", Mr Hendrickson explained. He added the far right issue is a bigger problem in Wales than Islamist extremism, and has grown as a movement since the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump. ""The Islamist problem has never been that big. If Muslims had really bought into that, there would have been bombs going off every day,"" he said. Resilience was set up in response to Prevent, which was criticised by some for being ""Islamophobic"". It works with vulnerable young people at risk of political or religious radicalisation - both to the far right and to Islamic extremism - or sexual exploitation. ""Resilience is about providing a response - a counter narrative,"" explained Mr Hendrickson. Working in schools, youth centres, colleges and prisons, he said most of the work his team do is pre-emptive, increasing the ability of vulnerable young people to resist radicalisation or exploitation. Mr Hendrickson said school staff need to be more aware of racist attitudes among pupils. ""A lot of schools are still struggling with incidents of racism - either they don't recognise it or they are uncomfortable to respond,"" he said. ""I don't blame parents but something should be happening at school. We are living in a diverse society, we need to have these discussions."" He used the example of a Syrian boy who was getting into trouble at school to illustrate the problem. ""One of our workers went to the school to speak to the boy, and found out he was being racially bullied,"" he said. ""When he raised that with the teachers, they hadn't recognised that at all."" Mr Hendrickson called for diversity education similar to sex education. He claimed the problem of far right extremism is ""cyclical"" and ""will get worse before it gets better"". ""The far right has been emboldened by the rise of UKIP, and to some degree the main parties have bought into that narrative,"" he added. ""The far right will only ever be violent because the narrative is based on anger and aggression: it's not about dialogue and getting people around the table. For them, it's 'us' against 'them', a race war."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""The UK Government published the Prevent Duty Guidance for England and Wales for specified bodies including education providers.  ""We would expect local authorities and schools to take reasonable steps to encourage compliance with the responsibilities under the Counter Terrorism Act. ""Our curriculum will aim to develop all our children as ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world, ensuring they respect the needs and rights of others, as members of a diverse society.  ""The safety, security and wellbeing of children and young people is of paramount importance and we expect schools to adopt a zero tolerance approach to all forms of bullying."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43544115,Mother run over twice 'thought I had died',Zaynab Hussein's attacker hit her with a car twice in a hate crime that has left her bed-bound for six months.,27 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In September last year, a 21-year-old man deliberately drove his car at a woman, and, having knocked her to the ground, returned to do so again. Left with life-changing injuries, Zaynab Hussein, who is still recovering, has spoken to the BBC about life before and after this horrific incident. Mrs Hussein, a mother of nine, had just dropped her two youngest children off at school in Leicester when a car mounted the pavement and ploughed into her. The 47-year-old was thrown against a nearby wall and fell to the ground after hitting her head. As she lay helpless, her assailant performed a U-turn, and, noting that she was still alive, made a second attack. He mounted the pavement and drove over her with all four wheels.  Reliving the events of the day, Mrs Hussein said that when she was hit the first time she ""started feeling sick and dizzy"". ""Since no-one was helping me, I thought I would help myself. I tried to reach for my phone and as I was looking for it, he came back a second time."" The injuries sustained from the second blow have left her confined to bed for the past six months. She has been receiving specialist treatment to heal and mend the severe fractures to her pelvis, spine and limbs. ""My leg has been destroyed in a way that you wouldn't think is humanly possible. It is entirely crushed. I had skin and muscle tissue removed from [my thigh] to patch my leg together,"" she said.  ""My [right] forearm snapped in half and folded in on itself so that my fingers were touching my elbow crease."" Recalling the attack, Mrs Hussein remembers falling into unconsciousness and fearing her life was about to end. She struggles to hold back the tears: ""I was screaming 'help me, help me!' to people but no-one came - everyone just left me to it. ""When he hit me again, I could hear people saying 'oh my God, he is back'... They were just watching me. ""I became conscious again when I was in the ambulance. My son was called from college and he was with me. I heard him crying and that's what brought me back.  ""I thought I had died, so I wasn't expecting to become conscious again. I couldn't believe that I was alive."" The most difficult thing for Mrs Hussein to come to terms with is the loss of her independence.  The youngest of her children is aged just three. ""I was someone who was raising her children, who was working and did everything for herself."" Now, she struggles to look after herself. Simple tasks such as using the lavatory are a challenge when no-one is around to help. ""I can't raise [my leg]. When I'm forced to go to the toilet by myself, I drag my damaged leg on the floor behind me. Sometimes I can't get up at all, so they put a pot with a chair in the room for me."" All of the good memories from her adopted home city are now overshadowed by a darkness. Prior to the attack, Mrs Hussein had lived a quiet life with family, in Leicester.  After escaping violence and instability in Somalia, she had moved to the East Midlands city in 2003 and worked as a cleaner. ""I was happy and loved it here. I've experienced something that has made me forget all the good memories,"" she said. She finds it incomprehensible someone could harm a complete stranger for no reason. ""I didn't do anything to him. He didn't know me, I didn't know him. I wasn't crossing the road. He hit me because he felt like it. It was arrogance... there was no other motive than to hurt me. ""If someone hits you once - it is horrible, but you can tell yourself it might have been an accident or a mistake. For him to come back a second time... that was very hard."" Mrs Hussein's attack was treated as a hate crime and her assailant, Paul Moore, also from Leicester, was found guilty of attempted murder, at Nottingham Crown Court in February. Jurors also convicted him of the attempted grievous bodily harm of a 12-year-old Somali girl - he tried to drive at the schoolgirl, who was wearing a headscarf, moments after Mrs Hussein's attack. Moore, 21, has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years. At his trial, his half-brother, Lewis Welsh, said Moore had used racist terms to describe the attack afterwards. ""I don't think he knew what he was saying or doing. But he did tell me that he had ran over a 'Paki',"" he said. ""He tried to put it down to the London 7/7 bombings. He said he was proud of himself. He was rambling. He was doing the country a favour."" Mrs Hussein believes Moore's attack was inspired by Islamophobia. ""He was looking for [points to her headscarf]. If we're being honest, that's what he was after. There were lots of other people he could've hurt - it was a busy time - but he sought out people with headscarves."" Moving forward, she says the only thing that matters to her is that an attack like this should never happen again.  ""I don't want any other human being to experience what I have been through,"" she said. ""To cruelly make someone, who was healthy, disabled within a matter of minutes is something that I wouldn't want to happen to anyone - not even the person who hit me.  ""Everyone - no matter their race, religion or whatever they are - should be protected from this."""

The black and minority ethnic (BAME) members of the Black and Green Ambassadors programme discussed the issues at a virtual seminar on Monday. The new ambassadors - Asia Yousif, Olivia Sweeney and Roy Kareem - were introduced at the event. Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said the scheme will ""rebuild a better Bristol."" The ambassadors discussed topics including their connection to nature, and the importance of visibility and opportunities for diverse voices to become more involved in environmental projects.  Ms Sweeney told the BBC that sustainability is something she has always been passionate about.  ""I remember learning the three Rs, Reduce ReUse Recycle at school and ever since then it has been my thing,"" she explained. ""As I have grown up I have become increasingly aware of the social justice and behaviour change angle of the environmental movement.  ""Talking about race is hard in certain settings so being able to find my voice within an understanding and supportive network is a rare privilege."" Mr Kareem said he got involved because he ""hadn't seen many people that looked like me represented in the environmental sector or the sustainability movement"". He applauded the programme for dealing with the ""intersection of sustainability, culture and fairness"". The Black and Green Ambassadors scheme is an Ujima Radio CIC and Bristol Green Capital Partnership initiative launched after the city won the European Green Capital award in 2015. Marvin Rees said: ""Working together with all of Bristol - in all of its diversity - and empowering communities is at the heart of our strategy to tackle the climate and ecological emergencies."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50511329,Corbyn: I'd stay neutral in Brexit referendum,"Boris Johnson asks how the Labour leader could agree a new EU deal and then be ""indifferent"" about it.",23 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Jeremy Corbyn has said he would remain neutral in a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins power. He told a BBC Question Time leaders' special he would not campaign for Leave or Remain so it would allow him, as prime minister, to ""credibly"" carry out what the voters then decide. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later asked how Mr Corbyn could be ""indifferent"" on such a vital issue. But Mr Johnson faced questions of his own about whether he could be trusted. The prime minister was the fourth party leader to answer the audience's questions, with the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson also taking to the stage for 30 minutes each on Friday evening. Pressed on whether politicians should be relied upon to tell the truth, Mr Johnson said this was ""absolutely vital"".  While trust was a crucial issue for voters, he argued the biggest threat to public confidence was the ""corrosive"" effect of Parliament trying to block Brexit. He said the Labour, SNP and Lib Dem leaders wanted to ""basically frustrate"" the result of the 2016 referendum, which the public had been waiting more than three years to see delivered, by ""absurdly"" holding another one.  He said that the Labour leader's views seemed to have ""mutated"" and Mr Corbyn's ambition to negotiate an improved agreement would be totally undermined if he did not care whether the public backed it or not. ""He is now going to be neutral on the deal he proposes to do. I don't see how he can do a deal when he is going to be neutral or indifferent."" The four leaders all appeared individually and faced a mixture of audience questions and follow-up questions from host Fiona Bruce at the event in Sheffield.  The first to take the stage, Mr Corbyn, faced tough questioning about his economic polices, with one member of the audience suggesting his ""reckless socialist"" agenda ""terrified"" him and his family.  The Labour leader said his plans to take Royal Mail, the railways, the water industry and broadband delivery into public ownership had been ""set out"" very clearly and were aimed at ""delivering an economy that works for all"". He insisted business had ""nothing to be frightened of"" by his plans, saying his ""fully prepared and costed manifesto"" would bring the country together and help reduce inequality.  Mr Corbyn was criticised for what several audience members suggested was a lack of clarity on whether he personally would support or oppose Brexit in a new referendum in 2020, with one questioner saying: ""Why would anyone vote for Labour without knowing the answer to that question?"" Mr Corbyn said it was ""entirely reasonable"" to put the question back to the people as another referendum represented a sensible middle ground between those who wanted to cancel Brexit entirely and those backing the PM's deal. Asked to clarify his own position, he said: ""I will adopt, if I am prime minister at the time, a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring our communities and countries together rather than continuing an endless debate."" He later told the audience: ""You heard it here first on Question Time."" In doing this, he would follow in the footsteps of Harold Wilson - who allowed Labour ministers to campaign on both sides in the 1975 Common Market referendum and took a back seat during the campaign - although he personally backed staying in.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock attacked Mr Corbyn's position, saying he had ""decided to be indecisive"" and it ""won't wash with the voters"".  But shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock defended Mr Corbyn's stance as ""brave"". ""What we are saying is we trust the people to have the final say,"" she told Today.  It's not clear if the lively grilling of major politicians will shift the dial at this election.  But it certainly marked a shift in Jeremy Corbyn's position on Brexit. He had been put under pressure by his opponents to say whether he would support Leave or Remain in the new referendum Labour is promising. So he tried to eliminate a negative by providing clarity, of a sort: a clear commitment to stay neutral. Labour's strategists are suggesting he could now be seen as an honest broker that can bring a divided country together. In truth, though, behind the scenes there are fears that the party may have over-estimated the threat from the Lib Dems and underestimated the importance voters in Leave areas attach to delivering Brexit.  So his neutrality is in part an attempt to reassure those voters that his promised referendum isn't the means of cancelling Brexit by the back door. His followers will say he has risen above the fray; his critics - that he has become more decisive about sitting on the fence. Questioned on the issue of tackling incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Mr Corbyn was accused of failing to intervene when one of his own Jewish MPs, Ruth Smeeth, was heckled by an activist at a party event in 2016.  Mr Corbyn said Ms Smeeth and others had ""suffered terrible abuse"". He insisted that all forms of racism and misogyny were ""unacceptable"" and party activists who had abused MPs had been disciplined or expelled. When Mr Johnson took the stage, he dismissed suggestions he was trying to suppress the findings of a report into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 referendum vote as ""Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""There is no evidence whatsoever, that I know of, to show any interference in any British electoral event,"" the Conservative leader said. He insisted his party had ""zero tolerance"" towards Islamophobia and said he regretted any offence he had caused in articles about race during his journalistic career - including a piece in 2018 in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers. But he defended the right to freedom of speech and did not accept an audience member's invitation to say ""sorry"" for writing them. Labour's economic plans would be ""ruinous"" for the country, he argued, but he also acknowledged his plan to cut national insurance bills for low-earners - expected to be the main tax announcement in the Conservative manifesto - would only have a modest impact.  On the NHS, Mr Johnson stuck by his claims that the health service was receiving the biggest cash injection in its history. He added: ""Of course I understand that things have been tough in the NHS and understand the pressures the NHS is under. I know the massive demand the NHS faces but we can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said voting for her party in Scotland was the best way of ""depriving"" the Tories of a majority across the UK. Asked about what she would do in the event of another hung Parliament on 12 December, she said she would not work with the Tories but was prepared to deal with Labour if Jeremy Corbyn committed to end austerity and agreed to hold another Scottish independence referendum. ""In terms of what I would seek to win from a minority Labour government, obviously I would ask for and expect Jeremy Corbyn to respect the right of the Scottish people to choose their own future. ""It is not for Westminster to decide. It is for the people of Scotland."" When it was pointed out to her that Mr Corbyn had just stated to viewers that he would not sanction another independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government, she said she was predicting what he might choose to do after the election, rather than dwelling on what he was saying now. She said: ""Do you think he's going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants, for a couple of years, to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?"" The first minister said more needed to be done to reduce the number of drug deaths in Scotland, saying, ""I don't want to be citizen of a country where people are dying from drug issues."" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was immediately asked by an audience member whether she regretted saying she could become prime minister and ""how ridiculous this sounded"" - given that her party only had 20 MPs at the end of the last Parliament. She said she recognised it was a ""big ask"" for her to make it to No 10 but she believed many people were ""dismayed"" at having to choose between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and there had to be a ""better alternative"". She faced awkward questions over her plans to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50, being asked by one audience member whether she regarded all 17.4 million Leave voters as ""stupid"". Ms Swinson said this was not the case and they clearly disagreed over the benefits of being in the EU, to which she was told ""you can disagree with me but you lost"". She was also challenged over austerity and what one audience member called her party's backing for ""harsh and cruel benefit cuts"" while in coalition with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015. She conceded the Lib Dems had made mistakes during their time in government and should have done more to limit the scale of austerity - although she said she remained supportive of the principle of the Universal Credit system - which Labour has pledged to scrap. It was not a comfortable ride for any of the four who appeared in front of the audience in Sheffield who were pressed on issues as broad as the economy, austerity, Brexit, Bolivia, the Russia report, racism, the NHS and plenty more.  It was particularly uncomfortable for the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who was pummelled by the audience over her promise to stop Brexit by simply halting the process altogether in the unlikely event she won a majority. There were moments of real challenge too for Boris Johnson first on a very simple question - can he be trusted? The audience's attitude made it clear they have a big question about that, and about him. Read more from Laura here. The two-hour show came after recently-screened Question Time specials with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley. The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61956108,Indian police arrest journalist over tweets,Mohammed Zubair of Alt News has reportedly been accused of insulting religious beliefs on Twitter.,28 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Police in India have arrested the co-founder of a fact-checking website who has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Mohammed Zubair of AltNews has been accused of insulting Hindu religious beliefs on Twitter, a network of media organisations said. Opposition leaders and journalists have condemned the arrest.  They said it was a clear attempt by the Hindu-nationalist government to clamp down on those who expose hate speech.  Mr Zubair recently highlighted comments by a spokesperson of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) allegedly insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a television debate. His tweet was widely shared and led to several Muslim countries lodging strong protests with India. In recent weeks, Hindu nationalists have drawn attention to past comments made by Mr Zubair and demanded that he be prosecuted for hurting their religious feelings. A prominent Indian journalist, Mohammad Zubair started the fact-checking website AltNews with former engineer Pratik Sinha in 2017.  The website quickly rose to prominence for its diligent work in combating misinformation and fake news in the country. Fact checks from AltNews are frequently shared by Mr Zubair on Twitter where he has more than half a million followers. He monitors hate speech and his Twitter posts on comments made by supporters of the BJP have invited intense backlash. Last week, he posted an e-mail from the microblogging site telling him that his tweet criticising Islamophobic comments by the leader of a Hindu group was being ""withheld"" - which means it's no longer visible in India - on request from the law enforcement authorities. The letter added that this was ""in order to comply with Twitter's obligations under India's local laws"". He later received another e-mail saying that two of his other tweets - about provocative comments made by a Hindu priest threatening to kidnap and rape Muslim women - were also being ""withheld in India"" under the country's IT laws. On Monday, Mr Zubair was detained over a complaint from a Twitter account that said he insulted Hindus in a 2018 post commenting on the renaming of a hotel after the Hindu monkey god Hanuman, the ANI news agency reported, citing senior Delhi police officials. A statement by the police later said that the tweet had been amplified by Mr Zubair's Twitter followers and ""created a series of debates/hate mongering"". Police claim their investigation found Mr Zubair's conduct ""questionable"" which ""warranted his custodial interrogation"". Pratik Sinha, also a co-founder of AltNews, who accompanied him to the police, said neither he nor Mr Zubair's lawyers were provided with a copy of the complaint on which the arrest was made. They were also initially not told where he was being taken after being detained.  Mr Zubair was produced before a local magistrate late on Monday night who granted the police one day's custody. Following this, he was allowed to meet his lawyer. A court on Tuesday remanded him in custody for a further four days. Many journalists and activists have been demanding his immediate release. ""Zubair who routinely busted fake news, exposed the hate machinery in India has just been arrested,"" said Rana Ayyub, a Muslim journalist. ""The country is punishing those who reported, documented the decline."" Opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: ""Every person exposing BJP's hate, bigotry and lies is a threat to them. Arresting one voice of truth will only give rise to a thousand more."" Police said at the centre of the arrest was a 2018 tweet by Mr Zubair in which he had shared a photo of a hotel signboard, modified from 'Honeymoon Hotel' to 'Hanuman Hotel'. The photo was actually a screengrab from a 1983 Bollywood comedy by acclaimed director Hrishikesh Mukherjee. But a Twitter account called Hanuman Bhakt, meaning worshipper of the monkey god Hanuman, recently shared the four-year-old tweet and called it a ""direct insult"" to Hindus. The account also tagged the Delhi police, asking them to take ""immediate action"" against Mr Zubair. The anonymous account, created last October, had just one follower until Tuesday morning. It has since risen rapidly to cross 1,500 followers."

The party said Prof Swaran Singh would look at how it handles complaints, and tries to clamp down on discrimination. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously pledged the investigation would get underway before Christmas.  Tory party chairman James Cleverly said it would help the party ""stamp out unacceptable abuse"". Prof Singh is a former commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), the watchdog currently investigating anti-Semitism allegations within Labour.  He has been a professor in Social and Community Psychiatry at the University of Warwick since 2006.  Announcing the appointment, Mr Cleverly said: ""The Conservative Party has always worked to act swiftly when allegations have been put to us"".  ""There are a wide range of sanctions to challenge and change behaviour,"" he added.  ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind"".  The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), an umbrella group of various UK Muslim bodies, has accused the party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia, and said it had a ""blind spot for this type of racism"". The group has previously called for Islamophobia allegations in the Conservative Party to be investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. Mr Johnson has defended the party's processes for handling complaints, saying members guilty of Islamophobia ""are out first bounce"". However he has faced accusations of Islamophobia himself, after writing in a newspaper column last year that Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes""."

King Felipe VI joined the demonstrators, alongside Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The king is the first Spanish sovereign to join a march since the monarchy was re-established in the 1970s. Emergency workers and shop staff who helped during the attack at Las Ramblas also took pride of place. The procession set off behind a banner bearing the slogan ""I'm not afraid"". Other placards denounced Islamophobia.  During the march, the king and prime minister walked the streets in front of hundreds of Catalan flags - the emblem for the autonomous region's long-running independence claim.    Some protesters whistled and shouted ""out"" at the king.  Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capital, is due to hold its unrecognised independence referendum in October.  Prime Minister Rajoy had encouraged ""everyone"" to take part to show that ""Catalonia and the rest of Spain [are] united against terror"". The 17 August attack - which saw a van deliberately driven into people on the Las Ramblas boulevard - was claimed by the Islamic State group. The driver later stabbed and killed a man while hijacking his vehicle. Hours later, a car attack in nearby Cambrils killed another woman.  A cell of 12 jihadists has been blamed for the attack. Eight are dead, while four have appeared in court in Madrid. King Felipe has reigned in Spain since 2014, when his father, King Juan Carlos I, abdicated.    Spain's monarchy was restored after the death of military dictator Francisco Franco in 1975."

Colin Barton, standing in Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, was expelled from the party for sharing Islamophobic memes. Robin Popley, in Charnwood, Leicestershire, was suspended after endorsing posts, one of which criticised the Duchess of Sussex. Neither have responded to requests for comment. Mr Barton's case was highlighted by BBC Radio Nottingham. Mr Barton, who was standing for Worksop South East in next week's borough council elections, shared various Facebook posts, one of which implied two headscarf-wearing women would be stoned for kissing. He also shared another meme which linked the sexual exploitation of white girls with Labour seeking ""Pakistani Muslim votes"". Mr Popley, who was standing as a candidate for Shepshed East, was suspended following a report in The Guardian newspaper.  It said he had ""liked"" a Facebook post that said Prince Harry's choice of wife was ""way off"", describing the duchess as ""a divorcee of mixed race 'actress' who has shown her ass on HBO"". The article also said Mr Popley had ""loved"" a post which said the appointment of Home Secretary Sajid Javid was ""aimed at securing the ethnic vote"" and a ""purely cynical tactic"" from Prime Minister Theresa May. A Conservative Party spokesperson confirmed Mr Barton had been expelled from the party and Mr Popley suspended. Ballot papers have already been printed which include both men as Conservative candidates and local returning officers said the deadline for withdrawals had passed.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-42650014,Schools urged to tackle Islamophobia,Young Muslims share their experiences to help schools in Wales teach issues around Islamophobia.,15 Jan 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Young Muslims in Wales say they have been frequently stared at in public, called ""terrorists"" at school and been told by strangers to take off headscarves. It comes as schools have been urged to raise awareness of Islamophobia. The Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland is focusing on the harm caused by religious hate crime.  Muslim pupils have shared their experiences to help shape resources for the classroom. The most recent UK Government statistics showed a 29% rise in hate crimes in England and Wales. Religious hate crime increased by 35% between 2016-17, during a time when a charity in Wales said teachers from 13 of the 22 local authorities reported incidents of racism in the last year. Ms Holland said: ""I've spoken to young Muslims from across Wales who've told me that they're often scared in their communities, that they've directly experienced abuse at school, and that they're tired of the way Islam is often portrayed by the media, and the effect this has on the views of their non-Muslim peers."" Young Muslims' views have helped shape the new resources for teachers to use in the classroom. Videos include contributions of pupils from Cathays High School in Cardiff where around three quarters are from minority ethnic backgrounds.  Shutha, 15, said has had ""a few racial comments"" directed at her. ""Stuff like 'go back to your country', stuff about what's on my head without knowing necessarily what it's for,"" she said. ""I used to think it was people being horrible but as I grew older I realised that people aren't really educated on the topic of Islam, the topic of what we do in our religion, why we do it and why we dress a certain way, why our beliefs are a certain way."" She added: ""And I feel like if people get more educated on that, there'll be less Islamophobia, there'll be just less hate in general."" Though Azeem, 16, has not had direct experience of Islamophobia, some of his friends have.  ""On the bus people wouldn't want to sit next to them because they're wearing headscarves,"" he said. Ibby, 17, considers himself lucky to attend a multi-cultural school which he describes as ""a cohesive community"". But outside the school gates friends have been ""verbally assaulted"" by people on the street, he said. ""Early intervention is what's needed before the problem becomes a serious problem"", he said. ""Teaching young people about religion, about culture is hugely important"". Lesson plans produced for the project have been trialled in schools in Swansea, Cardiff and Neath. Jo Bamsey, a religious education teacher at Pentrehafod Comprehensive, Swansea, said they had received positive feedback from pupils. ""The three lessons were well thought-out and allowed for honest discussion in an open and reflective environment,"" she said. Fiona Thomas, a teacher at Dwr-y-Felin Comprehensive in Neath, added: ""The resources conveyed the message clearly to our students that as humans we are all the same, enjoying playing football, listening to music and playing on the Xbox."" Anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card said that teachers in 16 of Wales' 22 local authorities had contacted them for support for help dealing with incidents of racism, or for help in delivering workshops. Sunil Patel, campaign manager, said: ""The number of inquiries our charity has received has trebled compared to the same period last year."" Ms Holland said she recognised the challenge faced by teachers in tackling sensitive issues. ""We know teachers can sometimes feel unsure and nervous about delivering lessons on topics like this, and I hope this resource gives teachers the necessary guidance and support."" she said."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54598546,French pupils held after teacher beheaded,"In all, 15 people are now in custody after the murder of teacher Samuel Paty near Paris.",20 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Four school students are among 15 people who have been taken into custody in France following the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, who showed controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his pupils. The other detainees include four family members of the killer, a father at the school and a known Islamist radical. Police carried out some 40 raids on the homes of suspected radicals on Monday and more raids are expected. The brutal killing has shocked France. Tens of thousands of people took part in rallies across the country on Sunday to honour Mr Paty and defend freedom of speech. A ceremony paying tribute to Mr Paty, who was 47, will be held at the Sorbonne University in Paris on Wednesday. A man named as 18-year-old Abdoulakh A was shot dead by police on Friday after killing Mr Paty close to his school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a north-west suburb of Paris. Four school pupils who may have helped identify Mr Paty to his killer in exchange for payment have been detained, a judicial source told the AFP news agency on Monday. This brings to a total of 15 the number of people taken into custody in the aftermath of the murder.  The killer's grandfather, parents and 17-year-old brother were detained shortly after the gruesome attack.  The father of a pupil who reportedly launched an online campaign against Mr Paty and a preacher described by French media as a radical Islamist were among six people arrested on Saturday. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin accused the two men of having issued a ""fatwa"" against the teacher. The dozens of raids on Monday targeting suspected Islamist radicals were not necessarily linked to the investigation into Mr Paty's murder. But Mr Darmanin said police would be interviewing about 80 people who were believed to have posted messages in support of the killing. ""We want to harass and destabilise this movement in a very determined way,"" an interior ministry source told AFP. The government also said it was probing 51 French Muslim associations. It said if any were found to be promoting hatred, they would be closed down. One organisation, the Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), was labelled an ""enemy of the state"" by Mr Darmanin. The organisation, which monitors anti-Muslim hate crime in France, has accused the minister of slander after he claimed the group was ""obviously"" involved in Friday's attack. In a statement following news of the attack, the CCIF expressed ""our pain and our sadness to the family of this teacher"". Anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-François Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class about freedom of speech earlier in October. As he had done in similar lessons in recent years, Mr Paty, a history and geography teacher, advised Muslim students to leave the room if they thought they might be offended. Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslims because Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God). The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the famous publishing of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A trial is currently underway over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015. Some French-Muslims say they are frequent targets of racism and discrimination because of their faith - an issue that has long caused tension in the country. Abdoulakh A is understood to have been an 18-year-old Chechen, born in Moscow, who had been living in the Normandy town of Évreux, about 100km (60 miles) from the murder scene. He had no known links to either Mr Paty or his school. Mr Ricard said that the killer went to the school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine on Friday afternoon and asked students to point out the teacher. The suspect followed Mr Paty as he walked home from work. He then used a knife to attack the teacher, before beheading him. Witnesses are said to have heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is Greatest"". When police responded to the scene and confronted him, he fired at them with an airgun. Officers returned fire, hitting him nine times. A 30cm-long (12in) blade was found close by. Authorities said the man had been before courts in the past but only on minor misdemeanour charges."

The author of a letter received by Erkin Guney, chairman of Masjid Ramadan mosque, in Hackney, said they ""could not stop smiling"" seeing the footage of the disaster. The father of three said his ""stomach turned"" after reading it. The earthquakes have claimed more than 40,000 lives and seen some towns with 80% of buildings turned to rubble. The anonymous letter wished for ""more deaths"" saying ""the more Muslims that suffer the better"". It read: ""I could not stop smiling watching the people being pulled from the rubble, some dead some still sadly alive."" It expressed ""comfort"" at news of entire families being killed in the disaster and wished for another earthquake in the region. Mr Guney, who has overseen 300 aid boxes dispatched from the mosque, also known as Shacklewell Lane Mosque, said he had received hundreds of supportive messages. He said the first line of the offensive letter mentioned ""sorrow"", adding: ""It was only when I read the second line, I stopped in my tracks and realised it was a very hateful message.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-63699881,Racism furore reignites scrutiny of Australian media,"High-profile Aboriginal presenter Stan Grant left Australian TV this week, citing ""relentless"" abuse.",24 May 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"After a prestigious career of more than three decades, trailblazing Aboriginal journalist Stan Grant hosted his final show on Monday and walked away from Australian TV screens indefinitely.  ""Racism is a crime. Racism is violence. And I have had enough,"" Grant wrote in a column last week explaining his decision.  The Wiradjuri man made history in 1992 when he became the first Aboriginal presenter on prime-time commercial TV in Australia. He went on to win a slew of awards in Australian media, and was an international correspondent for CNN and Al Jazeera before returning home to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).  The ABC describes him as one of Australia's most respected and awarded journalists.  But on Monday night he looked defeated, visibly shaking as he signed off from his political panel show Q+A.  ""To those who have abused me and my family, I would just say - if your aim was to hurt me, well, you've succeeded,"" he said.  Grant's decision to leave has reignited fierce conversations about racism and media diversity in Australia.  ""If one of the few Indigenous presenters on television with a career that took him all over the world can't be protected from racism... what will that mean for anyone who walks down a similar path?"" ABC journalist Ryma Tchier wrote on Twitter.  Australia's Indigenous people have over 60,000 years of history, and half of Australians were either born overseas or have a parent who was. But the media representing such a multicultural population remains disproportionately white.  A 2022 study found more than three quarters of the reporters or presenters on Australian TV were from an Anglo-Celtic cultural background. The difference was even more pronounced at the leadership and board level.  The Media Diversity Australia report prompted the five TV networks examined to acknowledge their lack of diversity. But the channels also questioned the report's findings, criticising how it had determined cultural background, and criticising the short, two-week research window of the study. Several pointed out they had increased diversity in other areas of their output or tried to increase representation through targeted roles and recruitment.  But the broader issue has long been a problem in Australian media, and critics cite it for contributing to high-profile controversies. In 2019, a newspaper was widely accused of using racist tropes in a cartoon depiction of Serena Williams - the image was ultimately deemed acceptable by media regulators. And in 2020, Australia's most watched breakfast show, Channel Seven's Sunrise, settled a racial discrimination case over an all-white panel where a pundit suggested Aboriginal children should be forcibly removed from their families.  The Seven Network initially defended the segment, which sparked protests outside their studio, saying ""editorial opinions… are a vital part of journalism"", but later apologised for causing offence after the broadcast regulator found they had breached industry standards. A prestigious media award - the Kennedys - was also criticised in 2021 for not having a single person of colour on the 60-person judging panel.  The cultural diversity in Australia's media industry is shocking compared to many other Western countries, says Antoinette Lattouf, who in 2011 became one of the first Arab-Australian women to be a commercial television reporter.   As a result, she says, many Australian communities' stories go untold and vital perspectives are missed.  ""Each nation has their own challenges… [but] anybody who has… seen BBC, CNN, ITV, even broadcasters in New Zealand, will note they're far more diverse than our screens,"" says Lattouf, who co-founded the Media Diversity Australia group to improve the situation.  Culturally diverse journalists say they face more barriers to entering the Australian media industry than their peers.  But cases like Stan Grant's expose the problem outlets have in retaining them when they do make it.  Former ABC reporter Rhianna Patrick says the reason she joined the industry was the same reason she left it.  ""I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a journalist… because I recognised that the only time I ever saw people from my community reflected in the media was in a negative way,"" the Torres Strait Islander tells the BBC.  She built an impressive career over two decades - first in Indigenous radio then at the ABC, where she came to headline her own, self-titled national radio show.  But Patrick was the only Indigenous person in her unit, sometimes her entire floor. The impact of that fact hit her all at once in 2020 as she watched the Black Lives Matter movement sweep the globe, including Australia.  ""All of these things I had buried… were starting to come to the surface and I realised… I just couldn't go back into a mainstream media space and do my job anymore,"" she said.  Non-white journalists have regularly reported racial abuse from audiences. In the wake of Grant's exit, even more disclosed experiences.   ""Maybe once a week, I get called a racial slur [or] I get told I'm not Australian … I've also thought about leaving because of racist abuse,"" said news presenter and comedian Michael Hing, who is Chinese-Australian.  He said he had also considered departing the ABC because ""all-white management teams are too often incapable of understanding"".   There is racism from peers too, Lattouf and Patrick recount.  ""If ever there were crimes committed by people of Middle Eastern backgrounds, people [in the newsroom] would say things like 'oh, what did your cousins get up to?'"" Lattouf says.  ""I've been told that 'I'm one of the good ones' from the Lebanese community - a backhanded compliment that suggests that the rest of my community isn't good.""  There's also the pressure that comes with often being the sole person from their community in a newsroom, and feeling disproportionately responsible for coverage of an issue or advocating for their people.  And covering topics such as police brutality, racism and violence can be feel personal and traumatic, they say. Patrick says she knows the work she did was important. ""But you also want to be able to have times when you can do stories about Indigenous excellence, about Indigenous joy.""   It all adds up. And so - like Grant - many culturally diverse journalists leave. When Grant announced his departure, he accused the ABC of an ""institutional failure"" to protect or defend him.  He said racism had been ""relentless"" throughout his career, but it reached a new level of intensity after he covered the King's Coronation for the ABC, when he spoke about the impact of colonisation on his people.  Grant said the ABC had invited him to be part of coverage specifically to offer that perspective, but when the backlash came, he was left to fend for himself. He also pointed out the role some conservative media outlets played in amplifying the outrage. In the days since his decision, there have been 'I Stand with Stan' protests, and the ABC has apologised and pledged to do better.  ""I'm incredibly sorry that he felt let down by our organisation... we will do all we can to make up for it,"" ABC News director Justin Stevens told a rally.  The ABC has promised to review how it deals with racism directed at staff. It follows other reviews it has had in recent years aimed at impoving diversity.  Some commentators hope the anger over Grant's exile could mark a turning point, but others are sceptical.  ""You go through these cycles of reckoning - reforms are introduced, you have a couple of new hires - but the actual underlying structures don't change that much,"" one Aboriginal reporter who didn't wish to be named told the BBC.  In his final speech on Monday, Grant said he had spent his career trying to represent his people with pride and love. ""I've just wanted to make us seen and I'm sorry that I can't do that for a little while,"" he said. ""I've had to learn that endurance is not always strength. Sometimes strength is knowing when to say stop. ""I am down right now. I am. But I'll get back up and you can come at me again. And I'll meet you with the love of my people."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59933029,Man held for making app to auction Muslim women,"The arrest came days after a similar app, Bulli Bai, generated outrage and led to four arrests.",10 Jan 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Police in India have arrested a man suspected of creating an app that put up photos of more than 80 Muslim women for ""sale"" online last year. The open source app - Sulli Deals - had been hosted on web platform GitHub in July 2021. The 25-year-old was arrested days after a similar app - Bulli Bai - uploaded photos of more than 100 Muslim women. Four students, including a 21-year-old student who allegedly created the second app, were arrested. In both cases, there was no actual sale, but the purpose was to degrade and humiliate Muslim women, many of whom have been outspoken about the rising tide of Hindu nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Sulli"" is a derogatory Hindi slang term right-wing Hindu trolls use for Muslim women, and ""bulli"" is also pejorative. After the Bulli Bai app generated outrage online, one of the women who had filed a police complaint in July alleged that police in the capital Delhi had not taken any action yet. On Sunday, police arrested Aumkareshwar Thakur from Indore city in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. Police told BBC Marathi that Mr Thakur's name came up while Neeraj Bishnoi, the alleged creator of the Bulli Bai app, was being questioned. Mr Thakur's devices are being analysed, KPS Malhotra, the deputy commissioner of Delhi Police's cyber crime team, told the BBC. The Sulli Deals app had taken publicly available pictures of women and created profiles, describing the women as ""deals of the day"". Those featured on the app were all vocal Muslims, including journalists, activists, artists or researchers. One of the women, a commercial pilot, told the BBC in July that she felt ""chills"" go down her spine when she heard about the app. The Bulli Bai app also generated similar reactions from the women whose photos were uploaded without their permission - this included several journalists, a Bollywood actor and the 65-year-old mother of a disappeared Indian student. A 2018 Amnesty International report on online harassment in India showed that the more vocal a woman was, the more likely she was to be targeted - the scale of this increased for women from religious minorities and disadvantaged castes. Critics say trolling against Muslim women has worsened in recent years in India's polarised political climate."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47514251,McDonnell would welcome Labour probe,"The shadow chancellor says he wants Labour to be a ""shining example"" in tackling anti-Semitism.",10 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour's John McDonnell has welcomed a potential investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism in his party.  The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it is considering a formal inquiry following a number of complaints, including from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. The shadow chancellor told the BBC he wants Labour to be a ""shining example"" in the way it tackles anti-Semitism. He added: ""Let's get on with it now"".   Jeremy Corbyn has said anti-Semitism has ""no place whatsoever"" in the party. The Labour Party has been dealing with complaints of anti-Semitism over the last two years. On Friday, the chair of Labour peers wrote to party leader Mr Corbyn to express ""alarm"" at the ""ongoing failure"" to resolve the issue - something they said ""diminishes the moral authority of the Labour Party"". The EHRC is asking Labour to work with it to improve its processes.  It has raised concerns with the party, which has two weeks to respond before it decides whether to take enforcement action - which can range from a voluntary agreement with the party to a full-blown investigation.   The watchdog, which was set up by the Labour government in 2006, said it believed the party ""may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs"", following a number of complaints. Asked about the investigation, Mr McDonnell told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I'm hoping we will get a clean bill of health about how we are handling things.  ""If there are issues that the EHRC can advise us on, I welcome that. Because I want us to be a shining example of how you tackle issues like anti-Semitism, both within your own party, but also wider society. ""Let's get it done, because we will all learn lessons from it and I hope that other political parties as well - in how they deal with the racism that they've experienced in their own party - learn from this too."" The Conservatives have been accused of not tackling Islamophobia in the party by their own former party chairwoman, Baroness Warsi. Senior Labour figures have clashed in the past week over the way the backlog of complaints against Labour members is being dealt with, amid claims the process has become politicised. The party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, has asked that any complaints be forwarded to him for monitoring, saying that ""opacity and delay"" had led to a ""complete loss of trust"". But the party's general secretary, Jennie Formby, said that approach would undermine party processes.  The Sunday Times has reported claims that two of Mr Corbyn's closest aides had intervened in the party's disciplinary processes to lift the suspension of an activist accused of anti-Semitism. The party said the report was based on a ""selective briefing"" from a former employee and said while for a few weeks staff in Labour's Governance and Legal Unit had sought advice on a handful of cases, that practice had been stopped when Ms Formby became general secretary ""and made the procedures for dealing with complaints about anti-Semitism more robust"".  It said there had been no attempts to overturn the unit's recommendations."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-51150517,Journalist attacked because of his sexuality,A judge rules Guardian columnist Owen Jones was targeted due to his sexuality and political views.,18 Jan 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man launched an unprovoked attack on Guardian columnist Owen Jones because of his sexuality and political views, a judge has ruled. James Healy, 40, admitted assaulting Mr Jones by The Lexington pub in Islington last year but claimed it was because the 35-year-old had spilled his drink. However, Mr Jones said he ""absolutely did not"" spill the drink. At the end of a two-day hearing, the judge ruled the attack could only have been due to his media profile. Recorder Judge Anne Studd QC said Healy, of Portsmouth, would have had ""plenty of opportunity to remonstrate"" with Mr Jones in the pub if he had spilled the drink but made no attempt to do so. ""This was a deliberate and targeted attack on Mr Jones personally,"" she said. Following Healy's arrest, a search of his home revealed a photograph of him performing a Nazi salute. The court heard the photo showed him as a teenager but had been printed out in 2015. Healy, who has admitted affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, faced a trial of issue to determine his motivation for attacking Mr Jones. In her ruling Judge Studd said that while it could not be proven Healy had been performing a Nazi salute in the photograph, she was ""sure that [Healy] holds particular beliefs that are normally associated with the far right wing"". ""I therefore propose to sentence Mr Healy on the basis that this was a wholly unprovoked attack on Mr Jones by reason of his widely published left-wing and LGBTQ beliefs by a man who has demonstrable right-wing sympathies,"" she said. Mr Jones suffered cuts and swelling to his back and head and bruises all down his body in the assault which happened on his birthday night out on 17 August. In his evidence at Snaresbrook Crown Court, the journalist said: ""I'm an unapologetic socialist, I'm an anti-racist, I'm an anti-fascist and I've consistently used my profile to advocate left-wing causes."" Mr Jones has almost one million Twitter followers, 125,000 followers on Instagram and 350,000 followers on Facebook. ""What I use these platforms for is to advocate left-wing ideas and a passion and unwavering commitment to opposing racism, fascism, Islamophobia and homophobia,"" he told the court. ""Almost every single day I am the subject of an unrelenting campaign [of abuse] by far-right sympathisers. ""They've come to see me as this hate figure in their ranks."" Mr Jones said he received death threats on a daily basis, adding: ""It's the combination of being left-wing, gay, anti-fascist - that's everything the far right hate."" Describing the evening of the attack, Mr Jones said: ""My recollection is that I was saying goodbye to a friend and then I was on the floor completely disoriented. ""In those 10 seconds, I don't really remember what happened because I was attacked from behind, I had no sense of what was going to happen."" When asked about the claim he had knocked Mr Healy's drink, he said: ""That absolutely did not happen. ""If I thought I had accidentally spilled someone's drink, I would apologise profusely, I would say, 'I'm so sorry' and I would insist - whether they liked it or not - on buying them another drink."" The court heard Healy has a string of convictions for football violence and is currently subject to a football banning order for encroaching on a pitch. He also allegedly had a football hooligan flag adorned with SS symbols and a collection of pin badges linked to white supremacist groups. Healy told the court: ""I'm a hoarder. I never throw anything away. I just had them all that time tucked away in the back of a drawer. ""Bearing in mind they came into my possession in 1998, there was no internet back then, the information now is easily available. ""As far as I knew, they were connected to football and football violence."" A date has yet to be set for Healy's sentencing."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40658243,US senator defends attacked Muslim rival,Jeff Flake expresses his support for a Democratic challenger after she is abused online.,19 Jul 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has come to defend a woman who wants to unseat him after she received hateful messages about her Muslim religion.  Democratic candidate Deedra Abboud, 45, came under attack after she posted a campaign message on Facebook with an image of the US Constitution. The post prompted an onslaught of cyberbullying, including comments about Ms Abboud's religion. Mr Flake, 54, expressed his support for Ms Abboud on Twitter. ""Hang in there @deedra2018. Sorry you have to put up with this. Lots of wonderful people across AZ. You'll find them,"" he tweeted on Tuesday. The senator also posted a link to an op-ed in The Arizona Republic calling out the online attack on Ms Abboud, which came after she posted a message about separation of church and state.  ""Almost 250 years ago a group of dreamers came together and sketched out a revolutionary vision. No longer would they be shackled to the whims of a distant government, nor bound to the religion of an idiosyncratic king. They set out to forge their own futures, determine their own destinies, and follow their own faith,"" she wrote.  ""In their infinite wisdom, the Founding Fathers decreed that this nation would separate church and state, and in doing so protect both institutions. Government would be free from religious overreach, and religion would be free from government interference."" Facebook users began flooding her page with comments saying there was ""no room for Muslims in our government. Nice try though you are quoting the Muslim brotherhood"". Another user wrote: ""Nice try but your first love is Satan (AKA Allah) and your second love is to a litter box your 'people' come from. You are as American as Chinese checkers."" ""BAN ISLAM IN THE USA…WE HATE YOUR FILTHY DEATH CULT,"" another Facebook user said. Ms Abboud, a Phoenix-based lawyer, thanked Mr Flake for his response.  ""Thank you @JeffFlake for leadership in rejecting behavior that doesn't reflect our American values. AZ's amazing people deserve more than this"", she tweeted.  Ms Abboud, a native of Little Rock, Arkansas, is running for Mr Flake's seat in the August 2018 Democrat primary. If she wins, she would challenge Mr Flake in the general election that autumn. Mr Flake has come to the defence of Muslims in Arizona before.  In the wake of President Donald Trump's executive order in January, which targeted seven Muslim-majority countries, the Republican said in a Medium post the White House was right to be concerned about national security, but that it was ""unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry"". ""Enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims,"" wrote Mr Flake, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees.  He also attended a service at a Scottsdale mosque in December 2015 to show his support amid harsh, anti-Muslim rhetoric from then-Republican presidential candidate, Mr Trump.  ""My hope and prayer today is that isolated voices calling for division are overwhelmed by the chorus of voices in this room today calling for acceptance, tolerance and inclusion,"" he said at the time."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49012361,May and Corbyn clash over anti-racism records,The PM calls on the Labour leader to apologise for anti-Semitism failings in heated Commons exchanges.,17 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over their anti-racism records after the prime minister demanded an apology for anti-Semitism in Labour. Mrs May said it was a ""disgrace"" Mr Corbyn had ""dodged his responsibility"" for tackling anti-Jewish prejudice. The Labour leader insisted he was ""dealing"" with the issue. And he said the PM should reflect on the impact of her own ""hostile"" immigration policies and her party's problems with Islamophobia.  Earlier on Wednesday, more than 60 Labour peers put their names to an advert in the Guardian accusing Jeremy Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism. The signatories, who make up about a third of Labour members in the Lords, said the leader was presiding over a ""toxic culture"".  Brandishing a copy of the advert at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said he could not ""parade himself as the champion of the people and the defender of equality and fairness"" until he apologised for his failure to get to grips with the problem of anti-Semitism. ""The person who has been dodging his responsibility is the right honourable gentleman,"" she said. ""The real disgrace is his handling of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party."" In response, Mr Corbyn said he would ""deal with any racism"" in his party and ""looked forward"" to Mrs May doing the same with allegations of Islamophobia in the Tories. ""This party totally opposes racism in any form whatsoever. Anti-Semitism has no place in our society or any of our parties and no place in any of our dialogue,"" he said. By BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith Although it was a bit of a cheek for Theresa May to lean over the despatch box and demand her opponent apologise, it does point to the fact that the anti-Semitism crisis in Labour has become a Jeremy Corbyn crisis. This morning some Labour MPs were saying they wanted Mr Corbyn to go in front of a Jewish audience and apologise for his personal failure to tackle anti-Semitism. The response of Team Corbyn has so far been to denounce such people as political malcontents seeking to damage his leadership. But interestingly John McDonnell, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, said maybe the party ought to listen to some of the views of these critical peers and incorporate them into future recommendations. You begin to wonder if the pressure is now becoming so intense that merely circling the wagons and denouncing critics as traitors is no longer sufficient. He said Mrs May should reflect on the impact of her immigration policies when she was home secretary and the failings in the treatment of the families of Windrush settlers.  ""Coming from a prime minister who encouraged the hostile environment, sent 'go home' vans around London and deported British citizens, I think she might look to her own party's and government's records as well."" Labour has been engulfed in a long-running dispute over anti-Semitism, which has seen nine MPs and three peers leave the party. Last week, the BBC's Panorama revealed claims from a number of former party officials that some of Mr Corbyn's closest allies tried to interfere in disciplinary processes involving allegations of anti-Semitism. As well as calls for an investigation into the claims made in the programme, the Labour leadership is also under pressure to adopt an independent complaints process. In the Guardian on Wednesday, the peers said Mr Corbyn had failed to accept responsibility for ""allowing anti-Semitism to grow in our party"". ""The Labour Party welcomes everyone irrespective of race, creed, age, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Except, it seems, Jews,"" the advert said. ""This is your legacy Mr Corbyn,"" it added. ""Labour is no longer a safe place for all members and supporters,"" it said.  About a dozen of the signatories are former ministers who served in the last Labour government - including Peter Mandelson, Beverley Hughes and John Reid. Those who signed make up about a third of the Labour members of the House of Lords. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell hit back, saying the letter was ""completely inaccurate"".  He said some people wanted to use the issue as a ""political weapon"" - but he was focussed on sorting the issue.  When the Panorama documentary aired, a Labour spokesman said the former employees who had talked to the BBC were ""disaffected"", and included some officials ""who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn's leadership"". But more than 200 current and former staff wrote to Mr Corbyn to say the party had treated whistleblowers in an ""appalling and hypocritical"" way, and that the ""moral responsibility"" for the anti-Semitism crisis lay with the party's leader. In February Labour released figures showing that the party received 673 accusations of anti-Semitism by Labour members between April 2018 and January 2019. However the scale of the issue remains disputed. Meanwhile, there have been calls for the Conservatives to commission an independent inquiry into claims of Islamophobia by its members.  Earlier in the leadership contest, Home Secretary Sajid Javid pressed his rivals to sign up for one during a head-to-head debate. Tory chairman Brandon Lewis has also refused to say how many complaints the party has received about Islamophobia, but he has insisted the numbers were ""very, very small"".  Correction 23rd July 2019:  An earlier version of this article inaccurately said that Labour has never confirmed the number of anti-Semitism cases it is investigating and this has been amended to confirm that the party did release figures for a 10 month period in 2018/19."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49089209,Reports of racist abuse rise by 43%,"Reports of racist abuse in English football rose by 43% during the 2018-19 season and can be linked to Brexit, says anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.",24 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Manchester City and England forward Raheem Sterling frequently spoke out against racism last season The rise in reports of racist abuse in football can be linked to Brexit, Kick It Out chief Roisin Wood has claimed. Statistics gathered by the anti-discrimination charity showed reports of racism in English football rose by 43% - from 192 to 274 - last season. ""I think you can't not link them together,"" Wood told BBC Sport. ""We're seeing a lot of reports of 'go back to where you came from' which we haven't seen for a while which seems to be on the back of Brexit."" Factoring in all forms of discrimination, reports of abuse in professional and grassroots football increased by 32% to 422, up from 319 during 2017-18. A further 159 reports were received via social media. Reports of faith-based discrimination - including Islamophobia and anti-Semitism - rose by 75% from 36 to 63, a higher percentage than any other form of abuse during the period. It is the seventh consecutive year reported incidents of discrimination within football have increased, and the 581 total reports is more than double the figure from five years ago. ""If we're seeing a rise in hate crime, the Home Office is seeing a rise in hate crime and other bodies are seeing a rise in hate crime, it's linked because that's what is going on in society at the moment. If it's there, we'll see it in football,"" Wood added. ""In some of the cases we have seen, there is a real hatred there which we haven't maybe seen as much of in the past where it's really violent and very targeted, particularly on social media. ""Some of the social media reports we've seen you wouldn't want anyone to see. ""We're talking to people all the time that feel, post-Brexit, that 'maybe this country isn't for me'. ""[Politicians] have to take that responsibility very seriously, they are the leaders of the country and they need to set the tone. Society is reflected in football."" Responding to the figures, which also showed that reports of abuse in the professional game had increased by 46%, the Football Association said it had made ""huge strides"" in recent years to ensure English football is a ""diverse and inclusive"" game. This includes a new inclusion plan - 'In Pursuit of Progress' - which aims to ""create opportunities in football, both on and off the pitch, for people of all backgrounds"", as well as funding two extra grassroots officers, based at Kick It Out, who work directly with the County FA network. ""We strongly condemn all forms of discrimination and encourage all fans and participants who believe that they have been the subject of, or witness to, discriminatory abuse to report it through the appropriate channels: the FA, our County FA network or via our partners at Kick It Out,"" the FA's statement added. Kick It Out says the FA has not informed them of the outcome in 79% of the 109 discrimination cases reported in grassroots football - 40% of which were from under-18 football. Incidents of racism marred the 2018-19 season, with Raheem Sterling and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang among several players to face abuse. In December, Manchester City and England forward Sterling suffered alleged racist abuse from Chelsea fans during City's 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge, and followed that the next morning with an Instagram post in which he questioned newspapers' portrayal of black players and said it fed prejudice and aggressive behaviour. In March, Sterling was vocal in condemning the racist abuse received by England players during their 5-1 win in Montenegro as well as offering support to his younger team-mate Callum Hudson-Odoi. And in April he was quick to call out Leonardo Bonucci when the Juventus defender suggested that his team-mate Moise Kean was partly to blame for the racist abuse he received from Cagliari fans. He was presented with his Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award in the same month, with FWA chair Carrie Brown citing his public stance on racist abuse as being just as important as his exploits on the pitch. This video can not be played December 2018: Former Liverpool & England footballer John Barnes on racism in football Dan Roan, BBC sports editor Just over two weeks before the start of the new season, these figures serve as a stark warning to English football's authorities.  They know the game here cannot afford a repeat of the high-profile incidents that marred last year, especially with the government urging them to put tackling abuse ""at the top of their agenda"".  Six months ago the outgoing Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley criticised the sport for a lack of leadership and collaboration on the issue. So some will be encouraged by the measures announced today, including a review of FA sanctions and education, and a renewed attempt to improve football's dismal record on job opportunities in coaching and senior administrative roles for BAME candidates.  But others will look at the Â£800,000 total annual funding that Kick It Out has to rely on from the FA, Premier League, Football League and Professional Footballers' Association, and ask whether these bodies should be investing significantly more if such a wealthy sport is serious about making the game more inclusive.  December: Banana skin thrown on to the pitch during the north London derby at Emirates Stadium, after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored for Arsenal December: Raheem Sterling suffers alleged racial abuse during Manchester City's defeat at Chelsea. Sterling later says newspapers are helping to ""fuel racism"" by the ways in which they portray young black footballers March: Chelsea lodge a complaint with Uefa over racist abuse aimed at Callum Hudson-Odoi during Europa League last-16 second leg win at Dynamo Kiev March: England report racist abuse of players during their 5-1 win over Montenegro in Podgorica April: Juventus' 19-year-old Italian forward Moise Kean suffers racist abuse from the stands during a match at Cagliari - with team-mate Leonardo Bonucci's suggestion that Kean was partly to blame called ""laughable"" by Raheem Sterling April: Two incidents of alleged racist abuse, towards Derby winger Duane Holmes and Wigan defender Nathan Byrne, are reported in the Championship  April: Troy Deeney and Watford team-mates Adrian Mariappa and Christian Kabasele receive racist abuse on social media April: Ashley Young receives racist abuse online following Manchester United's Champions League defeat in Barcelona In April, the Professional Footballers' Association asked players to send them evidence of racist online abuse in order to demonstrate to governing bodies the severity of the issue. The PFA planned to show the posts to the sports minister and a number of football bodies at a meeting in May, while meetings with Twitter and Facebook were also requested after a number of high-profile incidents. Players were previously encouraged to boycott social media for 24 hours as part of the #Enough campaign. The release of Kick It Out's figures came as the FA, Premier League and EFL published a joint letter to sports minister Mims Davies, in which they outlined measures they are taking to tackle discrimination in football next season. This includes a review of how both clubs and the FA sanction discrimination, improved steward training, improved reporting methods and providing more opportunities for BAME people in coaching, refereeing, management and administrative positions. In a statement, an EFL spokesman said it is ""committed to working collectively to ensure football is a game for all"". ""While today's announcement suggests more work needs to be done, the results of our recent supporters survey demonstrates clubs are working hard to make football as inclusive as possible. The survey stated 86% of respondents believed their club offered a 'welcoming and inclusive matchday experience for all supporters."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50408438,The early scalps of the general election,Dredging up dirt on rivals has never been easier - leaving some wannabe MPs rueing online indiscretions.,19 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The deadline for wannabe MPs to throw their hats into the ring passed on Thursday afternoon - but some didn't even make it that far. Up and down the country, candidates for the 2019 general election were forced to pull out of the race - and be replaced - before getting their names on ballot papers.  The stories behind these party-managed deselections are all different. But while some candidates have been forced to step down for more traditional reasons, such as policy differences with their parties, many have found themselves hostages to their past lives on social media.  Of the 23 identified by BBC research to have stood aside in the run-up to the deadline, about a third did so because of some kind of past online transgression.   Seven of Labour's selections lost their status in the run-up to the 14 November deadline. Art critic Matthew Collings had secured his place in South West Norfolk until allegations were made about posts on his social media accounts dismissing claims of anti-Semitism in the party as a ""witch hunt"" and describing a former chief rabbi as a ""notorious hate-filled racist"". He denied posting anything that ""could possibly be anti-Semitic"" but was removed just a day after his nomination.  Kate Ramsden was due to run in Gordon, Aberdeenshire, until the Jewish Chronicle highlighted a blog post from her in which she compared Israel to an abused child who becomes an abusive adult. The party withdrew its support and she quit.   And Frances Hoole lost her candidacy in Edinburgh South West over a social media post showing her with a bottle of Cillit Bang cleaning spray pointed towards an image of her SNP rival Joanna Cherry. The next three candidates were knocked out for different reasons. Gideon Bull, who was set to run as a candidate in Clacton, Essex, stood down after admitting to using the Jewish slur ""Shylock"" in a private council meeting - though he said he hadn't realised it was offensive.  Sally Gimson was selected by local members to run for the seat of Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, but then removed by Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) after  complaints from members of another local party where she used to be a councillor. And Laura Davies - who ran for the party in both 2015 and 2017 - was deselected by the NEC for the Shrewsbury seat after she disagreed with her local party over plans to shake up hospital provision in the area. Finally, Ed Murphy was ditched as Labour candidate in Cambridgeshire North West at the last minute before the deadline - with no reason made public by the party.  Three of the candidates chosen by the Conservative Party lost their chances to run before Thursday's cut-off point. Former BBC presenter Nick Conrad stood down after critics attacked comments he made on the radio in 2014, saying women should ""keep their knickers on"" in a discussion on rape. Antony Calvert had been due to run for the seat of Wakefield, but Facebook posts were discovered where he criticised the appearance of his Labour rival, Mary Creagh. Mr Calvert also said if the deceased Libyan dictator Col Muammar Gaddafi had wanted to walk the streets unrecognised ""he should surely have fled to Bradford"". He said the posts were more than 10 years old and had not intended to cause offence - but still had to step down.  The former MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, Chris Davies, had been chosen as the candidate for Ynys Mon. But he pulled out after some of his fellow Welsh Tories criticised his candidacy because of a previous conviction for claiming false expenses. And, in the Scottish constituency of Aberdeen North, Conservative candidate Roger Houghton has been suspended from the party. over alleged anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and homophobic comments. He will remain a candidate, but without the party's support. The Liberal Democrats have lost five of their selected candidates. Two went in September, even before the mad rush to get all the seats covered. Galen Milne stood for the party in Banff and Buchan in 2017 and had been due to run again. He was deselected after posting on social media that Tories should be ""burned at the stake"". Kirsten Johnson bowed out of running in North Devon over a race row that erupted after an interview she gave on BBC radio.  Kevin McNamara had been the Lib Dem's candidate in Thurrock until he resigned after social media posts of his from a decade ago were shared,  allegedly containing homophobic and racist comments. Rob Flello used to be a Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent South, and had been set to run for the Lib Dems in the same seat - until the party discovered he had voted against gay marriage and gay adoption. They said his values ""greatly... diverge from ours"".  For Tim Walker, the decision to stand down was more political. He decided not to be the Lib Dem candidate in Canterbury as he did not want to split the Remain vote between himself and Labour's Rosie Duffield, who had only won the seat from the Tories by 187 votes. The Brexit Party decided not to run candidates in the end in 317 Conservative seats. Besides this, eight of its candidates have been deselected or stepped aside for other reasons.  The party's ""Workington Man"" Philip Walling was removed from running in the constituency after he took to Twitter to back Boris Johnson's deal. This was before Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage moved towards the PM's view. Jill Hughes had been due to stand in the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen, but stood down after social media posts revealed some unusual beliefs, including a claim that extra-terrestrials were working with world governments in a ""hush-hush"" arrangement. Prabhjit Dhillon was going to take on Warwick and Leamington for his party - but gave up the candidacy after posts were discovered on his social media, saying ""moderate Muslims... sit back and look the other way while jihadists fight"".  Calum Walker quit from running in SNP-held Dundee East after Mr Farage's decision to stand down 317 candidates in Tory-held seats. He tweeted that he feared splitting the Leave vote in the area could lead to a Labour government ""propped up by the SNP"".  Louis Stedman-Byrce pulled out in Labour-held Glasgow North East for the same reason.  On deadline day, Rupert Lowe decided not to contest Labour-held Dudley North for fear he would ""split the vote"" with the Tories, and allow Labour back in. Andy Wood also pulled out in Hove, urging voters to back the Conservative candidate.  Finally, Owen Prew was not nominated in Canterbury - where he had been expected to run. The reason is not clear.  In many of these cases, it's clear social media is proving a check on people's ambitions for public life. Tweet dredging - going through people's social media history to look for incriminating posts - has grown massively. And it's not just in politics, says the BBC's digital elections reporter Joe Tidy. ""Just ask the actor and comedian Kevin Hart who lost his dream job of Oscars host last year thanks to the internet unearthing homophobic jokes from the actor's dusty old Twitter archive,"" he says.  So the 2019 election was undoubtedly going to see the effects. ""The methods have improved a great deal because of how much more schooled on internet use everyone has become,"" said Tidy. ""Every year, more and more people are graduating from 'the school of the internet' - able to carry out bulk searches of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram pages to dredge up stuff that has long been forgotten about. "" Many of such controversial comments were posted several years ago at a time when both the posters and the internet were less enlightened, so, he says, ""you can see how easy it is for careers to crumble"". There is some talk in the tech world of an ""auto-delete"" function to permanently erase posts after two or three years. Tidy says this could reduce the chances of people's careers being ruined by silly youthful outbursts online.  ""Then again,"" he adds, ""some argue that these glimpses into the past are a useful insight into the true characters of the people being thrust into public life."" So has there been an unusual rise in candidates standing down before this election? That is statistically very hard to work out, says our political correspondent Jessica Parker. ""There are no official records and it's worth remembering that people can pull out, under the radar, for all sorts of unremarkable reasons,"" she says. ""After rows about allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour and Islamophobia in the Conservatives, parties feel under pressure to show a zero-tolerance approach."" Brexit is another ingredient, she says, leading, as it does, to people withdrawing so as not to split the Leave or Remain vote.  Maybe it won't be like this forever. Parker says would-be politicians may learn to be more cautious online.  ""But whether Brexit will continue to test party loyalties in the same way: well,"" she concludes, ""that's anyone's guess."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45112792,Why some Muslim women wear the veil,"The differences between a hijab, niqab and burka - and why some women wear them while others don't.",8 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and for comparing them to ""bank robbers"" - prompting calls for him to apologise and be expelled from the Conservative Party. But Mr Johnson's comments, which some believe will aggravate Islamophobic tensions in the UK, have also highlighted some confusion about what a burka is - as the veil revealing just the eyes is, in fact, known as a niqab. So what actually are the differences between the various types of Islamic dress for women and what governs their choices?  The Koran, Islam's holy book, tells Muslims - men and women - to dress modestly. Male modesty has been interpreted to be covering the area from the navel to the knee. For women it is generally seen as covering everything except their face, hands and feet when in the presence of men they are not related or married to. However, there has been much debate within Islam as to whether this goes far enough. This has led to a distinction between the hijab (literally ""covering up"" in Arabic) and the niqab (meaning ""full veil""). The hijab is typically a scarf that covers the hair and neck, whereas the niqab is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf or an abaya, a full-length robe, and sometimes with a separate transparent eye veil.  The burka is the most concealing - covering the entire face and body, leaving just a mesh screen to see through. UK mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, says it's ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments show a ""lack of knowledge"". The ""majority of the women who wear the burka"" she says, are born and brought up in Britain. They are ""educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters none of whom wear a burka. ""I haven't forced my daughters into it because I don't have to,"" she said. ""It's not a must. It's not an obligation. However... [it] gets you closer to God. It's a spiritual thing more than anything else."" She is ""not under an obligation"" to cover her face but does so because it is ""emulating"" the Prophet Muhammad. So, how does she respond if asked to remove her covering for security reasons? ""I'm happy to take my veil off,"" she said, citing the example of being asked to at a bank. ""When I travel, and I do travel, sometimes I don't even wear [it] because I think it's a lot easier not to [for] security reasons. ""To make comments that they (women who wear burkas) look like bank robbers, I don't think it's fair."" Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, wears the niqab but told BBC News she sometimes gets verbal abuse from others for her choice of veil. ""A week ago someone abused me and said 'you're an ugly terrorist' when I tried to park my car near where I live,"" she said. ""Two years ago, when I was passing by one department to another at Heath Hospital, someone passed by and said 'don't cut off my head you're ISIS'. It's quite painful [to hear]."" In 2014, BBC News' Shaimaa Khalil wrote about why she stopped wearing her headscarf, only to put it back on again when she became the Pakistan correspondent. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who lives in New York, does not wear a face veil and supports a ban on them. She said the number of women wearing them in the West is increasing in part because girls begin to wear them before they reach puberty and many were not given a choice.    Muslim scholars have long debated whether it is obligatory to wear the burka or niqab, or whether it is just recommended. There have also been more liberal interpretations which say any headscarf is unnecessary, as long as women maintain the sartorial modesty stipulated in the Koran. That holy text addresses ""the faithful women"" who are told to shield their private parts and not to display their adornment ""except what is apparent of it"". Scholarly disputes revolve around what this last phrase means. Does it refer to the outer surface of a woman's garments, necessitating that she cover every part of her body - ie don the full niqab? Or does it give an exemption referring to the face and the hands, as well as conventional female ornaments such as kohl, rings, bracelets and make-up? The latter interpretation has been adopted by some of the most prominent scholars from Islamic history who favour the hijab - headscarf - option. There are additional Koranic instructions - seen as ambiguous and therefore much debated - for women to draw the ""khimar"" (scarf) to cover the ""jayb"" (bosom/upper chest), and for ""the wives and daughters of the Prophet and the women of the believers to draw their ""jalabib"" (cloaks) close round them"". When contacted by BBC Reality Check, both the Women's Muslim Council and Faith Matters (an organisation which promotes integration) said accurate numbers weren't available for the UK.  But there does seem to be consensus that the figure is likely to be low.  Dr Omar Khan, director at the Runnymede Trust, a think tank that deals with race equality, said that it is likely to be ""less than 1% [of the Muslim female population] - how much less is difficult to know"". Sunder Katwala, director of think tank British Future, acknowledged a lack of a ""robust methodology"", but said there was a ""ballpark estimate in region of 3,000-5,000"" with it ""very unlikely to be as high as 1-2%"" of the female Muslim population.  These are both estimates by experts working in relevant fields, but until specific research is carried out, it will be difficult to know how prevalent the full-face veil is.  What we do know is that in the 2011 census, Muslims represented 4.8% of the population of England and Wales.  Using the most recent population estimates, this would mean there are roughly 1.43 million Muslim women living in the two nations.  If the number of Muslim women wearing the niqab were to be as high as 1% - this would equate to just over 14,000 women - but, again, the 1% figure is just an estimate.  In other European countries, the figure also appears to be low. In 2009, a French Interior Ministry report estimated that just 0.1% of French Muslim women wore full-face veils which, at the time, equated to 1,900 women.  In Austria, a ban of full face veils in public spaces was said to affect just 0.03% of the Muslim population, according to Nilufar Ahmed, a senior lecturer in public health at Swansea University.  In Belgium between 150 and 200 women wore the niqab before a ban came into force, says Michael Privot, director of the European Network Against Racism.  Between 150 and 200 women in Demark - which banned face veils in public this month - wore a niqab or burqa on a daily basis.  That's 0.1% of Muslim women in the country, according to the Guardian. While Boris Johnson's comments about Islamic face veils have provoked consternation among some, his defenders have said they were made as part of an argument against banning such garments. Other countries though, have taken this step. France was the first European country to ban full-face veils - ie burkas and niqabs - in public places in April 2011, seven years after it introduced a law prohibiting conspicuous religious symbols in state schools. It was followed a few months later by Belgium, which banned the wearing of partial or total face veils in public on the grounds of security. Full or partial bans on full-face veils have since been in place in Austria, Bulgaria, the southern German state of Bavaria and, since 1 August, Denmark. There have been protests against Denmark's new law, which does not mention burkas and niqabs by name, but says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"". Repeat offenders could be fined 10,000 ($1,500; £1,200) kroner. By contrast, in Iran the law requires women to wear modest ""Islamic"" clothing. In practice, this means women must wear a chador, a full-body cloak, or a headscarf and a manteau (overcoat) that covers their arms. There are posters in cities and towns comparing unveiled women to unwrapped candy and lollipops attracting unwanted attention from flies. Recently, some Iranian women have protested against this law by taking off their headscarf in public. One woman was jailed for two years in March for doing this."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43103888,Leonard: Equal pay women 'owed apology',"The Scottish Labour leader says there was ""too much resistance"" to the council workers' equal pay claims.",18 Feb 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Scottish Labour leader has said women in Glasgow City Council are owed an apology for ""too much resistance"" to their equal pay claims when the local authority was under Labour control. Richard Leonard said Labour settled many equal pay claims but there was ""too much legal obstruction"". The party was in power in the city for decades before being ousted by the SNP last May. He was speaking to the party's Women's Conference in Glasgow. The council dropped its legal challenge in January with cross-party agreement.  It had previously lost a Court of Session appeal against an Employment Appeal Tribunal ruling that they had continued to discriminate against women through the introduction of payment protections upholding the earnings of male colleagues following the initial wave of equal pay awards. Unison said the women want a fair and transparent pay scheme and compensation and that the council has agreed to discuss a settlement for the 11,000 claimants with it and other trade unions. Mr Leonard said: ""I am pleased that we are now on the right side of the argument with equal pay in Glasgow City Council. ""Many equal pay claims were settled under Labour in Glasgow, but there was too much resistance, too much legal obstruction and for that I think we owe those women an apology."" He emphasised plans to tackle discrimination and harassment within Scottish Labour and wider society in the wake of the sexual harassment scandals at Westminster and Holyrood. His focus on discrimination follows his leadership rival and fellow MSP Anas Sarwar speaking out about his own experiences of abuse and criticism of Mr Leonard's decision not to suspend MP Hugh Gaffney, who apologised earlier this month after making ""deeply offensive and unacceptable"" remarks about the LGBT community and Chinese people. Scottish Labour has announced plans to set-up a special sub-committee of the party's Scottish executive to develop an anti-discrimination and harassment policy. Mr Leonard said: ""Over the past few months the culture of politics, particularly in relation to gender equality, has rightly come under the spotlight. ""Politicians - including some in the Labour party - have been found to engage in behaviour, that falls well below the standards we in this room, and in this party and in this movement, expect and deserve. ""There has, once again, been a breakdown of trust between politicians and those they hope to serve. So my job, our job is to work to rebuild that trust. ""We will work to ensure women across Scotland know that the Labour Party stands up for them. We will work to end discrimination both within the party and without."" He added: ""Scottish Labour, under my leadership, will be at the forefront of the drive for equality."" Mr Leonard said he had already taken steps to make the party more equal, adding: ""That action comes from the one driving principle - that there is no place for any form of discrimination in the Labour Party, be it sexism, be it homophobia, be it racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia."""

Stuart Seldowitz has acknowledged in media interviews that he is the man seen in viral video calling the vendor a ""terrorist"". He alleged the individual had provoked him by expressing support for Hamas. The halal cart man, named in reports as Mohamed Hussein, denied to media he made any comments in favour of Hamas. A New York Police Department spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that Mr Seldowitz had been taken into custody on Wednesday.  He is facing multiple charges, including aggravated harassment, hate crime and stalking, CBS, the BBC's US partner, reported.  The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Seldowitz for comment. In the viral videos, he is seen at the food cart at different times of day.  In one clip he says: ""If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids, you know what, it wasn't enough."" In another interaction, viewed more than 40 million times, according to X, formerly known as Twitter, he calls the vendor ""ignorant"", suggests his family could be tortured by the Egyptian secret police and makes inflammatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad and the Quran.  During another encounter, a bystander is heard saying: ""You're harassing this man."" Mr Seldowitz had a long career in the US Department of State, including in the Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs, and was a White House National Security Council director under President Barack Obama.  The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday that Mr Seldowitz had confirmed it was him in the clips.  ""The bottom line is, yes, it's me,"" the outlet quoted him as saying.  He said he thought ""there should be some comment back to someone who is endorsing terrorism and the killing of innocent civilians"". In an interview with City & State, Mr Seldowitz was quoted as saying: ""I regret the whole thing happened and I'm sorry.  ""But you know, in the heat of the moment, I said things that probably I shouldn't have said.""  Mr Seldowitz formerly worked for a lobbying company, Gotham Government Relations, which said in a statement on Tuesday that his actions were ""vile, racist and beneath the dignity of the standards we practice at our firm"". A press release issued by the company in November 2022 called him the firm's ""Foreign Affairs Chair"". But David Schwartz, Gotham's founder and president, said that Mr Seldowitz hadn't done any work for the firm for about five years and that the title was an honorary one.  ""I am incensed, I am outraged, and I am beyond words,"" Mr Schwartz told the BBC.  ""This is not the person that I knew, he was very intelligent, he was honoured by the state department and won three awards. ""But when I saw that video, within seconds I knew we had to act, and I did not hesitate. We have severed all ties."" Many New Yorkers have expressed support on social media for Mr Hussein, the food truck vendor.  New York Mayor Eric Adams posted on X: ""Islamophobia is hate. Plain and simple.  ""This vile, disrespectful rhetoric has no home in our city. We reject it - and we're glad to see we're not alone."" Mr Hussein, originally from Egypt, told the New York Post he intended to sue Mr Seldowitz. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."

Pinder Chauhan says she had experienced racist abuse since first being elected as a councillor in Northampton in 2017. She has been selected to stand in Bedford at the next general election.  She said ""very graphic"" drawings had been sent to her home and on WhatsApp, and she had experienced verbal abuse in the street. Ms Chauhan, who currently serves on West Northamptonshire Council, said ""very graphic"" drawings were sent to her home after she won the Sixfields ward in Northampton on the now-defunct Northamptonshire County Council. ""They were hand delivered so someone had physically gone to my doorstep and all I could think was that my kids and husband were in the house,"" she said. ""You automatically start thinking about their safety."" Ms Chauhan said the abuse had got worse since she was selected to stand for the Conservatives at the next general election, which is due by January 2025. ""It started off on social media where if I visited a temple I'd dress traditionally, but I'd get messages saying go back to your own country; I'd been born in England, so this is my country,"" she said. The BBC has seen the image of the pig's head that she was sent via Whats App. ""I was in the middle of party conference, so I'm feeling incredibly worried because phone calls started at the same time,"" she said.  ""All of a sudden this is in your personal space, it's on your phone and not just online."" She also shared her experience of an incident when she started out as a councillor in Northamptonshire. ""Someone on the street came right up to my face and said he was from the British National Party and I had to take a step back as he was that close to me,"" she said. ""I was with about five or six people, but even then someone was willing to be that close."" Ms Chauhan, who represents the East Hunsbury and Shelfleys ward and is cabinet member for flooding on West Northants Council, said these incidents would not stop her continuing her political career. ""I try not to think about it; I love listening to people and love being out there; I feel this is what I was born to do, as cliched as that sounds,"" she said. ""Politics is a massive platform for change - that's why I do it and I think that drive outweighs the negatives. ""It is part of being a politician - you do have to have a strong skin, but a lot of it is really unacceptable."" She said people who send these messages should ""think about the impact it has"".  ""There are other ways of communicating and you don't have to threaten, but ultimately I think for someone to do that they have to probably not be in the right place mentally,"" she added. Bedfordshire Police's hate crime lead Sgt Daniel O'Mahoney said: ""We treat all reports of hate crime with the utmost severity and members of the public should be confident in reporting incidents to us and know that they will be investigated thoroughly.  ""We continue to work with a number of partners across the region around hate crime, and I would encourage anyone who has been the victim of an incident to get in touch with us right away, either through our website or by calling 101.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67655910,Elizabeth Magill: UPenn loses $100m donation after House antisemitism testimony,A major University of Pennsylvania donor withdraws grant after Congress hearing about antisemitism on campus.,9 Dec 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A major University of Pennsylvania donor has withdrawn a $100m (£79.3m) grant after a controversial appearance in Congress by the school's president. In an email seen by the BBC, Ross Stevens said he was ""appalled"" Elizabeth Magill avoided questions about how students calling for the genocide of Jews would be punished. Ms Magill was grilled by politicians on Tuesday about antisemitism on campus. She has since apologised for her remarks, but is facing calls to resign. US media are reporting the advisory board at Wharton - the university's business school - has written a letter to Ms Magill calling for her to step down ""with immediate effect"".   American college campuses have seen angry protests and rising incidents of antisemitism since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted two months ago.  Ms Magill appeared in the House of Representatives alongside the presidents of Harvard and MIT, Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth. They were asked by Republican New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik: ""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university's] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?""  Ms Magill and her MIT and Harvard counterparts did not reply yes or no but said - in varying ways - that it depended on the ""context"".  There has been a widespread backlash since, with the White House condemning the remarks. ""The lack of moral clarity is unacceptable,"" Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, the highest-ranking Jewish member of the administration, said on Thursday at a ceremony to mark the lighting of the national menorah. In his message about the withdrawal of the donation, Mr Stevens said: ""I have clear grounds to rescind Penn's $100 million of Stone Ridge shares due to the conduct of President Magill.""  The founder and CEO of Stone Ridge Asset Management, he told the university that its ""permissive approach"" to those calling for violence against Jewish people ""would violate any policies or rules that prohibit harassment and discrimination based on religion, including those of Stone Ridge"". Penn is one of the oldest universities in the US and a part of the elite Ivy League group, which also has Harvard, Columbia and Yale as members.  Wharton counts former US President Donald Trump, Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, and many other powerful names in business and finance among its graduates.  The donation, in the form of limited partnership units in Stone Ridge, was gifted by Mr Stevens in 2017 to help Wharton create a finance innovation centre.  Ms Magill in particular has faced mounting scrutiny as to whether she can continue in her position.  She released a video on the university's website on Wednesday apologising for her response during the hearing, saying that she was focused on the ""university's long-standing policies - aligned with the US Constitution - which say that speech alone is not punishable"". She added she should have been focused on the ""irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate"", adding that it is ""evil, plain and simple"".  While her apology on Wednesday was welcomed by some, Mr Stevens' letter appeared to call for her resignation.   He said Stone Ridge would welcome the opportunity to review its decision ""if, and when, there is a new University President in place"". On Wednesday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - a non-voting trustee at UPenn - criticised Ms Magill for her ""absolutely shameful"" remarks and called on the university to make a ""serious decision"" on her continued leadership. ""It should not be hard to condemn genocide,"" he said. ""Leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity, and Liz Magill failed to meet that simple test."" A petition demanding Ms Magill's resignation had gathered more than 23,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon. Facing criticism over her own remarks at Tuesday's hearing, Harvard President Dr Gay apologised in an interview with the college newspaper, saying she ""got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures"". The House Committee on Education and the Workforce announced on Thursday that they will formally investigate Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over ""rampant antisemitism"". ""Committee members have deep concerns with their leadership and their failure to take steps to provide Jewish students the safe learning environment they are due under law,"" the committee's chairwoman Virginia Foxx said in a statement.  Two University of Pennsylvania students - both of whom are Jewish - filed a lawsuit against the school on Thursday, claiming it has become ""an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment and discrimination."" The lawsuit also accuses the school of ""selectively"" enforcing rules of conduct ""to avoid protecting Jewish students"" and hiring ""rabidly antisemitic professors who call for anti-Jewish violence"".  Islamophobic attacks have also been on the rise on university campuses.  The Department of Education has launched an investigation into multiple schools over alleged incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia."

In May, Holland Park School in Kensington, west London, was found to have a ""culture of fear and favouritism"". An investigation by its governors uncovered ""public humiliation"" or shouting used as a behaviour policy. Pupils and teachers were also subject to sexism, Islamophobia and racism. The school announced last year that former headteacher Colin Hall would retire early, while a new chair of governors was appointed. Now Ofsted has concluded that ""turbulence"" in the school's leadership had ""destabilised"" the school community. Inspectors found many aspects of school life, including pupils' behaviour, had ""declined substantially"" since a previous inspection seven years ago. The inspectorate said that pupils and staff had ""welcomed the governors' intervention to stop previous behaviour management strategies that they deemed unacceptable"". However, behaviour policies had not been updated, leaving a ""vacuum"" with staff and students confused over how to deal with unacceptable behaviour, some of which was spilling into the local area after school, Ofsted said. A spokesperson for the school said: ""Ofsted has independently identified many of the long-term, historical weaknesses which governors have also been concerned about, and which they have been working extremely hard, with school leaders, staff, and external partners, to put right. ""These serious problems were also set out in the independent investigation report and in the Notice To Improve that the government issued to the school last year. ""We now ask that the whole school community comes together and unites around a strategy to support the school to reach the standards that our students deserve."" The Department for Education previously issued the school with a Notice to Improve in November, highlighting financial mismanagement as well as leaders' ""excessive salaries and failure to seek prior approval from the government for 'novel and contentious' expenditure"".

The UAE, Oman, Indonesia, Iraq, the Maldives, Jordan, Libya and Bahrain have joined the growing list of countries in the Islamic world that have condemned the remarks. Earlier, Kuwait, Iran and Qatar had called Indian ambassadors to register their protest, and Saudi Arabia had issued a strongly worded statement.  Indian diplomats have been trying to placate these countries - it shares cordial relations with most of them - but the storm is far from over.  At the centre of this controversy is Nupur Sharma, who was a spokesperson of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She made the remark in a televised debate last month, and videos of her statement had gone viral. Naveen Jindal, who was media head of the party's Delhi unit, had also posted a provocative tweet on the issue.  Critics say Ms Sharma and Mr Jindal's comments reflect the deep religious polarisation that the country has been witnessing over the past few years. Hate speech and attacks against Muslims have risen sharply since the BJP came to power in 2014. Their comments - especially Ms Sharma's - angered the country's minority Muslim community, leading to sporadic protests in some states. The BBC is not repeating Ms Sharma's remarks as they are offensive in nature. The two leaders have issued public apologies and the party has suspended Ms Sharma and expelled Mr Jindal.   ""The BJP strongly denounces insults of any religious personalities of any religion. The BJP is also against any ideology which insults or demeans any sect or religion. The BJP does not promote such people or philosophy,"" it said in a statement. But experts say that the BJP's response may not be enough after what looked like the country's internal matter took an international turn. The anger in the Islamic world is evident from some of the statements from these countries.  Qatar said it expected a public apology from India.  ""Allowing such Islamophobic remarks to continue without punishment, constitutes a grave danger to the protection of human rights and may lead to further prejudice and marginalisation, which will create a cycle of violence and hate,"" Qatar's ministry of foreign affairs said. Saudi Arabia also used some strong words in its statement. ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its condemnation and denunciation of the statements made by the spokeswoman of the BJP,"" it said. India's ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, said the remarks from some ""fringe elements"" did not represent the views of the Indian government. Senior BJP leaders and other diplomats have also condemned the controversial statement. The 57-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and Pakistan have also criticised India. But Delhi criticised both, as it usually does, saying their comments were ""unwarranted and narrow-minded"".  Analysts say that the top leadership of the party and the government may have to make public statements on the issue. Not doing so, they say, runs the risk of damaging India's ties with the Arab world and Iran. India's trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman and the UAE, stood at $87 billion in 2020-21. Millions of Indians live and work in these countries and send millions of dollars in remittances back home. The region is also the top source for India's energy imports.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a regular visitor to the region since coming to power in 2014. The country has already signed a free trade agreement with the UAE and is in talks with the GCC for a wider deal. Mr Modi famously attended the ground-breaking ceremony of the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi in 2018 - it was termed as an example of the growing ties between India and the region.   Against this backdrop, the UAE's decision to join the chorus against India is quite significant. The relations between the two countries have significantly improved in the past few years. The UAE has also backed India at multi-nation forums.  Experts said the controversy could overshadow some of India's recent diplomatic successes with the UAE and other nations. While Delhi's relations with Tehran have been lukewarm over the past few years, the controversy could overshadow Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian's upcoming visit to India. Another former diplomat Anil Trigunayat, who has served in the Arab world, said that India was in a difficult situation and only sincere efforts at the leadership level could prevent negative fallout. Other analysts say the diplomatic cost from the fallout could greatly hurt India's interests in the region.  ""Indian officials often react defensively when foreign capitals, including close friends of New Delhi, criticise Indian domestic matters. But in this case, expect Indian diplomats to work quickly to defuse tensions with apologies and other forms of damage control,"" said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center think-tank. Arab nations are also looking to take concrete action to soothe anger among their own people. Hashtags criticising India have been trending in these countries and the incident has been the top story in their media outlets.  Some of these hashtags have called for a boycott of Indian products. There have also been reports of some stores in Qatar and Kuwait removing Indian products from their shelves. A sign in Arabic at the Al-Ardiya Co-Operative Society supermarket in Kuwait read: ""We have removed Indian products."" But analysts, including Mr Kugelman, believe that despite the public display of anger, the relationship was important to both the GCC and India and both sides would be looking at mitigating the risks.  ""As concerned as Delhi should be about this angry response from such a strategically critical region, India is also shielded from further damage by its own clout. Because of their economic interests, Gulf states need India to keep importing their energy, they need Indians to continue living and working there, and overall, they need to keep doing business with India,"" he said. He added that there might be limits to how far these countries would go in responding to these anti-Muslim comments.  Critics say that religious polarisation has increased in India since the BJP came to power. And the past few weeks have been particularly tense after some Hindu groups went to a local court in Varanasi to seek permission to pray at a centuries-old mosque, claiming that it was built on the ruins of a demolished temple. TV channels have held provocative debates and social media has seen rampant hate over the issue. Many people associated with right-wing organisations often make controversial statements on TV shows, but critics say Ms Sharma wasn't a ""fringe element"" as the BJP has claimed. She was an official spokesperson of the party, tasked with representing the BJP's views. Analysts add that the international fallout over the controversy should be a wake-up call for India and it should learn that divisive politics can have international ramifications.  ""Delhi is learning that when it comes to the country's increasingly toxic politics, what happens in India often doesn't stay in India. As India's global clout grows and its diplomatic and economic partnerships abroad become stronger, there's more at stake when its domestic politics cause unhappiness abroad,"" Mr Kugelman said."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50676921,Farage defends decision not to contest Tory seats,"The Brexit Party leader claims his party are ""tearing chunks out of the Labour vote"", as three of its MEPs quit.",6 Dec 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Nigel Farage has defended his ""difficult"" decision not to contest Tory-held seats, insisting he was putting ""country before party"". The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Neil that his party had stopped the ""Lib Dem surge"" and were ""tearing chunks out of the Labour vote"". He said his party was the challenger in Labour-Leave areas in next week's poll. It comes as three Brexit Party MEPs quit to support the Tories, saying the party will split the pro-Brexit vote. Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Lance Forman and Lucy Harris resigned the whip on Thursday, with Ms Rees-Mogg - Tory minister Jacob Rees-Mogg's sister - saying it was ""tragic"" that the Brexit Party ""are now the very party risking Brexit"". Mr Farage announced in November that his party would not contest the 317 Westminster seats the Conservatives won in 2017, in order to help Leave-supporting candidates win. Some have been critical of this decision, including MEP John Longworth, who lost the Brexit Party whip in the European Parliament on Wednesday for not support his leader's strategy. He is now backing the Conservatives. Andy Wigmore, from the Leave.EU group Mr Farage fronted at the 2016 referendum, said the former Brexit Party MEPs had made the ""right decision at the right time"" to back the Conservatives.  ""It's time for Nigel to join them,"" he added in a tweet.  During the 30-minute interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Farage was asked about his election strategy, Islamophobic remarks made by two of his candidates and whether the NHS should be ""on the table"" in any post-Brexit trade talks with the US. The Brexit Party leader denied being marginalised at the general election. Mr Farage said: ""I don't think if you came with me and visited some of the Labour heartlands in the north you would think that and I also think that what we've done is have a very dramatic effect on this election. ""I think, number one, the decision, difficult decision, I took in 317 seats to stand down. ""What that's done is that's poleaxed the Liberal Democrats. They were going to win in south London down through Surrey, right out to the west of England they were going to win a lot of seats if we'd stood. And I knew that wasn't the right thing to do."" Mr Farage claimed the Brexit Party had prevented a ""surge"" from the pro-EU Lib Dems and had, therefore, blocked a second EU referendum. ""What we are actually doing now is tearing chunks out of the Labour vote,"" he said. He blamed his failure to form a so-called ""Leave alliance"" between his party and the Conservative Party for the election on the Tories. ""The Conservative Party didn't want to do it,"" he said. On his call for political reform, including scrapping the House of Lords and changing the voting system, he said: ""At this stage we don't look like fundamentally reforming British politics, but do I think there is an appetite for it? Absolutely."" Mr Farage said he believed Boris Johnson would win the election and that was his preference in a choice with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. But he said he was undecided who to vote for in the Conservative-held constituency where he lives. Andrew Neil also challenged Mr Farage on Islamophobic comments made by two of his candidates in in Edinburgh South West and Birmingham Ladywood. ""Any attempt that gets made to try and paint the Brexit Party into being a right-wing political party that would harbour anybody with extreme views is completely and utterly wrong,"" he said. ""We are, in terms of the mix of our candidates, if I look at what we put forward for the European elections, we had more diversity of background, of class, of race, than any other party."" On Brexit, Mr Farage said he wanted to see ""some amendments"" to Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, saying: ""If we don't we are not going to get a clean break from the EU."" And on whether he thinks NHS drug prices would be ""on the table"" in post-Brexit trade deal talks with the US, Mr Farage said the suggestion was ""ludicrous because no British government will sign up to more expensive drugs"". He said he believed that ""wealthier people should be encouraged to take out private insurance to lift the burden off a system that is struggling to cope"". ""When it comes to opening up the NHS for privatisation, do you want the truth? It's already happened."" In a special series of election interviews, Andrew Neil has already questioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date to taking part, which has prompted a political row and accusations from Labour that he is ""running scared""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-53588018,The 'fighting Islamophobia' books for young adults,"Fiction books have been providing a ""counter-narrative"" to anti-Muslim views, research suggests.",24 Aug 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A girl being groomed to become a suicide bomber might not sound like the most child-friendly novel. But fiction books about terrorism and radicalisation have been helping children and young adults ""resist extremism and Islamophobia"" since the 9/11 terror attacks, new research suggests.  Nearly 3,000 people were killed and thousands more injured on 11 September 2001. The following month, US forces launched military action in Afghanistan and the ""War on Terror"" began.  A consequence of that, according to Cambridge University's Dr Blanka Grzegorczyk, was Muslim and immigrant communities being ""presented by the media as posing a threat to the core of British culture, nationhood and identity"". British authors have been ""writing back"" against that portrayal, suggests her Cambridge study - the first to examine the wave of books commissioned after 9/11 and 7/7 by children's publishers that deal with those themes. Dr Grzegorczyk looked at 28 books published since 2001, like one by Noughts and Crosses author Malorie Blackman. Many of the books ""depict the ramped-up security measures adopted by the British state"", Dr Grzegorczyk says, that ""in tandem with the media's cultivation of a certain paranoia"" helped promote a ""constant fear"" of Muslims.  She says books like Run, Riot by Nikesh Shukla - about a group of teenagers pursued by the police after one of them films the politically-sanctioned murder of an ethnic minority youth - ""communicate across the tribal divide that young people have grown up with"". ""They are offering young audiences a counter-narrative to that anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric,"" Dr Grzegorczyk tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Muhammad Khan's I Am Thunder - about a British Asian girl whose marginalisation leaves her vulnerable to radicalisation - also featured in the study. ""The way we often talk about those things in the media and our everyday lives feels quite simplistic,"" says Reuben Thomas. Reading I Am Thunder gave the 27-year-old a different perspective on radicalisation and Islam, he says. The portrayal of the main character suggests there are various factors - such as prejudice and bullying - that can lead to someone being radicalised. ""This book does a really good job of showing the nuance and complexity, without it being a victim narrative."" Reuben says he has a clearer understanding of ""the insidious nature of radicalisation"" because the book ""humanised the people involved and encouraged some empathy"". He says there are ""horrendous narratives"" in the media about young people being in gangs and religion being a negative thing - particularly for Muslims and British Asians - but the book ""dispelled so many of the myths"". ""It stripped all that away and looked at people as individuals, focusing on similarities rather than differences."" You might also be interested in: These books feature characters who form bonds beyond racial, cultural, religious or national divides. The study suggests this can help readers imagine a future based on shared values. Siobhan Dunlop agrees. The 27-year-old says the ethnic minority characters in Run, Riot are shown to be individuals ""with hopes and dreams"". ""They are shown as human and presented in a way closer to reality."" She says fiction can help deal with issues like Islamophobia because you get to see details from people's lives ""and realise they're connected to you"". ""They love their family, might have a similar taste in music or have visited similar places. I think that can help people connect in different ways with issues."" Siobhan's also started questioning the ""narrative around gentrification making things better"" since reading the book. Gentrification is when areas change as richer businesses and people begin moving in.  ""It's particularly poorer ethnic minority groups who get impacted by this kind of politics,"" she says. ""And for me it challenges the idea that having these new things is always progress - when actually it's disturbing people's way of life."" The books in the study, and others like them, are inspiring ""a new wave of youth activism"", Dr Grzegorczyk says, pointing to Black Lives Matter, Fridays for Future, and US campaigns against gun violence.  ""These books are pointing them towards a new kind of connectedness across cultures that moves us on from previous generations' fixation with 'us against them'."" Siobhan says books have changed her political views and ""make me want to act on those ideals"". ""They give you a different way of looking at the world.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-49143822,Payout after preacher's wrongful arrest,Footage of the street preacher's arrest has been viewed online almost three million times.,28 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Christian street preacher who had his Bible confiscated as he was handcuffed by police has been awarded £2,500 for wrongful arrest. Footage of the arrest of Oluwole Ilesanmi pleading with police to not ""take my Bible away"", has been viewed online almost three million times. He was detained outside Southgate Tube station in February after a 999 call claimed he had been Islamophobic. The Met said it had a right to investigate a potential hate crime. In a video posted online, Mr Ilesanmi, 64, is seen telling police: ""Jesus is on the way.""  An officer, who arrested him for breach of the peace, can be heard replying: ""I appreciate that but nobody wants to listen to that. They want you to go away.""  When Mr Ilesanmi tries to keep hold of his Bible, an officer says: ""You should've thought about that before being racist."" Mr Ilesanmi admits describing Islam as an ""aberration"" but said he was expressing his point of view as a Christian rather than denigrating Muslims. On Tuesday, Mr Ilesanmi will hand a petition to the Home Office, signed by 38,000 people, asking for greater protection for street preachers. Scotland Yard has since agreed to pay Mr Ilesanmi £2,500 for wrongful arrest and his humiliating and distressing treatment. Mr Ilesanmi said: ""I am glad that the police have recognised that it was not right to arrest me for preaching from the Bible.  ""It was traumatic being arrested. But I'm was determined to get back to Southgate and start preaching the gospel again."" Supt Neil Billany, of the force, said: ""The Met respects and upholds the rights of all individuals to practice freedom of speech, and this includes street preachers of all religions and backgrounds.  ""However, if the language someone uses is perceived as being a potential hate crime, it is only right that we investigate.  ""That is the role of the police, even if a decision is subsequently made that their actions are not criminal. In this case, it was deemed appropriate to remove the man from the area."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48601134,Tories accused of 'failure' over Islamophobia,"The Muslim Council of Britain says it has documented ""hundreds of cases"" within the party.",11 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has accused the Tory Party of ""fundamental failures"" in tackling Islamophobia.  Its head of public affairs, Miqdaad Versi, said he had seen ""hundreds of cases"" within the party, ""demonstrating the scale of the problem"".  When action was taken, he claimed the offending members were ""quietly let back into the party"". Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis has previously said ""swift action"" is taken when complaints are made. The MCB is an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies, including mosques, schools, and charitable associations. It has formally asked the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate accusations of Islamophobia in the Tory Party, claiming it ""runs deep"".  The watchdog said it was considering complaints in line with its ""usual processes"". Speaking at the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mr Versi said: ""We have seen, unequivocally, failures within specifically the Conservative Party when it comes to Islamophobia - not just small failures [but] fundamental failures in every single way.  ""I'm talking about leadership within the party... I'm talking about issues when members of Parliament have done certain things and no action has been taken against them.   ""I'm talking about when councillors and representatives of the Conservative Party have said or done things which are inappropriate and unacceptable."" He said that action was sometimes taken, but sometimes not ""until the media have been called"", adding: ""And then what happens? A few weeks later they're quietly let back into the party....These types of things are unacceptable."" Mr Versi said he was not claiming Islamophobia was not happening in other parties, but he was ""focussing on where the specific and large-scale issue is"". Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson also faced criticism during the committee over his previous comments about women who wear burkas. In August 2018, Mr Johnson wrote a column in the Daily Telegraph arguing against a ban on full-face veils - but said women wearing the garments looked liked ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". It prompted dozens of complaints, but he was cleared of breaking the Tories' code of conduct. Speaking at the committee, Iman Atta, director of anti-Islamophobia charity Tell MAMA, said there had been a rise in reports of abuse from women wearing veils or headscarves after the article.  Addressing those running to become the UK's next prime minister, she added: ""Political leadership comes with responsibility... because people will look at the words that a political leader is using and re-use those words on the ground and in the streets. ""We do ask every single candidate... to be responsible with the language that they use."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47454993,PM's 'head in sand' over Tory Islamophobia,"Theresa May has failed to acknowledge anti-Muslim prejudice in her party, Baroness Warsi says.",5 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Theresa May has been accused of ""burying her head in the sand"" over Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.  Former party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the PM had failed to ""acknowledge"" or ""tackle"" the problem and this was ""symptomatic"" of her wider leadership. Shortly after her comments, the party said 14 members had been suspended for Islamophobic Facebook posts. The Conservatives said ""decisive action"" would be taken against anyone making offensive remarks. The suspensions followed messages posted on a Facebook group called the ""Jacob Rees-Mogg Supporters Group"". The page was not affiliated with the MP or the party as a whole but Conservative members identified as using it have been suspended pending an investigation. ""When we find evidence of members making offensive or inappropriate comments, we consistently take decisive action,"" a spokesman said.  But Baroness Warsi, who was the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister, has said her party had ""turned a blind eye"" to prejudice and become ""institutionally Islamophobic"". She suggested the ""rot had set in"" several years ago and accused senior party officials of being ""in denial"" and presiding over an ""opaque"" complaints process.  In a personal attack on the prime minister, she said Mrs May had ""failed to tackle the problem head on"". ""She doesn't listen, she fails to acknowledge when there is a problem. It's probably symptomatic of the way in which her leadership has dealt with other matters. ""Burying your head in the sand is not going to make problems go away.""  She said efforts to modernise the party had ""gone into reverse"" since Mrs May succeeded David Cameron as leader, but she ruled out quitting the party, as others have done. ""If my party's going though a process of 're-UKIPification' of itself, then it's my job to stand within that party and fight to bring it back to the centre ground."" She has written to the party's chief executive Sir Mick Davis urging him to ""show leadership"" on the issue, because, she said, Mrs May and party chairman Brandon Lewis had not. She said Sir Mick, a former chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, had a ""long history of fighting bigotry"" and was ""uniquely placed to understand consequences of unchecked hate"". Baroness Warsi has been warning about anti-Muslim prejudice in the party for years.  Her latest intervention follows a row over former candidate Peter Lamb, who was was due to stand in the Staple Tye ward, in Harlow, Essex, in May's local elections and had previously stood in the Toddbrook ward. Mr Lamb was disciplined by the party after it emerged that he had posted a message on Twitter in 2015, saying ""Islam like alcoholism [sic]"" and ""the first step to recovery is admit you have a problem"".  Later in the same year, he tweeted: ""Turkey buys oil from ISIS. Muslims sticking together,"" adding: ""Do they want us to call ISIS Daesh now so that we don't associate them with Islam?"" Mr Lamb was reinstated as a candidate but local party sources said he had quit the party earlier on Tuesday, following the row about his comments. In a statement on Twitter, he apologised for the remarks, saying they were ""aimed at the extremists that have hijacked Islam and are cowardly hiding behind the religion"".  Justice Secretary David Gauke rejected suggestions the party had ignored warnings on the issue.  ""Where there is evidence, we take action, as a political party should.    ""Whether it is Islamophobia or whether it is anti-Semitism, there is an obligation on political parties to take action and address it.   ""That is what the Conservative Party does and will continue to do. So I don't accept that criticism."" But the Muslim Council of Britain said the level of prejudice within the party was ""astonishing"" and the claims should be independently investigated. ""We've seen MPs, councillors and members engage in bigotry that should have no place in a modern Conservative Party,"" a spokesman said.  ""Yet the constructive call by Muslim communities for an independent inquiry into the issue has been ignored again and again. Instead we hear excuses, denials and the responses we would expect when there is an institutional problem."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12376304,Row about Cameron speech timing,"Foreign Secretary William Hague defends the PM's remarks on multiculturalism - as a Labour MP suggests it amounted to ""propaganda"" for the English Defence League.",6 Feb 2011,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Mr Cameron signalled a tougher stance on groups promoting Islamist extremism The foreign secretary has defended the timing of David Cameron's comments on multiculturalism - which coincided with a march by the English Defence League. In Saturday's Mirror, Labour's Sadiq Khan accused the PM of effectively ""writing propaganda for the EDL"". William Hague said a PM's speech should not be shelved ""because some people have chosen to march down a street"". Labour's Yvette Cooper said the PM was ""unwise"" not to have also criticised the EDL and ""non-violent extremism"".  In his speech on radicalisation and terrorism on Saturday, Mr Cameron warned that the ""hands-off tolerance"" of unacceptable practices by non-white communities had only served to encourage extremism. He criticised ""state multiculturalism"" and argued the UK needed a stronger national identity to stop people turning to extremism. The English Defence League, which has been accused of Islamophobia - also held a rally in Luton on Saturday, prompting criticisms from some Labour MPs about the timing of Mr Cameron's speech. The EDL's leaders deny the group is racist. Asked whether the timing of the speech had been unfortunate, Foreign Secretary Mr Hague told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""This is a prime minister giving a speech about the future of our country, that doesn't have to be re-scheduled because some people have chosen to march down a street that particular day. ""This is a speech that will endure over the months and years long after people have forgotten what was going on on that particular Saturday afternoon."" But shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan  reportedly told the Mirror newspaper, external that Mr Cameron was ""writing propaganda"" for the group - a remark criticised by the Conservatives  as a ""smear"". Asked whether Mr Khan had been right to make the remark, Ms Cooper told Sky News: ""I think that we have always got to fight against extremism, it's also right to challenge non-violent extremism as well. ""I do think the prime minister was unwise not to make it clearer that he was criticising all kinds of extremism and so on the day of course that we had the English Defence League march he could have made it clearer that he was criticising extremism among EDL members."" Asked whether Mr Khan should apologise for his comments, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander told BBC1's Politics Show: ""I'm pretty sceptical about politicians calling for other politicians to apologise. ""My sense is Sadiq's remarks reflected some of the rather lurid headlines that we saw yesterday about the speech."" He added that it was for Mr Khan to ""explain the context in which he made those remarks"". On BBC One's Andrew Marr show, the chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission Trevor Phillips refused to criticise Mr Cameron's claim that multiculturalism had failed. He said Mr Cameron ""may have made life a bit more difficult for himself"" by combining a speech on terrorism with one on integration but said he was right to say it was not the role of government to tell people to embrace multiculturalism. This video can not be played The Chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, Trevor Phillips, says he partly agrees with Prime Minister David Cameron's criticisms of ""state multiculturalism."" However he added: ""People don't choose not to integrate mostly. There are a few people on the edges who don't want to integrate with anybody else but most people, if they don't mix, it's because they don't have the choice."" He said the government had a role to play to help people integrate - with a renewed battle against discrimination and work to ensure more jobs were accessible to people from all backgrounds. He added: ""The key thing here is that if you take the biggest Muslim community, Pakistanis, 25% of Pakistani men are taxi drivers, 75% of Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are economically inactive. That is the issue. ""The issue here is not some sort of abstract culture. The place most people integrate is in the workplace. If people can't get jobs, you can't expect them to integrate."" Mr Cameron's speech was criticised by some Muslim groups  - the Muslim Council of Great Britain said it was ""disappointing"" and treated the Muslim community as ""part of the problem as opposed to part of the solution.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54123146,US commemorates 19th anniversary of 9/11,"Both President Trump and Joe Biden visited the same memorial on Friday, at different times.",11 Sep 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Rivals for the White House have displayed a moment of unity as the US marks the 19th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden greeted Vice-President Mike Pence at the Ground Zero memorial in New York, where each attended ceremonies. Mr Biden then travelled to Shanksville, Pennsylvania - the site of the Flight 93 memorial - to pay respects.  President Donald Trump spoke there earlier on Friday. However Mr Biden and Mr Trump did not cross paths because their schedules did not overlap. Nearly 3,000 people died when four hijacked airliners were crashed into the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon and - after passengers fought back - the field in Shanksville, on what is the worst terrorist attack in US history. Joined by First Lady Melania Trump, Mr Trump attended a morning service at the Shanksville memorial, where Flight 93 crashed after its 40 passengers and crew prevented al-Qaeda hijackers from reaching the US Capitol building. ""To the family members of Flight 93: today every heartbeat in America is wedded to yours,"" Mr Trump said.  ""Your pain and anguish is the shared grief of our whole nation."" ""The memory of your treasured loved ones will inspire America for all time to come. The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds, America will always rise up, stand tall and fight back."" Although both Mr Trump and Mr Biden will refrain from overt campaigning, their separate visits to Pennsylvania are being watched closely, as the state is seen as a key battleground in the 3 November election.  Before his Shanksville visit, Mr Trump made a brief stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to greet members of the state Army National Guard. The iron-and-steel town is in Cambria County - the heart of what has been known as 'Trump country' - in the southwest of the state.  Mr Trump spoke with three officers about local military and thanked them for their service, local media reported.  Mr Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016 and with the election less than eight weeks away, the president is fighting hard to keep towns like Johnstown on his side, says BBC's Tara McKelvey.  Mr Biden and his wife, Jill, attended a memorial service and commemoration ceremony at the 9/11 museum in New York City. They travelled to Shanksville in the afternoon to visit the same memorial as Mr Trump. Mr Biden was seen greeting family members of those killed in the attack. He and his wife laid a wreath on the memorial as well. Mr Biden told reporters earlier on Friday he would not talk about anything other than 9/11 and that his campaign had withdrawn political adverts from airing on television. ""We took all our advertising down, it's a solemn day, and that's how we're going to keep it,"" he said. Mr Biden greeted Mr Pence at the World Trade Center site in New York earlier in the day, and the pair touched elbows in lieu of a handshake to observe protocols aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. Mr Biden referenced the pandemic in a series of tweets later in the day, saying: ""This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss."" Mr Pence delivered short remarks in New York City and read passages from the Bible, saying: ""I pray these ancient words will comfort your hearts and ours."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, also joined Mr Pence and Mr Biden at the memorial service. On US Twitter, hashtags relating to 9/11 are trending, with people remembering the day and sharing stories of loved ones lost in the attacks. Some on social media have also drawn attention to the anti-Muslim sentiment that spread across the country in the wake of 9/11, noting how they were bullied, stereotyped, or policed.  Hate crimes rose against Muslims after the 2001 attacks, FBI data found. The 9/11 attacks were a series of four coordinated attacks on the US by the Islamist terror group al-Qaeda.  As well as the 3,000 people killed on 11 September 2001, some 400,000 people were injured or exposed to other contaminants in the aftermath of the attacks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control. Hundreds of first responders and survivors have died in the years since due to related illnesses, like cancer. Weeks after the attack, the US sent troops to Afghanistan to combat al-Qaeda. The so-called 'War on Terror' has stretched decades and American intervention in the Middle East continues to be a quagmire of US foreign policy."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-53498343,Diverse talent 'must be celebrated in schools',"It is important to get away from a ""narrative of disadvantage"", the head of a review says.",30 Aug 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Black, Polish and Italian contributions to Wales must be taught to all children in schools, the head of a curriculum review has said. Almost 35,000 people have signed a petition for Britain's colonial past to be taught in Welsh schools. Charlotte Williams said it was important ""to get away from a black narrative of disadvantage"". She said the contributions of musicians, artists and academics from all communities must be celebrated. ""There are large parts of Wales where children will not have seen black people except for on TV - and sometimes this can be in very negative ways,"" she said. Following worldwide protests after the death of George Floyd in US police custody, there have been calls for greater recognition of Wales' role in colonialism and slavery to be taught in schools. The new working group led by Prof Williams has been set up by the Welsh Government to see how the new curriculum could be changed. She said it was essential slavery and injustices faced particularly by black people were taught in schools - but that also more had to be done to showcase role models and cultural diversity. ""If we miss out on this, we are doing a disservice to our own history,"" she said. ""But I don't want to send out the message that we are all terribly disadvantaged and victims. ""This is an appeal to schools and teachers to engage with the positive contribution of black and minority ethnic groups, the richness and vibrancy of it."" Wales' new curriculum, set to be introduced in 2022, is based on six ""areas of learning and experience"" and does not set out exactly what schools should be teaching. But Prof Williams said it would be challenging due to the lack of staff diversity and said teachers needed to be given support to ""be bold and brave"". Fewer than 1% of teachers in Wales say they are black, Asian, or from other or mixed minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2019-2020 school workforce census. Forty of the 1,065 students who began training to become teachers in Wales in 2018-2019 said they were from a minority ethnic group. Prof Williams said some teachers may be scared of exploring certain issues due to a fear of sounding racist, a lack of knowledge, or not being ""politically correct"". ""There's this awful thing about fear of saying or doing the wrong thing,"" she said. ""It's about being bold and being brave, and not stigmatising, and to use examples that will turn people's thinking around to a kind of normal thinking."" Growing up in Llandudno, Prof Williams said her family was the only black one in the town. ""I cannot think of examples from my own education that were pertinent to me and my identity and my heritage,"" she said. ""I grew up not understanding my place and my identity and how I fitted in Wales. I think that's what happening to children, they can't necessarily connect."" According to the most recent school census in January 2019, more than 33,000 pupils over the age of five had a black, Asian, minority ethnic or mixed background, making up 8.3% of students in Wales. But this varied widely by area, from 2% in Blaenau Gwent, to 28% in Cardiff. ""We used to go away to West Africa and we would come back, we'd had this fantastic experience, but no-one would ask us about it,"" Prof Williams said. ""Children are not asked and then they don't expect, which is even sadder, when they don't think their knowledge and their experience has anything to do with where they are."" She said making sure children in seemingly ""all-white, monocultural"" communities learnt about Wales' multicultural heritage would be challenging, but it was important all children did so and saw themselves reflected in lessons they were taught. This could mean encouraging schools to showcase more literature, music and art by minority ethnic artists or teaching traditional recipes in lessons, as well as learning about how different groups had influenced and shaped their community. ""I'm not afraid to say that I think it will take time, I think there are challenges,"" she said. ""I'm very enthusiastic about Wales and it's propensity to be progressive and forward thinking in what it does and how it approaches these issues."" Going to school in a mainly white school, as a teenager Asha Fletcher-Peters says she felt ""isolated"" and ""like an alien"". Having moved from London to the Vale of Glamorgan when she was nine, she went from being in a multicultural school where they celebrated Eid and Diwali, to one where she felt like an outsider. ""So many people had never seen anyone like me before,"" said Asha, now 25. ""Everyone wanted to be skinny, blonde and rich"". ""I just wanted to be like all the other girls. I used to get people using the n-word around me, thinking it was a fun thing to say."" Asha, who is now a professional musician and actress, said teachers did not cast her as lead roles in shows, as there was no ""black part"", and she was faced with white faces in history books and text books. ""No-one told me that black women did these different things, that there were women in hijabs, and not just white men - we didn't see ourselves in those spaces,"" said Asha. ""I felt so isolated my whole life. If I had seen women like me in my science books, I might have chosen differently, I might have ended up in a career in science."" Asha said one pupil wrote an essay about her, because they had never met a black person before, and she remembers trying to stay out of the sun so her skin would not get darker. ""People do not realise how damaging these things are,"" she said. ""I want the next generation to be themselves, to have their goals and their dreams, not to feel like they have to fit in this cookie-cutter shape."""

Also an education centre, it will be built by Sir David Adjaye in a park next to the Houses of Parliament. A jury that included Holocaust survivors, the Communities Secretary, and the Chief Rabbi unanimously selected the design. But, questions were raised over whether Victoria Tower Gardens is a suitable location for the memorial. ""We wanted to orchestrate an experience that reminds us of the fragility and constant strife for a more equitable world,"" Sir David said. ""It is critical these highly important and emotive historical touchpoints are explored, so that future generations are able to experience, learn, reflect and act."" Sir David has teamed up with Israeli designer Ron Arad and landscape architects Gustafson Porter + Bowman on the project. The memorial, due for completion by 2021, will honour the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust, and all other victims of Nazi persecution, including Roma, gay and disabled people. A shortlist of 10 finalists was whittled down from 92 entries submitted by architecture and design teams from 26 countries. The project will be a ""statement by the British people that our nation will remember those who suffered, and that we will always strive for a better future"" Sir Peter Bazalgette, Chair of the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation said. Ghanaian-born Sir David's recent work includes the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC and the Idea Stores in London's Tower Hamlets."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51369960,Blasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam,Mila posted a video criticising Islam. Death threats followed and she has not gone back to school.,4 Feb 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A teenager has sparked a national debate about blasphemy in France after an Instagram post calling Islam a ""religion of hate"". Mila, 16, posted her comments online after receiving homophobic abuse from a Muslim commenter.  She received death threats and has not attended school since. But Mila has refused to back down, saying in her first television interview that she ""wanted to blaspheme"". She has since deactivated her Instagram account. The post has sparked a huge debate in France over freedom of speech. The country has no national blasphemy laws and has a rigidly secular constitution. Police initially opened two investigations: the first into whether Mila was guilty of hate speech, and the second into her online attackers. They have since dropped the hate speech case as Mila was expressing a personal opinion on religion and not targeting individuals. On Tuesday, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told the National Assembly that Mila and her family were under police protection. Appearing on the Quotidien programme on the TMC channel, Mila apologised for insulting people who practise their religion ""in peace"" and said she regretted the ""vulgarity"" of her words and their spread online. But she defended her remarks. ""I have absolutely no regrets about what I said, it was really my thought,"" she told the interviewer.  Mina said her life was ""clearly on hold"" amid the controversy. She had to leave school because of the threats against her, saying she could have been ""burned with acid, hit, stripped naked in public or buried alive"". On Monday, education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that authorities were trying to ""return her to school peacefully so that she can have a normal life"". The controversy began on 18 January, after Mila did a live broadcast on her Instagram account. After speaking about her sexuality she was called a ""dirty lesbian"" by a Muslim commenter. In response, Mila posted an attack on Islam. ""I hate religion. The Koran is a religion of hate,"" she said, before using stronger words to attack Islam. ""I am not racist. You cannot be racist towards a religion. I said what I thought, you're not going to make me regret it."" Critics said her comments were offensive. Some sent her death threats, and others posted her personal information online. The head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, Mohammed Moussaoui, said nothing justified death threats no matter how serious her remarks. Supporters defended her right to attack Islam, and the hashtag #JeSuisMila (I am Mila) started trending in France. Opponents hit back with the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasMila. French justice minister Nicole Belloubet waded into the controversy, saying that death threats against the teenager were ""unacceptable"". However, Ms Belloubet herself was criticised after arguing that an attack on religion was ""an attack on freedom of conscience"". French Senator Laurence Rossignol gave Ms Belloubet ""0/20 in constitutional law"", saying that in France ""it is forbidden to insult the followers of a religion but one can insult a religion, its figures, its symbols"". Ms Belloubet later said her comments had been ""clumsy"". Mila's cause has been embraced by the far right. National Rally leader Marine Le Pen said Mila had ""more courage than the entire political class in power for the past 30 years"". In October, French President Emmanuel Macron warned against ""stigmatising"" Muslims or linking Islam with the fight against terrorism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-41863258,School dinner boycott call in halal row,The call for a boycott follows the council's decision to ban unstunned halal meat from school meals.,3 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Calls have been made for a boycott of school meals in Lancashire after councillors voted to ban unstunned halal meat from its kitchens. Lancashire County Council made the decision to stop using it in 27 council-run schools last month. They described the practice of not stunning animals before slaughtering them as ""abhorrent"" and ""really cruel"". Lancashire Council of Mosques said the decision would ""only serve to increase Islamophobia and anti-Semitism"". The group said the decision, which will take effect from December, meant the council would stop providing meals ""in accordance with the universal criteria of Halal"". LCOM's chief executive officer Abdul Hamid Qureshi said: ""Our advice to the community is to stop school meals as soon as this occurs and campaign for change.  ""We recognise that this will have a significant impact on schools across Lancashire and, more importantly, on the children.  ""We are committed to continue working with schools and regret the impact this will have."" Unstunned halal meat is currently supplied to 12,000 pupils at 27 schools in Blackburn, Nelson, Burnley, Rawtenstall, Hyndburn, Clitheroe and Preston. On 26 October, a meeting of the full council backed a move not to provide meat to any of its kitchens ""unless the animal was stunned before it was slaughtered"". Susie Charles, the council's cabinet member for children, young people and schools, said she could see ""no reason"" for a boycott. ""There is always a choice of meals anyway, including vegetarian options. It's a very short-sighted view and it's depriving children of good nutritious food,"" she said. ""Eighty-four per cent of halal meat in the country is currently stunned. Also, in New Zealand, all their lamb is stunned, and Saudi Arabia buys New Zealand lamb. If Saudis can eat stunned meat, I don't see why people in Lancashire can't."" The Conservative councillor also rejected LCOM's claim that the council's decision would result in more fear or hatred of Muslims or Jews.  She said: ""I don't see why it should. And why are they bringing the Jews into it? We don't supply any kosher food at all. The Jews buy their own food for their schools."" Council leader Geoff Driver said the decision was ""democratic"" and a ""huge majority"" had voted for the ban. He said he ""very sincerely"" hoped it would not lead to Islamophobic sentiment in the community. He added: ""If anybody looks at it objectively, they will see that the people who could cause these problems are the Lancashire Council of Mosques themselves. They are the ones who are making such a big issue of it."" More than 80% of halal meat in the UK is pre-stunned and is acceptable to many Muslims, according to the British Veterinary Association."

Rev Richard Cameron shouted at Mr Corbyn as he entered a community centre on Wednesday. It later emerged that he had made Islamophobic and homophobic comments on social media. The Church of Scotland has confirmed he will not be allowed to work as a minister while inquiries continue. A spokeswoman for the church said: ""In accordance with our procedures Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended. ""This is to allow us to carry out an inquiry in relation to the incident which took place earlier this week and the subsequent complaints about his social media use."" In one tweet Rev Cameron, the minister at Scotstoun Parish Church in Glasgow, compared homosexuality to incest, describing them as ""unnatural"".  ""Both cause harm by breaking sensibly held taboos,"" he added. In September, he tweeted: ""Christ has the power to help and change anyone. Obviously many gays hate this because want to carry on their perversion.""  He also shared a series of controversial views on Islam, describing terrorism as ""a problem Islam needs to deal with"", a full face veil as ""oppressive and unBritish"" and the Prophet Muhammad as ""a violent man"". In another post, he said: ""The best way to defeat Islam is to preach Christ"". When initially alerted to the tweets, the church said it ""deplored comments which were Islamophobic or homophobic"".  Rev Cameron, who worked in pharmaceutical sales before joining the church, has been minister at Scotstoun since 2000.  The 60-year-old heckled Mr Corbyn during a two-day trip to Scotland, branding him a ""terrorist sympathiser"".  As Mr Corbyn was telling reporters about a scarf given to him by the Who Cares? Scotland charity, Rev Cameron shouted that he thought the Labour leader would be wearing an ""Islamic jihad scarf"". ""Do you think the man that's going to be prime minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?"" he added. ""Who's going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you're prime minister?"" The Labour leader did not react and he was ushered into the community centre by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40442878,Anti-Islam campaigner launches UKIP bid,UKIP distances itself from controversial campaigner Anne Marie Waters who is bidding to lead the party.,30 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group is launching a bid to be the next UKIP leader on Saturday. Anne Marie Waters was blocked from standing for UKIP at the election, with then leader Paul Nuttall saying her views made him ""uncomfortable"". She campaigns against Sharia law in the UK and has called Islam ""evil"". UKIP said the campaign launch was ""not in any way an official UKIP event"" and urged members to ""think very carefully"" before attending. A UKIP spokesman said all leadership candidates would be vetted by the party's National Executive Committee, who will decide which ones will be allowed to go forward to a vote of the membership. Waters had planned to launch her leadership bid at Rotherham football club but has been forced to find an alternative venue. ""There were concerns about my 'views' and no doubt, police were happy to add to such concerns"", she said in a statement on her website.  South Yorkshire Police has said the decision to cancel the event at Rotherham's New York stadium was taken by the club.  The launch will now take place at an undisclosed location in Rotherham. Waters took part in a ""silent protest"" march against grooming gangs in the town last year. In a joint statement, UKIP MEP Jane Collins and councillor Allen Cowles, leader of UKIP's Rotherham branch, said they supported the decision to cancel the planned stadium rally and urged the party's councillors to boycott Waters' campaign launch. Mr Cowles said: ""UKIP councillors wish to make it clear that they do not condone in any way the views Ms Waters has previously expressed, or what she stands for.""  Waters announced her plans to stand for the UKIP leadership at a rally in Manchester earlier this month, where she was introduced by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson.  She told the cheering crowd ""Islam is a killing machine"" and urged them to ""join UKIP and vote for me,"" adding that the party will ""try to stop me"". After the Brexit vote, UKIP's leadership was aware the party had to broaden its appeal.   The former leader, Paul Nuttall, backed a radical policy platform with social integration at its core.  He said the party would shape the debate around extremism and Islamism in the way it claimed to have done with immigration - daring to address topics other politicians wouldn't. But while some in UKIP welcomed the policies announced in the election manifesto - including a ban on face coverings - they caused disquiet among other members who feared the party was in danger of being seen as Islamophobic.   Mr Nuttall insisted that was not the case, saying the focus was breaking down barriers in society and improving integration.  But UKIP is sensitive to public perception about its policy and direction. Having been dogged by allegations of racism in the past, it's determined not to go there again. A former Labour Party activist, Waters set up a UK branch of anti-mass immigration organisation Pegida with Robinson, but is no longer thought to be involved with the group.  She founded Sharia Watch UK, which aims to ""to document the advancement of Sharia law in Britain,"" in 2014. She hit the headlines a year later when she announced plans for an exhibition of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, but was forced to cancel the event after police warned it could be ""a risk to public safety"". She has argued that UKIP could regain support if it had the ""guts"" to be ""honest about Islam"" and challenge the view that it has ""nothing to do"" with jihadist violence. Anti-fascist campaign group HopeNotHate has branded Waters a ""toxic figure"" and urged UKIP to expel her from the party. But she has been defended by former UKIP leadership contender Raheem Kassam, editor of the Breitbart London website, who wrote earlier this year: ""If UKIP ditches Anne Marie Waters, the party is over"". The UKIP leadership contest was triggered by the resignation of Paul Nuttall, when the party failed to win any seats at the general election and saw its share of the vote collapse. Mr Nuttall, who campaigned for a ban on burkas and Sharia courts, said in April that Waters' comments were ""way above and beyond party policy"" and some had made him feel ""a bit uncomfortable"".  London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Ben Walker, a former UKIP councillor in South Gloucestershire, have also announced leadership bids. MEP Bill Etheridge, who came third in the first of UKIP's two leadership contests last year, and Thanet council leader Chris Wells have both said they might stand if Nigel Farage cannot be persuade to return to the job he quit after last year's Brexit referendum.  The former UKIP leader has not ruled out a bid."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-52576336,"Drag Race: The most political, troubled season ever?",The reality show has reminded US viewers to register to vote every week during its 12th season.,29 May 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Strip the format of RuPaul's Drag Race back to its most basic and you might think it's a TV show about people competing to see who's the best at dancing around while pretending to sing a song. But the 12th season has urged its US viewers to register to vote every week and made no secret of its political agenda. This weekend, finalists Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall and Crystal Methyd will compete (on a Zoom call) to be crowned the next drag superstar of the world. Season 12 has been a bumpy ride for viewers though and negative press about the behaviour of contestants - as well as host RuPaul - threaten to overshadow its message. In one episode, contestants Jackie Cox and Widow Von Du performed a lip-sync to Katy Perry's Firework - Jackie in a hijab based on the American flag, Widow in a gown inspired by the Black Panther Party. When Democratic politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared on the show as a guest judge, Jackie spoke about her Iranian mum's experiences in the US as an immigrant. ""People would tell her to go back to where she came from,"" explained a tearful Jackie. ""When I was young, I hid this part of my heritage for so long. She's an American citizen now. Seeing you standing up for people like my mum gives me so much hope."" One episode included a challenge where contestants took part in a fake rally to become the first-ever drag President of the United States - a format that hasn't been seen on Drag Race since 2012. And every episode has ended with contestants dancing on stage carrying signs reading ""register to vote"". There's political bias on Drag Race, no doubt. It's a left-wing show with a strong anti-Trump message, one that's been ramped up ahead of the US election in November 2020. Since coming to power in 2016, President Donald Trump has introduced, or tried to introduce, a number of measures which have stripped rights from LGBT people in America. ""Drag Race is a show that appeals to queer people, to women, to the groups that need to get out and vote,"" says Kevin O'Keefe, a US journalist who covers Drag Race for LGBT publication Xtra Magazine and considers himself a Drag Race ""herstorian"". ""It's mentioning politics more and more."" In the 2016 US election, only 50% of the population turned out to vote. ""Young people don't vote. That's a generalisation but the exit polls bear it out. A simple weekly reminder is useful,"" Kevin adds. ""Seeing those placards at the end of every episode, people may think it's showmanship, but that kind of repeated messaging actually does work."" Season 12 isn't the first season where politics has played an obvious part. Democrat Nancy Pelosi (the Speaker of the House of Representatives) made a brief appearance in the 2018 series of All Stars.  Contestants in 2016 had to produce smear campaigns against each other in season eight and in 2011 there were messages of support for US troops in season three. But some Drag Race experts say the very nature of the show is political, even when it's not directly referencing what's going on in Washington. ""Drag Race has always shown that people come for the drag, but you stay because you fall in love with these queer people,"" says Mikelle Street, digital director of Out magazine.  ""They always talk about issues that this community is dealing with."" In previous series', contestant Dusty Ray Bottoms spoke about their experience of conversion therapy, Nina West revealed they were threatened with murder by a far-right hate group while at college, Latrice Royale talked about spending time in prison. ""I don't know if season 12 is a return to politics, because I'm not sure the show ever left that,"" Mikelle adds. Kevin says that just because politics has been mentioned more doesn't make it the most political season. ""There's part of me that just wants to say that season one was the most political because it presented drag in this very rough around the edges way, something the show has shied away from since,"" he says. ""To me, letting drag queens be their messiest selves and presenting Cameroonian drag in BeBe Zahara Benet and pageant drag in Shannel - that to me will always seem more political than holding up a 'register to vote' sign."" Despite grand political ambitions for the 12th season of Drag Race, it's also been the most troubled. A contestant was disqualified before the series started when sexual misconduct allegations were made against them, leading to a hasty re-edit of every episode to remove them from the show. Comments made by Jeff Goldblum about Islam's stance on homosexuality were widely criticised and even RuPaul faced their own controversy when it was revealed they lease part of their 60,000 acre Wyoming ranch to oil companies for fracking. ""The reality is that people like Ru were progressive when they were coming up,"" says Mikelle.  ""But what happens with some of them - like Ru, like Ellen - is that they were progressive for their time when they were first coming in, and the movement continued to progress and they didn't necessarily move with it."" But even if this is at odds with the left-wing stance the show has, the negative press didn't seem do any damage to viewing figures. Drag Race was the most-watched show for 18 to 34-year-olds in the US on Friday nights. The show has also been affected by coronavirus, with its finale and reunion shows being filmed online due to social distancing measures. Season 12's big political storyline ended just before the final when Jackie was eliminated in the last of the episodes filmed in 2019. Kevin believes her time on the show will resonate with many LGBT viewers on a personal level. ""All of the stuff about her mum's experience as an immigrant, about her challenges with her former faith being Muslim, that all is a genuine weight on Jackie,"" he says.  ""I think a small push opens the floodgates, a lot of queer people wear that stuff on their sleeve and it doesn't take much for that to come out."" Going into the final, both Kevin and Mikelle are backing the same contestant to win: Jaida Essence Hall. ""Jaida represents something we haven't seen since Tyra Sanchez won season two,"" says Kevin.  ""She is a polished, gorgeous pageant girl. We've seen Asia O'Hara falter, we've seen Akeria Chanel Davenport falter - and I would be really bummed if it happened to Jaida."" But with the political agenda of season 12, RuPaul and the producers of Drag Race seem to want viewers to think about more than just who should become the world's next drag superstar when they watch the show. ""We're thinking about this administration, we're thinking about the election that's coming up,"" says Mikelle.  ""Those are the things that we're all thinking about and the ways in which the policies or lack of policies from the administration are affecting our daily lives.""

The son of the 62-year-old man found dead days after failing a lie-detector test on the programme tells the Daily Mail the presenter had ""ripped into him"" on stage.  The Sun says Jeremy Kyle fears ITV bosses will make him a scapegoat amid growing calls for the show to be axed. It has the headline: ""Kyle on trial."" The i newspaper reports that mental health campaigners have questioned whether the show can ever be safe.  The Spectator website says the shouting and screaming and fractious arguments presented for our titillation have been a concern for some time.  It adds that our desire for reality TV has led us down a dark and twisted path where a programme on which contestants are mocked by viewers based on their class, background and appearance remains such a huge draw. There are many accounts of the treatment of guests who have appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show.  One tells the Guardian his appearance was ""the worst thing that has ever happened in my life"".   A TV producer hired to film behind the scenes tells the Daily Mirror: ""It was distressing to see so many worlds torn apart and so little done to mend them afterwards.""  ITV has said participants are supported by the guest welfare team throughout filming and in the days afterwards. Few believe the show can survive. The Daily Mirror describes the programme as ""toxic telly"", and says television bosses must think carefully about what happens next.  Downing Street's announcement that the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill is to be brought to the Commons next month is widely reported.  ""The Fourth Vote Awakens"", the Huffpost UK website declares. The Sun says Theresa May will face a June D-Day.   For the Times, it will be a moment of truth for the prime minister and her Brexit deal.   The Telegraph says Mrs May has tried to delay her resignation for almost three months by telling ministers she can get a deal done if she's allowed to stay in Number 10 until the end of July. The announcement comes as a surprise to some. The Politico website says that with nothing yet agreed in the talks with Labour, and large factions in both main parties implacably opposed to the Brexit deal, it remains unclear how Mrs May hopes to win a Commons majority.   The LabourList website thinks that relying on either Conservative or Labour votes in the Commons is unlikely to produce a positive outcome for her. The Sun reports that the prime minister came under heavy pressure from her ""frustrated"" cabinet to bring the bill forward.  The Politics Home website says she will hope the move will be enough to satisfy Tory MPs demanding that she sets out a timetable for her departure from Number 10.  The Guardian says Mrs May hopes the bill will help to fend off calls for an imminent no-confidence vote from her backbenchers. The pledge by new Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt to introduce an amnesty on historical prosecutions for military veterans makes the lead for the Guardian and the Express.  The amnesty will not apply to legacy cases arising in Northern Ireland, with the Telegraph quoting sources who suggest that the political tensions there have made the issue too difficult to resolve. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The Times leads with a warning by the leader of Britain's police chiefs to Theresa May that anti-terrorist operations would be hampered if she bows to pressure to create an official definition of Islamophobia.   The paper says the adoption of the definition could in effect make it racist to criticise Islam or ""Muslimness"".   In a letter to the Prime Minister seen by the Times, Martin Hewitt - chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council - says the definition poses a threat to terror laws, stop-and-search at ports and the outlawing of terrorist groups. Finally, the Guardian reports that cubs and scouts are marching back into inner cities, with membership boosted by 20,000 in some of the most deprived parts of Britain over the past five years.  It says the recruitment is part of a concerted drive by the scouts to widen their appeal and defeat a stereotype that scouting is only for white, middle-class people.  According to the paper, the movement also wants to rebuild its previously deep connections in cities where it used to promote scouting as a way to learn skills to beat unemployment."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-48093032,Monkey chants 'aimed at child footballers',"Children as young as seven regularly suffer racist abuse, members of a new ethnic football forum say.",6 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Footballers as young as seven have experienced racist abuse at matches, a new anti-discrimination group has said. The Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Football Forum (BFF) has begun collating grassroots experiences of discrimination from across the country. Vice chair Ahmed Maravia, who runs a club in Leicester, said ""little kids"" often heard monkey chants and Islamophobic remarks at games. Leicestershire FA said discrimination did not belong in football. Mr Maravia, the chief executive of the Community Football Academy, said some of his under-14s once left the pitch in tears, despite winning, because of abuse. He said his players, who were predominantly Muslim, had been called the ""P-word"" and told - by opposing footballers, managers and coaches - they should be ""blowing things up, not playing football"". He said among the abuse victims were children as young as seven. ""Racist and Islamophobic remarks have been made and some of [them] don't understand, they're just little kids,"" he said. ""They just want to play football."" He said he had also heard ""monkey chants"" at an under-nines game and told how a parent once offered a banana to a child, saying they ""should be used to it"". Mr Maravia said providing evidence to the FA could be difficult and asked why a report of discrimination was not enough. ""[Those committing the abuse] don't do it in front of a match official,"" he said. ""They're not going to say 'hey, referee, stop the game, I want to make a racist remark'."" The forum, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, was planned months before a match in April, between FC Wymeswold and Cosby United, was stopped when a player said he was racially abused by a spectator. Ivan Limburd, the group's chair, said he hoped a survey about discrimination in grassroots football would lead to change and better education. Kelly Ellis, the chief executive of Leicestershire and Rutland FA, said it would engage with the clubs involved in the forum. She said: ""Leicestershire and Rutland County FA have always taken the stance that discrimination of any sort does not belong in football and investigate all allegations of discrimination in accordance with FA rules and procedures.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48083407,Tories 'aim not to fight' Euro elections,Party chairman Brandon Lewis says the priority is passing a Brexit deal before elections take place.,28 Apr 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Brandon Lewis has refused to say when the Tories' European election campaign will launch, saying his priority is not to have to fight them at all. The UK is due to elect new MEPs on 23 May, after Brexit was delayed amid continuing parliamentary deadlock. Several parties have launched their campaigns already but Conservative chair Mr Lewis told the BBC his focus was on next week's local elections. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, or sooner if a deal is agreed. This means the UK must now hold European Parliament elections on 23 May if it wants to avoid leaving the EU without a deal. But if agreement can be reached among MPs before 22 May, the UK could cancel its participation in the elections. The Lib Dems launched their campaign on Friday, with a pledge to do what they can to stop Brexit altogether. Nigel Farage's Brexit Party and pro-Remain party Change UK's have also launched their European election campaigns. Labour's NEC is due to meet on Tuesday to decide on its manifesto for the campaign. But asked about Conservative campaign plans on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Lewis said: ""As a government, our first priority is to not have to fight the EU elections. ""I think we should be doing everything we can to respect that 2016 referendum, if and when we are at the point where we are definitely fighting those EU elections then we will take some decisions about that.""  He said there was ""still time"" for the UK Parliament to approve the withdrawal agreement - which it has so far rejected three times - in time so the UK could leave the EU and would not have to take part in the elections at all. He rejected reports about donors deserting the Conservatives, saying that 2018 had been a ""record peacetime fundraising year"". Some Conservative members reportedly plan to back the Brexit Party at the elections, and Conservative councillors in Derbyshire are refusing to campaign at all in protest at the failure to have left the EU. Mr Lewis said: ""I don't deny the frustration people in our party have over where we are on Brexit. I share that frustration, I want to get this done so we don't fight those European elections."" He added: ""I hope that Conservative members, colleagues, volunteers, activists will come to want to not just vote for, but campaign for Conservatives to get elected, because ultimately Conservative representation is better than any other party."" On Sky News, Labour frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey said the government was still refusing to move on ""any of their red lines"" in cross-party talks aimed at reaching an agreement on Brexit. She said: ""Honestly I think the discussions so far have been productive, they've gone into a lot of detail, there seems to be a willingness on both sides to move towards some form of consensus. ""But as yet we haven't seen the government move on any of their red lines, we're having further discussions this week and hopefully we'll see some movement."" At the end of March, Prime Minister Theresa May said the public would find it ""unacceptable"" to have to elect a new group of 73 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU. But earlier this month, she agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-47947385,Call for same-sex education in primaries,"Teaching about same-sex relationships education must be made compulsory in primaries, a union says.",16 Apr 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Teachers are calling for same-sex relationships education to be made compulsory in UK primary schools. The demand, at the National Education Union conference in Liverpool, comes after protests at several primaries in Birmingham over an equality programme.  The protesters said the programme, No Outsiders, clashed with their religious beliefs. Delegate Deborah Gwynn said primary school pupils would have family members who were members of same-sex couples. ""We want them to feel included,"" she said. The motion claimed parental opposition in Birmingham and elsewhere was being organised by a range of homophobic groups. It called for the union to lobby the government and opposition parties to strengthen Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) guidance so that teaching about Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender relationships becomes statutory in both primary and secondary schools. She added that every child should be ""empowered to be the people that they want to be"". Tanveer Hammeed, a delegate from Leeds, said: ""RSE education needs to be for all, it needs to be inclusive, it needs to go through primary to secondary schools - no ifs, no buts."" Speakers also claimed there had been a conflation of issues of RSE and Islamaphobia, because of the predominance of Muslim parents protesting around the Birmingham schools, and that this was being stirred up by the Far Right. Teachers also expressed concerns about a return to the days when councils, and therefore schools, were banned from promoting homosexuality in any mainstream school. But they acknowledged that schools need to have a clear ""dialogue"" with parents about the necessity of inclusive education. From 2020, relationship, sex and heath education will be compulsory in all schools in England, while relationship and health education must be taught in primaries. But the guidance leaves head teachers to decide exactly what to teach and when. They also have to take into account the religious background of all pupils when planning it. In primaries, pupils will learn about ""healthy family life"" and how other people's families can look different from their own. With regard to education on same sex relationship issues, the government has said all pupils have to learn about them ""in a timely manner"", with the Department for Education recommending that it is ""integral throughout programmes of study"". In a statement, the DfE said: ""Pupils should receive teaching on LGBT relationships during their school years - we expect secondary schools to include LGBT content and primary schools are enabled and encouraged to cover this."" Policies on the issue differ in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was crucial that every young person felt happy and safe at school. ""Too many LGBT+ young people still don't feel they can be themselves at school. This can hit their self-esteem and motivation.  ""We can't address LGBT+ teenagers' self-harm and exclusion rates without talking openly and positively about LGBT+ people and their contributions to society now, and throughout history."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47590209,Anger and solidarity at mosque attack event,Faith and community leaders held a gathering in London for victims of the New Zealand mosque shootings.,16 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"There was a message of solidarity as faith and community leaders, joined by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, held a gathering at the East London Mosque dedicated to victims of the New Zealand mosque shootings. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up at the event in Whitechapel, as one speaker after another called for people to come together, across countries and religions. The Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, Harun Rashid Khan, expressed ""solidarity and companionship with all the people who are suffering from the heinous act of violence against minority communities"".  The Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, said an ""attack on faith anywhere"" was an ""attack on faith everywhere"". But there was also an obvious sense of anger from the Muslim community - not just at the attackers but also the media, politicians, and other public figures for ""demonising"" Muslims. Mohammed Mahmoud, an imam who was praised for his response to an attack outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, London, in 2017, said the security and peace of Muslims was under threat. He said people in power were partly responsible for ""perpetuating the narrative of otherness of a group who are perceived as infiltrators, and the dehumanisation and the vilification of Muslims who, by and large, are peaceful, law-abiding, loving citizens"".  Others were critical of the media for giving a platform to people they say are openly Islamophobic, as well as the coverage of terror attacks. Jusna Begum, 43, who believes Islamophobia is getting worse, said: ""I've stopped reading them, how attacks are covered...  ""A simple headline will always go back to the religion, for example this Australian guy, we won't say white, or Christian, we say mad men."" Lawrence Lewis, 28, said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"".  ""I feel like a lot of the time the Western narrative of the media is to demonise Islam, because they think that the laws and principles of Islam go against their ideology, and it doesn't,"" he said. Sheila McGregor, of the Tower Hamlets Stand Up To Racism group, said the ""demonisation"" of Muslims was a ""global phenomenon"" and had been carried out by politicians for ""decades"". ""This kind of act happens when people feel it is legitimate and it's legitimised from the top,"" she said.  The role of language in fomenting anti-Islam sentiment was touched on by several of the speakers, including the London mayor. Mr Khan did not reference the media or any politicians directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and at their role in people becoming radicalised.  ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use, and the messages we amplify,"" the mayor said.  ""There are some people in our city, in our country, who fan the flames of hatred.""  Others spoke of their shock at the New Zealand attack and their fear that something similar might happen in other mosques. Yelda Mahmood, 28, who had travelled from the US to London, said: ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together.  ""It doesn't matter what race you are or what religion you practice. ""How can someone go to someone's house of worship and do something like that?  ""It happens on the streets and in our neighbourhoods and now in our place of worships.""  In the wake of the attack, police have increased patrols at British mosques to provide reassurance. But Mohammed Mahmoud said there also needed to be more done to prevent people from spreading their Islamophobic views. He added: ""We demand that these platform providers, these people who provide columns and airtime for such individuals are called out and exposed and scandalised for their crimes against not only a group of Muslims who are peace loving, but also the crimes of disturbing the peace.""  Mr Khan said he hoped the increased presence of police at mosques would reassure worshippers. ""As far as we are concerned our diversity is a strength not weakness,"" he said. ""We don't simply tolerate it, we embrace it and respect it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-48730618,Diversity concern as parliament nears anniversary,"Warnings that the Scottish Parliament has ""gone backwards"" when it comes to the diversity of its MSPs.",23 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Diversity among the Scottish Parliament's elected representatives has ""gone backwards"" in some ways, MSPs have warned in a new BBC documentary. It comes 20 years after the first MSPs took their seats at Holyrood. Despite the recent prevalence of female leaders, the 2016 Scottish Parliament election saw fewer women elected compared with 1999. The parliament has also elected only four MSPs from ethnic minority backgrounds in the past two decades. The 1999 Scottish Parliament election returned 48 women to the chamber out of 129 MSPs. By the 2016 election that number had fallen to 45.  Former Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray, who was first elected to Holyrood in 1999, told the documentary, titled Children of the Devolution: ""We've never had a black woman MSP, that's never happened in 20 years. In some ways we've gone backwards."" Anas Sarwar MSP, who last year set up a Cross Party Group on tackling Islamophobia, said Scotland still had a long way to go on issues of equality. Mr Sarwar told the programme: ""You come to the realisation at some point - and part of it is when you become a parent yourself and you see the challenges that your children might face in the future - that I can't stay silent, silence isn't an option any more. ""I genuinely believe that my children are going to grow up in a more divided and a more hate-filled world than the one I grew up in and that frightens the life out of me. ""And I think we need people of all backgrounds talking about (it), and we all care about Scotland and we've got a long, long way to go."" SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, who has also been in the Edinburgh parliament from the start, said: ""If you say that a parliament should reflect the people that it serves, I think we do that in quite a lot of ways. ""We're not quite there yet with equality for women and we're certainly not there yet with other equalities that we need to take notice of. But the will is there."" The first episode of the documentary will reflect primarily on the early years of the new Scottish Parliament, which was formally opened by the Queen on 1 July 1999. One early controversy also centred around the issue of equality and moves by the then Labour-Liberal Democrat executive to scrap the controversial Section 28 or clause 2A law that banned the ""promotion"" of homosexuality in schools. A high-profile campaign to keep the clause was led by businessman Sir Brian Souter, who funded a postal referendum on the issue. After months of bitter political argument, MSPs voted to repeal the law in June 2000. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: ""I really hated that idea that one rich person could have ownership over a whole idea, it really brought home to me that it is not always a fair playing field and that really stuck in my craw."" Ms Davidson also reflected on the 2014 law change that would allow same-sex couples to marry in Scotland. ""When the bill was finally passed, I went back up the stairs to my office and I burst into tears,"" she told the BBC. ""After that, very late on, I went to a get-together in the pub with some of the campaigners and through a weird series of events someone there put me in touch with the person who is now my fiancee, so it almost started another chapter of my life."" Episode one of Children Of The Devolution is on BBC Scotland at 22:00 on Tuesday."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-43632366,'Punish a Muslim' scorned by community,"People gather to ""reclaim April 3 from hatred"" after letters were sent out urging violence.",3 Apr 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Three weeks ago, letters urging people to ""Punish a Muslim"" on 3 April arrived in homes in Bradford, Leicester, London, Cardiff and Sheffield. It sparked fears of violence with some Muslim people being too scared to leave home. But when one Cardiff man heard how scared his young children were, he worked with his community to ""reclaim 3 April from hatred"". Moseem Suleman helped to hastily arrange a social event in the Grangetown area of Cardiff. He said: ""Today is my brother's birthday. It should be joyous occasion. But it became a day my young children were afraid of.  ""They had heard bad things might happen to them. It is all they could talk about on their way home from school and it made me so sad."" Meet the man correcting stories about Muslims Communities unite to defy 'Punish A Muslim Day'  This is my country, too How the hijab became a fashion statement Mr Suleman and other members of Grangetown took less than three weeks to put on a day named Cardiff Together: One Love. So on Tuesday, Grange Gardens was filled with the sound of laugher and idle chat. Families sprawled on blankets on the damp grass, enjoying a mismatched picnic of onion bhajis and cupcakes.  Children thumped a football back and forth, while teenagers huddled in groups, scrolling on their mobile phones and giggling. ""I did not want them to remember this day of fear,"" Mr Suleman told the crowd. ""I wanted them to have happy memories. And because of this event, now they do."" To any passing onlooker, it would appear a normal, relaxed scene of togetherness in one of Cardiff's most diverse communities.   Yet it was organised in response to an ominous threat - a so-called Punish A Muslim day that had spread across the UK via social media.  The planned day - sparked by hate mail sent to individuals in Bradford, Leicester, London, Cardiff and Sheffield - has left many Muslim people too scared to leave their homes for fear of being attacked, with women particularly worried they might have their hijab torn off on the street.   But at the Hideout Café, the day has been used as an incentive to bring people together in defiance.  For Mariyah Zaman, 19, a media student at Cardiff Metropolitan University, the day is a symptom of the growing anti-Muslim sentiment she feels is sweeping across the UK and Europe.  She said: ""As horrific as it is, when I first heard about the Punish a Muslim Day, I wasn't surprised. ""Islamophobia has become normalised - especially against women who are visibly Muslim. ""It's not just in the street; it is present in institutions and work places. Muslims face stigmatisation every day.  ""People need to be educated and equipped with the right information. The biggest cause of Islamophobia is a lack of awareness and an irrational fear."" It is a view Ali Abdi, 30, agrees with. A local community activist who has lived in Grangetown all his life, he dedicates much of his spare time to trying to improve the area.  He said: ""This area has fabulous cohesion and a great history of it.  ""So my message today is that, in the face of division and hatred, as a community we carry on. ""No one is born to hate another person. People are taught it, and anything that is taught can also be untaught."" The event - ""Cardiff together: One love"" - was organised by the Cardiff working group of Muslim Engagement and Development (MEND) -  a national organisation which seeks to empower British Muslims - along with the Muslim Council of Wales.  But it has also been supported by other faith groups.  When invited to address the crowd over the microphone, Aled Edwards, secretary of the Interfaith Council for Wales and himself a Christian, said: ""The friendship and dialogue between the faith communities in Cardiff and Wales is very strong. ""If one of communities is persecuted in this way, we come together very quickly.  ""Tomorrow it might be Jews who are attacked or Hindus or Christians. ""We use it as an excuse to renew our friendship and stand together. But for Yasmin Khan, of Cyncoed, Cardiff, the low turnout of local Grangetown Muslims showed the level of fear the community still have. Waving her arm at the surrounding terrace houses, she said: ""This whole area is full of Muslims. ""But I have spoken to them, and they are too frightened of being attacked, so they haven't come. ""Even some mosques have said 'don't go out'.   ""My view is that this is not right. We have to live harmoniously. We can't just be frightened and made to stay in the house.""  Perhaps those who best sum up the day are two teenage girls - a Muslim and non-Muslim - who live over the road from each other and have bonded playing football on the community pitch.  Kicking a ball back and forth between themselves, one said: ""The Punish a Muslim Day is just so dumb.  ""Why do Muslims get blamed for all the terrorism and bad things that happen?"" Her friend - dressed in a headscarf, jeans and trainers - nods in agreement. ""It's true,"" she said, curling a ball to her friend's feet. ""We're taught in school not to judge people on how they look. ""You have to get to know them first. Adults need to learn that. It's 2018, after all. Not 1800."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44620412,A US civility crisis: Total political war,"In an increasingly acrimonious political scene, has the tenor of US civil discourse ever been worse?",1 Jul 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Interrupted dinners, driveway confrontations, threatening leaflets. Donald Trump administration officials are increasingly facing harassment from liberals enraged by the president's words and actions.  Is it a reflection of an increasingly acrimonious political environment, a sign that liberals are spinning out of control or a reasonable response by citizens faced with what some see as a historic national crisis and a president who critics say likes to stoke the fires of discord? It depends on who you ask and - in an increasing fractured US society - their partisan proclivities. The recent round of actions and reactions, accusations and recriminations, began last week when a group protesting against the administration's policy of separating undocumented migrant families at the border forced Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to cut short a dinner in a Washington Mexican restaurant. There have been protests since the start of the Trump presidency, of course, but the audio recordings and first-person accounts of crying children and despondent parents have sent a shock of crackling anger through already frayed nerves of those on the left. A few days after the Nielsen incident, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, an early Trump supporter, was chased out of a theatre by activists questioning her support for the administration's immigration and healthcare policies. The same night, in the western Virginia town of Lexington, the owner of an organic restaurant, the Red Hen, asked White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to dine somewhere else. Ms Sanders, one of the most visible members of the Trump administration, complied. Stephanie Wilkinson would later tell the Washington Post that she decided to make the request because she and members of her restaurant staff viewed the Trump administration's policies towards gays, and immigrant families at the border as ""inhumane and unethical"". ""I'm not a huge fan of confrontation,"" she said. ""This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals."" One of the restaurant's waiters posted about the incident on Facebook, and Ms Sanders responded to media requests for comment with a tweet confirming - and condemning - the incident. The restaurant, the Red Hen, was inundated by a mix of threats and praise, and Ms Sanders reportedly will begin receiving US Secret Service security protection. Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters, at a rally in California, applauded the restaurant confrontations - and encouraged more protests. ""The American people have put up with this president long enough,"" she said. ""If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them!"" On Monday, Mr Trump entered the fray, tweeting about the Red Hen incident and calling into question the restaurant's cleanliness. He also issued what seemed like a thinly veiled warning to Ms Waters, adding that she is an ""extraordinarily low IQ person"". ""She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement,"" he wrote. ""Be careful what you wish for Max!"" Since then, protesters have demonstrated outside the apartment complex of Stephen Miller, a White House adviser considered one of the architects of Mr Trump's immigration policy, handing out ""wanted"" leaflets alluding to the family-separation practice and accusing him of being guilty of kidnapping children, ""crimes against humanity"", Islamophobia and promoting Nazism and white supremacy. Pro-immigration activists also shouted at Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell at Georgetown University, before they were confronted by his wife, Trump administration Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. By Thursday night, Mr Trump was leaning into the growing political conflagration, saying that the restaurant protesters ""really want anarchy"" and that his government would ensure ""really strong law and order"". It's Mr Trump's style, displayed on the campaign trail and in the White House, to never back down from a fight. A traditional role of the president has been to play mediator, not instigator - a force for civic reconciliation, not confrontation.  This president, however, frequently finds strength in conflict, and he appears to sense that railing against enemies on the left could be a useful way to animate his political base. In tone and demeanour, the differences between Mr Trump and his predecessor have never seemed greater. In a fundraiser on Thursday night, Barack Obama told Democrats that his party needs to preach hope and unity in the forthcoming mid-term congressional election campaigns. ""The majority of the country doesn't want to see a dog-eat-dog world where everybody is angry all the time,"" he said. The confrontational nature of the recent protests and restaurant demonstrations has set off a debate, playing out on social media, television airwaves and newspaper opinion pages over whether American discourse is becoming unacceptably coarse. The Daily Beast's Matt Lewis called it the start of an ""Uncivil War"", where the each side of the political divide believes the other is ""evil and illegitimate"" - and acts accordingly. Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, says that while things are bad, the current ""level of vitriol"" is far from unprecedented. She points to acrimony following the 2000 presidential race, which had to be resolved by the US Supreme Court, Vietnam War protests and civil rights upheaval in the 1960s and, of course, the real Civil War - the one resolved by bullets and cannons - as times when things were worse. America was founded in revolution and war, she notes, so confrontation and conflict are, in a way, hardwired into the nation's DNA. ""In the 1960s our leaders were being gunned down in the streets or at their political rallies,"" she says. ""Sarah Huckabee Sanders being asked to leave a restaurant, we're going to put that in the same category? No."" If there's something that's different now, it's the ubiquity of social media and the immediacy that it gives every instance of confrontation and conflict. Where in the past, Perry says, an unpleasant restaurant episode might take days to make it into a newspaper or appear in a political memoir decades later, modern society means within hours the entire nation can be tuned in with outrage or approval.   A November 2017 Marist poll confirmed that more Americans are feeling as though the ""overall tone and level of civility"" in Washington during the Trump presidency is getting worse (67%) rather than improving (6%). Dive a little deeper, however, and the partisan finger-pointing is on full display. When asked whether Republicans ""cross the line"" in terms of attacking the other side, 80% of Democrats say yes. When Republicans are asked about Democrats, fully 87% say their opponents go too far. A May CBS/YouGov survey may offer some hints about Mr Trump's appeal, with 78% of Republicans in battleground congressional districts saying they ""mostly like"" how Mr Trump upsets the ""elites and the establishment"".  If confrontation is Mr Trump's brand, at least among Republicans it's a winning tactic. But do Democrats want that to be their brand, too? Within liberal ranks, a subsidiary debate is taking place over whether the strategy of aggressive confrontation is appropriate or a step too far, a needed escalation or a counterproductive effort. ""Hard to understand this argument that tossing [Ms Sanders] is somehow 'doing something' that will help elect Democrats, defeat Trump or change policy,"" tweets former Obama strategist David Axelrod. ""It won't."" He calls it a ""total political gift"" to Mr Trump. Others groused at what they saw as a double standard being applied to the political left. ""The one-sided nature of the 'civility' debate - where only liberals are lectured about this, while Trump mocks disabled people and Gold Star families, but liberals are told to play nice - reminds me, as usual, of the dynamics of abuse,"" tweets Salon politics writer Amanda Marcotte. On Thursday afternoon, a man walked into an Annapolis, Maryland, newspaper office and killed five journalists. Although local police report the suspect had a long-running grudge with the publication, it wasn't long before that tragic event, too, was subsumed by political recriminations and accusations that opponents had created an environment for the violence.  Many on the left pointed out that Mr Trump had repeatedly called journalists ""enemies of the American people"". Fox's Sean Hannity said Ms Waters' comments created a political atmosphere where such violence was more likely. In World War II, military conflict expanded into ""total war"" - where entire nations and peoples were mobilised and consumed in the flames of battle. There was no escape from the carnage. What US society now may be experiencing is total political war, where - thanks to media and technology - partisan discord is inescapable, whether in the corridors of power in Washington and theatres in Florida, the border with Mexico or restaurants in rural Virginia."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-47471903,Row in Scottish Labour ahead of conference,The former leader of Scottish Labour launches an attack on her successor over Brexit just days before the party's conference.,6 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The former leader of Scottish Labour has launched an attack on her successor just days before the party's conference.  Kezia Dugdale strongly criticised Richard Leonard's approach to Brexit in a letter that that was later leaked.  She also accused him of ""censoring"" two of the party's MEPs over their support for another referendum on EU membership.  A Labour source said this had been the result of a ""misunderstanding"".  And he said Mr Leonard had written to the two MEPs - Catherine Stihler and David Martin - to apologise.  The party's conference in Dundee begins on Friday and lasts until Sunday. In her letter, Ms Dugdale said she wanted to ""formally complain"" to Mr Leonard about the way in which Ms Stihler and Mr Martin had been treated ahead of the conference. She also claimed Ms Stihler's section in the conference guide had originally included a statement in support of a so-called People's Vote on Brexit which had been changed without her consent.  Ms Dugdale wrote: ""From what I can see from the agenda, there is no formal opportunity for them to speak or indeed a formal item to thank them for their combined 55 years of electoral service to the party. ""If that wasn't bad enough, I was shocked to discover from Catherine that her statement in the conference guide had been amended without her consent. ""When that was challenged, she was told it was on your direction and that you had the final say on what was printed."" Ms Dugdale, who has been a prominent campaigner for another referendum on Brexit, claimed the section had originally said: ""Brexit is a tragedy for our country and for the workers and communities that Labour represents.  ""That's why David and Catherine fully support a People's Vote with the option to remain in the EU."" However, according to Ms Dugdale, the section was replaced with: ""The complete mess the Tories have made of Brexit means they are putting Scottish people's jobs and our industries at risk. Labour will always put them first."" Ms Dugdale said changing the section without Ms Stihler's permission was ""wholly inappropriate"", adding: ""I can't possibly understand why you would seek to censor her final words to party members, especially since what she states is party policy and has been since last September."" A Labour source told BBC Scotland: ""This was a genuine misunderstanding and Richard has written to Catherine and David to apologise.""  Mr Leonard was also criticised in the email for his stance on Brexit, with Ms Dugdale expressing her disappointment that his support for holding a People's Vote had not come sooner. She wrote: ""You know that I've found the party's position on Brexit and a second EU referendum disappointing for some time. ""As I said at group last week and repeatedly over the past few months, I don't believe there is such a thing as a good Brexit or indeed a 'jobs first Brexit'. ""The move towards supporting a People's Vote is a welcome one, but it should have happened much, much earlier. I note from your roundtable with journalists last week that you'd sooner we left the EU than give people a final say. ""That's disappointing for the many party members who fervently back a final say and indeed all of our voters who are now a bit lost for a home."" Mr Leonard is a close ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who had previously resisted pressure from Remain supporters in his own party to get behind another referendum, insisting he preferred to force a general election. But Mr Corbyn announced a change of heart last month, telling his MPs: ""One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May's overwhelmingly rejected deal. ""That's why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country."" Mr Leonard later told BBC Scotland he backed the move, saying it could be the only way to break the deadlock over Brexit at Westminster.  He also said he was ""disappointed"" that Labour's investigation into claims of Islamophobia against a Dumfries and Galloway councillor was taking so long.  Jim Dempster was suspended by Labour in March of last year after admitting telling transport officials that ""no-one would have seen [then-transport minister Humza Yousaf] under his burka"". Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland he was hurt that the case had still not been dealt with almost a year after it was referred to Labour's national disciplinary body in London. But Mr Leonard said: ""The case is being dealt with through due process. I'm disappointed that it's taking as long as it has - the person involved in the complaint is still suspended from the Labour Party and I hope this will be resolved very quickly indeed"". Mr Dempster apologised to Mr Yousaf at the time, saying he was ""thoroughly ashamed and embarrassed"" by the comments he had made, and that ""my ignorance is totally inexcusable."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-43170447,Should a school be in a place like this?,Inspectors say there are more than 350 unregistered schools but they have few powers to investigate.,27 Feb 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"School inspectors have warned that there are hundreds of unregistered schools but that they have few powers to investigate or shut them down.  When you think of a place that teaches groups of children - all day, every day - the word most people would use is ""school"". But the law in England is surprisingly vague on what a school actually is.  More than 350 sites - suspected of being unregistered schools - have been investigated in England by education watchdog Ofsted since a specialist taskforce was set up two years ago. Ofsted inspectors say they don't have proper powers to inspect or close them. The people running these sites say they are not schools at all.  Some of them are on industrial estates, in church basements and even in pubs. The BBC has obtained pictures showing squalor, appalling food hygiene and dangerous wiring. Some premises have blocked fire escapes and no access to clean drinking water. Many sites do no criminal records checking of staff. But because of the confusing legal situation, most remain open. Suri's son is about to leave his primary and go to big school.  Not every parent is happy about the choice of education they end up with, but Suri - not her real name - breaks down in tears when she thinks about where her boy is going.  Later this year he will start at a ""yeshiva"" in the Haredi ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill, north London. It is not registered and its premises and teaching go unmonitored by the authorities.  Suri's son will never do GCSEs there, as these yeshivas usually don't provide any maths, English or science despite operating full-time. Instead they offer a wholly religious education for boys, focused on scripture, from the age of 13. At their schools, girls are often able to study secular subjects and do exams, but after a Haredi boy's Bar Mitzvah, devotion to religious education is imperative. Those who run yeshivas would argue that they are not schools and therefore don't have to abide by the rules that the state imposes.   If you have any information or experience with unregistered schools that you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch with us, in confidence, at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk And the Department for Education seems to accept that yeshivas are not technically schools.  In a statement, the DfE told the BBC that yeshivas ""do not meet the definition of a school and cannot therefore be prosecuted for operating as an unregistered school"". The DfE guidelines for England say that any place that teaches five or more children for at least 18 hours a week needs to be registered as a school. In Wales, anywhere offering ""full-time education"" is expected to register. In Northern Ireland the law requires all independent schools to register. The same applies in Scotland. But legal guidance known to have been cited by the DfE says a site is not technically a school if it doesn't teach general classes of education, such as maths, English or science.  Hence any place that only teaches religious education - be it Muslim, Jewish, Christian or any other faith - is arguably not a school.  But critics say that it is bizarre that a building - where children of school age are taught full-time - is not deemed a school. ""Of course they're schools,"" says Jay Harman, of pressure group Humanists UK, which campaigns on the issue of unregistered schools. ""These are places which provide children their only education from dawn till dusk. The fact that it's scriptural doesn't detract from their status as schools."" For the critics, to define the yeshivas as anything other than schools would suggest that the children are getting their main form of education elsewhere. The law demands all children have an efficient full-time education, whether at a school or at home. That's simply not happening, says Izzy Posen, 23, who was at a Stamford Hill yeshiva from the age of 13.  ""Children are in a yeshiva from as early as 8am until as late as 9pm - if that isn't a school, I'm not sure what is.  ""They're not taught anything else at home. There's no secular studies but this is the sole education I got - I didn't get any other. I couldn't speak or write English.  ""When I came out of these yeshivas, I had to teach myself English because I was never taught English. ""I remember at 18 reading an elementary school text book. I had no idea what the maths Pi symbol meant."" Certainly Suri believes that going to yeshiva will mean that her son does not get a full education.  ""There is no education at all and we're living in Britain - boys can't speak English,"" Suri says. She acknowledges that many Haredi parents are happy for their children to only have religious education.  But Suri believes her sons will struggle to get jobs if they ever want to find work. ""They'll have no future. They'll be stuck on benefits and left behind. Culture is important, identity is important, but there has to be a balance."" Suri belongs to one of the more conservative groupings within the Haredi community. She says if she were to try to enrol her son in a different school - even another Haredi one in Stamford Hill - she would face shame both in her community and within her own family. ""We'd be considered bad parents. We'd be ostracised."" Suri took an unusual step and contacted Hackney Council and Ofsted to press them to close the unregistered schools or launch inspections. Despite acknowledging that these places exist, the authorities said they couldn't help her.   But as well as the yeshivas for boys aged 13-16, the BBC has found two suspected Haredi primaries that have never been inspected by Ofsted. One was based in a building belonging to a synagogue in Westcliff-on-Sea, in Essex, but run separately by a Haredi group. The children there were much younger than those one would see at a yeshiva. The synagogue denies that an unregistered school is being run on the premises.  It says that the education provided is within the 18-hour limit. But when the BBC observed it, it was operating for longer hours. We filmed footage of a teacher appearing to manhandle a distressed child on one occasion, and strike a different boy on another. These incidents showed ""huge safeguarding issues"", according to Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner. The synagogue said it had not been aware of any assaults and has requested more information. It has since suspended the school. Another suspected unregistered primary school was located in a house in Hackney, where at least 30 young boys could be observed arriving at the beginning of the school day. When we knocked at the door we were told it was a club and advised to speak to a man - Moses Lewis - who says he advises ""schools and non-schools"" in the area.  He points out that there are many more registered schools than unregistered ones. ""I don't think we give the country much trouble by the way we educate our children."" He says he is confident that the law is not being broken. ""If somebody's got the courage, be it the Department for Education, be it Ofsted, let them pluck up the courage and bring a prosecution and let's fight it out in court."" In January, Hackney Council released its long-delayed investigation into the 30 or so unregistered educational sites in the borough. It called for greater inspection powers. Eli Spitzer is the headmaster of a registered school in north London, but attended two unregistered schools himself. He took GCSEs after graduating from a yeshiva and believes a solution can be found if the Department for Education acts. ""The overwhelming majority of schools are registered. ""If parents are reassured that what the authorities want is purely and simply compliance with the law, and are willing to accommodate their desire to educate their children in this type of way, I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to find a solution to this."" While he acknowledges there are some major obstacles - such as the teaching of sex education - he says regulatory inertia is responsible for the presence of so many unregistered schools. ""Like every industry that is unregulated, people just act with impunity, start taking advantage, start cutting corners - compliance and health and safety for example."" On a morning in July 2017, three Ofsted inspectors visited a building in central London they suspected of housing an unregistered school. Just a mile's walk from the Tower of London, the site in Whitechapel was housed in a four-storey block on a stretch of Commercial Road, surrounded by women's clothes wholesalers and curry restaurants. After they arrived, inspectors allege they were called ""Britain First paedophiles"" - a reference to the far-right group - by a former headteacher, Mohammed Umair. Umair is now facing prosecution for racially abusing Ofsted inspectors. He denies abusing them. Umair was issued with a warning notice by the inspectors for allegedly running a school on the site.  The year before, Ayasofia Primary, a registered school he had run from a building nearby was shut down after inspections found failings.  But Umair maintains he wasn't operating an unregistered school and says the centre was being run by someone else on a part-time basis.  Last September, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu addressed the general issue of unregistered schools. He said in ""segregated and isolated communities, unregulated and home schooling are a breeding ground for extremism and future terrorism"". The BBC has obtained a book from an unregistered school for young children in Birmingham that advocates the murder of gay people.  ""Those guilty of this crime are to be killed by the sword,"" says a passage in Forbidden, written by Muhammad Saleh al-Munajjid.  Another chapter warns a wife against refusing sex with her husband. Elsewhere it says a woman wearing perfume is an adulterer. The book ""undermines the values which British schools seek to promote"" and ""could potentially isolate young impressionable minds of Muslim schoolchildren"", according to Dr Iqtidar Cheema, director of the Institute for Leadership and Community Development, run by the charity Muslim Aid. ""Such moral and conceptual isolation is the first step to radicalisation."" Dr Farid Panjwani of the Institute of Education says some Muslims perceive they are marginalised and that unregistered schools may be a product of that.  A number of factors, including the government's anti-radicalisation Prevent strategy and episodes of Islamophobia, lead to some Muslims feeling ""disproportionate scrutiny"", he says. ""We should not generalise. The vast majority of schools with Muslim religious character are registered and doing well, some of them are performing at the top of the country."" In September 2015 a mixed school called Enterprise Diamond was set up in the basement of St Swithun's Church in Lewisham, south-east London. Nine pupils were enrolled.  Some had previously been home schooled. The parents of others did not want them going to a Pupil Referral Unit - a centre that educates children who are expelled or otherwise unable to attend school. The school was set up by Kay Johnston. She had attempted to register it but started lessons before the process was finished. Soon after, Johnston faced serious allegations from her time at another school in 2014. She was accused of assaulting a five year-old pupil with learning difficulties. Johnston was also claimed to have pushed the child off a chair.  After reviewing CCTV footage, a panel from the National College for Teaching and Leadership banned Johnston from teaching in January 2016. She denies striking the child and says she was bitten and kicked several times. Johnston appealed and continued to run Enterprise Diamond before it was inspected by Ofsted in March 2016 and served with a warning notice for running an unregistered school. She closed the school shortly after. There is no suggestion any child was harmed at the school. ""I never set out to do anything illegal,"" Johnston says. ""I was threatened with a jail sentence for rescuing vulnerable children who have been given up on by mainstream schools, caring for them, educating them at my own expense."" One mother, whose son and daughter both attended, says she chose to educate them there because she was unhappy with the alternatives offered by the state. Pupil referral units in the area are ""a pipeline to failure"", she says, leading to a life of crime.    The BBC has learned that local authorities across England and Wales have received 52 safeguarding alerts - concerns or suspicions of abuse or neglect - since January 2014 from unregistered schools. The majority of reports concerned allegations of physical abuse, but alerts were also made about sexual abuse and grooming. Alerts were received across England, with one in Wales. None were reported in Scotland and Northern Ireland. When Ofsted finds a suspected unregistered school, they can only issue a warning notice and seek to prosecute the individual running the school. The Department for Education has to approve this, then evidence is passed to the Crown Prosecution Service, before the education secretary is given the final decision to proceed. ""It takes an inordinately long time and [lots of] resources,"" says Victor Shafiee, Ofsted's deputy director for unregistered schools. ""It's not good enough.""  Ofsted says it has limited investigative powers - that it is not allowed to take away any evidence, force entry to premises with locked doors or compel witnesses to be interviewed. Despite investigating 359 suspected unregistered schools, it has yet to secure a single prosecution against a proprietor for running one.  Ofsted Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman says that her ""hands are tied"" and that the DfE ""could and should"" have approved cases to be put forward to the CPS. The DfE says it works very closely with Ofsted and jointly agrees which cases are sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. ""The CPS then determine whether the evidential and public interest tests are met. If the Director of Public Prosecutions takes a decision to charge, the case then comes to the secretary of state for his consent. So far no cases have reached that stage. ""No child should be placed at risk and where a school is operating illegally action must be taken. We fund a joint team with Ofsted to target these organisations and as a result of that, 192 inspections have taken place and 50 warning notices have been issued.  ""Thirty-eight unregistered schools have subsequently ceased to operate as schools and investigations are ongoing into the remainder."" Ofsted says there is anecdotal evidence of some places opening on new sites. Shafiee says a change in the law is needed to shut these places down when inspectors visit them. Ministers have regularly been warned about the issue. Ed Balls was told about the problem of unregistered schools in Hackney by civil servants when he was the education secretary in 2009. The civil servants said yeshivas were ""operating illegally and without the most basic health, safety and child welfare checks"". Then in 2014, details of a dozen unregistered schools in London were sent to the department, then led by Michael Gove. His successor, Nicky Morgan, was also alerted to the issue in a confidential advice note from 2015. ""Her Majesty's Chief Inspector is very concerned that the children and young people attending these unregistered schools are potentially at risk,"" it said. ""It is of utmost importance that urgent action is taken to ensure that they are kept safe and receive a suitable education."" In October 2015, it looked as if change was afoot. In his party conference speech, Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to introduce greater regulation of what he called supplementary schools. ""These children should be having their minds opened, their horizons broadened, not having their heads filled with poison and their hearts filled with hate,"" he said. ""If an institution is teaching children intensively, then whatever its religion, we will, like any other school, make it register so it can be inspected."" But Cameron's promise never materialised. One of the reasons for the failure to act is understood to have been the objections raised by the Church of England. New proposals would have allowed Ofsted powers over any place supervising pupils for more than eight hours a week. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, believed the measures would impose a burden on even the smallest church Sunday schools. But the BBC understands there may be another reason for the DfE's reluctance to act. We have seen legal guidance from 2014 known to have been cited by the DfE. The guidance suggests the DfE would lose in court if there was an attempt to close an unregistered Jewish yeshiva. Daniel Greenberg QC, acting for a yeshiva, argued that somewhere providing only ""specialised religious education"" did not count as a school because it offers no secular teaching whatsoever. The DfE makes a distinction between ""unregistered schools"" and ""out-of-school settings"". In the latter it includes ""full-time settings that only teach a religious curriculum, and therefore do not qualify as schools"". Dame Louise Casey - who led a review of community cohesion in 2016 - says it's a ""crazy policy"" for the DfE to have. ""We do not want kids growing up here who are only taught one religious way of thinking, and that religion covers their whole way of life from what they can work as, who they can be, what kind of jobs they can do, how they treat women. ""Even if it's technically legal, it's wrong.""

Images of Sam Farrell at a party on 23 March wearing striped pyjamas with a Holocaust number were tweeted by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) who said they were ""extremely concerned"". The president-elect had been due to take up the role at Edge Hill University in Ormskirk on 1 July. He said he was ""deeply sorry"". The UJS welcomed the apology but said his ""consistent history of antisemitic, Islamophobic, homophobic, transphobic, sexist and ableist social media posts deem him unfit for a role such as SU president"". Edge Hill Students' Union (SU) said they plan to organise anti-Semitism training for all new student officers after being contacted by a UJS representative. Mr Farrell had previously been disciplined over the incident but a fresh action was opened on 24 March due to new evidence, the SU said. At the time he said: ""Despite what my past posts may suggest, I do understand the severity of making light of events from history, especially when that history plays a fundamental role in reminding us of the needless persecution of others. ""I only hope I can convey how genuine I am when I say that I now realise how naïve and ignorant my past behaviour was. It was wrong, it will not happen again, and it should not have happened in the first place."" The SU said it would now ""be considering our options for the role for the forthcoming academic year"". In a statement, Edge Hill University said it welcomed the decision.  ""While the Students' Union is a wholly independent organisation, responsible for the election and appointment of its officers, the university has always been clear that it will not tolerate abhorrent, abusive or racist behaviour of any kind and would not hesitate to use its own procedures if necessary if the matter was not dealt with appropriately."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48434202,Call for Tory Islamophobia investigation,"The Muslim Council of Britain says a problem ""runs deep into the party"" and is demanding an inquiry.",28 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Muslim Council of Britain has formally asked the UK's human rights watchdog to investigate accusations of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. In a letter to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, the MCB said a problem ""runs deep into the party"".  The EHRC said in response that it was considering complaints about the party in line with its ""usual processes"".  In March, party deputy chairman James Cleverly insisted ""immediate action"" was taken after any racism claims. The MCB is an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies, including mosques, schools, and charitable associations. It has called repeatedly for an independent investigation into discrimination claims. Now, in its letter filing a formal complaint to the EHRC, it accused the Conservatives of not taking action against Islamophobia shown by Tory MPs, and tolerating discrimination towards party members.  The MCB said there was ""sufficient evidence"" to suggest the party may have breached anti-discrimination law, and accused it of showing a ""callous attitude to complaints"".  Among the allegations, it cited comments made by Boris Johnson about women wearing burkas looking like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"" as an example of when Tory MPs had created an ""atmosphere of hostility towards the Muslim members of the party"". The former foreign secretary was later cleared of breaking the Tories' code of conduct - a decision the MCB criticised at the time.  The group also criticised the unsuccessful London mayoral campaign of Zac Goldsmith in 2016 - in which he ran against Sadiq Khan - arguing it demonstrated a ""tolerance for Islamophobia"" within the Conservative Party.  The MCB complaint comes on the same day that the EHRC announced a formal investigation into the Labour Party over allegations of anti-Semitism. Conservative peer Baroness Warsi, who was the first female Muslim cabinet minister, has long criticised her party over the issue. In April, Tory chairman Brandon Lewis insisted the party's approach to Islamophobia was ""transparent"" but would not say how many complaints it had received. An EHRC spokesman said the body had written to the Conservative Party ""to ask for information in order to help assess the complaints"".  Earlier this month, the MCB criticised the government for rejecting a definition of Islamophobia created by a cross-party group of MPs. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims wanted to define it to tackle what it called a ""social evil"". Its wording has the support of various political parties - including Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Conservatives - and several Muslim groups. But a government spokesman said it needed ""further careful consideration"" and had ""not been broadly accepted""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47488047,Rudd apologises over 'coloured' term,"Diane Abbott says Amber Rudd's use of the word ""coloured"" was ""outdated"" and ""offensive"".",8 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has apologised for using the word ""coloured"" in a BBC interview.  Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised the use of the term, saying it was ""outdated"", ""offensive"" and a ""revealing choice of words"". During a discussion about MP abuse, Ms Rudd said: ""It's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse."" In her apology, Ms Rudd said she was ""mortified at my clumsy language"". The prime minister's official spokeswoman said making an apology was ""absolutely the right thing to do"". Historically, the word is associated with segregation, especially in the US, where black people were kept separate from white people - on public transport, or at drinking fountains which were described as ""coloured-only"" for example. It is regarded as an offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday life. The exchange happened during an interview on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. Host Jeremy Vine asked Ms Rudd: ""The question is, given that all people in the public eye seem to get terrible tweets from strangers, whether it's worse if you're a woman?"" Ms Rudd replied: ""It definitely is worse if you're a woman, it's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. ""I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, that's something we need to call out."" But Ms Abbott responded on Twitter, saying it was a ""revealing choice of words"". Former home secretary Ms Rudd apologised on Twitter. Separately, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has been criticised for her response to a question from Labour MP Naz Shah, about Islamophobia. The shadow women and equalities minister had called for a Commons debate, after the former Tory minister Baroness Warsi criticised the Conservatives over Islamophobia.  Ms Shah added that the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims had recently published a definition of Islamophobia. Mrs Leadsom replied that the Conservatives had an ""extremely robust and urgent"" response to Islamophobia but went on to suggest that, on the definition of Islamophobia, Ms Shah ""can discuss with Foreign Office ministers whether that would be a useful way forward"". Ms Shah said later: ""To say that British Muslims facing Islamophobia here in the UK is a 'Foreign Office' issue is truly baffling and horrifically alludes to British Muslims as foreigners. ""It just goes to show how out of touch the Tories are with a problem that their politicians and councillors are exacerbating."" A spokesman for the Commons Leader's office spokesman said: ""Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place. ""It was thought the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia.  ""International efforts to combat Islamophobia (and all forms of religious persecution and prejudice) are lead by the PM's special envoy on freedom of religion or belief, Lord Ahmad, at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. ""Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swiftly by the Home Office or Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government as appropriate."" But Baroness Warsi, a Conservative peer, tweeted: ""What is wrong with some of my colleagues?"""

It meant private companies were responsible for monitoring medium and low-risk offenders, with payment linked to results. But now those changes will be reversed by the end of 2020. In March the National Audit Office said problems with the new system had cost taxpayers almost £500m, and that numbers returning to prison for breaching their licence had ""skyrocketed"". Chief probation inspector Dame Glenys Stacey said the model of part-privatisation was ""irredeemably flawed"". Dame Glenys said she was ""delighted"" about Justice Secretary David Gauke's decision. But Janine McDowell, of Sodexo Justice Services in the UK & Ireland, claimed it would ""increase cost and risk"". With one week to go until the UK takes part in EU elections, Theresa May will meet the executive of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers today. They're expected to demand that she sets a date for her departure. The Conservatives and Labour are still trying to negotiate a deal that would allow a Brexit withdrawal agreement to pass the House of Commons. MPs will vote on a withdrawal bill - which is required to implement Mrs May's deal - next month.

Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Ex-BBC DJ Chris Evans has helped Virgin Radio break the one million listener barrier, the latest Rajar ratings show. His new breakfast show attracted an average weekly audience of 1.05 million in the first three months of 2019. Virgin Radio as a whole was averaging about 480,000 listeners per week before he joined. Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent The decision to renationalise offender supervision will be seen as an admission by the government that Chris Grayling's flagship reforms have failed. He went ahead in 2014 despite numerous warnings about the considerable risks of splitting probation services between different providers and introducing a method of payment-by-results. Probation unions and criminal justice experts urged him to at least pilot the new approach, so problems could be identified and rectified. But Mr Grayling went for quick, wholesale change. He wanted the contracts with the private companies firmly in place before the 2015 general election so the system couldn't be undone if there was a change of government. However, inspection after inspection signalled serious problems, with the nail in the coffin being Dame Glenys Stacey's report in March.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-41920794,Carl Sargeant's death: The emails,The family of Carl Sargeant have released correspondence sent between the former minister's solicitors and Labour before his death.,8 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The family of Carl Sargeant have released correspondence sent between the former minister's solicitors and the Labour Party before his death.  It constitutes both an email, with attached letter, sent to Labour from Mr Sargeant's solicitors on Monday this week, and an email sent by Labour to the solicitors on the day Mr Sargeant was sacked. What follows is the bulk of what was released to the media. On 6 November, Mr Sargeant's solicitor Huw Bowden emailed Sam Matthews, head of disputes at the Labour Party in London, at 16:48. He wrote: ""I write further to our telephone conversation on Friday and the letter Carl received by email on Friday to which I provide a letter in response. I would be grateful if you would acknowledge safe receipt. ""The understanding given to Carl and I on Friday was that you would now be dealing with the investigation and indeed a case number and investigations officer had been allocated to the case. To date neither Carl or I have heard from your investigations officer. ""Despite this the First Minister has felt able to conduct interviews with the BBC. In those interviews he has indicated he became 'aware of a number of incidents at the beginning of last week'. He says 'I asked my office to speak to those women involved who had provided detail of those incidents. As a result of those conversations I felt I had no choice but to refer the matter to the party'. ""In the light of the correspondence with Mr Sargeant on Friday this is clearly prejudicing what is allegedly an independent enquiry by your office. ""It would seem that already a large number of people have spoken to the complainant or complainants yet we still have received no disclosure of the complaint or complainants.  ""On Friday the First Minister of Wales advised our client he could not provide details of the complaint or complainants other than that his special advisor Matt Greenough had spoken to the complainant or complainants to verify the complaint."" The email added: ""We would ask that a full and complete log of contact with the witnesses be maintained, that the details of the complaints be disclosed and the content of our letter addressed as a matter of urgency."" The attached letter reads: ""Dear Sam, ""Re: Notice of administrative suspension from holding office or representing the Labour Party (and from the National Assembly Labour Party) ""Further to your telephone conversation with our Mr Bowden and Mr Sargeant on Friday 3rd November, as you are aware we have been formally instructed by Mr Sargeant in relation to the administrative decision to suspend him from the Labour Party and the National Assembly Party. ""We understand a decision was taken initially by the First Minister of Wales Mr Carwyn Jones on Friday 3rd November 2017 to dismiss him from his job as cabinet secretary. Mr Sargeant then received an email from Louise Magee, General Secretary of the Welsh Labour Party at 14.40 enclosing a letter from you dated 3rd November 2017. It is to this letter that we respond on his behalf. We also refer to the telephone conversation with Mr Sargeant and our Mr Bowden on 3rd November 2017 as referred to above and your email to Mr Sargeant and Mr Bowden received at 16.36 on 3rd November 2017. ""We would make it clear at the outset that our client categorically denies any allegation that he has acted in a manner that is either prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party. We are led to believe the allegations concern conduct that you described as our client having acted towards others in such a way as alleged to be 'unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping'. We make it clear that any such allegations are categorically denied. ""We would request immediate details as to the nature of the allegations that have been made against our client to enable him both to defend himself and to be satisfied as to the legitimacy and transparency of the procedure conducted upon receipt of the complaint. ""We would request information surrounding when, by whom and in what circumstances, were the complaint or complaints received. Was there one or more complaint? Were the complaints all received at the same time or on separate occasions and if so when? ""We also request details as to who received the complain on behalf of the Labour Party and how the complaint was dealt with upon its receipt. Was there an immediate investigation of those complaints and if so what was the outcome of that investigation? ""Upon review of the timescale for the progress of your investigation, the laying of charges and any hearing, we are gravely concerned that further delay will severely prejudice him. There will clearly be time needed to speak to witnesses of fact. In these circumstances we would require an urgent response to the above mentioned questioned raised. At the very least we would request the details of the names of the complainants and the dates, places and times that the allegations took place. ""When you spoke to our Mr Bowden on 3rd November you confirmed you were not aware of any parallel investigations being undertaken or having been contemplated. You confirmed that if you became aware of such parallel investigations then your investigation would be postponed then your investigation would be postponed and we would be notified immediately. ""With regard to the future progress of this case and the anticipated hearing, you mentioned a date of 16th January 2018. We would request the receipt of any charge and case papers at the earliest opportunity. We appreciate the papers should be received by Mr Sargeant no later than 6 weeks before the hearing (5th December 2017) however as the delay caused already has the potential to seriously prejudice our client we would ask for any papers to be forward to him as soon as possible. ""We are sure you appreciate the anxiety and distress being caused to our client particularly as he is yet to receive any details of the allegations that have led to the decisions taken to date by the First Minister of Wales, the Labour Party in Wales and the Labour Party head office. There is the potential requirement to interview a number of witnesses of fact and with the Christmas period intervening and the ongoing delay is both prejudicial to the preparation of our clients case but also to his physical and mental wellbeing. ""With regard to the potential hearing on 16th January 2018 we reserve the right to seek separate hearings if the allegations are separated in fact and time. We would also put you on notice that our client will be represented by solicitor and counsel at the hearing. ""Finally we seek clarification in relation to our client's legal costs. We would be grateful if you would confirm by return the liability of The Labour Party in that regard. Clearly our client faces serious and career threatening allegations. He maintains his innocence and indeed to date is unaware of the allegations made. As a committed member of the Labour Party he is anxious to ensure his name and the reputation of the Labour Party is preserved and as such he needs to be able to properly defend himself and accordingly we would seek confirmation that his reasonable legal fees will be covered. ""We look forward to hearing from you. ""Yours faithfully, Bowden Jones Solicitors."" The earliest correspondence of the set released was sent on 3 November from Mr Matthews to Mr Bowden, time-stamped 16:33. It reads: ""Hi Carl, ""Thank you for your call. ""If you have any further questions about the conduct of the Party's investigation, this is the best email address to reach me on. ""For you reference and as requested, I have attached Appendix 6 which outlines the process for a hearing of the NCC [National Constitutional Committee] - something which will occur if the NEC Disputes Panel refer the matter to the NCC.  ""Rule 2.I.8, to which the allegations relate, was changed at Labour Party conference this year.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47472902,Tory councillors quit in Islamophobia row,The two representatives were accused of sharing offensive Facebook posts about Labour's Sadiq Khan.,6 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Two Tory councillors have quit after being accused of sharing Islamophobic posts on social media. Len Milner and Chris Smith, who sit on East Staffordshire council, ""liked"" a cartoon posted on Facebook depicting a mock beheading of Labour's Sadiq Khan. Mr Milner said he had been cleared of wrongdoing by the council but had quit to avoid upsetting the party.  It comes amid claims that the party has ""buried its head in the sand"" over the extent of Islamophobia in its ranks.  Ex-Tory chairwoman Baroness Warsi has claimed senior officials ignored her warnings about the prevalence of anti-Muslim prejudice and Theresa May had failed to get to grips with the issue.  She widened her attack on senior figures on Tuesday, accusing Home Secretary Sajid Javid of ""dog whistle"" politics for comments he had made about grooming of young girls by young Muslim men.  ""I've called out Sajid on at least three occasions now on the language that he has used to deal with some very important technical and legal issues,"" she told BBC Politics Live. ""I've told Sajid very clearly that he is better than this."" The Conservatives say they have taken swift action when told about Islamophobic activity. On Monday, 14 Tory members were suspended for allegedly liking offensive comments posted on a Facebook group. In East Staffordshire, the two members of the party, including the current Mayor Chris Smith, have resigned amid claims they endorsed Islamophobic posts.  The posts appear to have been deleted from their respective Facebook accounts.  But Labour members on the council said one featured a meme of the Muslim mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, being beheaded while being knighted.  Members of the Labour group walked out of a council meeting on Monday ""in solidarity"" with Muslim colleagues and to ""stand up to racism"".  Mr Milner quit after being suspended by the party although he insisted his decision had nothing to do with the Conservatives beginning an internal investigation.  The East Staffordshire Conservative Association confirmed that Mr Smith had also resigned. ""We are a proudly anti-racist association and will not tolerate any form of prejudice including Islamophobia or anti-Semitism,"" its treasurer Aaron Bell said.  Mr Milner said the police had examined his Twitter history and told him ""there is nothing that gives any cause for concern and nothing that indicated right wing tendencies or affiliations"". East Staffordshire Council said its decision not to take action against Mr Milner did not mean that it had ""exonerated"" him. It said its investigation had concluded the tweets ""were not unlawful and while it is the case that people may disagree with the contents of his posts, or even be offended by them, that would not be sufficient to interfere with his right to freedom of expression"".  Meanwhile, a Conservative councillor in Kent has apologised for re-tweeting a message hailing the former English Defence Leader Tommy Robinson as a ""patriot"". Andrew Bowles, who has led Swale Borough Council for 16 years, was suspended after appearing to back a message criticising Facebook's decision to ban the anti-Islamic activist from its pages. The message contained a doctored image of the movie The Patriot featuring Mr Robinson's face superimposed on the body of the main character, played in the film by Mel Gibson. It said Mr Robinson's Facebook ban was due to him being ""racist to Muslims"", arguing that this was a ""disgraceful injustice"" and ""this corruptness needs to stop"". Mr Bowles said he had not meant to endorse Mr Robinson's ""racist and intolerant views"" which he found abhorrent. Instead, he wanted to make the point that ""silencing"" him risked turning him into a martyr.  He said he would attend a training course on acceptable social media conduct. Facebook removed Mr Robinson's official page and Instagram profile last month, saying its contents violated its policies on hate speech and the social network's community standards.  Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi said anyone engaging in Islamophobic activity or any kind of bigotry had no future in the party.  But he told BBC Radio 4's World at One he did not agree with Baroness Warsi it was an institutional problem. ""The Conservative Party has demonstrated that it deals with these things robustly,"" he said.  ""I would remind the country that what we do with a Muslim in the Conservative Party is make him home secretary."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55349800,Labour publishes plan to rid party of anti-Semitism,The plan is the party's official response to a highly critical report from the equalities watchdog.,17 Dec 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour has published a new plan for handling anti-Semitism in the party. It is a response to a highly critical report from the equalities watchdog, which found the party under its previous leadership had broken the law when handling anti-Semitism claims. The plan has been approved by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. It commits Labour to establishing an independent complaints process and addressing the backlog of anti-Semitism cases. Complaints of anti-Semitism dogged the party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. Following the publication of the EHRC's report, Mr Corbyn was briefly suspended from the party. He was later re-admitted but denied the parliamentary whip. In a foreword to the new plan, the party's now leader and deputy leader, Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, said tackling anti-Semitism was ""our number one priority"". The EHRC report was ""incredibly difficult reading for everyone who loves our party and wants it be a force for good"", the pair wrote.  ""But its findings were clear and stark: the Labour Party breached the Equality Act in terms of unlawful harassment and indirect discrimination towards our Jewish members,"" they said, adding that the party must take action. The party had been criticised for allowing political interference by the leader's office in the existing complaints process. The new plan commits the party to hiring external lawyers to advise panel hearings on anti-Semitism complaints. An investigation by the EHRC found evidence of 23 instances of ""inappropriate involvement"" by Mr Corbyn's office out of the 70 files it looked at. The new independents complaints process will handle any complaints of ""anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, sexual harassment and any discrimination based on protected characteristics"". Sir Keir and Ms Rayner said they would ""not hesitate to sanction those who breach our rules and regulations."" The plan also includes strengthening social media guidelines and due-diligence checks for prospective Labour candidates. The party will also set up an advisory board of Jewish members and developing educational material on anti-Semitism. This comes after the EHRC found the party had not provided adequate training for those responsible for handling complaints. The Jewish Labour Movement, one of the party's affiliate groups, said many of the plan's steps are ""those the JLM has been asking the party to implement for years"". In a statement on Twitter, the group said it was disappointed that it took the intervention of the EHRC to secure the publication of the plan, but added it was ""pleased that we now have a new leadership committed to act"". The statement concluded: ""While we welcome the reform of processes, by itself it is not enough. Recent events have shown a toxic culture persists in many parts of the party. Solving this is as essential as introducing an independent disciplinary process."" The campaign group Labour Against Anti-Semitism said the plan ""provides a good framework for tackling institutional anti-Jewish racism within the organisation."" But it called for the new process to be used in a ""full review"" of all historic reports of anti-Semitism since 2015, when Mr Corbyn became leader. ""Ultimately, the value of this plan will be measured by its effectiveness in driving all those who voice, promote and amplify anti-Semitic views out of the Labour Party. That objective is still, unfortunately, a long way from being met,"" it added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47822227,Paint-by-numbers inventor dies at 93,Dan Robbins' idea for DIY pictures inspired a generation of American hobbyists.,5 Apr 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Dan Robbins, the artist behind the paint-by-numbers craze that swept America, has died in Sylvania, Ohio, at the age of 93, his son told the AP news agency. He was working at a paint products firm in the 1940s when he invented the kits.  By the 1950s millions were being sold across the US every year. His inspiration for the idea came from Leonardo da Vinci, who used a similar method when teaching his apprentices how to paint. Mr Robbins first joined Palmer Paint, a company selling children's paint sets, after serving in World War Two.  In a post-war era of increasing leisure time, the company's owner, Max Klein, asked Mr Robbins to find a way to market the paint to adults.  ""I remembered hearing that Leonardo used numbered background patterns for his students and apprentices, and I decided to try something like that,"" Mr Robbins told an audience at the Chicago gallery Intuit in 2004.  He put together an abstract still life, a mix of ""Picasso, some Bracque and some Robbins"". Mr Klein told him he hated the painting but liked the idea of painting by numbers.  The kits, which contained canvasses with printed numbers corresponding to numbered paints, brushes and a palette, originally cost $2.50 (£2). The paintings ranged from landscapes to bullfighters, ballerinas to kittens. The company's most popular work was The Last Supper.  In 2013, Mr Robbins was asked if paint-by-numbers counted as art. ""No, it's only the experience of picking up a brush,"" he said. The aim, he added, was to recreate what a real artist goes through. Sales took off in the 1950s, reaching $20m (£15m) in 1955. But other brands soon caught on to the craze and the market became saturated. By 1957, sales were significantly down and Mr Klein was forced to sell up.  Mr Robbins stayed on when the company was bought out by General Mills, later moving to a Chicago cake decorations manufacturer. He retired in 1973 and started painting on a freelance basis.  A collection of paint-by-number artworks were exhibited at the prestigious Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in 2001."

Ryan Houghton - a candidate in the Aberdeen North constituency - confirmed his suspension on Monday after The National published the allegations. He has apologised for any hurt caused but insisted the comments were taken out of context. The Scottish Conservatives said the blog comments were ""unacceptable"". Mr Houghton remains a candidate but the Conservatives have withdrawn their support for his campaign while an investigation takes place. The National listed a number of posts, including one where he argued that while there was ""no credible evidence to suggest the Holocaust did not happen"" he went on to say: ""I do find some of the events fabricated."" Mr Houghton was also quoted as saying he did not see how homosexuality was good for the human race. In other alleged comments he said Islam's core teachings had the goal of ""world domination"" and that some Muslims had big families with the aim of creating ""Eurabia"". He released a statement on his Twitter feed, saying the comments were taken ""out of context"" and insisted he had never held anti-Semitic, racist or homophobic views.  Mr Houghton said: ""At the age of 20 on an online forum, I took part in a range of political discussions. These included terrorism, LGBT rights and anti-Semitism."" He said that in one of the threads he had discussed freedom of speech and he had discussed comments made by Holocaust denier David Irving. He said he made clear in subsequent posts that he was not defending the views and strongly opposed Holocaust denial. The candidate added: ""I apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish community in Aberdeen."" A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ""The comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result.  ""The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North.  ""The Scottish Conservatives deplore all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism."" It comes just a week Labour candidate Kate Ramsden quit in Aberdeenshire following a row over anti-Semitism.  She stood down in the Gordon constituency after the Jewish Chronicle highlighted a blog in which she compared Israel to an abused child who becomes an abusive adult. Another Scottish Labour candidate, Frances Hoole, was also been dropped over a social media post attacking her SNP opponent."

Darwin Martinez Torres, 25, assaulted Nabra Hassanen on 18 June 2017 in Sterling, about 30 miles (48km) west of Washington DC. Torres admitted all eight counts in a plea deal that will spare him the possibility of the death penalty. Investigators said they found no evidence it was a hate crime. Nabra and her friends were walking back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) mosque after a pre-dawn, fast-food meal when Torres pulled over in what police described as a road rage incident. The construction worker drove at the group, ramming his car into the curb.  He followed the group in his car as they ran into a parking lot before jumping out wielding a baseball bat. He attacked Nabra and pulled her into his car. Police said they found Torres hours later, circling the area with blood stains in his vehicle. He eventually confessed and led police to where he dumped her body in a pond in Loudoun County, Virginia. Nabra died of blunt force trauma, according to a medical examiner. ADAMS Center spokeswoman Hurunnessa Fariad said in a statement emailed to the BBC: ""We are confident that justice will be served for Nabra and her family.""  ""We pray that the sentencing of Mr Torres will bring peace and closure to the family and friends of Nabra Hassanen and allow for them to heal with loving memories of a smiling and gracious young lady."" Nabra's death sparked widespread concerns over the safety of Muslim Americans. Her parents told US media they were certain Nabra was targeted because of her faith, but investigators said the incident was not a hate crime.  Across the country, hundreds joined vigils in her honour. As Torres entered the packed court for a preliminary hearing last October, Nabra's mother threw a shoe at the defendant, and her father lunged at him, shouting: ""You killed my daughter!""   NBC News reported that Torres showed no reaction. He will now be sentenced to life in prison. His defence team had argued he is intellectually disabled with a low IQ. Originally from El Salvador, US media report he is suspected of being in the country illegally."

Hisham Muhammad, of Victoria Avenue, Bury, is accused of planning both a ""lone-wolf attack"" and a drone attack. The 26-year-old told the Old Bailey he had ""long held the suspicion"" the group was ""misrepresented or exaggerated in order to increase Islamophobia"". He denies engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism. His cousin Faisal Abu Ahmad, 25, denies failing to alert authorities of the alleged attack plan. In a defence statement read to the court, Mr Muhammad said he had watched extremist videos as research because he had ""long held the suspicion as a devout Muslim that much of the material about Islamic State is misrepresented or exaggerated in order to increase Islamophobia"". He said that was ""especially"" the case in countries like the UK ""where there is a desire to restrict Muslim immigration"". He told the jury ""a lot more research"" needed to be done into the group, adding: ""I don't believe it exists... I believe it was created by America to take away the rights of Muslims."" Mr Muhammad watched dozens of videos ""umpteen times"", which contained ""nothing nice"", prosecutor Anne Whyte QC said. She said of one that it was not a film of ""civilians harmlessly praising their god"", but of ""jihadis speaking of holy war"". Responding to a song he watched, which had the lyrics ""by the knife of horror we cut their necks"", Mr Muhammad said he did not support the violence, but ""liked the tune"" and listened to other music which featured violent lyrics. ""The point I am trying to make is that I listen to gangster rap, but I don't support it,"" he said. Jurors were also told he had searched terms including ""armed police Manchester"", ""suicide belt"", ""Isis"", ""machete"" and ""Manchester Victoria Station"" in May 2018, shortly before the first anniversary of the terror attack in the foyer of Manchester Arena, which stands adjacent to the station. He said he had had a job interview near the station and told Ms Whyte he could not remember if the interview was arranged after the searches. He added that the other search terms were down to his ""interest in weapons"". He had ""always had an interest in this stuff"", he said, before stating he had ""never heard of a suicide belt before, that's why I researched it"". The case continues.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-48187786,Viggo Mortensen rejects 'neo-fascist' Vox,The Spanish political party had tweeted an image of Mortensen playing Aragorn in Lord of the Rings,7 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Viggo Mortensen has denounced far right Spanish political party Vox after it tweeted a meme featuring the actor playing Aragorn in Lord of the Rings. The meme, shared by the nationalist party's official Twitter account in April, showed Aragorn lining up to face off against the assembled hordes of Vox's apparent enemies, including the media, Catalan separatists and a small ghost wearing the colours of the rainbow flag typically used to represent LGBT pride. ""Let the battle begin,"" the party tweeted. In a letter to the editor of Spanish newspaper El Pais, published on Tuesday, Mortensen said Vox's use of his image was ""absurd"". ""Not only is it absurd that I, the actor who embodied this character for [Lord of the Rings director] Peter Jackson, and a person interested in the rich variety of cultures and languages that exist in Spain and the world, is linked to an ultra-nationalist and neo-fascist political party,"" the actor wrote, ""it is even more ridiculous to use the character of Aragorn, a polyglot statesman who advocates knowledge and inclusion of the diverse races, customs and languages of Middle Earth, to legitimise an anti-immigrant, anti-feminist and Islamophobic political group. ""We must be attentive and proactive, like Aragorn in the Tolkien saga."" The letter's publication has drawn a significant reaction online. Both the name of the actor and his most famous character have been used widely on Twitter. Many of those to comment supported the actor's stance, while others pointed to Vox's electoral success as proof of its popular appeal. Vox won 24 seats in April's general election promising to ""make Spain great again"". The party opposes multiculturalism, unrestricted migration and what it calls ""radical feminism"". It rejects the far-right label, but its policies on immigration and Islam place it in line with other far-right and populist parties in Europe. The party's success marks the first time a far right party has won seats in the Spanish parliament in almost 40 years. In the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, based on J.R.R. Tolkien's books of the same name, Mortensen plays Aragorn, a ranger in love with an elf. One part of the fellowship which sets off to save Middle Earth from the evil Sauron, his companions include hobbits, a man, an elf, a dwarf and a wizard. Warner Bros, the studio which made the film series, confirmed in April that it had not given permission for its intellectual property to be used by Vox. ""We know that the Lord of the Rings has many fans,"" the studio tweeted in Spanish. ""But Warner Bros has not authorised the use of our intellectual property for any political campaign."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-59312289,‘Racist abuse made my son ask to be painted white’,"A family was forced to move from their home, schools and jobs by their neighbours' harassment.",7 Dec 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A family has described suffering years of racist abuse from neighbours that led to their son asking if he could be painted white. The couple and their two children were forced to move from their home, schools and jobs, even fearing their house would be burned down. Their neighbours were fined but the abuse continued, with racist graffiti left outside the family's home. They have now been moved by Sovereign Housing, which has not commented. The family, who live in the south of England, said they were still targeted even after a restraining order was taken out against their neighbours.  Because the family wanted to remain anonymous, the BBC worked with Southampton Solent University to create an animation voiced by actors, allowing them to discuss the abuse in their own words. The father said: ""The only time it's really affected me, I was in the bath, just lying in the bath and my son was there playing with the bubbles in the bath. ""And he said: 'Dad, why don't we get that paint that's left over from the house and we just paint me, you' and his older brother.  ""'We paint ourselves all white and then we don't have any problems.' ""And that's the time I can honestly say in my life that has actually drawn tears to my eyes.""   He said the abuse first started in September 2017, but it was only in the summer of 2020 they were finally moved by their housing association. The man said: ""[It was] totally out of the blue. We pulled up outside our house, started ushering the children inside. I heard someone shout 'weirdo'.  ""I looked and there was this chap, one of our neighbours, just standing opposite, hailing abuse at us. ""And then they came closer and closer. They teamed up and shouted more racial abuse."" The family reported the abuse to the police, and their neighbours were summoned to court. A woman admitted a racial public order offence and was issued with a £200 fine in November 2017, while a man admitted the same charge in January 2018. He was also fined £200.  A civil case was taken against them by Sovereign Housing, which owns housing across the south and west of England.  It was triggered after a member of its staff was shocked by threats of violence against the family.  But the family said the abuse continued - and that no further action was taken.  The father said: ""They shouted: 'We'll get you, we'll burn you up in your house.' ""I had a bucket, ready to fill up with water if need be, because I was worried that these people were going to set fire to us while we were in our house.""  The police force that dealt with the reports of the racial abuse said officers had spoken to an independent witness within 48 hours of the first report.   A spokesperson said: ""We know that hate crimes have a disproportionate impact on victims, their families and the wider community.  ""We want our residents to know that we take all reports of hate crime very seriously and that there is support available for them.""  Prosecutors said they asked the court for sentence uplifts for the abusers, and they received an increased fine to reflect the racist nature of their offending.  A CPS spokesperson said: ""We recognise that the victims in this case will have suffered greatly from being racially abused by their neighbours.  ""No one should have to live in fear of being a victim of crime, and it is clear they have had to endure incredibly offensive language directed at them. ""The defendants were prosecuted in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors for using racially offensive language.  ""The CPS secured guilty pleas from both defendants, which meant that the victims did not have to give evidence at a trial.""  Sovereign Housing has been approached for a comment.

Apsana Begum, 31, who represents the constituency of Poplar and Limehouse, was accused of three counts of making dishonest applications for council homes to Tower Hamlets Council.  She told Snaresbrook Crown Court her ""controlling"" husband was in charge of her finances and she was ""shocked"" to discover the paperwork was in her name. Ms Begum said the accusations had been ""driven by malicious intent"". The Labour MP collapsed and wept in the dock after the verdicts were returned. In a statement, Ms Begum said the trial ""caused me great distress and damage to my reputation"". She said: ""As a survivor of domestic abuse facing these vexatious charges, the last 18 months of false accusations, online sexist, racist and Islamophobic abuse, and threats to my safety have been exceedingly difficult."" Ms Begum said she would be ""consulting and considering"" on how to ensure ""something like this does not happen again to anyone else"".  The court heard Ms Begum, who won her seat in the 2019 general election, had applied to go on the council's social housing register on 22 July 2011. Her charges related to separate periods between 18 January and 21 May 2013, 21 May 2013 and 23 March 2014, and 28 October 2015 and 21 March 2016.  Ms Begum was alleged to have attempted to gain social housing in the first period by claiming she lived in an overcrowded three-bedroom house, making her a higher priority in the social housing queue. However, according to a social housing application made in 2009 by Ms Begum's aunt, the house had four bedrooms. Ms Begum maintained there had only ever been three bedrooms in the house and that she had never had her own bedroom while living there. She could not explain why her family members had said there were four bedrooms. She later moved into a different property with her then-partner Ehtashamul Haque without informing the council, where she lived for more than two years. Ms Begum claims Mr Haque was ""controlling and coercive"" and took over her finances. During this period, bids for housing were made in Ms Begum's name. She denied making the bids. ""I'm shocked to see these records,"" she told the court. Jurors found Ms Begum not guilty of all charges after the judge gave a majority direction."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-47613578,More schools drop LGBT rights classes,"The move comes as a campaigner says some members of Birmingham's Muslim community feel ""victimised"".",19 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Four more schools in Birmingham have stopped teaching about LGBT rights following complaints by parents.  Leigh Trust said it was suspending the No Outsiders programme until an agreement with parents was reached. Earlier this month the city's Parkfield Community School suspended the lessons after protests were held.  Campaigner Amir Ahmed said some Muslims felt ""victimised"" but an LGBT group leader said No Outsiders helped pupils understand it is OK to be different. In a letter seen by the BBC, Leigh Trust said it was halting the lessons until after Ramadan, which finishes in June. The schools involved are Leigh Primary School, Alston Primary School, Marlborough Junior and Infants School and Wyndcliff Primary School.  Leigh Trust - which is yet to comment publicly - said it wanted to discuss the programme with parents to find ""a positive way"" of teaching about the Equalities Act. Some parents at Parkfield, and the other four schools, claim the classes are inappropriate for young children and the schools' LGBT message contradicts Islam. The No Outsiders project was created and piloted at Parkfield in 2014 by assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat, who was made an MBE for services to equality and diversity in education in 2017. Ofsted has deemed the lessons as ""age-appropriate"". Mr Ahmed, one of the leaders of the Parkfield protests, said he had seen a presentation about the programme that was to be shown to the government as part of the school's Prevent strategy - which is aimed at reducing radicalisation. ""I think that's outrageous,"" he said. ""It's quite disgusting that the school has presented our children as potential radicals."" A spokesperson for Parkfield Community School said: ""The powerpoint was written four years ago in line with Prevent duty at that time.  ""No Outsiders is all about tolerance, accepting difference and respect, which are all key aspects of community cohesion and our fundamental British values."" Mr Ahmed said his community was ""respectful and tolerant"" of British values but now felt victimised. He claimed parents who had protested were ""effectively seen as homophobes in the wider community"". ""Fundamentally the issue we have with No Outsiders is that it is changing our children's moral position on family values on sexuality and we are a traditional community. ""Morally we do not accept homosexuality as a valid sexual relationship to have. It's not about being homophobic... that's like saying, if you don't believe in Islam, you're Islamophobic."" But Khakan Qureshi, a gay Muslim activist who runs Birmingham South Asian LGBT and was invited to visit Parkfield School last week, said he supported the need for the lessons. ""Myself and many others knew from a young age that we were different and we wish we had this sort of education,"" he said. He feels the Muslim community as a whole is not homophobic, but believes a minority within the protesters are ""agitating"". ""The attitudes of the protesters towards the No Outsiders programme is completely homophobic,"" he said. ""No matter how they package it, it still comes across as homophobic."" He said given the existing legislation to stop discrimination, ""I don't understand why certain communities here in the UK are not adhering to those laws"".

Heinz-Christian Strache posted a caricature of a banker with a hooked nose, wearing Star of David cufflinks. Austrian Jewish leader Oskar Deutsch likened it to images used by the Nazis in the 1930s. Mr Strache, who leads the Freedom Party, has denied he was being anti-Semitic. The cartoon was posted on Saturday, accompanied by a comment from Mr Strache decrying ""EU banking speculators"" for taking tax money from Austrians. On Sunday Mr Strache posted a second version, labelled in English. The Star of David emblems had been removed from the banker's cufflinks and the shape of his nose had also been changed. Both images show another figure labelled ""The Government"" pouring a drink for the banker, while a third, poorly clothed and thin figure labelled ""The People"", sits opposite the banker with a bone on his plate. Jewish leader Oskar Deutsch (L) likened the cartoon to Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda ""It is not a coincidence that a caricature of Jews, similar to the ones in 'Der Stuermer' in the 1930s and 1940s, appeared on the Facebook page of Freedom Party leader Mr Strache,"" Mr Deutsch said, referring to a newspaper published by the Nazis. Austrian politicians from both centre-left and conservative parties have condemned the cartoon. The conservative People's Party called on the Freedom Party (FPO) to address ""the incendiary and discriminating tones within the party itself"". A lawyer in Vienna has also said he will sue the FPO for holocaust denial, which is illegal in Austria. Mr Strache and the FPO have frequently faced accusations of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. On Sunday Mr Strache responded to the backlash with a further comment on Facebook saying he did not tolerate anti-Semitism and insisted that he was highlighting his scorn for ""the caste of greedy bankers"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60229869,Patel 'sickened' by Charing Cross police behaviour,The home secretary condemns culture of misogyny and discrimination at Met Police uncovered in a report.,2 Feb 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Home Secretary Priti Patel has said she was ""appalled and sickened"" by the behaviour of Metropolitan Police officers revealed in a report. The officers mainly based at Charing Cross, in London, were found to have joked about rape, killing black children and beating their wives. The Met said it was ""deeply sorry"", after the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) published its findings. But Ms Patel said the force had ""problems"" with its culture. She told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that examples of ""appalling conduct"" by serving officers could not be dismissed as ""one-off"" incidents. Asked if the Met was institutionally misogynist, she said it had ""cultural and attitudinal"" issues, suggesting a ""failure of leadership in some quarters"". But she said she had confidence in Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick to make the changes that were required. Pressed about Ms Dick's future, Ms Patel said she was ""very clear and upfront with the commissioner about the problems… I'm very challenging with the commissioner and I will continue to be so."" Ms Patel did not rule out launching a major inquiry into policing, like the 1999 Macpherson report into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, which labelled the Met ""institutionally racist"". The home secretary said: ""There are no excuses for the appalling behaviour and what we have seen in that IOPC report and it is quite clear there are cultural problems and issues in policing."" But, she added she wanted to ""find out what on earth is going on"" through existing, smaller scale inquiries launched after the murder of Sarah Everard by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, before deciding whether to go further. One probe, led by Dame Elish Angiolini QC, will look at previous criminal and misconduct allegations against Couzens, and whether any red flags were missed when he was vetted. A separate review, led by Baroness Louise Casey, is looking at the culture and standards within the Met Police, and its vetting, recruitment and training procedures. The IOPC launched its investigation in 2018 after an officer allegedly had sex with a vulnerable woman in a room inside a London police station - although this allegation was never proven. In its report, published on Tuesday, the police watchdog identified ""bullying and aggressive behaviour; 'banter' used to excuse oppressive and offensive behaviours; discrimination; toxic masculinity, misogyny and sexual harassment"". ""We believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few 'bad apples',"" the IOPC said in a statement. Evidence uncovered included: Of the 14 officers investigated, two were dismissed for gross misconduct and put on the barred list, preventing future employment with the police. Another two resigned and several others faced disciplinary action, the IOPC said. Nine are still serving with the force, while another is working as a contractor in a staff role. In Parliament on Wednesday, MPs expressed disgust at the findings of the IOPC report, which Home Office Minister Kit Malthouse said described ""abhorrent behaviour"" that ""shamed"" the Met Police. Conservative MP Matthew Offord, who called for the urgent question, criticised the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.  ""We need leadership on keeping London safe and that is not happening,"" Mr Offord said. Mr Khan has said he was ""utterly disgusted"" by the findings, adding: ""Anyone found to be responsible for sexism, racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, bullying or harassment does not deserve to wear the Met uniform and must be rooted out."" In a statement, the Met said: ""We are deeply sorry to Londoners and everyone they have failed with their appalling conduct and acknowledge how this will damage the trust and confidence of many in the Met. ""Since this reprehensible behaviour was uncovered in 2017 we have taken a series of measures to hold those responsible to account and stamp out unacceptable behaviour."""

Protests were held outside Batley Grammar School, where the staff member was suspended after complaints. Baroness Kishwer Falkner said making a teacher fear for their safety was ""simply unacceptable"".  The Equality and Human Rights Commission chair said the school ""ought to be trusted"" to take action. ""A teacher's identity being shared, making them fear for their safety, is simply unacceptable and could result in enforcement action from the police,"" she said. Gary Kibble, head teacher of the West Yorkshire school, said the teacher had ""given their most sincere apologies"" for the caricature being shown and said an investigation had begun. Demonstrators, who first gathered outside the grounds on Thursday morning, staged a second protest on Friday but had moved on by mid-afternoon. Some had demanded the teacher's sacking and accused staff of failing to take the issue seriously. Baroness Falkner said children's education ""should not be disrupted by protests in what has already been a difficult year"". ""Schools are places where children learn about ideas, values, difference and respect.  ""This sometimes involves exposing them to contentious issues and different views and ideas."" ""For schools to meet their legal duty to foster good relations between people from different groups, this should be done in a balanced, respectful and sensitive way."" Speaking on Friday morning, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick called for the ""deeply unsettling"" scenes outside the school to ""come to an end"". He defended the right of teachers to ""appropriately"" show images of the Prophet Muhammed and said ""no-one should be feeling intimidated or threatened as they go into school"". A petition calling for the teacher to be reinstated has received more than 10,000 signatures. Dr Shazad Amin, deputy chair of MEND, which helps Muslims engage with British media and politics, said its Islamophobia Response Unit had been helping several parents liaise with the school. He said he saw ""no problem"" with blasphemy being discussed at the school but said the particular image shown to pupils was ""deeply offensive"" and ""furthered stereotypes and anti-Islamic tropes"". As a result, he said, people in the local community had ""a right to feel hurt and a right to feel angry"" but called for them to allow the matter to be properly investigated. He said parents were ""fairly positive"" about the action taken so far by the school. Former Conservative Party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the debate had been hijacked by ""extremists on both sides"" to fuel a ""culture war"" at the expense of ""kids and their learning"".   Labour MP for Batley and Spen, Tracey Brabin, condemned those who ""seek to fan the flames of this incident"", and said she welcomed the school's apology. West Yorkshire Police said no arrests had been made and officers remained at the school.  Parts of the Koran are taken to mean that neither Allah nor Muhammad can be captured in an image by human hand and any attempt to do so is seen as an insult. Kirklees Council said Batley Grammar is an academy school so the authority only has a ""very limited role"" in its running, but it praised staff for taking ""swift action"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54678826,French anger over Turkey's 'rude' Macron comments,"France recalls its ambassador after President Erdogan suggests French leader needs ""mental check"".",25 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"France has recalled its ambassador to Turkey for consultations after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insulted his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. He said Mr Macron needed a mental health check for pledging to defend secular values and fight radical Islam. Mr Macron has spoken out forcefully on these issues after a French teacher was murdered for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class. France ""will not give up our cartoons"", he said earlier this week. Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslims because Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God). But state secularism - or laïcité - is central to France's national identity. Curbing freedom of expression to protect the feelings of one particular community, the state says, undermines the country's unity. Responding to Mr Macron's campaign to defend such values - which began before the teacher was murdered - Mr Erdogan asked in a speech: ""What's the problem of the individual called Macron with Islam and with the Muslims?""  He added: ""Macron needs treatment on a mental level. ""What else can be said to a head of state who does not understand freedom of belief and who behaves in this way to millions of people living in his country who are members of a different faith?"" In the wake of the remarks, a French presidential official told AFP news agency that France's ambassador to Turkey was being recalled for consultations, and would be meeting Mr Macron. ""President Erdogan's comments are unacceptable. Excess and rudeness are not a method. We demand that Erdogan change the course of his policy because it is dangerous in every respect,"" the official was quoted as saying. Erodgan is a pious Muslim who has sought to move Islam into Turkey's mainstream politics since his Islamist-rooted AK Party came to power in 2002.  The diplomatic spat is latest issue to strain relations between France and Turkey, who are allies under Nato but disagree on a range of geo-political issues, including the civil wars in Syria and Libya, and the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over disputed Nagorno-Karabakh. Seven people, including two students, have been charged over the beheading of French teacher Samuel Paty on 16 October near Paris. His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack, which took place near Mr Paty's school. In 2015, 12 people were killed in an attack on the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The publication was targeted by extremists for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Earlier this month, Mr Macron described Islam as a religion ""in crisis,"" and announced plans for tougher laws to tackle what he called ""Islamist separatism"" in France. He said a minority of France's estimated six million Muslims were in danger of forming a ""counter-society"". Some in Western Europe's largest Muslim community have accused Mr Macron of trying to repress their religion and say his campaign risks legitimising Islamophobia."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48723274,The Left Behind: TV drama unmasks the far right,The increase in hate crimes in the UK is the focus of a new film.,10 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The makers of a BBC docudrama about the rise of far-right movements in the UK believe it's largely driven by a growing sense of ""hopelessness"" in some sections of society. The Left Behind, produced by the Bafta-winning team behind Killed By My Debt, tells the story of a young Welsh man with no job security, housing or hope, who is drawn into committing an  Islamophobic hate crime. The docudrama draws on the research of Professor Hilary Pilkington, who spent time with the English Defence League (EDL) for her book Loud and Proud. It notes that in 2018 there was a 36% increase in the number of far-right extremists referred to the UK government's counter-terrorism programme, Prevent. It also details that there were 94,098 hate crimes in England and Wales that year - an increase of 123% in five years. Director Joseph Bullman believes lead character, Gethin - portrayed by Sion Daniel Young - is a victim of a broken system and representative of some British people living insecure lives. ""People live in structural conditions where these kinds of opinions are being bred,"" says the director, at a Q&A following the film's London premiere. ""Anyone who has grown up in a working class community will know that the vast overwhelming majority of  people love their families and just want to get on and make decent lives for their kids, but there are a minority who are being attracted to these perspectives because people are genuinely hopeless and I think that hopelessness is the thing that is driving this."" He adds: ""Most of those people, when you read the studies, live ultra-insecure lives in ultra-low wage jobs and they can't have a narrative for their lives. They feel humiliated, excluded and left behind and they've reached very wrong conclusions about migrants. We've just stopped listening to them - and it hasn't worked."" Bullman claims the map of the concentration of support for such movements closely mirrors a map of ""Britain's post-industrial towns and cities"".  It is, he adds, poor working class communities with ""real grievances"" about employment, housing and social care, that are increasingly turning to extremism. ""There aren't that many far-right groups in Hampstead and Richmond-upon-Thames,"" he says. Responding to the film-maker's comments, a government spokesperson tells the BBC the reasons for people becoming ""radicalised"" are more complex than that, and in running the Prevent programme they are doing what they can to stop it. ""Government and academic research has consistently indicated that there is no single socio-demographic profile of a terrorist in the UK,"" they say, ""and no single pathway leading to involvement in terrorism."" The strategy, the spokesperson adds, is about ""safeguarding vulnerable people from all walks of life who are at risk of radicalisation,"" and constitutes ""a comprehensive approach to tackling all forms of extremism, including the far right"". ""We will not tolerate any group or individual that spreads hate by demonising those of other faiths or ethnicities or stokes fear within our communities."" Bullman approached Welsh playwright Alan Harris (Sugar Baby, How My Light is Spent), to come up with the script for The Left Behind. The story is based loosely around the Ely estate in Cardiff and Bullman says they tried to cast actors who ""felt authentic"" and had ""some sense of the communities we were talking about"".  This led Young, who lived locally, to turn down another guaranteed film part and to write Bullman a letter asking to be considered for the lead role. ""You don't get that many stories of this weight and magnitude set in a world that I know,"" says Young, whose character's dad is also homeless and living on the streets. Writer Harris says for him the most memorable scene involves Gethin and his increasingly radical friends, with a group of desperate constituents (played by supporting artists) ""ripping shreds"" off their local councillor. In researching the film, Harris stumbled upon the chilling phrase and refrain ""don't become a ghost,"" which is used as a recurring motif. ""There are a lot of people in this country who feel as though they really don't matter,"" he explains, ""as if they are see-through. ""They are as effective as ghosts and that's a proper worry for people, you become kind of nothing really."" The factual drama begins with Gethin's gang attacking a halal butchers, while wearing pig masks, and then works backwards to attempt to understand their motives. Immigration has been a key talking point in British politics in recent history and will continue to be as Brexit plays out. Executive producer Aysha Rafaele stresses the importance of bringing these difficult images to the screen. ""The big divide in the country at the moment is really between what the effects of globalisation are,"" she says. ""Editorially we all know what we're trying to do with a film like this, where you are going to be accused of giving people a platform. Wouldn't it be better to just bury it? As a British Pakistan Muslim the answer is no, we should not be burying it. It is our responsibility as film-makers to allow voices you don't ordinarily hear."" The best thing policy makers can do, Rafaele says, is listen to the grievances of local communities in the UK, as that is ""the only way British Muslims are going to become safe"". ""Immigration and anti-immigrant sentiment actually embodies so many other things - it's about the boarded-up high street, it's about the fact industry in the area has shut down, it's about the fact the jobs people are doing are precarious. ""Austerity is a political choice not an inevitably, and the impact of globalisation is also a choice.""

The meme, shared by the nationalist party's official Twitter account in April, showed Aragorn lining up to face off against the assembled hordes of Vox's apparent enemies, including the media, Catalan separatists and a small ghost wearing the colours of the rainbow flag typically used to represent LGBT pride. ""Let the battle begin,"" the party tweeted. In a letter to the editor of Spanish newspaper El Pais, published on Tuesday, Mortensen said Vox's use of his image was ""absurd"". ""Not only is it absurd that I, the actor who embodied this character for [Lord of the Rings director] Peter Jackson, and a person interested in the rich variety of cultures and languages that exist in Spain and the world, is linked to an ultra-nationalist and neo-fascist political party,"" the actor wrote, ""it is even more ridiculous to use the character of Aragorn, a polyglot statesman who advocates knowledge and inclusion of the diverse races, customs and languages of Middle Earth, to legitimise an anti-immigrant, anti-feminist and Islamophobic political group. ""We must be attentive and proactive, like Aragorn in the Tolkien saga."" The letter's publication has drawn a significant reaction online. Both the name of the actor and his most famous character have been used widely on Twitter. Many of those to comment supported the actor's stance, while others pointed to Vox's electoral success as proof of its popular appeal. Vox won 24 seats in April's general election promising to ""make Spain great again"". The party opposes multiculturalism, unrestricted migration and what it calls ""radical feminism"". It rejects the far-right label, but its policies on immigration and Islam place it in line with other far-right and populist parties in Europe. The party's success marks the first time a far right party has won seats in the Spanish parliament in almost 40 years. In the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, based on J.R.R. Tolkien's books of the same name, Mortensen plays Aragorn, a ranger in love with an elf. One part of the fellowship which sets off to save Middle Earth from the evil Sauron, his companions include hobbits, a man, an elf, a dwarf and a wizard. Warner Bros, the studio which made the film series, confirmed in April that it had not given permission for its intellectual property to be used by Vox.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53418762,'Our neighbours made us Covid-19 pariahs',"As the virus spreads across India, so do fear and stigma attached to the disease.",20 Jul 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Last week, a bedridden retiree living with his wife in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) began feeling feverish with a bit of tightness in his chest - tell-tale signs of Covid-19. Satya Deo Prasad, 68, had possibly picked up the infection from his visits to a local hospital to get dialysis for his failing kidneys.  His daughter, based some 1,900km (1,180 miles) away in the western city of Pune, called a Kolkata helpline for an ambulance to pick her father up and take him to the hospital. After three hours, an ambulance arrived. It carried no attendant and the driver parked it some distance away from Mr Deo's house and refused to go any further. Over the telephone, Alka Prasad begged the driver to pick her father up from the house, telling him that her 62-year-old mother was in no state to bring him to the vehicle. But to no avail. ""I am not going to touch a Covid 'body',"" the driver, who was in protective gear, said flatly. ""He will have to come out and walk into the ambulance."" The panic-stricken daughter called the helpline again, which sent another ambulance with volunteers and picked up Mr Deo later that evening.  ""It took a full day to take him to hospital. Stigma attached to the disease was the primary reason,"" Ms Prasad told me. With more than one million reported infections, India has the world's third-largest case load of Covid-19. As the virus spreads, so do fear and stigma, inflicting the rich and the poor, and pervading cities and villages.   ""Fear and stigma have devoured us,"" says M Mitra, a Kolkata-based homemaker whose father had tested positive for the disease.  At the receiving end of the stigma are people who have been infected and recovered from the disease, health workers and doctors. The United Nations says ""fears, rumours and stigma"" are key challenges accompanying Covid-19 globally. In India, social stigma around the disease has led to people being labelled and discriminated against. It has forced people to hide illness, avoid tests and delay hospitalisation, often with fatal consequences. Stigma attached to quarantine has meant that people returning from isolation are often treated as outcasts. In April an incident involving an Indian Islamic organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, caused massive outrage and led to reports of Islamophobia across the country. Such social pressure can have catastrophic consequences. Hours after the death of her husband from Covid-19 in early July, a homemaker in Siliguri in West Bengal picked up her two children, hailed an auto-rickshaw and got off at near the nearest railway track. There, they tried to kill themselves by throwing themselves in front of a moving train, before being rescued by locals. In many parts of their town, authorities had marked houses with Covid-19 patients by putting up bamboo barricades in front. In other parts, they put up signs like ""Danger, Covid ahead"", pointing to houses with patients. ""The virus is like a death sentence for many. They believe if the disease doesn't kill you, the stigma will,"" says Abhijit Chowdhury, a physician who runs Covid Care Network, comprising a group of volunteers and a helpline to tackle stigma. Quarantine stickers outside homes in cities and towns prominently display the name of resident patients. ""Nowhere in the world are such things done. We need a movement against stigmatisation,"" Dr Ambarish Satwik, a Delhi-based surgeon says. A doctor working in a Covid-19 ward in a Mumbai hospital told me bodies were piling up because relatives were refusing to collect them due to fear of contracting the infection. At crematoriums in Delhi, priests have complained that some relatives do not tell them that the deceased had died of Covid-19.  Twenty-six-year-old Amrita Panda learnt about Covid-related social exclusion the hard way after four members of her family were infected in May. Most of them had mild symptoms and were quarantined at home in Howrah, a suburb of Kolkata.  Ms Panda's 82-year-old grandfather, however, developed breathing problems, and had to be taken to a hospital, where he recovered after treatment. ""There were raging rumours in my neighbourhood that my father and grandfather had died of the disease. Neighbours stopped approaching us. We had to let go of our domestic maid because her other employers threatened to sack her for working at our place,"" she told me. Even after the family recovered and completed their quarantine time, neighbours have continued to avoid them. A local bank refused to let Ms Panda's father enter its premises. ""It feels that contracting the disease is a crime. Even when we go out for our chores sometimes, people shout at us and scream, look the Covid people are out and about!"" says Ms Panda. In her upscale high-rise complex in Kolkata, government official Sangeeta Banerjee Barua also faced discrimination after she tested positive after weeks of working at a quarantine centre.  ""I had mild symptoms and recovered at home. But our neighbours who are doctors and engineers and teachers asked us to shut our windows, not come out in the balcony. Neighbours tell us we are high-risk even after recovery. They have made us pariahs,"" she said. In June, Dr Jagadish Hiremath tried to rent an apartment near his 100-bed hospital in the southern city of Bangalore so he could live away from his family while he treated Covid patients. ""I looked at middle class apartments, luxury apartments. No landlord was willing to rent it to me because I was a doctor. They said let the pandemic end first,"" he told me.  The local grocery and milk shop refused to sell to his hospital workers. When an operating room technician boarded a bus to come to work, he was asked to get off, saying the bus didn't allow hospital workers. ""It's basically a cultural problem. The messaging about the disease has been poor. If this continues, we will have nobody left to work in the hospitals,"" Dr Hiremath said. Many believe that screechy, over-the-top coverage of the disease by news networks and feeble communication by the government is responsible for this. The networks are full of ""doomsday stories"" of how the disease kills and graphic visuals of the dead, a survivor complained.  K Sujatha Rao, a former health secretary, believes the stigma is due to fear and lack of trust in the public health system. ""There is no confidence in the government or health system to help people if they get the infection. The fear is of not being able to get treatment due to unaffordability. It is a fear born of an acute sense of helplessness,"" she told me. There could be cultural reasons as well. Esi Thompson, who has studied stigma in the context of Ebola, says local leaders, survivors, and community members had to be engaged as volunteers and advocates to fight stigma.  ""It is of uttermost importance to be sensitive to national, social and cultural norms in communicating any health risk. It is also important to consider how information about new health risks are communicated and interpreted in the light of people's lived realities,"" Dr Thompson, a professor of health risk and communication at Indiana University Bloomington, told me. It is not clear whether any of this is being done effectively in India as yet. ""My fear is that this stigmatisation of Covid-19 will survive the vaccine and the cure,"" says Pradeep Krishnatray, a former director of research and strategic planning, Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs. ""Remember, we still continue to stigmatise leprosy in India""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-48339080,Head teacher threatened over LGBT lessons,"Police are investigating the messages while an MP calls for a protest exclusion zone ""to protect children"".",20 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A head teacher at a primary school giving lessons on LGBT equality has received threatening emails and phone calls. Police are investigating messages sent to Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson at Anderton Park Primary School in Birmingham. There have been seven weeks of protests outside the site from which ""hundreds"" of pupils were kept away on Monday. Birmingham MP Jess Phillips has called for an exclusion zone at the school to limit where people can demonstrate. Ms Hewitt-Clarkson has branded the protests aggressive. The city council is looking into Ms Phillips' request, with the authority's leader saying some outside the school are ""peddling hatred"". The complaints at Anderton Park, mainly from Muslim protesters, focus on lessons for which pupils have been given books featuring cross-dressing children and gay families. The protests' leader says that amounts to ""social engineering"".   Similar teaching has been opposed in letters sent predominantly by conservative Muslims to schools across England, BBC Newsnight reported last week. Ms Hewitt-Clarkson said of the protests: ""There's a whole variety of emotions: embarrassment for lots of our community and our parents who think this is just awful what's happening; frustration that it's going on so long; frustration that great British laws like 'you can protest peacefully' actually are causing us a problem. ""It's interesting what a normal person on the street would think peaceful means and what actually is peaceful outside here."" She described the scene in the Sparkhill area of the city as ""very loud, it's very aggressive, it's tiresome"". Ms Hewitt-Clarkson said she was ""meeting lots of parents"", with a series of 12 meetings set up between now and the end of June. She also denied a claim from some parents that she is Islamophobic, saying she believed in ""equality for everybody"". In England, relationships education will be compulsory for all primary pupils from September 2020.  Shakeel Afsar is the leader of the Anderton Park protests, although he has no children at the school. He said the school had pulled ""the shutters down"" on parental engagement and was promoting LGBT lifestyles to children. He said 600 pupils were kept from school on Monday ""to make it crystal clear we will not have our children indoctrinated or participating in any social engineering programmes which undermine our family values by promoting child sexualisation"". Anderton Park said more than half of the 700-strong student body had attended school. The council has been contacted to confirm attendance figures. Overnight, counter-protesters adorned the site with heart-shaped messages featuring the words ""love is the answer"".  West Midlands Police, which is investigating the threats against Ms Hewitt-Clarkson, said officers were also looking into ""disorder"" outside the school in which eggs were thrown at the counter-protesters. The force said it was investigating three reports of assault and two of criminal damage. Outside the school earlier, Mr Afsar was involved in a stand-up disagreement with Ms Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley. She said protesters could not ""pick and choose"" which equality they could and could not have. Saying the worst thing about the protests was damage ""to the reputation of a peaceful"" community, she called for an exclusion area ""to protect the 700 children in this school"". Ian Ward, leader of Birmingham City Council, said he had asked authority officers to see whether they could use a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) to counter the protests. He said: ""If a PSPO is not appropriate, then we will look at alternative options, because the children and staff at Anderton Park have a right to attend school without this daily disruption. ""It's one thing for parents to ask questions about elements of a school curriculum, it's quite another for others to pounce on the situation as an excuse to peddle hatred and misinformation."" A council spokesperson said PSPO proposals would normally go out to public consultation and, based on response, a decision made by the authority and ""police leads""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43893791,The Labour anti-Semitism row explained,Allegations of anti-Semitism continue to dog the Labour Party. Here's an overview of the row so far.,27 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Jeremy Corbyn has come under fire for not saying he is sorry for anti-Semitism in the Labour Party in a BBC interview. It's something that's been going on for a while now and Mr Corbyn has apologised to Jewish people in the past. But when asked, four times, for an apology this week, Mr Corbyn didn't offer one. He described racism as ""a total poison"" in our society and said he wanted to work with all communities to eliminate it. Mr Corbyn has said this before, and in early November 2019 spoke about suspending members of the Labour party for anti-Semitic activity. To understand the issue, you first have to know two very important definitions. Zionism is a political movement which supports the right of Jewish people to their own homeland in the land of their ancestors - modern-day Israel. There are variations of Zionism - for example, some Zionists believe Israel has a right to some areas of land beyond its territory. Other Zionists disagree. The vast majority of Jewish people are Zionists, though a small minority oppose Zionism, for either religious or political reasons. Non-Jewish people can be Zionists as well. Anti-Zionism can be generally defined as opposition to the existence of the State of Israel. Anti-Semitism, on the other hand, means prejudice against Jewish people and has existed for centuries. The State of Israel was declared in 1948. Since then, in some cases when people have strongly criticised Israel it has been difficult to know whether or not the criticism is motivated by anti-Semitism. This has led to accusations that anti-Zionism - rejection of the Jewish state - is merely a modern form of anti-Semitism. Those who reject this comparison say this argument is used as a tool by Israel's supporters to silence reasonable criticism of Israel by portraying that criticism as racist. Anti-Semitism is not just a problem in the left wing of British politics. In fact, historically, most Jewish people voted for the Labour Party, when it was supportive of the State of Israel. But the party's stance on Israel began to change after the 1967 Middle East war - when Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip came under Israeli occupation. Traditionally the left wing has spoken up for the rights of oppressed minorities in the UK and around the world - and the Labour Party now aligns itself with the Palestinian cause. Palestinians want their own state and face some severe restrictions from Israel. Israel says that, in the absence of any peace settlement, these measures are to protect it from Palestinian violence. By the 1980s, people with strong views on Israel became more prominent within Labour. This contributed to the party developing an association with anti-Zionism, something which had previously been limited to the far-left. This story dates back to 2016, when Mr Corbyn announced an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the Labour Party. The inquiry found that there is an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Speaking to the BBC in April 2018, the chairwoman of the inquiry accepted that her recommendations hadn't fully been implemented by the party.  In July 2018, John Woodcock MP resigned from the Labour Party and a month later, Frank Field MP quit the party's group in Parliament. They both gave anti-Semitism within the party as among their reasons for quitting - although it wasn't the only reason. Then in February 2019, the MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, was the centre of a row within the party when her local branch tried to deselect her. She has been critical of the party's handling of anti-Semitism and has also been the target of abuse online. She was one of seven MPs to quit Labour at that time - although not all of them left due to concerns over anti-Semitism.   Then in May 2019, the Equality and Human Rights Commission launched a formal investigation into the Labour Party over allegations of anti-Semitism. Labour said it would co-operate fully with the watchdog. A party spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle anti-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". The charge against the Labour leader isn't usually that he's anti-Semitic himself - but that he has been too slow to take action to stamp it out. He has insisted time and time again there is no place for anti-Semitism in Labour. The issue flared up again in March 2018, when Luciana Berger shared screenshots which showed a Facebook post from 2012. American graffiti artist Mear One had posted a picture of his street art, which was alleged to have been anti-Semitic and was eventually removed. The allegation was that it promoted a conspiracy of powerful Jewish people controlling and oppressing others. The six men all have exaggerated physical features often used to ridicule and stereotype Jewish people. It emerged that Jeremy Corbyn had commented under the Facebook post, questioning the removal of the wall painting. He has since expressed ""sincere regret"" for not looking more closely at the picture before he commented on it. Labour's former Deputy Leader Tom Watson called it ""a horrible anti-Semitic mural that was rightly taken down"". The artist Mear One denies it was an anti-Semitic piece of work, saying it was about ""class and privilege"". Protests were held at the time against anti-Semitism and the Labour leader met Jewish leaders to address the issue. The leaders claimed Mr Corbyn did not agree to any of the concrete actions they asked for, but he said he was ""committed to rooting out anti-Semitism"". Ever since he became Labour leader in 2015, Jeremy Corbyn has had to oversee a divided party. Some of his allies say that the anti-Semitism row is a plot to undermine his leadership. The seven MPs who quit in 2019 were all well-known critics of Corbyn and have said bullying within the party as well as its handling of Brexit were reasons they split. Some people in the party deny the claim that he has not taken action to solve the problem.  They say that he has now speeded up the complaints system and is doing everything possible to rid the party of the problem. In the 10 months up to January 2019, 96 members were immediately suspended from the party for their conduct and 12 were expelled.  Labour party figures also point to the fact that many complaints have been made about the Tories' attitude to Islamophobia. There are  calls from the Muslim Council to hold a full investigation into what is going on in the Conservative Party, just as the EHRC is undertaking a formal inquiry into the Labour Party.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-40382557,'UKIP should not become anti-Islam',Nathan Gill says trying to ban full face veils - as UKIP pledged - is not a matter for government.,26 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"UKIP's main focus should not become anti-Islam, the party's MEP in Wales has said. Nathan Gill has criticised his party's general election campaign pledge to ban full face veils worn by Muslim women. He said the move to announce it early in the campaign meant the party could not talk about anything else. Mr Gill argued government should not dictate what ""you can and can't wear"" and said he did not want to associate himself with the campaign. UKIP said the veil was an ""instrument of oppression"", adding it sought to ""lift the veil"" on ""that oppression"" and it had been banned in other countries. ""If we are to bring communities together, we must begin by removing the implements of oppression and division,"" a party spokesman said. UKIP saw its UK-wide vote share fall by 10.8% to 1.8% at the 2017 general election. It won no seats and leader Paul Nuttall resigned the day after. At the launch of the party's general election manifesto, which took place in the days after the Manchester terror attack, former leader Mr Nuttall said radical Islam was a ""cancer that needs to be cut out"". Mr Gill told BBC Wales: ""I don't want our party's raison d'etre to become anti-Islam. ""Ultimately we all live on a very small island. We've all got to get on. ""It's pointless us talking about very emotive words like cancers and things like that, when we should be talking about harmonisation and us getting on together as a people. ""The amount of people who have a problem with Islam, or Muslim immigration or things like that, must be 1% of the population."" Criticising the fact that UKIP's campaign was ""kicked off"" by the announcement of a face veil ban, Mr Gill said: ""It meant that we couldn't talk about anything else because that was always going to be brought up by the media and by the opposition. ""We should have kicked the campaign off with a positive vision of a post-Brexit Britain."" Mr Gill, who sits as an independent AM in the assembly and led UKIP Wales during the EU referendum campaign, said: ""I don't want government dictating to us, to the level of what you can and can't wear, and to the level of how you worship, or all these different things. ""I didn't do anything during the general election campaign - I didn't really want to be associated with it."" Mr Gill also said a claim by Neil Hamilton, assembly UKIP group leader, that there was no problem with Islamophobia in Britain was ""nonsense"". ""Some people just enjoy media attention. I never sought that,"" he said. ""There's no point making silly claims and there's no point saying things that you don't really fully understand or that you've not fully researched. ""I just feel that we don't have to tout ourselves in front of the media saying outrageous things."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44964740,Arctics and Jorja Smith on Mercury list,The Arctic Monkeys receive their fourth nomination as the Mercury Prize reveals its shortlist.,26 Jul 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Arctic Monkeys, arguably Britain's biggest rock band, are among the 12 nominees for the 2018 Mercury Prize. Their space lounge concept album, Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino, earns the band a fourth nomination for the award, established in 1992 as a high-minded alternative to the Brits. But the quartet face stiff competition from the likes of Jorja Smith, Lily Allen and Florence + The Machine. Other nominees include Wolf Alice, Noel Gallagher and jazz act Sons of Kemet. Last year's winner, Sampha, also features on the soulful Everything Is Recorded, a collaborative album put together by the head of XL Records, Richard Russell - aka ""the man who signed Adele"". The Arctics, Gallagher and Florence are 4-1 favourites at bookmakers William Hill, with Wolf Alice, Smith and Allen given odds of 6-1.  Several of the shortlisted albums are overtly political. Both Nadine Shah's Holiday Destination and Everything Everything's A Fever Dream address the rise in nationalism and xenophobia, coupled with a decline in empathy. London MC Novelist, meanwhile, delivers a strong anti-violence message on his self-produced debut album, Novelist Guy; and Sons Of Kemet's Your Queen Is A Reptile celebrates powerful black women who've been overlooked by history. ""It was really important to document the times we're living in,"" Shah told the BBC.  ""As a Muslim woman [living during] a rise in Islamophobia, I'm scared. I'm genuinely scared. So I needed to speak about that."" Other nominees turn their attention inwards, with Florence + The Machine displaying a new level of vulnerability on High As Hope; and Jorja Smith chronicling the bumpy road to adulthood on her streetwise debut Lost & Found. Pop star Lily Allen receives her first ever nomination for her fourth album, No Shame, an emotional depiction of her marital breakdown and struggles with self-worth. ""Making this record was really tough and it was a slog,"" she told the BBC.  ""I felt very disconnected from myself as I was making it. I was trying to find me in and amongst it all. The fact it's connected to other people, it just feels really great."" The full shortlist for the 2018 prize is: The 2018 shortlist was drawn up by a panel of judges including musicians Marcus Mumford, Jamie Cullum and Ella Eyre, alongside broadcasters Clara Amfo and Mistajam, and a handful of music critics and journalists. They said the nominees held a ""shared belief in the importance of music for navigating life's challenges - whether personal or political, falling in or out of love, growing up or looking back, angry or ecstatic."" Although the award has a reputation for rewarding up-and-coming acts, there are only three debut albums on this year's list, alongside two number one records and five former nominees. Radio 1's Huw Stephens welcomed the inclusion of artists on their third, fourth or (in Noel Gallagher's case) 10th albums. ""Hopefully it says that we're not as flash-in-the-pan as we have been in the past and that artists have time to build and to grow."" ""Artists like Arctic Monkeys and Florence + The Machine are being allowed time to develop. They don't always have to go to number one and sell out stadiums and headline Glastonbury. They can just work at their craft for years."" Arctic Monkeys, who won the prize for their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, are now the second most-nominated act in the Mercury's 26-year history. Only Radiohead have more nominations, with five, although they've never taken home the trophy.  PJ Harvey also has four nominations - and is the only artist to win the award twice, for Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea in 2001 and Let England Shake in 2011. This year's winner will be unveiled at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 20 September. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48723274,The Left Behind: TV drama unmasks the far right,The increase in hate crimes in the UK is the focus of a new film.,10 Jul 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The makers of a BBC docudrama about the rise of far-right movements in the UK believe it's largely driven by a growing sense of ""hopelessness"" in some sections of society. The Left Behind, produced by the Bafta-winning team behind Killed By My Debt, tells the story of a young Welsh man with no job security, housing or hope, who is drawn into committing an  Islamophobic hate crime. The docudrama draws on the research of Professor Hilary Pilkington, who spent time with the English Defence League (EDL) for her book Loud and Proud. It notes that in 2018 there was a 36% increase in the number of far-right extremists referred to the UK government's counter-terrorism programme, Prevent. It also details that there were 94,098 hate crimes in England and Wales that year - an increase of 123% in five years. Director Joseph Bullman believes lead character, Gethin - portrayed by Sion Daniel Young - is a victim of a broken system and representative of some British people living insecure lives. ""People live in structural conditions where these kinds of opinions are being bred,"" says the director, at a Q&A following the film's London premiere. ""Anyone who has grown up in a working class community will know that the vast overwhelming majority of  people love their families and just want to get on and make decent lives for their kids, but there are a minority who are being attracted to these perspectives because people are genuinely hopeless and I think that hopelessness is the thing that is driving this."" He adds: ""Most of those people, when you read the studies, live ultra-insecure lives in ultra-low wage jobs and they can't have a narrative for their lives. They feel humiliated, excluded and left behind and they've reached very wrong conclusions about migrants. We've just stopped listening to them - and it hasn't worked."" Bullman claims the map of the concentration of support for such movements closely mirrors a map of ""Britain's post-industrial towns and cities"".  It is, he adds, poor working class communities with ""real grievances"" about employment, housing and social care, that are increasingly turning to extremism. ""There aren't that many far-right groups in Hampstead and Richmond-upon-Thames,"" he says. Responding to the film-maker's comments, a government spokesperson tells the BBC the reasons for people becoming ""radicalised"" are more complex than that, and in running the Prevent programme they are doing what they can to stop it. ""Government and academic research has consistently indicated that there is no single socio-demographic profile of a terrorist in the UK,"" they say, ""and no single pathway leading to involvement in terrorism."" The strategy, the spokesperson adds, is about ""safeguarding vulnerable people from all walks of life who are at risk of radicalisation,"" and constitutes ""a comprehensive approach to tackling all forms of extremism, including the far right"". ""We will not tolerate any group or individual that spreads hate by demonising those of other faiths or ethnicities or stokes fear within our communities."" Bullman approached Welsh playwright Alan Harris (Sugar Baby, How My Light is Spent), to come up with the script for The Left Behind. The story is based loosely around the Ely estate in Cardiff and Bullman says they tried to cast actors who ""felt authentic"" and had ""some sense of the communities we were talking about"".  This led Young, who lived locally, to turn down another guaranteed film part and to write Bullman a letter asking to be considered for the lead role. ""You don't get that many stories of this weight and magnitude set in a world that I know,"" says Young, whose character's dad is also homeless and living on the streets. Writer Harris says for him the most memorable scene involves Gethin and his increasingly radical friends, with a group of desperate constituents (played by supporting artists) ""ripping shreds"" off their local councillor. In researching the film, Harris stumbled upon the chilling phrase and refrain ""don't become a ghost,"" which is used as a recurring motif. ""There are a lot of people in this country who feel as though they really don't matter,"" he explains, ""as if they are see-through. ""They are as effective as ghosts and that's a proper worry for people, you become kind of nothing really."" The factual drama begins with Gethin's gang attacking a halal butchers, while wearing pig masks, and then works backwards to attempt to understand their motives. Immigration has been a key talking point in British politics in recent history and will continue to be as Brexit plays out. Executive producer Aysha Rafaele stresses the importance of bringing these difficult images to the screen. ""The big divide in the country at the moment is really between what the effects of globalisation are,"" she says. ""Editorially we all know what we're trying to do with a film like this, where you are going to be accused of giving people a platform. Wouldn't it be better to just bury it? As a British Pakistan Muslim the answer is no, we should not be burying it. It is our responsibility as film-makers to allow voices you don't ordinarily hear."" The best thing policy makers can do, Rafaele says, is listen to the grievances of local communities in the UK, as that is ""the only way British Muslims are going to become safe"". ""Immigration and anti-immigrant sentiment actually embodies so many other things - it's about the boarded-up high street, it's about the fact industry in the area has shut down, it's about the fact the jobs people are doing are precarious. ""Austerity is a political choice not an inevitably, and the impact of globalisation is also a choice.""

The panic-stricken daughter called the helpline again, which sent another ambulance with volunteers and picked up Mr Deo later that evening.  ""It took a full day to take him to hospital. Stigma attached to the disease was the primary reason,"" Ms Prasad told me. With more than one million reported infections, India has the world's third-largest case load of Covid-19. As the virus spreads, so do fear and stigma, inflicting the rich and the poor, and pervading cities and villages.   ""Fear and stigma have devoured us,"" says M Mitra, a Kolkata-based homemaker whose father had tested positive for the disease.  At the receiving end of the stigma are people who have been infected and recovered from the disease, health workers and doctors. The United Nations says ""fears, rumours and stigma"" are key challenges accompanying Covid-19 globally. In India, social stigma around the disease has led to people being labelled and discriminated against. It has forced people to hide illness, avoid tests and delay hospitalisation, often with fatal consequences. Stigma attached to quarantine has meant that people returning from isolation are often treated as outcasts. In April an incident involving an Indian Islamic organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, caused massive outrage and led to reports of Islamophobia across the country. Such social pressure can have catastrophic consequences. Hours after the death of her husband from Covid-19 in early July, a homemaker in Siliguri in West Bengal picked up her two children, hailed an auto-rickshaw and got off at near the nearest railway track. There, they tried to kill themselves by throwing themselves in front of a moving train, before being rescued by locals. In many parts of their town, authorities had marked houses with Covid-19 patients by putting up bamboo barricades in front. In other parts, they put up signs like ""Danger, Covid ahead"", pointing to houses with patients. ""The virus is like a death sentence for many. They believe if the disease doesn't kill you, the stigma will,"" says Abhijit Chowdhury, a physician who runs Covid Care Network, comprising a group of volunteers and a helpline to tackle stigma. Quarantine stickers outside homes in cities and towns prominently display the name of resident patients. ""Nowhere in the world are such things done. We need a movement against stigmatisation,"" Dr Ambarish Satwik, a Delhi-based surgeon says. A doctor working in a Covid-19 ward in a Mumbai hospital told me bodies were piling up because relatives were refusing to collect them due to fear of contracting the infection. At crematoriums in Delhi, priests have complained that some relatives do not tell them that the deceased had died of Covid-19.  Twenty-six-year-old Amrita Panda learnt about Covid-related social exclusion the hard way after four members of her family were infected in May. Most of them had mild symptoms and were quarantined at home in Howrah, a suburb of Kolkata.  Ms Panda's 82-year-old grandfather, however, developed breathing problems, and had to be taken to a hospital, where he recovered after treatment. ""There were raging rumours in my neighbourhood that my father and grandfather had died of the disease. Neighbours stopped approaching us. We had to let go of our domestic maid because her other employers threatened to sack her for working at our place,"" she told me. Even after the family recovered and completed their quarantine time, neighbours have continued to avoid them. A local bank refused to let Ms Panda's father enter its premises. ""It feels that contracting the disease is a crime. Even when we go out for our chores sometimes, people shout at us and scream, look the Covid people are out and about!"" says Ms Panda. In her upscale high-rise complex in Kolkata, government official Sangeeta Banerjee Barua also faced discrimination after she tested positive after weeks of working at a quarantine centre.  ""I had mild symptoms and recovered at home. But our neighbours who are doctors and engineers and teachers asked us to shut our windows, not come out in the balcony. Neighbours tell us we are high-risk even after recovery. They have made us pariahs,"" she said. In June, Dr Jagadish Hiremath tried to rent an apartment near his 100-bed hospital in the southern city of Bangalore so he could live away from his family while he treated Covid patients. ""I looked at middle class apartments, luxury apartments. No landlord was willing to rent it to me because I was a doctor. They said let the pandemic end first,"" he told me.  The local grocery and milk shop refused to sell to his hospital workers. When an operating room technician boarded a bus to come to work, he was asked to get off, saying the bus didn't allow hospital workers. ""It's basically a cultural problem. The messaging about the disease has been poor. If this continues, we will have nobody left to work in the hospitals,"" Dr Hiremath said. Many believe that screechy, over-the-top coverage of the disease by news networks and feeble communication by the government is responsible for this. The networks are full of ""doomsday stories"" of how the disease kills and graphic visuals of the dead, a survivor complained.  K Sujatha Rao, a former health secretary, believes the stigma is due to fear and lack of trust in the public health system. ""There is no confidence in the government or health system to help people if they get the infection. The fear is of not being able to get treatment due to unaffordability. It is a fear born of an acute sense of helplessness,"" she told me. There could be cultural reasons as well. Esi Thompson, who has studied stigma in the context of Ebola, says local leaders, survivors, and community members had to be engaged as volunteers and advocates to fight stigma.  ""It is of uttermost importance to be sensitive to national, social and cultural norms in communicating any health risk. It is also important to consider how information about new health risks are communicated and interpreted in the light of people's lived realities,"" Dr Thompson, a professor of health risk and communication at Indiana University Bloomington, told me. It is not clear whether any of this is being done effectively in India as yet. ""My fear is that this stigmatisation of Covid-19 will survive the vaccine and the cure,"" says Pradeep Krishnatray, a former director of research and strategic planning, Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs. ""Remember, we still continue to stigmatise leprosy in India""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-48339080,Head teacher threatened over LGBT lessons,"Police are investigating the messages while an MP calls for a protest exclusion zone ""to protect children"".",20 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A head teacher at a primary school giving lessons on LGBT equality has received threatening emails and phone calls. Police are investigating messages sent to Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson at Anderton Park Primary School in Birmingham. There have been seven weeks of protests outside the site from which ""hundreds"" of pupils were kept away on Monday. Birmingham MP Jess Phillips has called for an exclusion zone at the school to limit where people can demonstrate. Ms Hewitt-Clarkson has branded the protests aggressive. The city council is looking into Ms Phillips' request, with the authority's leader saying some outside the school are ""peddling hatred"". The complaints at Anderton Park, mainly from Muslim protesters, focus on lessons for which pupils have been given books featuring cross-dressing children and gay families. The protests' leader says that amounts to ""social engineering"".   Similar teaching has been opposed in letters sent predominantly by conservative Muslims to schools across England, BBC Newsnight reported last week. Ms Hewitt-Clarkson said of the protests: ""There's a whole variety of emotions: embarrassment for lots of our community and our parents who think this is just awful what's happening; frustration that it's going on so long; frustration that great British laws like 'you can protest peacefully' actually are causing us a problem. ""It's interesting what a normal person on the street would think peaceful means and what actually is peaceful outside here."" She described the scene in the Sparkhill area of the city as ""very loud, it's very aggressive, it's tiresome"". Ms Hewitt-Clarkson said she was ""meeting lots of parents"", with a series of 12 meetings set up between now and the end of June. She also denied a claim from some parents that she is Islamophobic, saying she believed in ""equality for everybody"". In England, relationships education will be compulsory for all primary pupils from September 2020.  Shakeel Afsar is the leader of the Anderton Park protests, although he has no children at the school. He said the school had pulled ""the shutters down"" on parental engagement and was promoting LGBT lifestyles to children. He said 600 pupils were kept from school on Monday ""to make it crystal clear we will not have our children indoctrinated or participating in any social engineering programmes which undermine our family values by promoting child sexualisation"". Anderton Park said more than half of the 700-strong student body had attended school. The council has been contacted to confirm attendance figures. Overnight, counter-protesters adorned the site with heart-shaped messages featuring the words ""love is the answer"".  West Midlands Police, which is investigating the threats against Ms Hewitt-Clarkson, said officers were also looking into ""disorder"" outside the school in which eggs were thrown at the counter-protesters. The force said it was investigating three reports of assault and two of criminal damage. Outside the school earlier, Mr Afsar was involved in a stand-up disagreement with Ms Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley. She said protesters could not ""pick and choose"" which equality they could and could not have. Saying the worst thing about the protests was damage ""to the reputation of a peaceful"" community, she called for an exclusion area ""to protect the 700 children in this school"". Ian Ward, leader of Birmingham City Council, said he had asked authority officers to see whether they could use a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) to counter the protests. He said: ""If a PSPO is not appropriate, then we will look at alternative options, because the children and staff at Anderton Park have a right to attend school without this daily disruption. ""It's one thing for parents to ask questions about elements of a school curriculum, it's quite another for others to pounce on the situation as an excuse to peddle hatred and misinformation."" A council spokesperson said PSPO proposals would normally go out to public consultation and, based on response, a decision made by the authority and ""police leads""."

Yems, 63, has been banned from football until June 2024.Â  An independent panel found him guilty of racist abuse towards his players following a hearing in November. However, a report from the disciplinary commission said comments made by Yems were ""not a case of conscious racism"". Last week the FA said it ""fundamentally disagreed"" with that view and had already requested a longer suspension than the 18 months given to Yems. In publishing the written reasons for his ban last week the report said that Yems used ""offensive, racist and Islamophobic"" language, including joking that a Muslim player was a terrorist. ""We are appealing the sanction imposed by the independent panel on John Yems,"" said an FA spokesperson. ""We believe a longer sanction is appropriate.""

He then parted company with the League Two club 13 days later, two days after the FA announced it was investigating the allegations against him. Yems admitted one FA charge of making comments that had a reference to either ethnic origin, race, nationality, religion, gender or colour but denied 15 other charges. The independent regulatory commission found 11 of them to be proven and four unproven during a hearing and banned Yems until 1 June 2024. A further charge of segregating the players at the club along racial lines was withdrawn by the FA before the hearing. The tribunal's report stated how, in his defence, Yems ""categorically denied that he was in any way racist"". The panel was made up of barrister Robert Englehart KC, former Sheffield United striker Tony Agana and Wolverhampton Wanderers club secretary Matt Wild. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said the FA's decision to appeal against the length of the ban was ""absolutely right"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58523450,What matters most to Canadian voters,"Three people tell the BBC what issues are at stake and who they are voting for, as election day nears.",11 Sep 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Canadian voters are set to decide the makeup of their next government when they head to the polls on 20 September.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the snap election last month. Opinion polls suggest Mr Trudeau's centre-left Liberals are tied in first place with the centre-right Conservatives, the main opposition party, led by Erin O'Toole. Other parties - the New Democratic Party (NDP), the Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, the Green Party, and the People's Party of Canada - are also running.  Three voters - a Liberal, a Conservative and a New Democrat - shared their thoughts with the BBC as party leaders wrapped up back-to-back debate nights. Alex is a college student who was born and raised in Ottawa. A first-time voter, he intends to vote Liberal because pandemic recovery is his highest priority. What is your ""ballot box"" issue and why? Getting us out of the pandemic. When we're in this pandemic, we can't get the economy back to normal because it's not a normal time period. We can't really focus on climate change either because we know a lot of people are relying on [oil and gas] jobs to feed their families and heat their homes. Until we can deal with the pandemic and get past it, I don't think we can start focusing on the economy. That's the biggest priority for me. Who are you voting for and why? I'm planning to vote for the Liberals. Out of all the options available to me and the makeup of my riding [electoral district], I think that's the best option. The NDP has a really good plan for getting us out of the pandemic; I don't really believe the Conservatives because they're not mandating vaccines for their own candidates and trying to play both sides of the vaccine choice debate; but the Liberal camp has done a pretty good job, although not perfect, and I have trust in them to keep us going. In terms of the economy, although I liked what I heard from the Conservative plan, I have concerns especially with their approach to climate change. My local candidate indicated that, in terms of the economy and climate change, we've got to do one or the other, and I don't really believe in that message. We're all in this together and we've got to work together. Ultimately, I'm not 100% sold on really any of the parties but ultimately I just feel like the Liberals and the Liberal candidate in my riding are the best choice for me. Did the debate change your mind about any of the candidates? I think, for most decided voters, debates do very little to change people's minds most of the time. But I was reminded that I don't believe in the Conservatives' climate policy or Covid policy. I do support a lot of the social policies of the NDP, but the NDP is basically never elected in my riding and I do have a couple of concerns with costs in their platform. In general, the whole debate was a little bit hectic, basically trading one-liners and campaign slogans with each other. But there was a very good question about building trust amongst indigenous communities in Canada and I don't know if any of the parties really have a great plan for how to do that. Bernadette is a single mother who runs a fully female consulting firm. She is afraid of more Liberal spending and, after considering a vote for the People's Party of Canada, now intends to vote for the Conservatives. What is your ""ballot box"" issue and why? Fiscal responsibility. One of the big things the Liberals spoke about was the middle class, but I'm middle class through and through. I'm a small business owner, a single mom, a property owner. I'm all these things, but my taxes have gone up. Responsible spending is better than raising taxes. I don't want you guys to keep spending money. I want you guys to improve the economy so that we can make the money and then give you the money to spend responsibly. I think the government forgets that it's our money they are spending frivolously without our input. Who are you voting for and why? As much as I support the People's Party, I'm going to vote Conservative. What Canadians need is jobs, not handouts, at this moment in time. Because we still have to pay for, and our children have to pay for, handouts. We need a working economy. The Conservatives have got the best perspective on how to achieve that. The oil and gas industry is in decline. I understand the need for clean energy, but you cannot flip a switch. It has to be done sustainably. You have to rely on the current industry in order to generate capital that can move over, not switch it off, because that kills jobs and we have no way to make money as a country. I'm OK with a slower way of reducing emissions because it means that we can maintain the economy at the same time; it's got to be a balance. Did the debate change your mind about any of the candidates? The debate changed my mind purely because I found that Erin O'Toole was confident and calm in his answers, even when he was getting harassed by other party leaders. As much as I feel that the Conservatives are a little bit like fake Liberals, which I don't like about them, I still think we need to have a Conservative government in order to get back on track. If we don't get the Conservatives in, Canada's got a fairly bleak future over the next four years, particularly if the Liberals get a majority. I can't even imagine the spending or how bad the job market will be. I don't want to bash anybody but Trudeau was having a bit of a temper tantrum. He's feeling the pressure of losing, maybe even losing his minority. What stood out to me was that many of the leaders were talking about what they wanted to do, but it was only [NDP leader] Jagmeet Singh and Erin O'Toole who seemed to have a how. The Bloc and the Greens do not matter to me as much. The Liberals have not delivered. This is the first time I've ever even considered this, but I'd prefer to have a Conservative majority with an NDP opposition. Jagmeet Singh would make an excellent opposition party leader. To me, that's a good balance for the country. Jaffar is a Muslim immigrant and retired chartered accountant. He believes Canada's economic recovery, inclusiveness and global image are all at stake in this election. What is your ""ballot box"" issue and why? Firstly, the economy and fixing the impacts of the pandemic. Then, Canada's foreign policy, the environment and climate change. Islamophobia is very scary in Canada. It's spreading fast and innocent people have been killed. They didn't discuss that at all in the debate. To Mr Trudeau and Mr O'Toole, it's not even an issue. I would like Jagmeet Singh to talk more about issues of race, religion and extremism. It's a real thing that's happening and we've got to do something. Somebody I know went with their wife to [a popular restaurant in Toronto] for dessert and they were refused service because of her hijab. Native and residential school issues took up about two minutes in the debate. The discovery of these unmarked graves is a national shame. People of colour, particularly First Nations, don't have any representation in the corridors of power. We need to make sure there is fair representation. Who are you voting for and why? I'm voting for the NDP this time. What Jagmeet Singh has been saying is sincere and will benefit us all. He has some really good ideas on housing, job re-training, the economy and healthcare. I think Jagmeet might also fine tune Canada's foreign policy because he talked about Canada's respect in the world and that's an important one for me. He's talking about a lot of spending though, so I wonder where that's going to come from. So I have some question marks. I feel it's going to end up hitting us in the middle class because we're creating a lot of debt in Canada to support the economy through this pandemic. But overall I think he is great. Did the debate change your mind about any of the candidates? I didn't appreciate Mr O'Toole very much. I have congratulated him on passing a resolution in the Canadian Parliament condemning China for its treatment of Uighurs, but I haven't heard a peep out of him about human rights violations in other places because it suits them to be selective in their condemnation. Canada has lost its respect in the world because it is speaking from both sides of its mouth. And that applies to Mr Trudeau, who is continuing to sell arms to Saudi Arabia as the war in Yemen goes on. I was a little bit more impressed with [Green Party leader] Annamie Paul. She didn't say much but talked sense about how we need to work together."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-42650106,The schoolchildren bullied for being Muslim,"In her book Mothering a Muslim, writer Nazia Erum says children as young as five are being targeted.",13 Jan 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Schools and playgrounds can be dangerous places where children are isolated or bullied. Children often use differences in appearance, skin colour, food habits, misogyny, homophobia and casteism to inflict pain on their peers. And now, according to a new book out in India, Muslim children are increasingly being targeted in posh schools for their religious identity because of the growing Islamophobia in India and across the world. Writer Nazia Erum, who spoke to 145 families in 12 cities and 100 children studying in 25 elite Delhi schools while researching her book Mothering a Muslim, says that children as young as five are being targeted. ""What I found during my research was shocking, I didn't think it was happening in these elite schools,"" Ms Erum told the BBC. ""When five and six year olds say they were called a Pakistani or a terrorist, how do you respond to that? And how do you complain to the school?"" she asks. ""A lot of it is said in jest, it's meant to be funny, to evoke a laugh. It's subtle and it can seem like harmless banter, but it's not. It's actually bullying and tormenting.""  The children she interviewed for her book told her about some of the questions and comments that are regularly hurled at them: Since its launch, the book has started a conversation around religious hate and prejudice in schools and last weekend, #MotheringAMuslim trended high on Twitter, with many taking to social media to share their own experiences. Nearly 80% of India's population of 1.3 billion is Hindu, while Muslims make up 14.2%. For the most part, the two communities have lived peacefully, but religious resentment has always simmered below the surface since 1947 when India and Pakistan were carved out of a single nation. The parting was bloody - between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence.  Ms Erum says while anti-Muslim slurs have been used since the 1990s, after the demolition of the Babri mosque by Hindu hardline groups and the Hindu-Muslim riots that followed, in recent years their tone and intensity have changed. She became acutely aware of it in 2014, after she gave birth to her first child. ""As I held my little daughter Myra in my arms, for the first time I was afraid,"" Ms Erum said, adding that she was worried about even giving the baby a name that could be easily identified as Muslim.  It was a time of sharp religious divisions in India. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was running a hugely polarising election campaign, which helped sweep Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power.  There was a rise in Hindu nationalist sentiment and some television channels were presenting a distorted narrative that painted Muslims as ""invaders, anti-national and a threat to national security"".  ""Since 2014, my identity as a Muslim was in my face, and all my other identities had become secondary to that. There was a sense of palpable fear among the entire community,"" Ms Erum says.  And since then, the fault lines have only widened. The polarising arguments and debates on television have entrenched biases, which are now being passed around from the adults to children. ""So in playgrounds, schools, classrooms and school buses, a Muslim child is singled out, pushed into a corner, called a Pakistani, IS, Bagdadi and terrorist,"" says Ms Erum. The stories of children she cites in the book make for grim reading: Being bullied on account of one's religion in schools is not limited to India, it's happening across the world.  In the US, it's been described as the ""Trump Effect"" after reports that his presidential campaign had produced an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of colour and inflamed racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom.  So can the increased bullying of Muslim children in Indian schools be described as the ""Modi Effect""? ""All politicians are using a similar tone, including those from Islamic parties,"" Ms Erum says. She adds that schools have refused to accept that religious bullying took place on their premises.  That, she says, could also be since most cases go unreported - children don't want to be seen as tattletales and most parents dismiss them as random incidents. But what is worrying is that a form of self-censorship has crept into their lives and many Muslim parents have begun telling their children to be on their best behaviour at all times - don't argue, don't be good at computer games that involve bombs or guns, don't crack a joke at the airport, don't wear traditional outfits when you go out. Ms Erum says these are warning signs and parents and schools must do everything possible to counter communal bullying. ""The first step is to accept that there's a problem, and then have a conversation about it. Whataboutery is not going to help,"" she says. ""If this issue is not addressed, it's not going to be restricted to 9pm debates in television studios or newspaper headlines, because hate swallows all, it impacts both the tormentor and the tormented equally."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-57641242,Rising Islamophobia 'should shame us all',A report into racism against Muslims recommends lessons in school and a more diverse police service.,29 Jun 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The first public inquiry into Islamophobia in Scotland has found that racism against Muslims has escalated. Verbal and physical assaults have intensified, especially on public transport, with more participants in Glasgow experiencing abuse. Labour leader Anas Sarwar, who leads the group of MSPs behind the report, said the results ""should shame us all"". Several recommendations have been made for the Scottish government to act upon. The inquiry was set up in 2018 by a cross-party group of MSPs charged with tackling islamophobia after levels of hatred increased. The report, produced by Newcastle University professor Peter Hopkins, calls for the integration of an understanding of Islamophobia into Scotland's education curriculum. It also wants to see the recruiting of more police officers from diverse communities. It asks that all political parties in Scotland adopt a ""no tolerance"" approach to Islamophobia. The report suggests that the Scottish government funds and supports initiatives to educate people about the damage Islamophobia does to society. And it calls on the Scottish government to instigate a full independent review. Mr Sarwar started the group after he was allegedly subjected to racist comments by a Labour councillor. He wrote to the first minister outlining a series of proposals to tackle ""everyday racism and Islamophobia"" across Scotland. He also called for a review of the legal framework surrounding racist and Islamophobic abuse on social media. Responding to the report, Mr Sarwar said: ""We pride ourselves on being a welcome and tolerant country, but it's clear how much more work we have to do. ""There are people in Scotland who feel scared to leave their homes for fear of verbal of physical attack, are withdrawing from public services with devastating knock-on consequences on their health and education and feel they are outsiders in their own country. ""This should shame us all."" He said it was clear that efforts had to be redoubled to challenge and overcome hatred and prejudice. And he added: ""The fight against hate is a fight for all of us."" The review was told by its participants that the abuse takes place most commonly in the street. Public spaces such as shops or restaurants and public transport were also hotspots, then at work and places of education to a lesser extent.  Muslim women were more likely to encounter Islamophobia than men. Report author Prof Hopkins has been researching issues of racism and Islamophobia in Scotland for 20 years.  He said: ""The evidence submitted to this inquiry makes it clear that Scotland has a very serious set of issues to address in relation to everyday Islamophobia and racism.  ""Inquiry evidence included numerous references to verbal and physical abuse, attacks in and around mosques and religious buildings, and experiences of threatening behaviour on public transport.  ""Almost four fifths of respondents were fearful of experiencing Islamophobia and this had real consequences for how they lived their lives.  ""Islamophobia permeates all domains of Scottish society; it is not only restricted to one context. It threatens education, limits employment prospects, and impacts everyday issues including health, wellbeing and housing.  ""It is time to address the issue of Scotland's Islamophobia rather than denying its existence."" He added: ""The recommendations make it clear that all sectors, agencies and departments need to make long-term changes to eradicate Islamophobia from Scottish society.""  A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We are committed to tackling hate crime and prejudice, including Islamophobia in all its forms and we will carefully consider this inquiry's recommendations. ""New hate crime laws ensure our police and courts will have the powers they need so those who would deliberately target others due to their religion or other characteristics can be prosecuted. ""Later this year we will report on the progress of our Tackling Prejudice and Building Connected Communities Action Plan, which was published in 2017 and included actions on raising awareness of hate crime and encourage reporting."" She said the government would develop a new hate crime strategy later this year in consultation with stakeholders. ""As part of this, we will consider the need to define Islamophobia, including consideration of the UK's All-Party Parliamentary Group's definition,"" she added."

It meant private companies were responsible for monitoring medium and low-risk offenders, with payment linked to results. But now those changes will be reversed by the end of 2020. In March the National Audit Office said problems with the new system had cost taxpayers almost £500m, and that numbers returning to prison for breaching their licence had ""skyrocketed"". Chief probation inspector Dame Glenys Stacey said the model of part-privatisation was ""irredeemably flawed"". Dame Glenys said she was ""delighted"" about Justice Secretary David Gauke's decision. But Janine McDowell, of Sodexo Justice Services in the UK & Ireland, claimed it would ""increase cost and risk"". With one week to go until the UK takes part in EU elections, Theresa May will meet the executive of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers today. They're expected to demand that she sets a date for her departure. The Conservatives and Labour are still trying to negotiate a deal that would allow a Brexit withdrawal agreement to pass the House of Commons. MPs will vote on a withdrawal bill - which is required to implement Mrs May's deal - next month.

His new breakfast show attracted an average weekly audience of 1.05 million in the first three months of 2019. Virgin Radio as a whole was averaging about 480,000 listeners per week before he joined. Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent The decision to renationalise offender supervision will be seen as an admission by the government that Chris Grayling's flagship reforms have failed. He went ahead in 2014 despite numerous warnings about the considerable risks of splitting probation services between different providers and introducing a method of payment-by-results. Probation unions and criminal justice experts urged him to at least pilot the new approach, so problems could be identified and rectified. But Mr Grayling went for quick, wholesale change. He wanted the contracts with the private companies firmly in place before the 2015 general election so the system couldn't be undone if there was a change of government. However, inspection after inspection signalled serious problems, with the nail in the coffin being Dame Glenys Stacey's report in March.

Images of Sam Farrell at a party on 23 March wearing striped pyjamas with a Holocaust number were tweeted by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) who said they were ""extremely concerned"". The president-elect had been due to take up the role at Edge Hill University in Ormskirk on 1 July. He said he was ""deeply sorry"". The UJS welcomed the apology but said his ""consistent history of antisemitic, Islamophobic, homophobic, transphobic, sexist and ableist social media posts deem him unfit for a role such as SU president"". Edge Hill Students' Union (SU) said they plan to organise anti-Semitism training for all new student officers after being contacted by a UJS representative. Mr Farrell had previously been disciplined over the incident but a fresh action was opened on 24 March due to new evidence, the SU said. At the time he said: ""Despite what my past posts may suggest, I do understand the severity of making light of events from history, especially when that history plays a fundamental role in reminding us of the needless persecution of others. ""I only hope I can convey how genuine I am when I say that I now realise how naïve and ignorant my past behaviour was. It was wrong, it will not happen again, and it should not have happened in the first place."" The SU said it would now ""be considering our options for the role for the forthcoming academic year"". In a statement, Edge Hill University said it welcomed the decision.  ""While the Students' Union is a wholly independent organisation, responsible for the election and appointment of its officers, the university has always been clear that it will not tolerate abhorrent, abusive or racist behaviour of any kind and would not hesitate to use its own procedures if necessary if the matter was not dealt with appropriately."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48434202,Call for Tory Islamophobia investigation,"The Muslim Council of Britain says a problem ""runs deep into the party"" and is demanding an inquiry.",28 May 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Muslim Council of Britain has formally asked the UK's human rights watchdog to investigate accusations of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. In a letter to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, the MCB said a problem ""runs deep into the party"".  The EHRC said in response that it was considering complaints about the party in line with its ""usual processes"".  In March, party deputy chairman James Cleverly insisted ""immediate action"" was taken after any racism claims. The MCB is an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies, including mosques, schools, and charitable associations. It has called repeatedly for an independent investigation into discrimination claims. Now, in its letter filing a formal complaint to the EHRC, it accused the Conservatives of not taking action against Islamophobia shown by Tory MPs, and tolerating discrimination towards party members.  The MCB said there was ""sufficient evidence"" to suggest the party may have breached anti-discrimination law, and accused it of showing a ""callous attitude to complaints"".  Among the allegations, it cited comments made by Boris Johnson about women wearing burkas looking like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"" as an example of when Tory MPs had created an ""atmosphere of hostility towards the Muslim members of the party"". The former foreign secretary was later cleared of breaking the Tories' code of conduct - a decision the MCB criticised at the time.  The group also criticised the unsuccessful London mayoral campaign of Zac Goldsmith in 2016 - in which he ran against Sadiq Khan - arguing it demonstrated a ""tolerance for Islamophobia"" within the Conservative Party.  The MCB complaint comes on the same day that the EHRC announced a formal investigation into the Labour Party over allegations of anti-Semitism. Conservative peer Baroness Warsi, who was the first female Muslim cabinet minister, has long criticised her party over the issue. In April, Tory chairman Brandon Lewis insisted the party's approach to Islamophobia was ""transparent"" but would not say how many complaints it had received. An EHRC spokesman said the body had written to the Conservative Party ""to ask for information in order to help assess the complaints"".  Earlier this month, the MCB criticised the government for rejecting a definition of Islamophobia created by a cross-party group of MPs. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims wanted to define it to tackle what it called a ""social evil"". Its wording has the support of various political parties - including Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Conservatives - and several Muslim groups. But a government spokesman said it needed ""further careful consideration"" and had ""not been broadly accepted""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47488047,Rudd apologises over 'coloured' term,"Diane Abbott says Amber Rudd's use of the word ""coloured"" was ""outdated"" and ""offensive"".",8 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has apologised for using the word ""coloured"" in a BBC interview.  Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised the use of the term, saying it was ""outdated"", ""offensive"" and a ""revealing choice of words"". During a discussion about MP abuse, Ms Rudd said: ""It's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse."" In her apology, Ms Rudd said she was ""mortified at my clumsy language"". The prime minister's official spokeswoman said making an apology was ""absolutely the right thing to do"". Historically, the word is associated with segregation, especially in the US, where black people were kept separate from white people - on public transport, or at drinking fountains which were described as ""coloured-only"" for example. It is regarded as an offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday life. The exchange happened during an interview on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. Host Jeremy Vine asked Ms Rudd: ""The question is, given that all people in the public eye seem to get terrible tweets from strangers, whether it's worse if you're a woman?"" Ms Rudd replied: ""It definitely is worse if you're a woman, it's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. ""I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, that's something we need to call out."" But Ms Abbott responded on Twitter, saying it was a ""revealing choice of words"". Former home secretary Ms Rudd apologised on Twitter. Separately, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has been criticised for her response to a question from Labour MP Naz Shah, about Islamophobia. The shadow women and equalities minister had called for a Commons debate, after the former Tory minister Baroness Warsi criticised the Conservatives over Islamophobia.  Ms Shah added that the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims had recently published a definition of Islamophobia. Mrs Leadsom replied that the Conservatives had an ""extremely robust and urgent"" response to Islamophobia but went on to suggest that, on the definition of Islamophobia, Ms Shah ""can discuss with Foreign Office ministers whether that would be a useful way forward"". Ms Shah said later: ""To say that British Muslims facing Islamophobia here in the UK is a 'Foreign Office' issue is truly baffling and horrifically alludes to British Muslims as foreigners. ""It just goes to show how out of touch the Tories are with a problem that their politicians and councillors are exacerbating."" A spokesman for the Commons Leader's office spokesman said: ""Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place. ""It was thought the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia.  ""International efforts to combat Islamophobia (and all forms of religious persecution and prejudice) are lead by the PM's special envoy on freedom of religion or belief, Lord Ahmad, at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. ""Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swiftly by the Home Office or Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government as appropriate."" But Baroness Warsi, a Conservative peer, tweeted: ""What is wrong with some of my colleagues?"""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-41914331,Has the arena attack changed Manchester?,How life has changed for people in the city six months on.,22 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"It has been six months since 22 people were killed and hundreds more injured in the suicide bombing at Manchester Arena. BBC News talks to people about how the city has changed since the attack.  At the Christmas market in Manchester's Albert Square, shopper Nicola Depetrillo said people were ""defiant"" in the wake of the terror attack on 22 May. ""I think it's the same for everybody now, life's changed for us,"" she said.  ""It will be in the back of your mind all the time and you are more aware of what is around you. But you've got to go about your everyday life. You can't stop going out. ""Why should we stay away? This is our city.""  Charlotte Powell said she recently took part in an event which involved chasing people in the city centre while collecting clues.  She described how one man thought they were running out of fear and began sprinting with them. ""His face was shocked and you could see the fear. He said 'I thought it was another attack' and all we were doing was running down the road,"" she said. ""So people are a bit edgy."" Tibyan Sanoh was on the tram when the attack happened and heard the bang as the bomb exploded in the arena. She said: ""For a couple of weeks it was really scary. But on the whole I feel like everyone's just got back to normal, which is strange. ""When something happens people automatically think it's a terrorist attack. But aside from that I feel Manchester is a hard-faced city anyway, so you just crack on.""  Catherine Jones, from Cheadle Hulme, said on Remembrance Sunday a cannon fired to mark the beginning of the silence made her jump.  ""My immediate reaction was it was a bomb again. You think about it more in the city centre when you're in enclosed shopping centres. I'd rather be out where you can run if it happens again."" She said people were more vigilant and the attack had increased awareness around reporting anything suspicious. ""We wouldn't stop coming in to Manchester because of it [though].  Life has to go on.""   As visitors enjoy German sausages at the markets and sip mulled wine, they are being joined by armed police.  Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham announced officers would for the first time patrol the market to provide the ""reassurance people will want"". Armed officers have also been deployed to Manchester Airport and events such as the Great Manchester Run. Hanouf Alosaimi, who was visiting the market, said: ""If I see armed police, everything is safe and good. When I see police everywhere, everything is secure and I am very happy with it.  ""[I think Manchester in general] is more secure. I feel very, very safe."" ""Security has been massively vamped up,"" says David Adu-Dwumaa  who works in the city centre but lives in Leigh. ""Some people would see it and be paranoid about what could happen, but it can always happen, so I think it's better for [reinforcements] to be there."" However, Caniko Behdjet, from Whitefield, said she felt ""concerned, rather than reassured and protected"" when she saw police with guns. ""As soon as I got off the tram there was something over the loud speaker about keeping your belongings with you or they will be destroyed. It makes you feel a bit uneasy.""  Barriers have also been put up at key locations in the city centre. Councillor Pat Kearney said he had visited the market in Berlin where a lorry ploughed into shoppers and killed 12 people and had ""learned lessons"". ""A year or two ago we wouldn't talk so openly about the security measures. But now I think the public actually want to be reassured that the council and police have thought through the security,"" he added. Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce (GMCC) reported an ""immediate dip"" in tourism and hotel bookings following the attack. But levels of tourism, visitors and conferences are now as ""high as ever"", according to its head of research and policy, Christian Spence. ""This year's festivals and events in the city centre have all been huge successes and the Manchester 'buzz' is very much in evidence,"" he said. Hotel occupancy rates initially ""struggled"" after the attack but showed signs of recovery by August, a report to Manchester City Council's Economy Scrutiny Committee said. Marketing Manchester said hotel occupancy up to the end of September was nudging ahead of the 2016 figures. ""We are confident we will end the year ahead of last year,"" a spokesperson said.  This contrasts with hotel performance data following the terror attack in Paris in November 2015 which left 130 people dead, when ""mixed performance levels were still evident a year later"".   Reports of Islamophobic hate crimes and incidents in Greater Manchester rose by 500% in the month following the attack, police figures showed. They included a bomb threat, racist taunts, and graffiti. After this initial spike, and a high of 1,061 reported incidents, the figures have since dropped but remain slightly above 2016 levels. In October there were 711 incidents of reported hate crime, compared to 564 the previous year.  Greater Manchester Police's Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said events in Manchester and across the UK have had a ""huge impact"" on figures, but one month after the attack levels of hate crime ""returned to similar levels"" as before. He said hate crime was often under-reported and encouraged people to come forward. Firms closest to the arena, which had to be closed for several days in the immediate aftermath of the attack, were offered help by Manchester City Council. Three applied for business rate relief and received support totalling £7,640, while others were contacted for potential support from a hardship scheme. Several businesses responded and identified potential losses totalling about £50,000, the Economy Scrutiny Committee report found. But Mr Spence said that when compared to ""the physical devastation"" of the IRA bombing in 1996, the biggest impact of the recent bombing was ""on those who lost loved ones... those injured... and the psychological impact on people who live and work in the city centre."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44109371,Racist hate mail sent with O2 Sim cards,"Phone company apologises for mail addressed to ""Mr Isis Terroriste"" and ""Mr Getout Ofengland"".",15 May 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"O2 has apologised after two items of ""shocking"" racist hate mail were sent to a British-Iraqi family in London.  Addressed to ""Mr Isis Terroriste"" and ""Mr Getout Ofengland"" at the exact family address in Wembley, north London, they contained free pay-as-you-go Sim cards ordered online in August 2017 by an unknown third party. The family, who presumed they were junk mail, only recently read the envelopes. The Muslim Council of Britain said the ""Islamophobia"" was deeply concerning. The family told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Programme: ""We were really saddened to come across these letters, especially having a younger child in the house who we don't want to grow up witnessing such hateful language.  ""It's even sadder to think that such hate speech has become normalised despite living in such a uniquely multicultural and diverse city like London."" Family friend and lawyer Sura Jawad said the letters were hateful.  ""It's horrible to think that there are people who have so much hatred in them that they set out to deliberately make others feel isolated and unwelcome or who take comments like these light-heartedly,"" she said. ""Either scenario shows that racism and Islamophobia are very much rife issues, particularly in a post-Brexit climate."" O2 said its Sim card postage and printing was managed by a third-party partner, Williams Lea Tag, and was automated. Human checks were in place but only once a query had been identified. And in this case no query had been raised before postage.  The company said it would be working with this partner to review the entire process as a result of this issue - including where human checking was used.  O2 added that it ""has a rigorous data-cleansing process in place to prevent any of our free products being sent to addresses with obscenities or offensive names, and so this is a rare occurrence"". ""If the family decide to report this case, we will work closely with the police as part of their investigation."" After speaking to a friend of the family affected, Miqdaad Versi, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: ""These Islamophobic bigots are finding more and more ways to spread their hatred.  ""Whilst it is imperative that corporations upgrade safeguards to prevent such incidents recurring, there are broader concerns about the government not taking Islamophobia seriously.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43782111,Chakrabarti on Labour and anti-Semitism,"The Labour peer says officials have the ""resources"" and political will to address ""serious problem"".",16 Apr 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour officials have the ""resources""  to tackle anti-Semitism within the party, shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti has insisted. The peer implied to the BBC there was still a ""serious problem"", nearly two years after a report she wrote for Jeremy Corbyn urged action to address an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". She accepted not all her June 2016 recommendations had been implemented. But she said general secretary Jennie Formby had prioritised the issue. Jewish groups, which demonstrated outside Parliament last month, have demanded urgent action - including the full implementation of the 2016 report - after a number of high-profile rows. It is understood that Mr Corbyn will meet representatives from the Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council for talks on 24 April amid calls for investigations into cases of alleged anti-Semitism, including that of suspended former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, to be expedited. Baroness Chakrabarti's 2016 investigation concluded Labour was ""not overrun"" by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or other forms of racism but made a number of recommendations to confront what it found was clear evidence of ""ignorant attitudes"" among some party members.  These included procedural rule changes to improve the party's disciplinary process, the adoption and publication of a complaints procedure and the appointment of a general counsel to give advice on issues including disciplinary matters and to take responsibility for instructing external lawyers. Asked if she conceded there was a ""more serious problem"" with anti-Semitism now than in 2016, Baroness Chakrabarti told BBC Radio 4's Today she thought ""there was a serious problem at the time"". ""But what I am glad to say is that I have spent some time in recent days with Jennie Formby and she shares my serious concern."" Asked as a shadow cabinet member whether she bore some responsibility for the fact her report had not been fully implemented, she said it was clear that further action was needed.  ""I clearly have not, by myself, been able to achieve that. The new general secretary has the resources and has made this an absolute priority."" She added: ""I think it is time to tackle some of the tropes that have been promoted on the left of politics as well as on the far-right of politics, particularly any confusion between anti-elitism and anti-Semitism. That really has to stop."""

Police confirmed that the 68-year-old has been released on an undertaking to appear in court at a later date.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-43632366,'Punish a Muslim' scorned by community,"People gather to ""reclaim April 3 from hatred"" after letters were sent out urging violence.",3 Apr 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Three weeks ago, letters urging people to ""Punish a Muslim"" on 3 April arrived in homes in Bradford, Leicester, London, Cardiff and Sheffield. It sparked fears of violence with some Muslim people being too scared to leave home. But when one Cardiff man heard how scared his young children were, he worked with his community to ""reclaim 3 April from hatred"". Moseem Suleman helped to hastily arrange a social event in the Grangetown area of Cardiff. He said: ""Today is my brother's birthday. It should be joyous occasion. But it became a day my young children were afraid of.  ""They had heard bad things might happen to them. It is all they could talk about on their way home from school and it made me so sad."" Meet the man correcting stories about Muslims Communities unite to defy 'Punish A Muslim Day'  This is my country, too How the hijab became a fashion statement Mr Suleman and other members of Grangetown took less than three weeks to put on a day named Cardiff Together: One Love. So on Tuesday, Grange Gardens was filled with the sound of laugher and idle chat. Families sprawled on blankets on the damp grass, enjoying a mismatched picnic of onion bhajis and cupcakes.  Children thumped a football back and forth, while teenagers huddled in groups, scrolling on their mobile phones and giggling. ""I did not want them to remember this day of fear,"" Mr Suleman told the crowd. ""I wanted them to have happy memories. And because of this event, now they do."" To any passing onlooker, it would appear a normal, relaxed scene of togetherness in one of Cardiff's most diverse communities.   Yet it was organised in response to an ominous threat - a so-called Punish A Muslim day that had spread across the UK via social media.  The planned day - sparked by hate mail sent to individuals in Bradford, Leicester, London, Cardiff and Sheffield - has left many Muslim people too scared to leave their homes for fear of being attacked, with women particularly worried they might have their hijab torn off on the street.   But at the Hideout Café, the day has been used as an incentive to bring people together in defiance.  For Mariyah Zaman, 19, a media student at Cardiff Metropolitan University, the day is a symptom of the growing anti-Muslim sentiment she feels is sweeping across the UK and Europe.  She said: ""As horrific as it is, when I first heard about the Punish a Muslim Day, I wasn't surprised. ""Islamophobia has become normalised - especially against women who are visibly Muslim. ""It's not just in the street; it is present in institutions and work places. Muslims face stigmatisation every day.  ""People need to be educated and equipped with the right information. The biggest cause of Islamophobia is a lack of awareness and an irrational fear."" It is a view Ali Abdi, 30, agrees with. A local community activist who has lived in Grangetown all his life, he dedicates much of his spare time to trying to improve the area.  He said: ""This area has fabulous cohesion and a great history of it.  ""So my message today is that, in the face of division and hatred, as a community we carry on. ""No one is born to hate another person. People are taught it, and anything that is taught can also be untaught."" The event - ""Cardiff together: One love"" - was organised by the Cardiff working group of Muslim Engagement and Development (MEND) -  a national organisation which seeks to empower British Muslims - along with the Muslim Council of Wales.  But it has also been supported by other faith groups.  When invited to address the crowd over the microphone, Aled Edwards, secretary of the Interfaith Council for Wales and himself a Christian, said: ""The friendship and dialogue between the faith communities in Cardiff and Wales is very strong. ""If one of communities is persecuted in this way, we come together very quickly.  ""Tomorrow it might be Jews who are attacked or Hindus or Christians. ""We use it as an excuse to renew our friendship and stand together. But for Yasmin Khan, of Cyncoed, Cardiff, the low turnout of local Grangetown Muslims showed the level of fear the community still have. Waving her arm at the surrounding terrace houses, she said: ""This whole area is full of Muslims. ""But I have spoken to them, and they are too frightened of being attacked, so they haven't come. ""Even some mosques have said 'don't go out'.   ""My view is that this is not right. We have to live harmoniously. We can't just be frightened and made to stay in the house.""  Perhaps those who best sum up the day are two teenage girls - a Muslim and non-Muslim - who live over the road from each other and have bonded playing football on the community pitch.  Kicking a ball back and forth between themselves, one said: ""The Punish a Muslim Day is just so dumb.  ""Why do Muslims get blamed for all the terrorism and bad things that happen?"" Her friend - dressed in a headscarf, jeans and trainers - nods in agreement. ""It's true,"" she said, curling a ball to her friend's feet. ""We're taught in school not to judge people on how they look. ""You have to get to know them first. Adults need to learn that. It's 2018, after all. Not 1800."""

Counter-terrorism police have been investigating letters sent out around the UK as a possible hate crime. Images of the A4 notes, which contain a list of violent acts alongside a number of ""points"" for performing them, have been widely shared online. There are fears the campaign may have led to physical attacks in Scotland. Holyrood's cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia is to discuss the ""Punish a Muslim day"" letters with Police Scotland representatives on Tuesday. Concerns have also been raised about them in the House of Commons, with MPs describing the ""abhorrent"" letters as a ""really urgent situation"". No-one in Scotland is known to have received a copy, but Labour MSP Anas Sarwar said there has been a ""spike"" in racist and Islamophobic crimes in Glasgow. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that he knew of five ""very serious"" hate crimes in the city over the last 10 days.  In one case, he said a schoolgirl was asked if someone could rip off her hijab so they could film it and earn 25 points from the ""Punish a Muslim"" campaign.  Mr Sarwar said a woman was also assaulted outside a supermarket, where she was sworn at and told to go home.  Another woman was attacked in a shopping centre and a third was abused and assaulted on train by three men.  ""So all of these things - added to this Punish a Muslim campaign running on social media - is causing genuine fear and alarm,"" the MSP added.  Mr Sarwar said he had been contacted by people unsure as to how to keep themselves safe.  ""What we're trying to do is find a coordinated response, saying please go about your daily business as you normally would,"" he said.  ""Let's not let these people change our everyday way of life, but be more vigilant, look out for your friends and family, and if you see anything, suspect anything or experience anything, please share that with the police."" Earlier, Mr Sarwar said MSPs would be discussing the issue with police at the cross-party group meeting, where they will identify additional action to reassure people.  ""We have a duty to stand against racism and prejudice in all its forms. MSPs will come together to show support and solidarity with the communities being targeted by this vile Islamophobic campaign,"" he added. Dr Muhammad Adrees, convener of the Muslim Council of Scotland, said the letters were ""a chilling reminder of the very real danger and hatred facing ordinary Muslims every day"". He said: ""Although there are no known recipients in Scotland, they have nonetheless caused considerable alarm and the community needs reassurance, especially since the letters have already triggered Islamophobic incidents here.  ""Our advice to members of the public is to remain vigilant and alert but not alarmed. Go about your everyday business, taking some extra precautions. If you feel threatened or are at risk, contact the police immediately."" Supt David Pettigrew, of Police Scotland, said: ""Police Scotland is aware of the recent media coverage of letters received by some individuals in England over the past few weeks that are anti-Islamic in nature.

John Cryer said some of what is written ""makes your hair stand up"", adding: ""This stuff is redolent of the 1930s."" He was speaking at a fringe debate at the Labour conference in Brighton. Labour says it condemns anti-Semitism in the ""strongest possible terms"" with ""tough new rules"" recently agreed by the party's ruling executive committee. These changes to the rule book will be voted on by delegates in Brighton on Tuesday. The fringe debate, organised by the Holocaust Educational Trust and the Anti-Semitism Policy Trust, looked at anti-Semitism on the left of politics. Panellists agreed there had been a recent increase in people questioning the Holocaust. Mr Cryer, Labour MP for Leyton and Wanstead, described a ""seeping poison"" and warned that future generations might not realise that when it came to Nazism, ""we were right and they were wrong"". As chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, he sits on the disputes panel of the National Executive Committee, which rules on what members have ""said, written or tweeted"", he told the audience. ""I have seen some of the tweets from paid up Labour Party members and I am not kidding you, it makes your hair stand up,"" he said. Some Labour members dismiss reports of anti-Semitism as a myth, he said. ""But you don't have to look very far before you see it's not a myth...and there's no place in the Labour Party for stuff like that."" Another MP, Wes Streeting, said a ""rump"" of anti-Semites in Labour should be ""driven out"" of the party. ""It isn't anti-Semitic to criticise the Israeli government,"" he said. ""Unfortunately we see too many people examples of anti-Semitic language being used in order to do so."" Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""Why do people want to question the truth of the Holocaust?  ""Do we question whether the earth is flat? There are certain stories that can't have two sides."" Last year, an inquiry was carried out into claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party following the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone. It found there was evidence of ""ignorant attitudes"" but that the ""Labour Party is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of racism"".  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was then criticised when its author, Shami Chakrabarti, was nominated to become a Labour peer. Mr Livingstone, who denies accusations of anti-Semitism, is currently suspended from Labour over comments he made about Adolf Hitler and Zionism. A party spokesman said: ""Labour condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest possible terms and our NEC unanimously passed tough new rule changes last week. ""All groupings in the party should treat one another with respect. We will not tolerate anti-Semitism or Holocaust denial."""

Congregants were arriving for prayer early on Saturday when the explosion went off at the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center in a Minneapolis suburb. The FBI are investigating what Mr Dayton called ""a terrible, dastardly, cowardly"" act. They said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device. No one was injured in Saturday's attack at 0500 local time (0900 GMT), but the imam's office was heavily damaged.  As many as 20 people were inside at the time of the explosion.  Mohamed Omar, the executive director of the mosque, told CBS News a member of the congregation saw a truck flee the centre's car park at high speed after the blast. The office's windows were shattered either by an explosive or another object was thrown inside, authorities said.   ""The destruction done to this sacred site is just unthinkable, unforgivable. I hope and pray the perpetrator will be caught and prosecuted to the full extent of the law,"" Mr Dayton said at a news conference outside the mosque, located in Bloomington, Minnesota. He was joined by state Representative Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American legislator in the US, and US Representative Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress.  ""What makes Minnesota unlike no other [state] is how we accept and love members of our community, no matter the religion they practise, the language they speak, or where they come from,"" Mr Ellison said.  He added ""hate is becoming too prevalent in our society"" and that it must be countered ""with love and the values we hold so dear"". The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is offering a $10,000 (£7,700) reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the attack. The organisation has also urged mosques and Islamic centres across the country to increase security in the wake of Saturday's attack.  The Muslim American Society of Minnesota also said it would offer a $10,000 reward for information on the attacker.  A fundraising page created to help pay for costs to repair the mosque raised more than $40,000 as of Monday morning.  An estimated 3.3 million Muslims live in the US, around 1% of the population, according to a recent Pew Research Center report. Minnesota is home to the largest population of Somalis living in the US and the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center largely serves people from the Somali community.  Minnesota authorities reported a record high of 14 anti-Muslim bias incidents in 2016, The Star Tribune reported."

He was working at a paint products firm in the 1940s when he invented the kits.  By the 1950s millions were being sold across the US every year. His inspiration for the idea came from Leonardo da Vinci, who used a similar method when teaching his apprentices how to paint. Mr Robbins first joined Palmer Paint, a company selling children's paint sets, after serving in World War Two.  In a post-war era of increasing leisure time, the company's owner, Max Klein, asked Mr Robbins to find a way to market the paint to adults.  ""I remembered hearing that Leonardo used numbered background patterns for his students and apprentices, and I decided to try something like that,"" Mr Robbins told an audience at the Chicago gallery Intuit in 2004.  He put together an abstract still life, a mix of ""Picasso, some Bracque and some Robbins"". Mr Klein told him he hated the painting but liked the idea of painting by numbers.  The kits, which contained canvasses with printed numbers corresponding to numbered paints, brushes and a palette, originally cost $2.50 (£2). The paintings ranged from landscapes to bullfighters, ballerinas to kittens. The company's most popular work was The Last Supper.  In 2013, Mr Robbins was asked if paint-by-numbers counted as art. ""No, it's only the experience of picking up a brush,"" he said. The aim, he added, was to recreate what a real artist goes through. Sales took off in the 1950s, reaching $20m (£15m) in 1955. But other brands soon caught on to the craze and the market became saturated. By 1957, sales were significantly down and Mr Klein was forced to sell up.  Mr Robbins stayed on when the company was bought out by General Mills, later moving to a Chicago cake decorations manufacturer. He retired in 1973 and started painting on a freelance basis.  A collection of paint-by-number artworks were exhibited at the prestigious Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in 2001."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59753043,French outcry over academic in Islamophobia row,Dozens of academics warn that freedom of expression is at risk after a German professor is suspended.,22 Dec 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Dozens of French academics have warned that freedom of expression is at risk after a German professor was suspended over a row with politics students. Klaus Kinzler has been locked in dispute for months over accusations of Islamophobia at Sciences Po Grenoble.  In a case that has provoked allegations of left-wing cancel culture, the political studies institute has suspended him for ""defamatory remarks"". The institute is now set to lose local funding because of the row. Laurent Wauquiez, the right-wing leader of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, said an annual €100,000 (£85,000) subsidy was being suspended. His decision was widely welcomed by figures on the right of French politics, with just four months to go before a presidential election in which centrist sitting President Emmanuel Macron is leading the opinion polls. But the politics institute said the removal of funding was politically motivated and jeopardised students who struggled to access higher education. Forty people, mostly academics, have now signed an open letter to Higher Education Minister Frédérique Vidal, warning that pluralism in teaching and research is under threat, with teachers and students alike resorting to self-censorship. CANCEL CULTURE: France resists US challenge to its values At the heart of the row is Prof Kinzler, who has been challenged for months by a group of politics students who accused him of fascism and Islamophobia. The professor of German civilisation initially got into an email argument with a colleague over a day of debates on racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. Prof Kinzler reportedly argued that it was not appropriate to equate Islamophobia with racism and anti-Semitism.  A left-wing union accused him of Islamophobia, but the disagreement took on a new lease of life last March when posters were put up on the Grenoble campus that read ""Fascists in our lecture halls. Islamophobia kills"", targeting Prof Kinzler and a colleague. The head of the political studies institute, Sabine Saurugger, said she had repeatedly asked Prof Kinzler not to talk to the media about the row. However, he gave a series of interviews this month, accusing the institute of being a ""political re-education camp"", with a management impotent in the face of a hard core of academics spreading ""wokeism"". Prof Kinzler's lawyers have spoken of a ""witch hunt"", adding that he was forced to speak out after he had been subjected to a political attack. Ms Saurugger told Le Monde newspaper that the management had supported Prof Kinzler when he had come under attack from ""shocking and unacceptable posters"". However, she said it was ""my duty to intervene when the reputation of the institution is targeted, when I hear of 'a political re-education camp'."" She called on Laurent Wauquiez, the regional political head who is also a former Republicans (centre-right) party leader, to visit the university away from the media storm to see the reality of its teaching. However, with next April's presidential elections looming, the row has roused widespread political comment. Far-right candidates have backed the decision to withhold funding. An MP from President Macron's party, François Jolivet, has called for the university to be placed under supervision, while Republicans leader Valérie Pécresse has said she fears freedom of expression is no longer guaranteed there.

Ryan Houghton - a candidate in the Aberdeen North constituency - confirmed his suspension on Monday after The National published the allegations. He has apologised for any hurt caused but insisted the comments were taken out of context. The Scottish Conservatives said the blog comments were ""unacceptable"". Mr Houghton remains a candidate but the Conservatives have withdrawn their support for his campaign while an investigation takes place. The National listed a number of posts, including one where he argued that while there was ""no credible evidence to suggest the Holocaust did not happen"" he went on to say: ""I do find some of the events fabricated."" Mr Houghton was also quoted as saying he did not see how homosexuality was good for the human race. In other alleged comments he said Islam's core teachings had the goal of ""world domination"" and that some Muslims had big families with the aim of creating ""Eurabia"". He released a statement on his Twitter feed, saying the comments were taken ""out of context"" and insisted he had never held anti-Semitic, racist or homophobic views.  Mr Houghton said: ""At the age of 20 on an online forum, I took part in a range of political discussions. These included terrorism, LGBT rights and anti-Semitism."" He said that in one of the threads he had discussed freedom of speech and he had discussed comments made by Holocaust denier David Irving. He said he made clear in subsequent posts that he was not defending the views and strongly opposed Holocaust denial. The candidate added: ""I apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish community in Aberdeen."" A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ""The comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result.  ""The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North.  ""The Scottish Conservatives deplore all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism."" It comes just a week Labour candidate Kate Ramsden quit in Aberdeenshire following a row over anti-Semitism.  She stood down in the Gordon constituency after the Jewish Chronicle highlighted a blog in which she compared Israel to an abused child who becomes an abusive adult. Another Scottish Labour candidate, Frances Hoole, was also been dropped over a social media post attacking her SNP opponent."

A vigil was be held in Cardiff on Friday night to honour the victims of the mosque shootings in New Zealand. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales stood with New Zealand in its ""resistance to the forces of darkness"". The Muslim Council of Wales called on the Welsh Government to develop a ""specific strategy for countering far-right extremism"". Speaking at the vigil, which took place at the Temple of Peace in Cathays Park, Mr Drakeford said the gathering showed the level of ""strength and solidarity"" in Wales towards those affected by the ""awful events"" in New Zealand. He added: ""It is also a message to communities here in Wales, who are fearful that what they have seen elsewhere may give license to people in this part of the world."" Wales rugby captain Alun Wyn Jones, said: ""On behalf of the Welsh Rugby Union players and staff we pass our respects to everyone affected with events that have gone on in New Zealand. ""Obviously there's close links with a lot of our staff and a few players so we would like to extend that."" The Muslim Council of Wales said it was ""shocked and hurt"" by the shootings in ""such an idyllic and quiet place"". It called them a reminder that ""hatred can appear any place and at any time"". The council said religious hate crime had ""rocketed by 40% across England and Wales in just one year, with more than half targeted at Muslims"". In Wales, the council added there had also been a ""resurgence in the activity and organising of far-right groups"". It called on public bodies to adopt the All Party Parliamentary Group definition of Islamophobia ""as steps towards preventing future tragedies such as this from taking place"". South Wales Police said that in common with other UK forces, it would carry out extra patrols on Friday and over the weekend. South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes tweeted that such tragedies sent ""shockwaves across faith communities"", and his force would provide a ""visible presence at our mosques"". Dyfed-Powys Police also said it would step up ""reassurance patrols"" around mosques and increase contacts with communities of all faiths. Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner Jeff Cuthbert said: ""Today we must stand together in solidarity to remember all those who lost their lives in this hateful, abhorrent terrorist attack.  ""We all have a responsibility to teach people that hate abuse is wrong from a young age and stand up against vicious extremism in all its forms."" PC Robert Newton-Miller, of North Wales Police, said the force was placing officers at mosques, and had been in touch with imams. ""I will be attending Friday prayers today to deliver a message to the communities in North Wales in order to promote our support and reassurance during these difficult times,"" said PC Newton-Miller. The Church in Wales said: ""In the face of this kind of hatred, it is more important than ever that we reach out in friendship and solidarity to our neighbours. We pray that God will be close to those most deeply affected, and give courage to all those who may now be fearful of showing their faith.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45096519,Johnson 'won't apologise' for burka comments,The former foreign secretary stands by his remarks despite the Tory chairman telling him to apologise.,8 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Boris Johnson has stood by his remarks about the burka after the Conservative Party chairman told him to apologise. The former foreign secretary has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and comparing them to ""bank robbers"". PM Theresa May has backed calls for Mr Johnson to apologise, saying the remarks have ""clearly caused offence"". But a source close to Mr Johnson said he ""won't be apologising"", adding it was ""ridiculous"" to attack his views. ""We must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues,"" the source added.  ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" Mr Johnson's remarks, in a Daily Telegraph article, have provoked criticism from Muslim groups, some Tory MPs and opposition parties. In the article, Mr Johnson said full-face veils should not be banned but that it was ""ridiculous"" people chose to wear them. However, the founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum said the remarks would harm community relations. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said he agreed with Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt that there had been degree of offence in Mr Johnson's comments, and called on the former London mayor to apologise. By BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca The criticism pitted at Boris Johnson has largely been around the words that he used - ""letter boxes"" and ""bank robbers"" to describe Muslim women wearing face veils.  But Mr Johnson hasn't directly responded to the accusation that it is his language which caused the offence.  Instead, the statement that has come from a source close to him suggests Mr Johnson wants to turn this into a debate about whether or not women should wear the burka at all.  Keeping a high profile is important to Mr Johnson.  He is seen by some in the Conservative Party as a contender for leadership - particularly since his resignation in which he criticised the prime minister's plan for Brexit.  But he risks being seen as weak if he is forced into an apology by the party chairman.  So his refusal to apologise, and an attempt to now put himself on the side of ""liberal values"", could be an example of Mr Johnson trying to save face while maintaining his profile. Former Conservative chairwoman Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet, welcomed Mr Lewis's intervention and called for disciplinary action against Mr Johnson if he did not apologise. She described the remarks as ""offensive and deliberately provocative, but very clever politics"". A debate about the burka should be had ""in a serious way"", she said, rather than ""trying to get airtime and attention on an issue which he knows will resonate with a certain part of the Tory Party"". Shazia Awan-Scully, a Muslim who ran as a Conservative candidate in 2010, said she did not agree with wearing the burka but it was up to women to make up their own minds. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Some women choose to wear it, some women are conditioned to wear it, but it's certainly out of the question for me to tell a woman what to wear."" She added that the language used by Mr Johnson showed he was ""pandering to this Islamophobic attitude bubbling away in the Conservative Party"", which she said she had experienced herself. Conservative backbench MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Johnson had raised an important subject in a ""light-hearted way"". The reaction ""says a lot about internal Conservative Party politics"", he told the BBC. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who supports banning face veils, said Mr Johnson had been ""tactless"".  The 50-year-old said wearing a full-face veil was a ""new phenomenon"" and she didn't consider it a religious right, adding that she would be ""very opposed"" to it becoming normalised in British society.  By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Last year, Zaynab Hussein, a mother from Leicester, was left fighting for her life after a man she didn't know smashed into her with his car - and then ran over her again. She was attacked because she was a Muslim.  Tell Mama, the national organisation that collects anti-Muslim attack statistics, says that the majority of street victims of such abuse and violence are women, for the same reason that Mrs Hussein was singled out: some Muslim women are easily identifiable by their mode of dress - and therefore easy to target.  Seven years ago Baroness Warsi said prejudice against Muslims had passed the ""dinner table test"".  And Mr Johnson's critics regard his ""letter box"" and ""bank robber"" comments as part of the problem the peer defined: normalising prejudice and dehumanising women, rather than calmly debating the complexities of the veil in an open society.  Since Baroness Warsi's warning, there has been the launch of a cross-departmental working group to tackle anti-Muslim hatred.  But it has been criticised as toothless, not least because the government can't agree a definition for Islamophobia.  In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West, and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation""."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55314832,A 'lost baby' in a battle over love and religion,A young Hindu says she miscarried after being separated from her Muslim husband under a new law.,17 Dec 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Reports that a pregnant Hindu woman who was forcibly separated from her Muslim husband and may then have miscarried have highlighted controversies over a new anti-conversion law in India. Earlier this month, a video clip went viral in India. It showed a group of men, with orange scarves draped around their necks, heckling a woman in Moradabad town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. ""It's because of people like you that this law had to be enacted,"" one of the men scolds her. The hecklers were from Bajrang Dal, a hardline Hindu group which supports Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  The law they are talking about is the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance that the state recently brought in to target ""love jihad"" - an Islamophobic term radical Hindu groups use to imply that Muslim men prey on Hindu women to convert them to Islam through marriage. The incident in the video took place on 5 December. The Bajrang Dal activists handed over the 22-year-old woman, her husband and his brother to the police, who then sent her to a government shelter and arrested the men.  Days later, the woman, who was seven weeks pregnant, alleged she suffered a miscarriage while in custody.  Earlier this week, a court allowed her to return to her husband's home after she told the magistrate that she was an adult and had married the Muslim man by choice. Her husband and brother-in-law remain in jail. In media interviews since being released on Monday evening, she has accused the staff at the shelter of mistreating her and said that her initial complaints of stomach pain were ignored. The shelter has denied the allegations. ""When my condition deteriorated, they took me to a hospital [on 11 December]. After a blood test, I was admitted and they gave me injections, after which I started bleeding."" Two days later, she said, she was given more injections. The bleeding increased and her health worsened, leading to the loss of her baby, she says. Whether that is true and what exactly happened in the hospital is still unclear.  On Monday morning, while she was still in detention, the authorities rubbished reports that she had miscarried. The reports were based on interviews with her mother-in-law. The chairperson of the Child Protection Commission, Vishesh Gupta, denied all reports of the miscarriage and went as far as to insist that ""the baby is safe"".  A gynaecologist at the hospital where she was treated told reporters that ""the seven-week-old foetus could be seen in the ultrasound"". However, the doctor added only ""a trans-vaginal test could confirm whether the baby was safe or not"". But the authorities have not yet commented on the allegations she has made since her release. They have also not given her the results of her ultrasound examinations or details of which medicines she was injected with. So, five days after she was first taken to hospital, there's still no clarity on the status of the baby, raising questions and doubts. But reports that the young woman may have had a miscarriage have caused outrage in India, with many taking to social media to blame the authorities for it. In India, interfaith marriages have long attracted censure, with families often opposing such unions.  But the new law, which stipulates that anyone wishing to convert must seek approval from the district authorities, gives the state a direct power over the citizens' right to love and choose a spouse.  It carries a jail term of up to 10 years and offences under it are non-bailable. At least four other BJP-governed states are drafting similar laws against ""love jihad"".  Critics have called the law regressive and offensive and said it would be used as a tool to target interfaith couples, especially liaisons between Hindu women and Muslim men.  A petition has also been filed in the Supreme Court, demanding that it be scrapped. In the short time since it was passed on 29 November, at least half a dozen cases have been reported under the controversial law.  Weddings of interfaith couples, between consenting adults and even those involving parental approval, have been halted and Muslim grooms have been arrested.  The 22-year-old woman says she had converted to Islam and married her Muslim husband in July in Dehradun, a city in the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand. They were intercepted when they came to Moradabad to register their wedding.  ""The biggest problem with a law like this is that it treats interfaith love as a criminal activity,"" says historian Charu Gupta. ""It also refuses to believe that a woman has agency, it disregards her free will. Isn't it a woman's choice who she wants to marry? And even if she wants to convert to another religion, what is the problem? ""This law,"" she says, ""is so wide in its range and scope, and it puts the onus on those charged under it to prove their innocence. And that is very dangerous."""

In his first season after moving from Italian club Roma in 2017, the ""Egyptian King"" was the Premier League's top scorer, and he then went on to help the club become European and English champions. But he's won as many - if not more - plaudits for his persona and conduct off the pitch, helping to change perceptions of elite footballers and break cultural boundaries. His charitable contributions - to education, healthcare and animal rights projects - have won praise and prompted a former football communications officer to remark that he has ""never forgotten his roots"". But it was his act of prostrating in prayer after goals that reverberated in the wider global consciousness, even among those who don't follow football. In 2015, two Liverpool fans performing the ritual Islamic prayer at Anfield were described as a ""disgrace"" by one Twitter user, who received widespread criticism for his comment.  Dr Solava Ibrahim, an Egyptian-British lecturer in international politics at Anglia Ruskin University, describes the then ""dominant discourse"" about Muslims as ""being violent or constantly linked to terrorist attacks or debates around women's subjugation"". So as a long-time Liverpool supporter, she says it was ""a huge wow moment"" when fans started singing that Salah was ""a gift from Allah"" and that ""if he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too"". ""It was showing not just acceptance but his position as a role model - not just for Arabs, Middle East and Africa but also for UK youngsters,"" she adds. Najib Al-Hakimi, who works as a co-ordinator at the Liverpool Arabic Centre said he was ""thrilled"" by the song, ""because people were looking at Muslims as if they were ignorant and terrorists"".  ""But by his actions, he was able to change that,"" he adds. He has since noticed more members of the local Arab community going to Anfield in recent years, adding: ""Most of the youth are wearing his shirt and they'll talk about him, how good he is."" Liverpool fan Neil Atkinson, who writes for The Anfield Wrap, has also noticed that ""there's definitely been an element of shifting"" across Merseyside. ""If people feel that the Muslim faith is other, Salah's actions are significant,"" he says. ""After he prays on the pitch, I love that he'll turn to celebrate with the crowd and he's also celebrating himself, which are good things."" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has previously spoken about how the team incorporate time for Salah to perform religious rituals as part of match preparations.  Club captain Jordan Henderson has also said the team opts for non-alcoholic champagne at trophy presentations, adding: ""Within the dressing rooms there's none of that [intolerance] so why isn't that the case in the outside world?"" Mr Atkinson believes the wider city of Liverpool ""sees itself as quite different to the rest of England because it's a port… it wants to be more outward-looking"". Salah also gets a hero's reception when he is spotted out and about around Liverpool. One young boy famously faced the force of his - literally - unswerving devotion when he ran into a lamppost while chasing Salah's car in 2019.  Louis Fowler bust his nose but was said to be ""made up"" when the player turned back to check on him. Dr Ibrahim says the incident demonstrates Salah's ""human touch and accessibility"". ""He is much more famous than a lot of Nobel Prize winners but he's not seen as someone up in the clouds or in the elite classes, I think that's part of why his messages get through,"" she says. Salah has previously spoken about how women ""deserve more than what [society] give her now"" and has since appeared in a Women's Day promotional video with his eldest daughter Makka, while also asking his wife Magi to accept the Golden Foot award on his behalf last year. ""You need to see the message,"" says Dr Ibrahim.  ""It's not just rhetoric and action - and that's the power. It's subtle and real."" In one of many academic studies of what's now known as the ""Salah effect"", a number of Brits shared their views about how he had ""opened people up to thinking about Islam in a different way"". Prof Grant Jarvie, who co-authored the research for the University of Edinburgh, said: ""We were surprised - not so much about the impact of Mohamed Salah - but with these sort of studies, you normally get a mix of criticism and good things. But generally speaking, people were positive about Salah on and off the field.""  He says the striker demonstrates ""soft power potential"", adding that ""sport can be a good enabler of cultural relations"". The player's impact in reducing Islamophobia - particularly in a city with Britain's oldest mosque - has been described as ""phenomenal"" by Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram, while Time magazine named Salah among the world's 100 most influential people in 2019. It's not been all goals and glory though.  Salah divided public opinion during the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations after suggesting an Egyptian team-mate who apologised for committing sexual harassment should be given a ""second chance"".   Merseyside Police also had to remind him not to use a mobile phone while driving after he was filmed using a device in a car, which was surrounded by fans.   However, Salah's reputation remains relatively untarnished and with that comes a boost for Liverpool as a city.  While the region played a key role during the British Empire and later in culture and sport, its landmarks are becoming an increasingly familiar backdrop for adverts by Salah's international sponsors. In echoes of The Beatles film A Hard Day's Night, a recent one shows him being chased by fans in a Pepsi commercial for Middle Eastern audiences. Mr Atkinson says Salah's contract extension enables the striker to thrive in ""that reflected glory of being Muslim, Arab, Egyptian, all the different parts of his identity - it makes everything brilliant for himself and Liverpool"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45096519,Johnson 'won't apologise' for burka comments,The former foreign secretary stands by his remarks despite the Tory chairman telling him to apologise.,8 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Boris Johnson has stood by his remarks about the burka after the Conservative Party chairman told him to apologise. The former foreign secretary has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and comparing them to ""bank robbers"". PM Theresa May has backed calls for Mr Johnson to apologise, saying the remarks have ""clearly caused offence"". But a source close to Mr Johnson said he ""won't be apologising"", adding it was ""ridiculous"" to attack his views. ""We must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues,"" the source added.  ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" Mr Johnson's remarks, in a Daily Telegraph article, have provoked criticism from Muslim groups, some Tory MPs and opposition parties. In the article, Mr Johnson said full-face veils should not be banned but that it was ""ridiculous"" people chose to wear them. However, the founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum said the remarks would harm community relations. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said he agreed with Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt that there had been degree of offence in Mr Johnson's comments, and called on the former London mayor to apologise. By BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca The criticism pitted at Boris Johnson has largely been around the words that he used - ""letter boxes"" and ""bank robbers"" to describe Muslim women wearing face veils.  But Mr Johnson hasn't directly responded to the accusation that it is his language which caused the offence.  Instead, the statement that has come from a source close to him suggests Mr Johnson wants to turn this into a debate about whether or not women should wear the burka at all.  Keeping a high profile is important to Mr Johnson.  He is seen by some in the Conservative Party as a contender for leadership - particularly since his resignation in which he criticised the prime minister's plan for Brexit.  But he risks being seen as weak if he is forced into an apology by the party chairman.  So his refusal to apologise, and an attempt to now put himself on the side of ""liberal values"", could be an example of Mr Johnson trying to save face while maintaining his profile. Former Conservative chairwoman Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet, welcomed Mr Lewis's intervention and called for disciplinary action against Mr Johnson if he did not apologise. She described the remarks as ""offensive and deliberately provocative, but very clever politics"". A debate about the burka should be had ""in a serious way"", she said, rather than ""trying to get airtime and attention on an issue which he knows will resonate with a certain part of the Tory Party"". Shazia Awan-Scully, a Muslim who ran as a Conservative candidate in 2010, said she did not agree with wearing the burka but it was up to women to make up their own minds. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Some women choose to wear it, some women are conditioned to wear it, but it's certainly out of the question for me to tell a woman what to wear."" She added that the language used by Mr Johnson showed he was ""pandering to this Islamophobic attitude bubbling away in the Conservative Party"", which she said she had experienced herself. Conservative backbench MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Johnson had raised an important subject in a ""light-hearted way"". The reaction ""says a lot about internal Conservative Party politics"", he told the BBC. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who supports banning face veils, said Mr Johnson had been ""tactless"".  The 50-year-old said wearing a full-face veil was a ""new phenomenon"" and she didn't consider it a religious right, adding that she would be ""very opposed"" to it becoming normalised in British society.  By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Last year, Zaynab Hussein, a mother from Leicester, was left fighting for her life after a man she didn't know smashed into her with his car - and then ran over her again. She was attacked because she was a Muslim.  Tell Mama, the national organisation that collects anti-Muslim attack statistics, says that the majority of street victims of such abuse and violence are women, for the same reason that Mrs Hussein was singled out: some Muslim women are easily identifiable by their mode of dress - and therefore easy to target.  Seven years ago Baroness Warsi said prejudice against Muslims had passed the ""dinner table test"".  And Mr Johnson's critics regard his ""letter box"" and ""bank robber"" comments as part of the problem the peer defined: normalising prejudice and dehumanising women, rather than calmly debating the complexities of the veil in an open society.  Since Baroness Warsi's warning, there has been the launch of a cross-departmental working group to tackle anti-Muslim hatred.  But it has been criticised as toothless, not least because the government can't agree a definition for Islamophobia.  In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West, and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation""."

The Conservative Party said it had suspended the membership of Waveney council deputy leader Stephen Ardley and had started an investigation. After the election of Sadiq Khan, Mr Ardley is alleged to have said it was ""unbelievable"" a Muslim was elected London Mayor in a Christian country. Mr Ardley, a former Lowestoft mayor, has yet to comment on the allegations. The Conservative Party said: ""Stephen Ardley has been suspended and an investigation is under way."" Mark Bee, Conservative leader of Waveney District Council, said: ""The allegation was made to Brandon Lewis [MP for Great Yarmouth] regarding Stephen Ardley about comments alleged to have been made on social media two years ago. ""Because of the nature of the allegations Stephen has had to be suspended straightaway from the district council and the county council and from his cabinet positions."" He said he met with Mr Ardley, who is also a Suffolk County councilllor, to tell him the news on Friday afternoon. Mr Bee said Mr Ardley was ""disappointed"" to not be involved with the council at this time but ""recognised the need for it [the complaint] to be properly investigated"". A Muslim Council of Britain spokesman said: ""It is no longer good enough to say that these cases are being investigated.  ""There needs to be an independent inquiry and we continue to hope that the [Conservative] party will heed our call."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-59171107,'I could have been a racist killer',"As a teenager, Mike was an armed and angry US Nazi. Looking back, he fears he came close to murder.",13 Nov 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In his late teens, Mike became a Nazi. Now, only six years later, he is a supporter of Black Lives Matter - and it worries him deeply to think how close he came, at the angriest stage of his life, to going out with his gun and shooting people.  When Mike locked eyes for a brief moment with the man who had just fallen to the ground, he could tell that he was going to die. It was a frantic night in downtown Oakland, California, and the wind was sharp with the sting of tear gas as it whipped palm trees up into a frenzy.  Three days after the murder of George Floyd, protests in support of Black Lives Matter were breaking out across the US. Mike had been protesting with his girlfriend but as night fell and the police started firing rubber bullets and tear gas, they decided to leave. They were walking back to their car, along streets filled with the black smoke of burning rubbish bins, when they saw a white van pull up. Then they heard the gunshots. The van pulled away as a man in uniform slumped to the ground. Mike moved towards him, trying to remember the first aid training he had learned in the military. But a police car arrived and a jittery gun-wielding officer jumped out and ordered Mike to leave. Later he learned that Dave Patrick Underwood, a federal officer who had been guarding the courthouse, had died at the scene. More than a year on, it still haunts Mike that he couldn't do more to save him. By coincidence, Mike had a connection to Underwood; he had been marching that day with members of his family. But he was also connected to the man who was later charged with his murder. Steven Carillo was a sergeant at the same California Air Force base where Mike had enlisted just a few years earlier. And that wasn't all.   Mike had a secret. At home in his wardrobe there was a uniform made of grey-green khaki fabric, with a Nazi symbol on the collar.  Mike kept it hanging there to remind himself of the person he used to be, someone who wanted to go out and kill people.  Like Carillo, Mike had fallen down the rabbit hole of extremism, and become a follower of America's violent far-right. In the summer before Mike's final year at school he watched as the first wave of Black Lives Matter protests rolled out across the US, but taking part was the furthest thing from his mind. ""I thought they were Satan incarnate,"" he says. He had just met a new friend through a messaging group online. Paul (not his real name) invited Mike to visit his home, where he lived with his parents. It was an ordinary house on a quiet cul-de-sac in an upmarket suburb of a major US city. They were meeting to ""shoot some propaganda videos"". Paul opened the door in full Nazi uniform. He took Mike straight to his garage. ""It was just like a clothing store for Nazis,"" Mike says. The walls were lined with weapons - ammunition, cartridges and many guns."" Paul had gathered a few other young men for the shoot. They loaded guns and ammunition into a truck and drove out to some nearby hills. ""We were on a state park firing semi-automatic and automatic weapons, filming and running around in Nazi uniforms,"" Mike says. Then the park rangers appeared. Paul was annoyed. ""He was just kind of standing there and he's not really having any of it. He's not wanting to listen to this government authority telling him that he cannot do what he thinks he's entitled to do, which is make videos and pretend to be the Wehrmacht [the armed forces of Nazi Germany]."" The rangers confiscated all the guns they could see, but the boys had hidden some of them and just loaded them back in the truck once they were alone again. Then they went back to Paul's house and hung out with his parents - still wearing their Nazi uniforms. Mike was 17 and says he had become the perfect vessel for toxic extremism. He had spent his childhood in a small, rural, mostly white town. Days were spent kayaking on the lake or cycling around town with his tight-knit group of friends. Adults and kids would hang out together and dinner parties and barbecues were spontaneous. It was a place where everybody knew everybody. But Mike's stepfather was an alcoholic who could lash out violently, and when Mike was 12 his mother got a divorce and moved with the children to another part of the country. Suddenly Mike was living in a sweltering, multi-racial urban neighbourhood, and he hated it. ""There were people there who didn't look like anything that I had ever seen before, the food was different, the water tasted different, everything just completely different."" They were also much less well off now, and the stepfather - whom Mike had been close to, despite his violent outbursts - never kept a promise to visit the children. All this made Mike angry, and he found an outlet for that anger in the alt-right.  Encouraged by the father of a friend, Mike began listening to right-wing talk show host Sean Hannity, and when he searched for similar content online he found alt-right videos and podcasts on Facebook and YouTube. Social media algorithms were already creating what is known as the rabbit-hole effect - leading him to content that became more and more extreme. Here he was told, for example, that divorce was a Jewish conspiracy meant to destroy the ideal white family. ""For whatever reason, for me that was easier to believe than that my stepdad was a degenerate alcoholic,"" he says. Eventually Mike migrated to the darkest corners of the internet - to white nationalist message boards on 4chan and 8chan. These sites were like a social club for racists, Nazis and white nationalists, where people could say the N-word while getting to know one another, Mike says. He started exchanging messages with a group of neo-Nazis in the San Francisco Bay area and that is how he ended up on Paul's doorstep that summer afternoon. ""I was just looking for a place to put all my anger,"" Mike says. ""And it found a perfect home."" A year later, Mike finished school. When he didn't get into his preferred universities, he said he would join the Navy instead, but his mother was against the idea. They settled on a completely different plan - Mike would go to a business school in London.  In the UK, Mike expected bowler hats and gentlemen - his image of London was like something out of a Victorian novel. The reality was very different. His school was in Whitechapel, an area with a vibrant Muslim community. ""I was an 18-year-old, radical white nationalist deeply fearful, deeply Islamophobic and I arrived in Whitechapel at a flat that was sandwiched between the Royal London Hospital and the East London Mosque,"" he says. ""I definitely didn't see the diversity there as a positive thing, I looked at it as an example of everything that was wrong in the world."" During his time in London, Mike sank deeper and deeper into white nationalism. Most of his activity was online - he digitally stalked and harassed American left-wing celebrities for months with a team of other extremists - though one day he also walked up to a mosque and dropped a packet of bacon on the doorstep.  He stopped going to classes and after a few months he got a letter from the Home Office that his student visa was going to be revoked. One afternoon in April 2017, he was on his way to meet some friends at a pub on Parliament Square. While he was on the train passengers were told that Westminster station had been closed because of a police operation - they had to get off at the station before. A vehicle had mounted the footpath on Westminster Bridge at 70mph and mowed down pedestrians. The driver then got out and stabbed a police officer; six people died, including the attacker, and 50 were injured. Mike emerged from the Tube station to a scene of panic. The sight of two children wrapped in foil blankets handed out by the emergency services is imprinted on his mind. At this stage, IS was still a powerful force in the Middle East. It said it was responsible for the attack, one of a number carried out across Europe while it was at its most influential. Mike tried to sign up to the military the next day. Some of the white nationalists he had been speaking to online were military men and he took his cue from them. He was rejected from the RAF because of his nationality, but within weeks he was back in California enlisting with the USAF. ""I was supercharged, like really supercharged. I mean, there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to go to somebody else's country, whether it be Iraq or Afghanistan, put on a uniform and pick up a gun and kill them."" In the weeks before he began his military training, he spent hours in his garage drinking and chain-smoking cigarettes, full of rage. ""I almost always had a gun with me,"" he says. ""And I was at the point where if somebody had told me to do something, I would have done it."" In that period, he could have become a Steven Carillo, he now fears - though there was another incident later in 2020 where this feeling hit him with particular intensity. A few months after the protests in Oakland, rioting engulfed Kenosha in Wisconsin when a black man was shot in an encounter with police.  A 17-year-old boy called Kyle Rittenhouse joined a vigilante group formed to defend the city from what an organiser called ""evil thugs"". He shot three people with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and is now on trial accused of intentional homicide and recklessly endangering safety. Mike found it hard to read about. ""I look at that young teenager and I'm like, 'Wow, that was really close to being me,'"" he says. In February this year, the Pentagon issued a ""stand down"" against extremism - an order to leaders across the military to address extremism in their troops. At the same time, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin set up a working group to determine how to spot ""insider threats"" and explained that prospective recruits would now be screened for extremist affiliations. These moves came after early analyses of those arrested in the Capitol Hill riots on 6 January suggested a troubling proportion were acting or former servicemen and women - including Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran killed by a police officer as she tried to break through a barricaded door. A 2020 Military Times online poll of 1,108 readers on active duty, found that just under a third had seen signs of racist or white supremacist behaviour within the military.  Among those charged with offences in 2020 - apart from Steve Carillo - were US Army private Ethan Melzer, accused of preparing the ground for a deadly ambush on his unit by sending information to a neo-Nazi group, and three extremist veterans accused of carrying Molotov cocktails to throw at police during a Black Lives Matter protest in Las Vegas. But perhaps surprisingly, for Mike the military would be the start of his journey out of far-right extremism.  In late 2017, he was in the second month of his training, stationed deep in the woods of Missouri. ""I was just stuck in the middle of nowhere with all sorts of people from all over the US - including black guys, Jewish guys, a guy from Guam who taught me how to spear fish,"" he says. ""I was making friends with people who I would never have considered being friends with before."" He found military boot camp difficult. The hours were gruelling and the lack of autonomy - the control that his superiors had over his every move - was hard to deal with. ""It's one thing to be some kid, chain-smoking and reading 4chan and getting riled up in your garage,"" he says. ""To then finding yourself in the middle of nowhere, on an Air Force base that you cannot leave and people are screaming at you."" He was miserable and tried to quit basic training six times in eight weeks. His mother wasn't talking to him - he thinks perhaps she knew he had joined the military for the wrong reasons. Letters were a lifeline for recruits but in the first five weeks Mike received none. When the other trainees had time each week to read their letters, Mike sat alone wallowing in his misery. One day another recruit, who was black, noticed this. ""Hey man,"" he said, picking up a Bible. ""Let's pray together."" It was one of many small gestures that helped Mike to survive basic training and ultimately changed his outlook on life. ""Why are you helping me?"" Mike thought. ""I thought you wanted to destroy me."" Over the next few weeks, this recruit and another young Jewish man would support Mike through his darkest moments, with a friendly pat on the back when he was struggling or a quiet, ""Hey man, you can do this."" During training he was also removed from the echo chamber that had been reinforcing his racist beliefs. He didn't have time to go online and without the toxic propaganda that had filled his days, hate was loosening its grip on him. By the time he emerged from basic training Mike knew he didn't want to be in the military. He spent several months working at an Air Force base, but he was deeply depressed.  He reached his lowest ebb shortly before he was due to be sent to Afghanistan. ""I knew I was being deployed. I was under a lot of stress, [there was] just too much alcohol about one night and access to a firearm."" He came close to killing himself and was put on unpaid medical leave. It's an episode he finds difficult to discuss. Although in his case basic training helped him break away from extremism, Mike doesn't think it's a coincidence that a number of those involved in far-right violence in recent years served in the military. He believes that some extremists may join the military, as he did, eager for an opportunity to kill people of a different race. Others, he suggests, sign up because they think the training will help them overthrow the state, while a third group become disillusioned and radicalised as a result of their experience in the ranks. ""They feel taken advantage of, not understood and lied to,"" he says. One of these is a friend who Mike has seen on social media showing support for an anti-government militia group. ""He served for 16 to 20 years and he's been to two wars - two wars that were about a lie,"" Mike says, referring to Iraq and Afghanistan. Last month the Institute for Strategic Dialogue released a report looking at discussion of the military by far-right extremists on the messaging app Telegram. They found a small number of extremists claimed to be veterans, but they also saw that the military was generally discussed in a negative light. ""This is largely due to the perception that the US's interventions abroad serve Israeli interests rather than those of the white race,"" the report says. Mike also started to believe that America's wars were pointless, but he accepted his racism was pointless too. ""I started kind of realising, about 70 years later than everybody else, that Hitler was clearly wrong,"" he says. As Mike's ideas on race started to change he got in touch with Christian Picciolini, a former neo-Nazi who now channels his energies into deradicalisation. ""He told me to practise empathy, being non-judgmental, being honest, and always being self-reflective - essentially to find a way to make good happen,"" Mike says. He started working at a music venue and became enamoured of the punk rock scene. It was the outlet that he needed for anger he'd built up from his unsettled childhood. Punk became his saviour. ""My punk rock community has been the one of the biggest things in getting me out. I think how vital it is to have an outlet and to have a group where you feel like you belong. But a constructive group,"" he says. After his medical leave ran out, Mike didn't return to the military and was classified as Awol. Then, last December, to his surprise, he was honourably discharged.  Sometimes he worries that extremism still has a grip over him. Towards the end of 2019 a deli that he was working in was robbed by two young black men and an older woman was assaulted, Mike tried to stop them and they pulled out a gun. Later that night Mike recognised the same ugly, dehumanising, racist ideas crowding his thoughts again but he fought against them. ""I've made continual efforts to be anti-racist, to be actively anti-racist. But it is difficult and I don't want to pretend like it isn't."" As he clawed his way out of the extremist rabbit hole, he saw some Americans fall deeper into it. Oakland and Kenosha weren't the only places where Black Lives Matters protesters were injured and Mike was horrified by the attack on Capitol Hill. The US is a loosely bound ""union of otherwise warring clans"", he says. ""And when you decide to drop a match on it, it can get incredibly dangerous. I've already seen a tremendous amount of violence."" Mike wants people to understand how easy it is in America today for extremist ideology to take over someone's life. ""I was a teenager with basic internet access in suburban California, and I became radicalised enough to want to commit acts of violence against people because of the colour of their skin or their religion,"" he says. ""The thing I want people to know is that I was a Nazi. Not in 1939 Bavaria but in modern-day America."" Mike is a pseudonym Just one conversation was enough to recruit Christian Picciolini into the neo-Nazi movement, but it took him years to get out. To make amends for his wrongdoing, he has spent the last quarter of a century persuading hundreds of others to make a break with extremism.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59753043,French outcry over academic in Islamophobia row,Dozens of academics warn that freedom of expression is at risk after a German professor is suspended.,22 Dec 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Dozens of French academics have warned that freedom of expression is at risk after a German professor was suspended over a row with politics students. Klaus Kinzler has been locked in dispute for months over accusations of Islamophobia at Sciences Po Grenoble.  In a case that has provoked allegations of left-wing cancel culture, the political studies institute has suspended him for ""defamatory remarks"". The institute is now set to lose local funding because of the row. Laurent Wauquiez, the right-wing leader of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, said an annual €100,000 (£85,000) subsidy was being suspended. His decision was widely welcomed by figures on the right of French politics, with just four months to go before a presidential election in which centrist sitting President Emmanuel Macron is leading the opinion polls. But the politics institute said the removal of funding was politically motivated and jeopardised students who struggled to access higher education. Forty people, mostly academics, have now signed an open letter to Higher Education Minister Frédérique Vidal, warning that pluralism in teaching and research is under threat, with teachers and students alike resorting to self-censorship. CANCEL CULTURE: France resists US challenge to its values At the heart of the row is Prof Kinzler, who has been challenged for months by a group of politics students who accused him of fascism and Islamophobia. The professor of German civilisation initially got into an email argument with a colleague over a day of debates on racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. Prof Kinzler reportedly argued that it was not appropriate to equate Islamophobia with racism and anti-Semitism.  A left-wing union accused him of Islamophobia, but the disagreement took on a new lease of life last March when posters were put up on the Grenoble campus that read ""Fascists in our lecture halls. Islamophobia kills"", targeting Prof Kinzler and a colleague. The head of the political studies institute, Sabine Saurugger, said she had repeatedly asked Prof Kinzler not to talk to the media about the row. However, he gave a series of interviews this month, accusing the institute of being a ""political re-education camp"", with a management impotent in the face of a hard core of academics spreading ""wokeism"". Prof Kinzler's lawyers have spoken of a ""witch hunt"", adding that he was forced to speak out after he had been subjected to a political attack. Ms Saurugger told Le Monde newspaper that the management had supported Prof Kinzler when he had come under attack from ""shocking and unacceptable posters"". However, she said it was ""my duty to intervene when the reputation of the institution is targeted, when I hear of 'a political re-education camp'."" She called on Laurent Wauquiez, the regional political head who is also a former Republicans (centre-right) party leader, to visit the university away from the media storm to see the reality of its teaching. However, with next April's presidential elections looming, the row has roused widespread political comment. Far-right candidates have backed the decision to withhold funding. An MP from President Macron's party, François Jolivet, has called for the university to be placed under supervision, while Republicans leader Valérie Pécresse has said she fears freedom of expression is no longer guaranteed there.

A vigil was be held in Cardiff on Friday night to honour the victims of the mosque shootings in New Zealand. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales stood with New Zealand in its ""resistance to the forces of darkness"". The Muslim Council of Wales called on the Welsh Government to develop a ""specific strategy for countering far-right extremism"". Speaking at the vigil, which took place at the Temple of Peace in Cathays Park, Mr Drakeford said the gathering showed the level of ""strength and solidarity"" in Wales towards those affected by the ""awful events"" in New Zealand. He added: ""It is also a message to communities here in Wales, who are fearful that what they have seen elsewhere may give license to people in this part of the world."" Wales rugby captain Alun Wyn Jones, said: ""On behalf of the Welsh Rugby Union players and staff we pass our respects to everyone affected with events that have gone on in New Zealand. ""Obviously there's close links with a lot of our staff and a few players so we would like to extend that."" The Muslim Council of Wales said it was ""shocked and hurt"" by the shootings in ""such an idyllic and quiet place"". It called them a reminder that ""hatred can appear any place and at any time"". The council said religious hate crime had ""rocketed by 40% across England and Wales in just one year, with more than half targeted at Muslims"". In Wales, the council added there had also been a ""resurgence in the activity and organising of far-right groups"". It called on public bodies to adopt the All Party Parliamentary Group definition of Islamophobia ""as steps towards preventing future tragedies such as this from taking place"". South Wales Police said that in common with other UK forces, it would carry out extra patrols on Friday and over the weekend. South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes tweeted that such tragedies sent ""shockwaves across faith communities"", and his force would provide a ""visible presence at our mosques"". Dyfed-Powys Police also said it would step up ""reassurance patrols"" around mosques and increase contacts with communities of all faiths. Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner Jeff Cuthbert said: ""Today we must stand together in solidarity to remember all those who lost their lives in this hateful, abhorrent terrorist attack.  ""We all have a responsibility to teach people that hate abuse is wrong from a young age and stand up against vicious extremism in all its forms."" PC Robert Newton-Miller, of North Wales Police, said the force was placing officers at mosques, and had been in touch with imams. ""I will be attending Friday prayers today to deliver a message to the communities in North Wales in order to promote our support and reassurance during these difficult times,"" said PC Newton-Miller. The Church in Wales said: ""In the face of this kind of hatred, it is more important than ever that we reach out in friendship and solidarity to our neighbours. We pray that God will be close to those most deeply affected, and give courage to all those who may now be fearful of showing their faith. The Bishop of St Davids, Joanna Penberthy, added: ""All of us together must condemn violence and stand against hatred and prejudice."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59212355,The US city run by Muslim Americans,"Once a Polish enclave, Hamtramck, Michigan is now the first US city with an all-Muslim government.",16 Nov 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A walk down the main street in Hamtramck, Michigan, feels like a tour around the world. A Polish sausage store and an Eastern European bakery sit alongside a Yemeni department store and a Bengali clothing shop. Church bells ring out along with the Islamic call to prayer.  ""The world in two square miles"" - Hamtramck lives up to its slogan, with around 30 languages spoken within its 5 sq km area. This month, the Midwestern city of 28,000 has reached a milestone. Hamtramck has elected an all-Muslim City Council and a Muslim mayor, becoming the first in the US to have a Muslim-American government. Once faced with discrimination, Muslim residents have become integral to this multicultural city, and now make up more than half its population.  And despite economic challenges and intense cultural debates, residents in Hamtramck from different religious and cultural backgrounds coexist in harmony, making the city a meaningful case study for America's future of rising diversity. But will Hamtramck be an exception or a rule? The arc of Hamtramck's history from beginnings as a town of German settlers to the modern day - it was America's first majority-Muslim city - is etched in its streets.  Storefronts display signs in Arabic and Bengali,  embroidered Bangladeshi garments and Jambiyas, a type of short curved blade from Yemen, are seen in store windows. Muslim residents queue up to buy paczki, a kind of custard-filled Polish doughnut. ""It's not unusual to see some with miniskirts and tattoos and some in burqas walking on the same street. This is all about us,"" said Zlatan Sadikovic, a Bosnian immigrant who owns a café in downtown Hamtramck.  A stone's throw outside central Detroit, which largely envelops the city, Hamtramck was once part of the epicentre of America's automotive industry, dominated by the General Motors plant that straddled its border with 'Motor City'. The first Cadillac Eldorado rolled off the assembly line in Hamtramck in the 1980s. Over the course of the 20th Century, it became known as ""Little Warsaw"", as Polish immigrants flocked in for the blue-collar jobs. The city was one of the stops of Polish-born Pope John Paul II's US tour in 1987. In 1970, as much as 90% of the city was of Polish origin.  However, that decade saw the beginning of the long decline of US car manufacturing, and younger, wealthier Polish Americans began moving to the suburbs. The change made Hamtramck one of Michigan's poorest cities, but the affordability attracted immigrants. Over the last 30 years, Hamtramck transformed again, to become a landing pad for Arab and Asian immigrants, notably those from Yemen and Bangladesh. A significant portion of the city's residents today - 42% - are foreign born. More than half are believed to be practising Muslims. The newly elected government's makeup reflects the changing demographics in Hamtramck. The city council will include two Bengali Americans, three Yemeni Americans and a Polish-American convert to Islam. Winning 68% of the vote, Amer Ghalib will be the first Yemeni-American mayor in the US. ""I feel honoured and proud, but I know it's a big responsibility,"" Mr Ghalib, 41, said. Born in a village in Yemen, he moved to the US when he was 17, first working in a factory making plastic car parts near Hamtramck. He later learned English and received medical training, and now works as a healthcare professional. Rather than being a ""melting pot"" or ""salad bowl"", Hamtramck is more like a ""seven-layer cake"" where different groups retain their distinct cultures while closely co-existing with each other, said city councilmember-elect Amanda Jaczkowski. ""People are still proud of their culture specifically, whereas if it's assimilation, we would lose the uniqueness."" ""When you live this close to each other, you are forced to overcome those differences,"" Ms Jaczkowski, 29, said. But Hamtramck ""is not Disneyland"", said Karen Majewski, the outgoing mayor who will have served in office for 15 years before stepping down. ""It's just a small place. And we do have conflicts."" Friction arose in 2004 following a vote to broadcast the Islamic call to prayer in public. Some residents have argued that a ban on bars near mosques hurts the local economy. Six years ago, when it became the first American city to elect a Muslim-majority government, press from all over the world descended upon Hamtramck. Some media reports at the time painted a picture of a ""tense"" town with an influx of Muslims. A national TV anchor asked whether Ms Majewski was afraid of being mayor.  There was even speculation from some that a Muslim-controlled city council might impose Shariah law. ""In Hamtramck, people roll their eyes at that kind of talk,"" said Ms Majewski.  She was ""gratified"" that Hamtramck has been a welcoming community, she said, and it's ""natural"" for new residents to vote for those who understand their experience and their languages. The US Census Bureau does not collect information about religion, but the Pew Research Center think tank estimates that there were about 3.85 million Muslims living in the US in 2020, making up about 1.1% of the total population. By 2040, Muslims are projected to become the second largest religious group in the US, after Christians. Despite their growing presence, Muslims in America have often been subjected to prejudice.  Twenty years after the 9/11 attack, Islamophobia still haunts Muslims and other Arab Americans. Close to half of Muslim-American adults told Pew in 2016 that they had personally experienced some form of discrimination, when the then-candidate Donald Trump proposed a ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries entering the US. Researchers also found that among all religious groups, Muslims still face the most negative views from the American public.  More than half of Americans say they do not personally know any Muslims, but those who personally know a believer are less likely to think that Islam encourages violence more than other religions.  Hamtramck is a living example of how personal knowledge curtails Islamophobia.  When Shahab Ahmed ran for city councilmember shortly after the 9/11 attack, he faced an uphill battle. ""There were flyers all over the city saying I am the 20th hijacker that didn't make it to the airplanes,"" the Bengali American said. After he lost the election in 2001, Mr Ahmed knocked on neighbours' doors to introduce himself. He was elected two years later, becoming Hamtramck's first Muslim city official. Since then, support for the Muslim community has grown in the city. In 2017, when the Trump administration imposed the entry ban, residents came together to protest. ""In a way it mobilised and unified a lot of people because everybody knows that in order to live in Hamtramck, you have to respect other people,"" said Razi Jafri, co-director of documentary film ""Hamtramck, USA"". Nationally, Muslim Americans have also become more politically visible. In 2007, Minnesotan Democrat Keith Ellison became the first Muslim congressman. The current US Congress has four Muslim members.  On Hamtramck election day this month, dozens of residents gathered in front of a polling station to greet each other, many showing off their Election Day souvenir, the ""I voted"" sticker. Immigrants were excited to participate in democracy, Ms Jaczkowski said. ""It's a very American thing to be able to bring people together"". But as with the rest of the country, intense cultural debates are taking place in the city. In June, when the city government approved flying a gay pride flag in front of the city hall, some residents were incensed. Several pride flags hanging outside of private businesses and homes were torn down, including one outside of a vintage clothing store downtown owned by Ms Majewski. ""That sends a really alarming message to people,"" she said. Marijuana has also become a source of controversy. Three dispensaries opening in Hamtramck have prompted dismay from some in both Muslim and Polish-Catholic communities. Other residents are concerned about a lack of women's political participation in conservative Muslim communities.  On election night, Mr Ghalib, the mayor-elect, was surrounded by a jubilant Yemeni-American crowd in a post-election party serving baklava and kebabs. More than 100 supporters were there, all of them men. Women participated in his campaign, Mr Ghalib said, but segregation of the sexes remains traditional,  even as it is being challenged by younger generations who have become more ""Americanised"", he said.  Hamtramck also faces challenges common to Rust Belt cities, from decayed infrastructure to limited economic opportunity. Heavy rains over the summer overwhelmed the city's sewers and flooded many homes. High levels of lead were found in city drinking water samples, garnering national attention. Nearly half of the city is below the poverty line. These are just some of the pressing issues that the new city leadership would have to grapple with. ""What does democracy look like in a Muslim majority city? Like everywhere else, messy and complicated,"" said the documentary filmmaker Mr Jafri, ""So when the novelty wears off, the work needs to be done."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51596125,Ryanair boss criticised for Muslim profiling claim,"The Ryanair boss says Muslim men should be profiled at airports because ""that is where the threat is"".",22 Feb 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has been criticised for saying Muslim men should be profiled at airports. The chief executive told the Times that ""males of a Muslim persuasion"" who are single and travelling alone pose the largest terror threat to airlines. The Muslim Council of Britain said Mr O'Leary's comments were ""racist and discriminatory"".  Ryanair later said Mr O'Leary was ""only calling for more effective airport security checks"". In the wide-ranging interview, Mr O'Leary, 58, said: ""Who are the bombers? They are going to be single males travelling on their own. If you are travelling with a family of kids, on you go; the chances you are going to blow them all up is zero. ""You can't say stuff, because it's racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion. Thirty years ago it was the Irish. If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat."" The MCB described Mr O'Leary's comments as the ""definition of Islamophobia"" and said Muslims face institutional discrimination in many aspects of life. ""Institutional discrimination against Muslims is well established: whether it is the ability to get a job, buy a flat or even getting car insurance. The challenges of #flyingwhilstMuslim are well documented across the globe,"" a spokesperson said. ""It is a shame that such racism is being expressed so openly, and that the CEO of a large airline would so want to discriminate against his customers so brazenly."" Ryanair said in a statement released on Saturday that ""no call for extra checks on any group or persons was made"" by Mr O'Leary in the Times interview, headlined ""Airline boss wants extra checks on Muslim men"". ""Michael was only calling for more effective airport security checks which would do away with much of the unnecessary queues at airport security today for all passengers,"" a spokesperson said. ""He apologises sincerely for any offence caused to any group by today's inaccurate headline."" Civil liberty groups have argued profiling, including on the basis of race, religion or gender, violates people's rights. One profiling expert previously told the BBC that the benefit of such profiling only outweighs the cost in exceptional circumstances. Airlines in the UK have previously said airport security checks should be reduced to improve the experience for passengers. People arriving and leaving the UK are already profiled by border agencies and police through advanced passenger information, including payment details and passport numbers. Mr O'Leary, who has worked for Ryanair for 30 years, also used the interview to lament planning rules requiring the company to provide facilities for disabled staff and referred to obese passengers as ""monsters"" who ""may need to buy two seats"". And on the introduction of its new Boeing 737 Max planes, Mr O'Leary suggested Ryanair may offer discounts to entice passengers to fly on the crisis-hit aeroplane when it eventually re-enters service. He said the jet - which has been grounded worldwide since March 2019 following two fatal crashes - ""will be the safest, most checked"" plane. He added: ""But we have a customer confidence issue. We will deal with that by hopefully having lower fares onboard the plane while trying it out."" Mr O'Leary told the Independent last year passengers would not get a refund if they refused to fly on a Ryanair 737 Max."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43208945,Is Salah helping Muslim fans engage with football?,Is the success of Premier League players like Mohamed Salah and Mesut Ozil helping Muslim fans engage with football?,1 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Mohamed Salah has scored 23 goals in 27 Premier League games this season Mesut Ozil, Mousa Dembele, Riyad Mahrez, Paul Pogba and Mohamed Salah are among the Muslim players now starring in the Premier League. Their faith can be seen in their mannerisms on the pitch - cupping hands in silent pre-kick-off prayer or prostration after hitting the back of the net.  For Salah, who has 23 Premier League goals for Liverpool this season, his religion has become the unlikely inspiration for some Liverpool fans to rewrite the lyrics to 1996 hit Good Enough by Dodgy. The words of the chorus are adjusted to celebrate the feats of the Egyptian striker: ""If he's good enough for you he's good enough for me, if he scores another few then I'll be Muslim too. If he's good enough for you he's good enough for me, he's sitting in the mosque that's where I wanna be."" A video posted on Twitter with a group of Reds fans performing the song went viral, and tens of thousands of hits later even non-Liverpool fans have put allegiances aside in praise of the video and its lyrics. This video can not be played Mohamed Salah inspires 'I'll be Muslim too' chant In his hometown of Besayoun near Cairo, Salah would have been four years old at the time of the song's original release so it is unlikely that he would have heard it then. The 25-year-old has certainly heard it now. The video has received mainstream media coverage and Liverpool fan and club member Asif Bodi believes it is an exercise in inclusivity. He likes the song's message and is adamant that Salah and the video have had a unifying effect in Liverpool, which was the home of solicitor William Quilliam, the first English Muslim convert to Islam in 1887, and where he opened the UK's first mosque and Islamic centre. Abubakar Bulla (left) and Asif Bodi (right) are ardent Liverpool supporters ""The Mo Salah song shows how tolerant and welcoming the people of Liverpool really are. Historically Liverpool has a reputation of welcoming visitors and also is the site of one of the first mosques in the British Isles,"" said Bodi. ""It's great to see all the positive outpouring of affection towards Mohamed. I would get behind any Liverpool player but I can't hide my pride that Mo is not only a great Liverpool player but he is also a fellow devout Muslim too."" A regular at Anfield, Bodi is part of a large number of Muslims who support Liverpool, and he says Salah's performances and goals have seen that number grow. ""The success of Salah has also led to an increase in the Liverpool fan base in the UK and around the Muslim world. I was pleased to hear of a 10-year-old Manchester United fan who became a Liverpool fan because of the song. That can only be good,"" he adds. This video can not be played Liverpool's Mohamed Salah wins 2017 BBC African Footballer of the Year Like Salah, German World Cup winner Ozil is proud of his religion and happy to show it on the pitch. ""I'm a Muslim, I believe in that. You can see before games that I pray and that I'm pleased to be able to go on this path. It gives me a lot of strength,"" he said. ""I'm someone who's always been thankful, someone who doesn't just wish the best for me but for the people. It's a very important part of my life. What's important is to come together and show respect.""  Like an increasing number of grounds in the Premier League, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium incorporates a multi-faith fans' prayer room. When a prayer time arrives during a match, fans have a place to congregate safely to focus on their faith for the few minutes it takes before returning to their seats. Arsenal's Muslim fans and matchday staff cram into their tiny concourse room to offer their prayers. Mesut Ozil prays before a game between Arsenal and Burnley in January 2017 In September 2016, the new main stand at Anfield was completed and a multi-faith fans' prayer room was included in the redevelopment. This was not only in response to the diverse needs of the Liverpool fan base, but also in response to a previous experience for Bodi and fellow solicitor and Reds' Muslim fan Abubakar Bulla in 2015. Images of both Bodi and Bhula praying at Anfield caused a storm on Twitter with one Liverpool fan tweeting ""Muslims praying at half-time at the match yesterday. #Disgrace.""  Liverpool were swift to distance themselves from that comment and condemned the tweet, as did other Liverpool fans on social media. Looking back, Bodi and Bulla wonder if those fans who had a negative view on their praying are now the same fans cheering loudly as Muslim striker Salah smashes in another goal and breaks another goal-scoring record, all celebrated with an on-field prostration to his faith. ""I now think that the negative Twitter reaction to our praying was the reaction of a very small minority, and the Mo Salah song displays the true feelings of Liverpudlians,"" reflected Bodi, who praised Liverpool's fans' prayer room.  ""This facility has undoubtedly led to a greater number of Muslims attending games. Its success can be judged by the fact that it has been outgrown with many more people wishing to use it than it can accommodate at any specific time."" This video can not be played Football Focus: Mohamed Salah joined Liverpool 'to win titles'  In east London in October 2013, during a game between West Ham and Manchester City, a small group of home Muslim fans - with no prayer room available - tried to offer their Maghrib (sunset) prayer on a concourse under the main stand at the club's former home Upton Park.  Videos later emerged on social media of the group suffering horrific racist and Islamophobic abuse. Spurred into action, and to avoid any future misunderstandings, the club ensured that their new home, London Stadium, would have a multi-faith prayer room. Asian Network Reports: Muslims face racist chants at West Ham Over in the West Midlands, the borough of Sandwell has been described as one of the most deprived areas in Britain. Hard-working white and ethnic minority communities live and work here in a catchment area for West Bromwich Albion.  A stone's throw from The Hawthorns is Oldbury, home to Baggies fan Ashley Rawlins. A season ticket holder, Rawlins embraced Islam in 2012. He likes the Salah video, and is well positioned to empathise with fans' understanding on all sides while saluting the performances of Albion's own Muslim players. Ahmed Hegazi was joined by fellow Egyptian Ali Gabr in January. ""I've been on both sides in regards to the Muslim community and seeing the Mo Salah tribute song from Liverpool fans has been such a positive thing,"" he said. ""It shows that football is bringing people together as you wouldn't have seen something like this a few years ago, especially people singing 'sitting in a mosque is where I wanna be'. ""At my club, we have a similar story with regards to Ahmed Hegazi. He is so well received, his bravery in the games has been inspiring and as a result the fans love him. I have his name on the back of my shirt and he is definitely a conversation starter."" Ahmed Hegazi joined West Brom from Egyptian Premier League side Al Ahly In quick time Rawlins, a manager at the Ministry of Justice who also plays semi-professional football, has achieved a greater knowledge and understanding of Islam than many born into the faith. In his office, the 29-year-old is happy to share his knowledge on Islam when he gets asked questions by his fellow workers.  ""At work, I have regular conversations with my team and there is interest in Islam. They ask many questions which I'm happy to answer. If I don't know the answer, I find out and get back to them,"" he said. Away from the top-flight teams, community based clubs need their local fans to turn up and support their team, and if that club is located in a predominantly Muslim community, Rawlins urges them to also attend matches.  But he warns that if the clubs want them to return they will need to address the additional needs, especially when it comes to matchday catering. ""Muslim fans should definitely go to matches to show the general public that there are so many similarities between us, regardless of faith,"" he says. ""I do, however, feel football clubs with a mixed demographic fan base could do more to address the lack of prayer facilities as this is a fundamental part of our faith and many others.""

Salford councillor Mike Pevitt, who represents the Claremont ward, has since deleted the tweets and apologised.  The Conservative opposition have reported Mr Pevitt, alleging that he breached the council's code of conduct. The North West Labour Party refused to comment. But a spokeswoman did confirm that a formal warning had been issued by the party's National Executive Committee (NEC). Mr Pevitt's tweet read: ""You could make it up, nobody bats an eyelid about 350 mosques writing to the Tories about Islamophobia, but Labour get lead in polls and Tories instruct their members to write in."" He has deleted the tweet and apologised for the comments. But Salford City Council's Conservative opposition has called for a council investigation into the tweet and have written to the authority's monitoring officer. Councillor Jillian Collinson, the party's chief whip who represents Boothstown and Ellenbrook, said: ""The Labour Party can do what it likes, this is a breach of the council's standards. ""It's not good enough - if anyone of our group said something like this we would be in big trouble."" Fellow Conservative councillor Rabbi Arnold Saunders added that relations were good between the Jewish community and the Labour Party in Salford. On Tuesday Labour's NEC adopted an international definition of anti-Semitism following months of acrimony. Rabbi Saunders also said: ""Salford's Labour-led council has already adopted this definition of anti-Semitism."" The Labour Party said it takes all such complaints extremely seriously."

There were 224 complaints of attacks and abuse against Muslims in the month after the bombing, on 22 May, in which 22 people were killed. That compares with 37 in the same period in 2016 - a 505% increase. The spike was temporary and hate crime reports have returned to similar levels as before the attack, police said. Immediately after the attack, at an Ariana Grande concert, a bomb threat, racist taunts, and graffiti were among the incidents reported to Greater Manchester Police. Other types of hate crime also increased with a 61% rise in race-related crimes and incidents, a 41% increase in those targeted at disabled people, and a 9% rise related to sexual orientation, according to police figures. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said the city is proud of its diversity and police ""will not tolerate hatred or discrimination of any kind."" It is ""sadly not unusual for there to be a spike"" in hate crimes after this kind of attack but ""thankfully they do decrease again quickly"", he said. Other areas have also reported an increase in attacks. Earlier this month, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, highlighted a five-fold increase in Islamophobic incidents reported to the Met Police since the London attack. ACC Potts said hate crime is often under-reported, echoing Ch Supt Wasim Chaudhry's recent comments that fear is preventing Muslims from reporting hate crimes. He urged people to contact police, Crimestoppers, or organisations like Tell Mama, which supports victims of Islamophobia."

The ban was imposed at a special council session on Sunday in Sisco amid tensions over the brawl, in which five people were hurt. Authorities in Cannes and Villeneuve-Loubet, on the French Riviera, also banned Islamic burkinis this month. Witnesses say hatchets and harpoons were used in the Sisco beach brawl. The five injured on Saturday were later discharged from hospital, but tensions are simmering in the area.  Tension has grown this summer between local communities and Muslims of North African origin in the south of France, especially following the massacre of 85 people by a lorry driver on the seafront at Nice on 14 July.   Court upholds ban on burkinis in Cannes Burkini ban: What do Muslim women think? The Bastille Day massacre in Nice Corsican nationalists warn jihadists Women's rights minister Laurence Rossignol warned that the debate over burkinis was being used for ""ulterior motives"", especially by the far right. While denouncing the burkini as ""profoundly archaic"", she said that in order to combat such outdated ideas, politicians had to maintain their composure. ""I don't want our society being ignited by these subjects."" A woman in a burkini on a French beach: There is heated debate about such costumes But Sisco Mayor Ange-Pierre Vivoni was adamant his decision was ""nothing to do with racism, it's about protecting people's security"". Corsica was ""sitting on a powder-keg"", he said. The ban, which he had considered for some time, was not against Muslims but aimed at protecting people of North African descent as much as anyone else.  The mayors who imposed burkini bans in Cannes and Villeneuve-Loubet are both in the right-wing Republicans (LR) party, while Mr Vivoni is, like the women's rights minister, a Socialist. On Sunday a crowd of more than 200 Corsicans tried to march on a housing estate - Lupino - on the southern edge of Bastia, but were blocked by police. The Muslim families of North African origin were believed to be from Lupino. There were scuffles with police, and some in the crowd chanted ""This is our home!"", France's Le Monde daily reported (in French), external. Finally the crowd dispersed. The justice authorities have launched an investigation to determine exactly what happened on the beach. Police could be seen holding back protesters in the Lupino area of Bastia on Sunday Witnesses say the brawl began after the Muslim families objected to photos being taken by a tourist. When a local teenager, with a group of friends on the beach, also took a photo the brawl erupted. Stones and bottles were thrown. ""It wasn't the burkini that started the row,"" the mayor told French radio. Soon about 40 men from Sisco arrived to defend the youths, witnesses said, and one of the men was slashed with a harpoon blade. According to Le Figaro newspaper (in French), external, some of the older men in the bathing party had attacked the teenagers with hatchets. Villagers allegedly then set alight cars belonging to the bathers.   France has a deep-rooted tradition of secularism, making the wearing of religious symbols in public spaces controversial. Islamic headscarves are banned from French schools and niqabs (full-face veils) and burkas (full-body veils) cannot be worn in public. The head of Corsica's regional executive, Gilles Simeoni, has appealed for calm. At the end of last month, an outlawed Corsican paramilitary group warned Islamist militants against targeting their island.  Mr Vivoni told France Info radio on Monday that the atmosphere in his community was tense and he appealed for the situation to calm down. ""There's a fear but I assure everyone that the community is well protected and in any case I think here we're 'protected from retaliation', so to speak."" A court in Nice has upheld the Cannes ban but a religious group, Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), has said it will take the case to France's highest administrative court.

As he did so, he filmed the entire crime and live-streamed it directly to Facebook. What ensued was an exhausting race for social media pages to take the footage down, as it was replicated seemingly endlessly and shared widely in the wake of the attack. And through social media, it found its way onto the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. This series of events has, once again, shone a spotlight on how sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Reddit try - and fail - to address far-right extremism on their platforms. As the video continued to spread, other members of the public put up their own posts pleading with people to stop sharing it. One pointed out: ""That is what the terrorist wanted."" The video, which shows a first-person view of the killings, has been widely circulated. While huge numbers of people have been duplicating and sharing the footage online, many others responded with disgust - urging others not only not to share the footage, but not even to watch it. Spreading the video, many said, was what the attacker had wanted people to do. A lot of people were particularly angry at media outlets for publishing the footage.  Channel 4 News anchor Krishnan Guru-Murthy, for example, specifically named two British newspaper websites and accused them of hitting ""a new low in clickbait"". Buzzfeed reporter Mark Di Stefano also wrote that MailOnline had allowed readers to download the attacker's 74-page ""manifesto"" from their news report. The website later removed the document, and released a statement saying it was ""an error"".  Daily Mirror editor Lloyd Embley also tweeted that they had removed the footage, and that publishing it was ""not in line with our policy relating to terrorist propaganda videos"". All of the social media firms have sent heartfelt sympathy to the victims of the mass shootings, reiterating that they act quickly to remove inappropriate content.  Facebook said: ""New Zealand Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the live-stream commenced and we removed both the shooter's Facebook account and the video. ""We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware. We will continue working directly with New Zealand Police as their response and investigation continues."" And in a tweet, YouTube said ""our hearts are broken"", adding it was ""working vigilantly"" to remove any violent footage. In terms of what they have done historically to combat the threat of far-right extremists, the social media companies' approach has been more chequered.  Twitter acted to remove alt-right accounts in December 2017. Previously it has removed and then reinstated the account of Richard Spencer, an American white nationalist who popularised the term ""alternative right"". Facebook, which suspended Mr Spencer's account in April 2018, admitted at the time that it was difficult to distinguish between hate speech and legitimate political speech. This month, YouTube was accused of being either incompetent or irresponsible for its handling of a video promoting the banned Neo-Nazi group, National Action. British MP Yvette Cooper said the video-streaming platform had repeatedly promised to block it, only for it to reappear on the service. Dr Ciaran Gillespie, a political scientist from Surrey University, thinks the problem goes far deeper than a video, shocking as that content has been. ""It is not just a question about broadcasting a massacre live. The social media platforms raced to close that down and there is not much they can do about it being shared because of the nature of the platform, but the bigger question is the stuff that goes before it,"" he said. As a political researcher, he uses YouTube ""a lot"" and says that he is often recommended far-right content. ""There is oceans of this content on YouTube and there is no way of estimating how much. YouTube has dealt well with the threat posed by Islamic radicalisation, because this is seen as clearly not legitimate, but the same pressure does not exist to remove far-right content, even though it poses a similar threat. ""There will be more calls for YouTube to stop promoting racist and far-right channels and content."" His views are echoed by Dr Bharath Ganesh, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""Taking down the video is obviously the right thing to do, but social media sites have allowed far-right organisations a place for discussion and there has been no consistent or integrated approach to dealing with it.  ""There has been a tendency to err on the side of freedom of speech, even when it is obvious that some people are spreading toxic and violent ideologies."" Now social media companies need to ""take the threat posed by these ideologies much more seriously"", he added. ""It may mean creating a special category for right-wing extremism, recognising that it has global reach and global networks."" Neither under-estimate the magnitude of the task, especially as many of the exponents of far-right views are adept at, what Dr Gillespie calls, ""legitimate controversy"". ""People will discuss the threat posed by Islam and acknowledge it is contentious but point out that it is legitimate to discuss,"" he said. These grey areas are going to be extremely difficult for the social media firms to tackle, they say, but after the tragedy unfolding in New Zealand, many believe they must try harder."

Professor David Miller was criticised for views he allegedly expressed while working at the University of Bristol.  He was then sacked in 2021 after a disciplinary hearing found he did not meet its ""standards of behaviour"". Speaking at his tribunal, Prof Miller said he was targeted by groups that ""launched attacks on academic freedom"".  The academic drew controversy during a lecture at the university in 2019, when he said the Zionist movement was one of five pillars driving Islamophobia in the UK, the tribunal heard. The University of Bristol subsequently got a complaint from the Community Security Trust charity, which said his lecture was a ""false, vile... antisemitic slur"". An investigation heard the professor of political sociology's behaviour led to Jewish students ""being subjected to weeks of harassment and abuse"". But a report into academic freedom of expression concluded his comments ""did not constitute unlawful speech"". Giving evidence at an employment tribunal at the Bristol Civil Justice Centre on Tuesday, Prof Miller said Bristol University ""refused to defend me against things it knew to be untrue, things which were very damaging to me"". Asked about abuse directed at the then-president of the Bristol University Jewish Society (JSoc), Edward Isaacs, as a result of his criticism of Prof Miller, the academic denied there was any such backlash. Previously employed as a professor of sociology at the universities of Bath and Strathclyde, Prof Miller told the tribunal JSoc was a ""racist"" group because it supported Zionism. Speaking shortly after his dismissal, the former lecturer said the university ""embarrassed itself"" by ""capitulating to a pressure campaign... overseen and directed by a hostile foreign government"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-41914331,Has the arena attack changed Manchester?,How life has changed for people in the city six months on.,22 Nov 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"It has been six months since 22 people were killed and hundreds more injured in the suicide bombing at Manchester Arena. BBC News talks to people about how the city has changed since the attack.  At the Christmas market in Manchester's Albert Square, shopper Nicola Depetrillo said people were ""defiant"" in the wake of the terror attack on 22 May. ""I think it's the same for everybody now, life's changed for us,"" she said.  ""It will be in the back of your mind all the time and you are more aware of what is around you. But you've got to go about your everyday life. You can't stop going out. ""Why should we stay away? This is our city.""  Charlotte Powell said she recently took part in an event which involved chasing people in the city centre while collecting clues.  She described how one man thought they were running out of fear and began sprinting with them. ""His face was shocked and you could see the fear. He said 'I thought it was another attack' and all we were doing was running down the road,"" she said. ""So people are a bit edgy."" Tibyan Sanoh was on the tram when the attack happened and heard the bang as the bomb exploded in the arena. She said: ""For a couple of weeks it was really scary. But on the whole I feel like everyone's just got back to normal, which is strange. ""When something happens people automatically think it's a terrorist attack. But aside from that I feel Manchester is a hard-faced city anyway, so you just crack on.""  Catherine Jones, from Cheadle Hulme, said on Remembrance Sunday a cannon fired to mark the beginning of the silence made her jump.  ""My immediate reaction was it was a bomb again. You think about it more in the city centre when you're in enclosed shopping centres. I'd rather be out where you can run if it happens again."" She said people were more vigilant and the attack had increased awareness around reporting anything suspicious. ""We wouldn't stop coming in to Manchester because of it [though].  Life has to go on.""   As visitors enjoy German sausages at the markets and sip mulled wine, they are being joined by armed police.  Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham announced officers would for the first time patrol the market to provide the ""reassurance people will want"". Armed officers have also been deployed to Manchester Airport and events such as the Great Manchester Run. Hanouf Alosaimi, who was visiting the market, said: ""If I see armed police, everything is safe and good. When I see police everywhere, everything is secure and I am very happy with it.  ""[I think Manchester in general] is more secure. I feel very, very safe."" ""Security has been massively vamped up,"" says David Adu-Dwumaa  who works in the city centre but lives in Leigh. ""Some people would see it and be paranoid about what could happen, but it can always happen, so I think it's better for [reinforcements] to be there."" However, Caniko Behdjet, from Whitefield, said she felt ""concerned, rather than reassured and protected"" when she saw police with guns. ""As soon as I got off the tram there was something over the loud speaker about keeping your belongings with you or they will be destroyed. It makes you feel a bit uneasy.""  Barriers have also been put up at key locations in the city centre. Councillor Pat Kearney said he had visited the market in Berlin where a lorry ploughed into shoppers and killed 12 people and had ""learned lessons"". ""A year or two ago we wouldn't talk so openly about the security measures. But now I think the public actually want to be reassured that the council and police have thought through the security,"" he added. Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce (GMCC) reported an ""immediate dip"" in tourism and hotel bookings following the attack. But levels of tourism, visitors and conferences are now as ""high as ever"", according to its head of research and policy, Christian Spence. ""This year's festivals and events in the city centre have all been huge successes and the Manchester 'buzz' is very much in evidence,"" he said. Hotel occupancy rates initially ""struggled"" after the attack but showed signs of recovery by August, a report to Manchester City Council's Economy Scrutiny Committee said. Marketing Manchester said hotel occupancy up to the end of September was nudging ahead of the 2016 figures. ""We are confident we will end the year ahead of last year,"" a spokesperson said.  This contrasts with hotel performance data following the terror attack in Paris in November 2015 which left 130 people dead, when ""mixed performance levels were still evident a year later"".   Reports of Islamophobic hate crimes and incidents in Greater Manchester rose by 500% in the month following the attack, police figures showed. They included a bomb threat, racist taunts, and graffiti. After this initial spike, and a high of 1,061 reported incidents, the figures have since dropped but remain slightly above 2016 levels. In October there were 711 incidents of reported hate crime, compared to 564 the previous year.  Greater Manchester Police's Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said events in Manchester and across the UK have had a ""huge impact"" on figures, but one month after the attack levels of hate crime ""returned to similar levels"" as before. He said hate crime was often under-reported and encouraged people to come forward. Firms closest to the arena, which had to be closed for several days in the immediate aftermath of the attack, were offered help by Manchester City Council. Three applied for business rate relief and received support totalling £7,640, while others were contacted for potential support from a hardship scheme. Several businesses responded and identified potential losses totalling about £50,000, the Economy Scrutiny Committee report found. But Mr Spence said that when compared to ""the physical devastation"" of the IRA bombing in 1996, the biggest impact of the recent bombing was ""on those who lost loved ones... those injured... and the psychological impact on people who live and work in the city centre."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40452360,Trump travel ban comes into effect,"Strict visa rules now apply to people from six mainly Muslim countries, as well as all refugees.",30 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"People from six mainly Muslim countries and all refugees now face tougher US entry due to President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban. It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry.  Lawyers took up positions at US airports, offering free advice. But there was no sign of the chaos that affected travellers when the first version of the ban was brought in at a few hours' notice in January. That is because the executive order does not affect people who already have valid visas or green cards. The Department of Homeland Security said it expected ""business as usual at our ports of entry"". Monday's Supreme Court ruling upheld the temporary ban, a key Trump policy. But the judges provided a major exception, for those who have ""a credible claim of a bona fide relationship"" with someone in the US. The effect is that citizens of the affected countries with a close relative in the US, such as a spouse, parent, child or sibling, will potentially be allowed in. In a last minute change, the Trump administration extended the definition of close family to include fiancés. However grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces are not considered to be ""bona fide"" relations. The rules apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, as well as to all refugees. Moments before the ban began at 20:00 Washington time on Thursday (00:00 GMT), it emerged that the state of Hawaii had asked a federal judge for clarification. Hawaii's attorney general has argued that the definition of ""close family"" is too narrow and may improperly prevent people from travelling to the US. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it would be closely monitoring the guidance and implementation of the order. The Supreme Court is expected to make a final decision on the ban when its next session begins in October. According to the new rules, for the next 90 days those from the six countries without a close relationship will not be able to enter the US. IN - a parent, spouse, fiancé, child, son- or daughter-in-law, or sibling, including step- or half-siblings.  OUT - grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, in-laws, extended family and grandchildren. Also exempt from the new rules are those with business or educational ties to the US.  However, the guidelines specifically state that the relationship must be formal, documented and not formed for the purpose of evading the order. As well as making clear that those with valid visas and legal permanent residents are not affected, the Department of Homeland Security says dual nationals who travel on their passport from the unaffected country will also be allowed entry. The Supreme Court also approved a 120-day ban on refugees entering the US, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who cannot prove the same ties to an American individual or entity. But opponents of the ban point out that refugees are invited to relocate in the US by the UN Refugee Agency, which has well-documented relationships with the people they refer for resettlement.  It remains unclear how many refugees scheduled to resettle in the US will be affected, but the government will fully halt the programme once its quota of 50,000 refugees for the budget year ending in September is met.  The US president insisted his ban was necessary for national security and pointed to terrorist attacks in Paris, London, Brussels and Berlin as evidence.  However, critics called the policy un-American and Islamophobic, and said that this ban would not have stopped atrocities in the US perpetrated by American-born attackers. The original ban, released on 27 January, provoked mass protests at American airports.  It included Iraq among nations whose travellers would be barred from the US, and imposed a full ban on refugees from Syria. The president issued a revised version with a narrower scope on 6 March to overcome some of the legal problems. The policy was left in limbo after it was struck down by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland."

Louis Fowler, 11, was trying to get the Liverpool striker's attention, who was driving out of the club's training base on Saturday, when he ran into the post. The Reds fan fell and ""busted his nose"", his stepfather Joe Cooper said.  He added that they were ""gobsmacked"" when Salah soon turned up at their home nearby to check on Louis' condition.

""Unfortunately, Louis went straight into a lamp-post while running after [Salah's] car and busted his nose when he hit the floor,"" he said. Neighbours took Louis and his brother home, only to be followed shortly afterwards by Salah, who had turned back. ""It all happened so quick we hadn't even had the chance to clean him up,"" Mr Cooper said. ""He'd seen one of the boys had hurt himself and he had the decency to drive back into the close to check that he was OK. No-one could believe it. Everyone was gobsmacked.

The young brothers were ""made up"" at meeting their hero Louis was later treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, where he was the ""talk of the hospital"" because of his encounter. Mr Cooper said: ""The face is a bit sore but he is great! He can't stop smiling!"" Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Louis said that he ran into the lamp-post due to the excitement of seeing his idol.  ""I ran with my brother... in my excitement I wasn't focusing on what was in front of me,"" he said.  Louis' brother Isaac, 10, said he ran and ""proper jumped on"" Salah when the star later arrived on their street. ""I was getting carried, and I was like 'Mo!'... I was shouting his name,"" Louis added. And the young fan had one final wish for Salah. ""I love him so much, he's the best and hopefully he scores a hat-trick against Chelsea,"" Louis said. Since joining Liverpool from Roma in 2017, Salah has been praised for his high-scoring performance on the pitch as well as his charitable work off it, including tackling Islamophobia.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42782097,How a mosque shooting showed a community's best and worst,"A year after a gunman killed six during prayers, emotions are still raw in the community.",29 Jan 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A year after a deadly shooting in a Quebec mosque, emotions are still raw among Muslims in the Canadian province.  Mohamed Labidi says there was before 29 January 2017 - and there was after.  ""We were confronted with a new reality,"" says the president of the Quebec City mosque where - on a Sunday evening a year ago - a gunman walked in and opened fire during prayers.  The attack on the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Centre left six dead and 19 injured.  Khaled Belkacemi, 60, Azzedine Soufiane, 57, Abdelkrim Hassane, 41, Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42, Ibrahima Barry, 39, and Aboubaker Thabti, 44, were killed, and 17 children were left without their fathers.  Alexandre Bissonnette, 28, is due to stand trial in March on six counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder.   Labidi says the mosque still receives hateful letters. In August, his car was deliberately torched outside his home.  After that arson, members of the mosque decided to avoid speaking regularly with the media.  ""At some point we said we need to lower the temperature, to step away,"" says Labidi. ""It was possible that people who didn't like us, that it was sparking their rage.""  In the days after the shooting, the mosque opened its doors wide to the world, inviting the media in to tour the grim aftermath of the carnage.  Labidi says they did so to show a violent shooting ""did indeed take place in the heart of the mosque, in the place of prayer"".  ""There were even people killed in the place where they were praying. They didn't have the time to run or hide."" ""It was also to show there's nothing to hide in a mosque,"" he says. ""It's just a place for prayer to what we believe is the creator of the world.""  In the wake of the shooting, Quebec politicians offered messages of tolerance and unity, and spoke about the need to tone down the divisive rhetoric that had sometimes permeated the long simmering debate in the province on religious freedoms and accommodation. ""When I say words matter, it means words can hurt, words can be knives,"" said Premier Philippe Couillard.  ""If we start presenting a foreigner as a threat, a challenge to our identity, something we should steer clear of, that does not advance the idea that we need to try and live together in an inclusive Quebec.""  But Hassan Guillet, an imam who gave the eulogy at the funeral of three of the victims, worries the provincial election this autumn means Quebec might return to what he has called a poisoned atmosphere.  As he took stock of the past year, Guillet says he's been concerned by a number of events.  There was the heated referendum over a proposal for a Muslim-run cemetery in the nearby small town of Saint-Apollinaire. A slashed Koran was sent to the Quebec City mosque in July, days before the vote.  Then there was a baseless news story on a Quebec broadcaster suggesting two Montreal mosques were trying to prevent women from working on a nearby construction site.  The story spread widely in the province, sparking outrage before the mosques denied the allegations and it was debunked. The broadcaster apologised, saying people they interviewed for the report later changed their stories.  And by the end of 2017, the number of police-reported hate crimes targeting Muslims in Quebec City had doubled from the year before. Guillet was also critical of the rejection by most political parties in Quebec of a proposal to mark 29 January as a national day of remembrance and action on Islamophobia.  ""Alexandre Bissonnette was not created in a vacuum,"" says the imam of the alleged gunman, who he has also called a victim - to some criticism from Muslims. Guillet says a debate around state secularism in the run-up to the 2014 provincial election focused a lot of attention on Muslims in Quebec.  The government, then run by Parti Quebecois (PQ), proposed barring the wearing of overt religious symbols or clothing like turbans or hijabs for public employees, and required people to uncover their face when receiving a government service.  While the PQ lost the election to the Liberals, the ensuing discussion - which carried over to the 2015 federal election - has been blamed for fuelling anti-Islamic sentiment in the Canadian province.  ""Everything - unemployment, education, equality of men and women - everything was put under the carpet and the whole debate was about the place of religion in society and the place of Muslims in society,"" Guillet says.  In October, Quebec moved ahead with a religious neutrality law that banned face coverings like the niqab when a person is giving or receiving a public service.  Opponents said it unfairly targeted the handful of Muslim women in the province who cover their faces. It's currently being challenged in court, and a judge suspended the ban in December.  Tariq Syed, who recently released a documentary on the shooting's aftermath, Your Last Walk In The Mosque, says the massacre has pulled the community closer to each other and to the broader Quebec City society.  ""They are more engaged with the society in general now - talking to the interfaith groups, participating, explaining who they are, about Islam, about the faith,"" he says.  Quebecers showed a heartfelt outpouring of support for the Muslim community in the days following the massacre. Thousands attended an emotional vigil the night after the shooting, and thousands more attended the public Montreal services for some of the victims.  Canadians opened their wallets and donated over C$400,000 ($325,000; £228,000) to the families of the victims.  Money is also pouring in to help buy a home adapted to the needs of a paralysed victim, Aymen Derbali, who was hit as he attempted to save lives.  Guillet calls the shooting ""a weight on our conscience"".  ""We are Francophone and Anglophone but we are human beings,"" he says of the emotional response following the massacre.   ""We are fathers, we are mothers.  ""I don't think anybody likes to see his neighbour killed in such a savage way."" And despite his concerns, he has since seen a ""light of hope"" that ""decent people in society started to raise the flag"" in the community's support.  Worshippers at the Quebec City mosque have experienced the best and the worst of humanity since 29 January.  ""The majority of people are of the first kind - that's to say they have sympathy, love, and so on,"" Labidi says.  ""But there is a minority that holds on to hate.""  The mosque will hold several days of events to mark the anniversary, including a prayer service, the screening of Syed's documentary, and a vigil. The commemorations will also pay tribute to acts of solidarity that followed the tragedy.  ""We should not let pessimism stop us from dreaming and hoping and working to improve society and our lives,"" says Guillet."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45112792,Why some Muslim women wear the veil,"The differences between a hijab, niqab and burka - and why some women wear them while others don't.",8 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and for comparing them to ""bank robbers"" - prompting calls for him to apologise and be expelled from the Conservative Party. But Mr Johnson's comments, which some believe will aggravate Islamophobic tensions in the UK, have also highlighted some confusion about what a burka is - as the veil revealing just the eyes is, in fact, known as a niqab. So what actually are the differences between the various types of Islamic dress for women and what governs their choices?  The Koran, Islam's holy book, tells Muslims - men and women - to dress modestly. Male modesty has been interpreted to be covering the area from the navel to the knee. For women it is generally seen as covering everything except their face, hands and feet when in the presence of men they are not related or married to. However, there has been much debate within Islam as to whether this goes far enough. This has led to a distinction between the hijab (literally ""covering up"" in Arabic) and the niqab (meaning ""full veil""). The hijab is typically a scarf that covers the hair and neck, whereas the niqab is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf or an abaya, a full-length robe, and sometimes with a separate transparent eye veil.  The burka is the most concealing - covering the entire face and body, leaving just a mesh screen to see through. UK mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, says it's ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments show a ""lack of knowledge"". The ""majority of the women who wear the burka"" she says, are born and brought up in Britain. They are ""educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters none of whom wear a burka. ""I haven't forced my daughters into it because I don't have to,"" she said. ""It's not a must. It's not an obligation. However... [it] gets you closer to God. It's a spiritual thing more than anything else."" She is ""not under an obligation"" to cover her face but does so because it is ""emulating"" the Prophet Muhammad. So, how does she respond if asked to remove her covering for security reasons? ""I'm happy to take my veil off,"" she said, citing the example of being asked to at a bank. ""When I travel, and I do travel, sometimes I don't even wear [it] because I think it's a lot easier not to [for] security reasons. ""To make comments that they (women who wear burkas) look like bank robbers, I don't think it's fair."" Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, wears the niqab but told BBC News she sometimes gets verbal abuse from others for her choice of veil. ""A week ago someone abused me and said 'you're an ugly terrorist' when I tried to park my car near where I live,"" she said. ""Two years ago, when I was passing by one department to another at Heath Hospital, someone passed by and said 'don't cut off my head you're ISIS'. It's quite painful [to hear]."" In 2014, BBC News' Shaimaa Khalil wrote about why she stopped wearing her headscarf, only to put it back on again when she became the Pakistan correspondent. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who lives in New York, does not wear a face veil and supports a ban on them. She said the number of women wearing them in the West is increasing in part because girls begin to wear them before they reach puberty and many were not given a choice.    Muslim scholars have long debated whether it is obligatory to wear the burka or niqab, or whether it is just recommended. There have also been more liberal interpretations which say any headscarf is unnecessary, as long as women maintain the sartorial modesty stipulated in the Koran. That holy text addresses ""the faithful women"" who are told to shield their private parts and not to display their adornment ""except what is apparent of it"". Scholarly disputes revolve around what this last phrase means. Does it refer to the outer surface of a woman's garments, necessitating that she cover every part of her body - ie don the full niqab? Or does it give an exemption referring to the face and the hands, as well as conventional female ornaments such as kohl, rings, bracelets and make-up? The latter interpretation has been adopted by some of the most prominent scholars from Islamic history who favour the hijab - headscarf - option. There are additional Koranic instructions - seen as ambiguous and therefore much debated - for women to draw the ""khimar"" (scarf) to cover the ""jayb"" (bosom/upper chest), and for ""the wives and daughters of the Prophet and the women of the believers to draw their ""jalabib"" (cloaks) close round them"". When contacted by BBC Reality Check, both the Women's Muslim Council and Faith Matters (an organisation which promotes integration) said accurate numbers weren't available for the UK.  But there does seem to be consensus that the figure is likely to be low.  Dr Omar Khan, director at the Runnymede Trust, a think tank that deals with race equality, said that it is likely to be ""less than 1% [of the Muslim female population] - how much less is difficult to know"". Sunder Katwala, director of think tank British Future, acknowledged a lack of a ""robust methodology"", but said there was a ""ballpark estimate in region of 3,000-5,000"" with it ""very unlikely to be as high as 1-2%"" of the female Muslim population.  These are both estimates by experts working in relevant fields, but until specific research is carried out, it will be difficult to know how prevalent the full-face veil is.  What we do know is that in the 2011 census, Muslims represented 4.8% of the population of England and Wales.  Using the most recent population estimates, this would mean there are roughly 1.43 million Muslim women living in the two nations.  If the number of Muslim women wearing the niqab were to be as high as 1% - this would equate to just over 14,000 women - but, again, the 1% figure is just an estimate.  In other European countries, the figure also appears to be low. In 2009, a French Interior Ministry report estimated that just 0.1% of French Muslim women wore full-face veils which, at the time, equated to 1,900 women.  In Austria, a ban of full face veils in public spaces was said to affect just 0.03% of the Muslim population, according to Nilufar Ahmed, a senior lecturer in public health at Swansea University.  In Belgium between 150 and 200 women wore the niqab before a ban came into force, says Michael Privot, director of the European Network Against Racism.  Between 150 and 200 women in Demark - which banned face veils in public this month - wore a niqab or burqa on a daily basis.  That's 0.1% of Muslim women in the country, according to the Guardian. While Boris Johnson's comments about Islamic face veils have provoked consternation among some, his defenders have said they were made as part of an argument against banning such garments. Other countries though, have taken this step. France was the first European country to ban full-face veils - ie burkas and niqabs - in public places in April 2011, seven years after it introduced a law prohibiting conspicuous religious symbols in state schools. It was followed a few months later by Belgium, which banned the wearing of partial or total face veils in public on the grounds of security. Full or partial bans on full-face veils have since been in place in Austria, Bulgaria, the southern German state of Bavaria and, since 1 August, Denmark. There have been protests against Denmark's new law, which does not mention burkas and niqabs by name, but says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"". Repeat offenders could be fined 10,000 ($1,500; £1,200) kroner. By contrast, in Iran the law requires women to wear modest ""Islamic"" clothing. In practice, this means women must wear a chador, a full-body cloak, or a headscarf and a manteau (overcoat) that covers their arms. There are posters in cities and towns comparing unveiled women to unwrapped candy and lollipops attracting unwanted attention from flies. Recently, some Iranian women have protested against this law by taking off their headscarf in public. One woman was jailed for two years in March for doing this."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43103888,Leonard: Equal pay women 'owed apology',"The Scottish Labour leader says there was ""too much resistance"" to the council workers' equal pay claims.",18 Feb 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Scottish Labour leader has said women in Glasgow City Council are owed an apology for ""too much resistance"" to their equal pay claims when the local authority was under Labour control. Richard Leonard said Labour settled many equal pay claims but there was ""too much legal obstruction"". The party was in power in the city for decades before being ousted by the SNP last May. He was speaking to the party's Women's Conference in Glasgow. The council dropped its legal challenge in January with cross-party agreement.  It had previously lost a Court of Session appeal against an Employment Appeal Tribunal ruling that they had continued to discriminate against women through the introduction of payment protections upholding the earnings of male colleagues following the initial wave of equal pay awards. Unison said the women want a fair and transparent pay scheme and compensation and that the council has agreed to discuss a settlement for the 11,000 claimants with it and other trade unions. Mr Leonard said: ""I am pleased that we are now on the right side of the argument with equal pay in Glasgow City Council. ""Many equal pay claims were settled under Labour in Glasgow, but there was too much resistance, too much legal obstruction and for that I think we owe those women an apology."" He emphasised plans to tackle discrimination and harassment within Scottish Labour and wider society in the wake of the sexual harassment scandals at Westminster and Holyrood. His focus on discrimination follows his leadership rival and fellow MSP Anas Sarwar speaking out about his own experiences of abuse and criticism of Mr Leonard's decision not to suspend MP Hugh Gaffney, who apologised earlier this month after making ""deeply offensive and unacceptable"" remarks about the LGBT community and Chinese people. Scottish Labour has announced plans to set-up a special sub-committee of the party's Scottish executive to develop an anti-discrimination and harassment policy. Mr Leonard said: ""Over the past few months the culture of politics, particularly in relation to gender equality, has rightly come under the spotlight. ""Politicians - including some in the Labour party - have been found to engage in behaviour, that falls well below the standards we in this room, and in this party and in this movement, expect and deserve. ""There has, once again, been a breakdown of trust between politicians and those they hope to serve. So my job, our job is to work to rebuild that trust. ""We will work to ensure women across Scotland know that the Labour Party stands up for them. We will work to end discrimination both within the party and without."" He added: ""Scottish Labour, under my leadership, will be at the forefront of the drive for equality."" Mr Leonard said he had already taken steps to make the party more equal, adding: ""That action comes from the one driving principle - that there is no place for any form of discrimination in the Labour Party, be it sexism, be it homophobia, be it racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50398826,Tories suspend members over Islamophobia claims,The party takes action after the Guardian newspaper hands it a dossier of allegations.,13 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservatives have suspended a number of members over claims of Islamophobic social media posts. The Guardian says it has seen details of racist content posted, shared or endorsed by 25 sitting and ex-Tory councillors. The Conservatives say they take ""swift action... on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of any kind"".  But in a tweet Labour accused the party of ""showing their true colours"". The Guardian says it handed a dossier containing the allegations, produced by an anonymous Twitter user, to the Conservative Party. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove reiterated the party's pledge to hold an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party, and promised it would start before the end of the year.  A Conservative spokesperson said the individuals named in the dossier had been ""suspended immediately, pending investigation"".  ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind.  ""That's why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to stamp them out as and when they occur."" It is understood not all the names provided in the dossier are members of the Conservative Party, but the party was unable to say how many members had been suspended. Responding to the disclosures, the Muslim Council of Britain said Islamophobia was ""endemic"" in the Conservative Party. It comes as the Conservative Party faces calls to hold an independent inquiry into Islamophobia following incidents highlighted to the party and in the media. Earlier this year a number of Conservative Party members were suspended, after the BBC highlighted 20 cases to the party of members posting or endorsing Islamophobic material online."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47650948,The lives lost and the world they revealed,"From optimistic refugees to a couple deeply in love, Christchurch was meant to be safe for a new start.",22 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The life stories of the Christchurch mosque victims are a striking reflection of a world in turmoil - one marked by war, poverty and economic inequality. In New Zealand, many thought they had found a safe, remote corner of Earth on which to build new lives. That changed last Friday at 13:40 when a gunman casually opened fire.  ""I was so happy that I had a beautiful country to raise my kids in,"" says Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed, a survivor of those attacks. ""This really hurts me.""  In the week since 50 lives were abruptly taken, Christchurch has come together with powerful messages of unity. For many here, this has opened their eyes to a diverse and complex community they previously gave little attention. But it is also a reminder of how easy it is for hatred to proliferate and then explode - and a closer look at the stories of those who attended the mosques last Friday is also a stark portrait of just how fragile their worlds had always been.   Khaled Mustafa, 44, and his son Hamza, 16, were refugees. They had escaped the war in Syria along with three other family members.  The family had spent time in Jordan at first, before they were accepted under New Zealand's refugee resettlement programme.  They naturally assumed New Zealand was a safe place and had been there for less than a year when they were killed at the Al Noor mosque on Deans Avenue, the site of the first of the two attacks.  Abo Ali, a Syrian man who moved to New Zealand in 1990, says he met the family just once but they were ""so happy to have a better life"". ""They run away from the death, and they die here,"" Mr Ali tells the BBC. Hamza's younger brother, Zaid, was also at the mosque. He survived, but was injured. He attended the funeral of his father and brother on Wednesday in a wheelchair, after surgery. ""I shouldn't be standing in front of you. I should be lying beside you,"" he was reportedly heard muttering at their graveside. Mr Ali says the news hit the local Syrian and Muslim communities hard.   ""But after, when we see the New Zealand people's support, and when we see the Christian people in New Zealand too, their support - believe me, we forget about our problem.""  In many ways, 24-year-old Ansi Alibava's path to New Zealand was an unlikely one.  She was born in Kerala, India, and not into a wealthy family. After her father died in Saudi Arabia, where he had been working, she began looking after the family, aged just 18.  Her husband Abdul Nazer says that when they first met, he was struck by how she was ""supporting everything"".  The couple had migrated from India a year ago to pursue her dream of studying and travelling overseas. It had been his dream to make hers a reality, he said.  It was only when his father agreed to pledge his house for a loan that the pair were able to get to New Zealand. It was the first time either had even been outside of Kerala. After securing jobs in Christchurch they had been supporting both families at home.  Mr Nazer can only manage a few words as he describes the bliss they shared in New Zealand.  She loved her studies, he says, sitting in a room at Christchurch's Lincoln University where she was working towards a masters degree in agricultural engineering. She had recently begun an internship.  He had just been telling his cousin Fahad Ismail Ponnath, who was there to support him, how the campus brought back so many ""lovely memories"" - rooms they had been in together, places they had walked.  But last Friday the couple went to the Al Noor mosque as usual, going their own ways into the male and female areas.  When the gunfire erupted, Mr Nazer fled the building and leapt over a fence into a nearby property. The owner of that house initially didn't let him in ""thinking that he was one of the terrorists maybe,"" Mr Ponnath says.  But he soon left the safety of that house to look for his wife, and he found her lying motionless on a street. As he moved towards her, calling out, other survivors intervened to tell him she had died. Soon the police were there, moving everyone, including her husband, away.    In limited English, Mr Nazer, 34, says of his wife: ""She's a really lovely person. Very kindly."" ""She loved all people,"" he says. ""Cousins, friends. She kept a big space in her mind [for] family members. Especially my father and my mother, my brothers."" Mr Nazer doesn't know for sure whether he'll remain in New Zealand, but it is likely, as he is now committed to supporting Ms Alibava's family - they have no breadwinners left.  On Wednesday, flowers and tributes were starting to pile up outside Mohammed Imran Khan's takeaway shop, Indian Grill. Mr Khan, also known among friends as Imran Bhai, died in the Linwood mosque.  Originally from India, he was an immensely popular figure in Christchurch. ""It's just been an absolutely overwhelming [amount] of texts and messages or communications from people I don't even know - just saying what a lovely man he was,"" his wife Tracey says. ""I knew that people loved him, not so much to this extent, I think. He was a very known man throughout the community for just his heart and giving of time and everything else."" She is focused on looking after their teenage son, as well as her husband's relatives.  ""It's very difficult being over the other side of the world and hearing this, and not having information,"" she says, with relatives arriving from around the world. Having spent much of his life in his native India and then Saudi Arabia, Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed says he ""couldn't comprehend"" how safe and inclusive New Zealand was when he arrived.  He used to tell his friends overseas: ""You're scared to death to go to airports. Here, we love the airport. It's like fun - we enjoy it, it's like a pleasure trip for us. Because this country's safe."" Mr Syed Ahmed says the Linwood mosque was home to a small and close community.  ""We really love to go on Friday and we were praying,"" he says, emphasising the final word. He cannot believe what happened to him and his friends in the country he regards as the greatest on Earth. Mr Syed Ahmed says he froze when he heard three gunshots interrupting Friday prayers.   People continued briefly to pray but his ears ""were completely focused - there is something happening"". Then, he says, one man started yelling: ""Take cover, take cover - move, move, move."" Despite hearing shots, he ran straight towards the main door - he doesn't know why - and took cover in a storage space next to door when the gunman came in. He believes he was saved by another worshipper, Abdul Aziz, who took on the attacker by hurling a credit card machine at him. ""But that time, I saw my friend right in my line of sight,"" Mr Syed Ahmed says. ""[A] big splash of blood was on the wall - I could see that he had died there.""  The dozens of victims largely began their lives outside New Zealand, in South Asia and the Middle East, in Somalia or Fiji, Malaysia and Indonesia. Linda Armstrong, 64, was a New Zealander but her life had been far from conventional, her nephew Kyron Gosse says. At one point, as ""a bit of a hippy"", she had lived on Waiheke Island near her home city of Auckland ""in this little hut in the middle of the bush with only a long drop [toilet] and no shower"", he says. At other times, she had settled in lofts and granny flats, ridden a motorbike, and travelled extensively - once living in Berlin.   Always curious, she found Islam in 2011 while volunteering in a refugee centre in Auckland and talking to people there.  ""She'd want to know - why? What do you believe?"" Mr Gosse says. ""And as she found out more and more about Islam, she told me: 'These are really beautiful people and this religion really resonates with me'."" He describes his aunt as ""a kind of outrageous character"" who had always been rebellious and a bit stubborn.  She brought her stubbornness to the mosque. Following one conversation with a younger relative, she took issue with the plastic waste being generated there - so she went out and bought everyone reusable plates.  She rarely had much money but was endlessly generous. Despite living on welfare payments, she began donating NZ$50 (£25; $34) per month to a refugee family from Syria. ""She never met them, she just heard about it and thought: what can I do?"" Mr Gosse says. Ms Armstrong ""wasn't in the best of health"", so she was seated at the back of the mosque when the violence came. That didn't stop her moving quickly to protect others.  ""She put herself in front of one of her friends, took the bullet, and then died in her arms with the imam saying a prayer over her,"" Mr Gosse tells the BBC. ""We're all pretty proud that that was the sort of person she was."" Across Christchurch this week, locals have been comparing the collective trauma to an earthquake that struck the city in 2011, killing 185 people.  It is, many say, a similar pain although they are fully aware that this particular pain has been inflicted by a person, and on a specific community. After an earthquake, a city can rebuild - a physical healing of its wounds.  One victim, Zakaria Bhuiya was part of that process. He had moved to Christchurch from Bangladesh to work on the post-quake rebuild, according to the Indian Social and Cultural Club.  Mr Bhuiya, a welder, had taken annual leave on Friday to celebrate his 33rd birthday with friends at the Al Noor mosque. ""He lived on the bare basics in order to maximise the money he could send home to support his family,"" his employer AMT Mechanical said. He leaves behind a wife in Bangladesh, Rina Akter.  He had no family in Christchurch, but in the days it took officials to identify his body, the friends he had made staged a small protest outside the mosque.  ""Our brother is missing, give us some information,"" read one sign.  At times in this city of about 400,000 people it feels like everyone knew a victim, or knows someone who did. Peter Higgins, 67, says cardiologist Amjad Hamid had convinced him to retire following ""a heart attack"" and subsequent complications.   ""That bloke really turned my life around,"" he says of Dr Hamid, a 57-year-old Palestinian who migrated decades ago. ""He got shot. And I think, how many people has he saved? And someone decides to play out with a gun."" The tragedy has made many think more deeply about the Muslim community here.   Clare Needham, 72, says Daoud Nabi - the first of the dead to be identified - would turn up frequently to a charity shop where she volunteered, and would haggle over items.  Mr Nabi, 70, told her of his deep love for his grandson. It was only this week that she learned the kind of profile he had within the community. Born in Afghanistan but a long-time New Zealand resident, he was president of a local Afghan association and a known supporter of other migrant groups. One visitor to the tributes, Dave Palmer, was struck by the tolerance of Farid Ahmed, whose wife was killed in the attack, yet who told reporters he had forgiven the shooter. ""I thought: I don't know whether I could ever do that,"" says Mr Palmer, a Christian. ""That takes an amazing amount of strength and courage."" The kind of tolerance personified by Farid Ahmed and Linda Armstrong stands in stark contrast to the gunman and the online communities through which material allegedly posted by him spread.  Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. The gunman live-streamed the massacre on Facebook and a person suspected to be him posted a 65,000-word document online, outlining the alleged reasons for the attacks.  As many have pointed out since, it was littered with coded references that sought to engage specific online communities. It was posted on 8chan - a forum favoured by the alt-right. It showed just how easy it is for intolerance and hate to ignite in such forums, unlike in the wider community, where tolerance is patiently built up over time.  Ultimately, it took just one man and 17 minutes - in the case of the Al Noor attack - to shatter dozens of carefully built, second-chance lives.  Questions have been raised since the attacks about whether forums should be better monitored for evidence of extremism, but experts say this would be challenging for a few reasons - not least the sheer volume of posts. ""We told them our fears about the rise of the alt-right. And the government has not responded adequately,"" says Anjum Rahman, of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, who says she has been pleading with successive governments to address discrimination. Ms Rahman is also sharply critical of the media. ""Where were you?"" she says, arguing there was not enough scrutiny globally. Paul Hunt, New Zealand's chief human rights commissioner, says it has one of the world's best human rights records although it does see Islamophobia, racism and hate crimes in ""some sectors of society"". But if the gunman - whose name Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has sworn she will never speak - had wanted to tear New Zealand apart, judging from the past week he has failed.  On Thursday, the prime minister announced a wide-ranging crackdown on New Zealand's gun laws - including banning all the types of weapons used in the attacks. Unlike after attacks in the US, for example, it's been almost universally well-received - some people had begun turning in their guns before the ban was even announced.  Again and again, locals say they are determined to pull together and ensure this tragedy is not repeated. ""I'm trying to process grief but also anger: how dare he do this to us?"" says Cara Butler, 38. ""But I think he's picked the wrong place - I think he's going to see the opposite of what he thought. He's not going to create division, it's going to create community and more cohesion."" Mr Syed Ahmed, the survivor, says his two children ""have New Zealand, Kiwi values - and I'm so happy with that"". But he fears for them, saying all nations - not just New Zealand - must not become complacent. ""Now I see that people can come to the remotest, peaceful corner of Earth,"" he says. ""This just can't happen to this country. You can't leave it just as another incident. We're [travelling] as far as the Moon and Mars, but our neighbourhoods aren't safe for our kids? ""It's everyone's responsibility to deal with this hate."" ."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43491894,Accuser details councillor racism claims,The man tells BBC Scotland that Labour councillor Jim Dempster carried out sustained racial abuse against him 30 years ago.,23 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man has described in graphic detail claims that a Labour councillor carried out sustained racial abuse against him and his sister when they were children. Jim Dempster was suspended by the party last week after admitting making an Islamophobic remark about Transport Minister Humza Yousaf.  Mr Yousaf said the brother and sister later contacted him with allegations of racism dating back more than 30 years. Mr Dempster said the new claims were totally untrue and had no substance. And he insisted the language and behaviour attributed to him ""does not represent me, or how I conducted myself"". His accuser told BBC Scotland he had moved to the village of Sanquhar, near Dumfries, when he was 12 and was almost immediately subjected to ""verbal abuse on quite a sustained, constant and daily level"" from the locals.  The man and his relatives were of Pakistani origin - although he was born in Scotland - and were the only ethnic minority family in the village.  He said: ""They made me feel that I wasn't welcome, that I was different and it was their wee village and I was somehow an interloper and that my kind would never be welcome there. ""That was drummed home to me on a daily basis"".  The man said Mr Dempster was not a councillor at the time, but was a well-known member of the community who later bought a newsagent shop in the village high street after working as a part-time fireman. He said: ""I would always get the impression that Mr Dempster wasn't really happy about me coming into the shop - he didn't like me being there, it almost felt like there was fire burning in his eyes."" He said the third time he went into the shop, Mr Dempster shouted out ""here comes the Paki"" in front of other schoolchildren, adult customers and staff. ""The whole shop erupted in laughter - they thought it was quite funny, especially the kids"", he alleged.  ""I just put the money on the counter and I went away. I blamed myself for it - I thought 'what have I done to this man to warrant this behaviour?""' The man said he had not spoken out at the time.  He explained: ""When you are the only minority in quite a small place, there's not that many people you can go to talk about it so we had to alternative but to brush it under the carpet.""  He said it was only when he saw media reports about Mr Dempster saying that people would not have been able to see Mr Yousaf ""under his burka"" that he contacted the politician with his own experiences.  He said he did not know until later that his sister, who was aged about six when the racist abuse from Mr Dempster is said to have started, had also contacted Mr Yousaf.  He added: ""I only found out after three decades that my sister was abused (by Mr Dempster) - she was called chocolate monkey, he said she smelled of curry. ""At one point he came with a can of air freshener and started to spray it around the shop. It was something we never spoke about as family."" In a statement Mr Dempster said: ""I absolutely refute and deny the allegations made against me"". Referring to a newspaper report that the alleged abuse took place in the 1980s and early 1990s, he said he did not buy the newsagent shop until May 1991.  He added: ""The language and behaviour alleged does not represent me, or how I conducted myself. This can easily be borne out by visiting the local community and seeking their views.  ""Members of the local Muslim community in Upper Nithsdale are keen to speak to the media and describe me as the man they have known for many years."" Mr Yousaf has called for Mr Dempster to resign as a councillor, and to be expelled from Scottish Labour. Labour is looking at the latest claims as part of the investigation into Mr Dempster that was sparked by the councillor telling transport officials that ""no-one would have seen [Mr Yousaf] under his burka"". The councillor later apologised, saying he was ashamed and embarrassed and could offer no defence or explanation.  He also insisted that the ""stupid and ill-judged remark is not representative of who I am"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard told BBC Scotland that he was ""quite angry"" about the claims against Mr Dempster, and acknowledged that such cases should be dealt with ""much more speedily"" by the party. On Tuesday, Mr Dempster issued a joint statement with the imam of the Dumfries Islamic Centre in which he was described as a ""good man""."

Rev Richard Cameron, the minister at Scotstoun Parish Church in Glasgow, shouted at Mr Corbyn as he entered a local community centre. It later emerged that Rev Cameron had made Islamophobic and homophobic comments on his Twitter account. The church said there had been ""significant concern"" about the posts. In one tweet, Rev Cameron compared homosexuality to incest, describing them as ""unnatural"".  ""Both cause harm by breaking sensibly held taboos,"" he added.  In September, he tweeted: ""Christ has the power to help and change anyone. Obviously many gays hate this because want to carry on their perversion.""  He also shared a series of controversial views on Islam, describing terrorism as ""a problem Islam needs to deal with"", a full face veil as ""oppressive and unBritish"" and the Prophet Muhammad as ""a violent man"". In another post, he said: ""The best way to defeat Islam is to preach Christ"".  In response, a spokeswoman for the Church of Scotland said it deplored comments which were Islamophobic or homophobic.  ""At this stage all we can say is that there is a formal complaints process and that any complaints we receive in relation to this matter will be taken seriously and addressed,"" she added.  Rev Cameron, who worked in pharmaceutical sales before joining the church, has been minister at Scotstoun since 2000.  Earlier, he heckled Mr Corbyn during a trip to Glasgow, branding him a ""terrorist sympathiser"".  As Mr Corbyn was telling reporters about a scarf given to him by the Who Cares? Scotland charity, Rev Cameron shouted that he thought the Labour leader would be wearing an ""Islamic jihad scarf"". ""Do you think the man that's going to be prime minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?"" he added. ""Who's going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you're prime minister?"" The Labour leader did not react and he was ushered into the community centre by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.  Mr Cameron then accused Mr Corbyn of ""running away"". The Church of Scotland rebuked Rev Cameron for the way he approached the situation, saying: ""Whilst we may occasionally robustly challenge policy issues with which we disagree, we always intend to do that in a way that is polite and measured and allows for reasoned debate."" Meanwhile Who Cares? Scotland, which works with care experienced young people, criticised the minister for taking the focus away from their clients."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50397847,Labour vows to outspend Tories on the NHS,"The party says it would tax the ""wealthiest"" to cut hospital waiting times if it wins the election.",13 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Labour is promising to spend more on the NHS in England than the Tories if it wins the general election. The NHS budget would rise to £155bn by 2023-24 - £6bn more than the government promised the front-line budget would reach by that stage when it set out its five-year plan last year. Labour said the money would cut waiting times and boost mental health services. But the Tories said Labour's plan for a shorter working week would eat into the funding due to the need for more staff. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the working hours policy, announced at Labour's annual conference in September, would ""cripple our economy and cost the NHS billions every year"". But Labour said a 32-hour working-week would be phased in over 10 years so would not have the impact on NHS budgets claimed by the Tories, and it would also be offset by gains in productivity. Announcing his party's flagship election policy at the Royal Society of Medicine, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said after a ""decade of underfunding and cuts"" waiting lists had risen to ""record levels"". ""Only Labour has a plan to rescue the NHS,"" he added.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Labour's policy of taxing the ""richest in society"" and reversing cuts to corporation tax would release money to spend on healthcare. Lib Dem health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said: ""Labour's announcement completely misses the point.  ""They are ignoring the fact that Brexit is the biggest threat to the NHS.""  Labour's proposals were welcomed by NHS leaders. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said the pledge represented a ""significant extra investment"" on top of what has been set by the government. ""If used wisely, it would help to transform services and retain front-line staff.""  During the summer of 2018, the Theresa May government announced a five-year funding settlement for the front line of the NHS in England.  It also meant more money for other parts of the UK - under a system known as the Barnett Formula the devolved nations get the same percentage increases in areas like health - although it is up to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to decide where that is spent. In England it means the budget for NHS England will be £20bn more in 2023-24 than it was in 2018-19 once inflation is taken into account - a rise of 3.4% a year on average during the period. Labour has promised to top this up by £6bn by 2023-24 - an annual rise of 3.9% on average over the coming years. But this front-line budget - £121bn this year - does not cover the entirety of health spending. Another £18bn is being spent on other areas, including training staff, building projects and public health schemes like stop-smoking services. Read more of the BBC's Election 2019 coverage here: Labour has promised to increase these too. The most significant rise will be in the capital budget - for buildings, equipment and infrastructure. This year £7bn is being spent in this area after Boris Johnson increased the budget by £1bn shortly after he became prime minister. Labour says by 2023-24 the budget will top £10bn a year - a sum health academics have argued is needed to deal with the backlog in repairs and bring spending in line with other wealthy nations. The Tories have yet to set the budgets for these areas all the way through to 2023-24, although they have said investing in buildings and infrastructure is a priority. In terms of the front-line budget, Labour says the extra £26bn in real terms by 2023-4 they will be investing will help reduce waiting times in A&E and for routine operations such as knee and hip replacements - both targets for how long patients should wait have been missed for the last few years. They are also prioritising mental health, promising to fund more counselling services for schools, community mental health hubs and crisis teams. The wider increases in the overall health budget will help fund the return of the bursary for nurses and midwives to fund their time spent studying at university - the government scrapped these in 2017 - while they will also benefit from the Labour policy of scrapping tuition fees. Labour believes this will help address the shortage of nurses in the NHS. The party also wants to increase the number of GP training places from 3,500 a year to 5,000.  Free prescriptions and hospital car parking will also be introduced. What is quite remarkable is just how similar the Tories and Labour are in terms of many of the areas they are focusing on. Both are looking to increase the budget by more than it has been in recent years - albeit Labour are promising 4% more by 2023-24 for the front line. Setting aside free prescriptions and car parking, which are not Tory policies, both parties are prioritising training extra staff and investing in new buildings and equipment Last week the Tories too pledged extra training places for GPs, saying they wanted to recruit an extra 6,000 GPs. The prime minister has also promised there will be 40 major hospital building projects in the next decade - although only six have been given a guarantee of funding so far. The Liberal Democrats are yet to give much detail about their policies - although they have promised a penny on income tax will be introduced, which will raise extra money for mental health, public health and social care.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-45236851,People's Vote 'boost' and '100' Tory rebels,Sunday's papers feature a record donation to the People's Vote campaign and a Conservative rebellion.,19 Aug 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"As the government prepares to publish the first of its series of documents setting out the consequences of leaving the EU with no deal, the Sunday Express says the battle lines are being drawn in the quest for Brexit.   The paper's lead story reports that up to 100 Tory MPs are preparing to rebel against Theresa May's Chequers plan.   It says Brexiteers have demanded she instead study an alternative plan they believe will deliver the Brexit the UK voted for.   The paper adds that MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg are preparing the alternative proposal, to be published in the next fortnight. On the other side of the argument, the record £1m donation to the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, makes the Observer's main story.   According to the paper, Julian Dunkerton - co-founder of the Superdry fashion label - said that if Brexit had happened 20 years earlier, his brand would never have been a success.   But the paper warns that supporters of a new vote face a race against time before Britain ceases to be an EU member at the end of next March. ""Racists flock to Boris on Facebook"", is the main headline in the Sunday Times.   It says Boris Johnson is at the centre of a new row over racism after an investigation into online abuse revealed his official Facebook page hosts hundreds of Islamophobic messages.   Under entries that publicise Mr Johnson's articles and speeches - the paper adds - his followers have left comments including calls to ban Islam and deport Muslims. The Sunday Telegraph says it can reveal that the government is considering launching a ""Care ISA"" - which would be exempt from inheritance tax - in an effort to solve the social care crisis.   According to the paper, the Treasury has been reviewing proposals to include the ""Care Isa"" in the government's forthcoming social care Green Paper.   The paper explains that at present, Isas are taxed at death, so people are encouraged to spend their savings before they die instead of keeping them to fund their care - often needed at the end of their lives. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning According to the Mail on Sunday, 10 British ships sunk during the Second World War - which are designated as war graves - have been plundered for scrap metal by Chinese pirates. It says vessels that provide the final resting place for more than a thousand sailors have been smashed to pieces and looted by salvagers off the Malaysian and Indonesian coasts. Finally, the Sunday Mirror reports that Lucy Clark - football's only transgender referee - will take to the pitch on Sunday afternoon for the first time under her new identity. Ms Clark - a cab driver from Surrey - is pictured in her referee kit.   She tells the paper: ""I can appreciate people will be a bit shocked when I run on to the pitch. But I'm the same person.  I will just look a bit different""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-46228083,'Nobody seemed to care' about WW2 graves,"For over 70-years, one woman has been tending to the graves of Indian soldiers killed in Scotland during World War Two.",16 Nov 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"For more than 70 years, Isobel Harling has tended the graves of Indian servicemen who fought and died during World War Two.  In Kingussie, nine graves belong to men who served in Force K6, a Muslim transport corps who rode mules and delivered supplies to front-line soldiers.  Mrs Harling hopes the families of the men buried at this cemetery know that their final resting place is well looked after.   She lost her own brother during the war,  when he was shot down in Leuven in Belgium, and she has often thought about the people tending his grave.  Her own loss influenced her dedication to the graves of the Indian soldiers.  ""They came over from home and they gave their lives for us. It's only right that we should remember them. The people in Leuven look after their graves, so it's only right that we look after the boys that were buried here."" Mrs Harling first started visiting the graves in her early 20s, often cycling to the graveyard by herself. When the local gravedigger noticed her tending the graves, he told her not to bring any of her own equipment because she could use his while she was there.  With help from the gravedigger, she  has spent years cutting the grass, placing flowers on the graves and keeping the cemetery tidy. Now in her 90s, she regrets that she has had to slow down a little.  Mrs Harling has never met the families of the men buried at Kingussie but she hopes the families know the graves are being cared for in the Highlands.  ""Nobody seemed to care and that bothered me. So when I jumped on my bike and cycled down, no one knew where I was going,"" she recalled. ""They (K6 soldiers) used to come down into the village, and they would come to some of the functions and dances... they were very quiet, very nice and mannerly."" At the start of the war, 1,723 men from India disembarked at Marseilles with 2,000 mules, sent to France to help the British Expeditionary Force deliver supplies to the front lines. These were the Force K6: Punjabi Muslims of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps (RIASC). Five-months later, struggling with one of the harshest winters of that time, the men faced the German blitzkrieg, with two companies escaping from Dunkirk and another company via St Nazaire. A fourth ended up in a German POW camp.  It was a foreign terrain for these men. Having come from the Punjab region, the men were accustomed to a warmer climate.  After their escape from France, they spent three-and-a-half-years in Britain.  They were part of preparations for one of Churchill's plans to invade Northern Norway to help secure German airfields.  The plan was never approved, but the Force K6 still accompanied the British infantry brigades, training them in loading, and how to handle mules.  Some of the men were born in what is now Pakistan and others from Kashmir. During their time in Scotland, there were inevitable casualties.  The youngest of the nine men was Mushtaq Ahmad, who was only 21-years-old when he was killed in action on 19 October 1942. The oldest in the group was Ali Bahadur, who died aged 38.  Thirteen of the men are buried in four cemeteries across Scotland. Most of them buried in Kingussie, as their Indian General Hospital was nearby.  Omar Sheik the founder of the Colourful Heritage Project said: ""I think the contribution of the soldiers is over five million soldiers in the great wars, 2.5m British Indian soldiers just in World War Two. The largest ever volunteer army.  ""The reality is not enough has been done to remember them and their contribution. The fact we are here, doing an inaugural service in 2018, at the largest single gravesite of Force K6 soldiers says everything.  ""Many of their relatives don't even know where they are or where they are buried, that itself is very poignant."" For many people in the Highlands this would have been their first time seeing a person from India.  ""They were welcomed immensely by the local communities."" Organised by Colourful Heritage and the British Armed Forces, a multi-faith remembrance service took place on Thursday to honour those men who gave their lives for Britain.  Mr Sheik says its a unique story and demonstrates a special connection between Scotland and the British Indian Army.  ""In Churchill's own words, 'had the British Indian Army not arrived when they did, the course of the war might have been very different'. ""A lot more needs to be done to commemorate the contribution of the British Indian Army. In the backdrop of Brexit and the anti-migrant narrative and the rise of the far right politics and rise in Islamophobia... now more than ever this story needs to be told.  Mrs Harling feels like the men belong in Highlands, a place where they died and remain buried, but not forgotten.  ""They gave up their lives for us, for our freedom. They've been there for a long time now,"" she said. ""It was very fascinating to see them marching with their mules, a sight I never forgot."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57390398,Muslim family killed in Canada truck attack,Four members of a family in Ontario were killed in what police believe was a deliberate hate crime.,8 Jun 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Four members of a Muslim family were killed in a ""premeditated"" vehicle attack on Sunday, Canadian police say.  The attack took place in the city of London, Ontario province. A boy aged nine, the family's only survivor, is in hospital with serious injuries.  A 20-year-old Canadian man has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The attack was the worst against Canadian Muslims since six people were killed in a Quebec City mosque in 2017. ""It is believed that these victims were targeted because they were Muslim,"" Det Supt Paul Waight told a news conference on Monday.  Police are weighing possible terrorism charges, he said, adding that it is believed to be a hate crime. Two women - aged 74 and 44 - a 46-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl were all killed. They have not been named, in accordance with the wishes of the family. A nine-year-old boy was in hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, said police. Police named the alleged attacker as Nathanial Veltman, 20, of London, Ontario. He was arrested without incident at a shopping centre about 6km (4.8 miles) from the crime scene.  It is not yet known if the suspect has ties to any hate groups, said Det Supt Waight.  ""There is no known previous connection between the suspect and the victims,"" Det Supt Waight said, adding that the suspect was wearing a vest that appeared to be ""like body armour"".  Police said Mr Veltman had no previous convictions. Officials added that there was good weather and high visibility conditions when the black truck was seen mounting the kerb on Hyde Park Road at around 20:40 local time on Sunday. One witness told CTV News she had to shield her young daughter's eyes from the bodies. Another witness told CTV the scene was ""just chaos"". ""There were people everywhere and running,"" said Paige Martin. ""Citizens were trying to direct the emergency vehicles where to go. There was a lot of pointing and screaming and arm waving."" A 2016 census found that London - a city about 200km (125 miles) south-west of Toronto - is growing increasingly diverse. One in five people was born outside of Canada, with Arabs being the area's largest minority group, and South Asians coming in a close second. Ontario Premier Doug Ford was among those who paid tribute to the victims, tweeting: ""Hate and Islamophobia have NO place in Ontario.""  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that he was ""horrified"" by the news. ""To the loved ones of those who were terrorised by yesterday's act of hatred, we are here for you,"" he wrote. ""This was an act of mass murder, perpetrated against Muslims, against Londoners, and rooted in unspeakable hatred,"" said London Mayor Ed Holder. In a statement, Mayor Holder said he was speaking ""on behalf of all Londoners when I say our hearts are broken"".  ""We grieve for the family, three generations of whom are now deceased."" The mayor's statement added that he had ordered flags outside London City Hall to be lowered for three days of mourning. The National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) said in a statement that the attacker should face terrorism charges. ""A man allegedly got in his car, saw a Muslim family walking down the street, and made the decision that they do not deserve to live,"" said the organisation's CEO Mustafa Farooq. ""He did not know them. This is a terrorist attack on Canadian soil, and should be treated as such,"" his statement continued. Nawaz Tahir, a London lawyer and representative of the Muslim community, said during the police news conference: ""These were innocent human beings who were killed simply because they were Muslim."" ""We will stand strong against Islamophobia. We will stand strong against terror with faith, with love, and a quest for justice,"" he continued.  ""Hate will never overshadow the light of love."" It is not the first time members of the Muslim community in Canada have come under attack. In January 2017, a Canadian man fatally shot six worshippers at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre, and seriously injured five others. The perpetrator was sentenced to life in prison.  Canada's deadliest vehicle-ramming attack happened in 2018, when a self-described ""incel"" (involuntary celibate) ploughed his van into a group of pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 people."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60321129,The young Indians spreading hate online,Young right-wing Hindus in India are finding newer and more outrageous ways to target critics online.,11 Feb 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"In May last year, as Muslims around the world celebrated Eid al-Fitr, several women in Pakistan got a shock. Screenshots of photos they had posted of themselves, dressed up for the festival, were livestreamed without their permission on YouTube by two men across the border in India. The livestream, by Ritesh Jha and an accomplice he calls ""Keshu"", was accompanied by misogynist, Islamophobic comments and watched by hundreds. After several users reported the stream, YouTube removed the video and the channel. The women later said they felt ""unsafe"" and ""afraid"" and that their Eid had been ""ruined"". Eight months on, Mr Jha, 23, says he was ""filled with hate at that time"". He claims he wanted to avenge Hindu women whose morphed photos he had spotted on social media. He did not reveal any details about Keshu.  Trolling of women - especially those critical of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - has worsened in recent years amid an increasingly polarised climate both online and offline.  While supporters of all political parties and ideologies harass women online, experts say a churn in the far-right and the spread of technology has emboldened young Hindu nationalists further.  The YouTube livestreaming incident was followed by several cases of women being abused online. Developers of two apps shared photos of Muslim women in a mock ""auction"" meant to humiliate them. Hindu women critical of Mr Modi and the BJP were also put on a fake ""sale"" on audio app Clubhouse, which said it has since suspended the room and taken action against accounts connected with it. In all three cases, there was no actual sale. After a sharp public outcry, police arrested nine people in connection with both apps - all between 18 and 26 years old. Most were active in social media groups where Islamophobic messages were regularly posted.    Mr Jha too has been named in a police complaint in connection with the Clubhouse mock auction and the Youtube livestream incident, a senior police official told the BBC. ""We are investigating the case and will take necessary legal action against him if he does not present himself,"" Rashmi Karandikar, cybercell chief of the Mumbai Police, said. Experts say these are not isolated incidents.  ""I would attribute this to a sweeping radicalisation of the Hindu middle class,"" says journalist and author Snigdha Poonam. ""It's pure bigotry that's coming from deep within Hindu society."" Mr Jha's now-deleted YouTube channel had thousands of followers who engaged with anti-Muslim content he shared. He justifies the offensive jokes targeting Islamic practices as ""dark humour"". He also compares the livestreaming of the women's photos with ""harmless videos on TikTok or Insta Reels"".  Mr Jha was 14 when he got his first smartphone. He says the content he accessed then was his introduction to the right-wing world. ""On it, I saw memes, heard speeches of politicians who screamed that Hindus were in danger,"" he says.  The partisan political debates and toxic narratives that identified Muslims as the enemy slowly turned him into a ""radical"", he says. ""You start to feel you are being discriminated against, so much so you begin thinking of violence,"" Mr Jha says.   This is likely to affect more young people, experts say.  ""The pandemic has also created a febrile environment for radicalisation, by ensuring that millions of people have spent more time online,"" says a study by Canada's Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which studies online behaviour of right-wing extremists in the country. India's right-wing is also going through changes - many now divide themselves into two groups: ""trads"" and ""raytas"".  Trads, or traditionalists, have more extreme views and believe the BJP is not right-wing enough. They call their critics on the right ""raytas"" - a play on the Hindi idiom ""rayta phailana"", which broadly means to mess things up.  Raytas say they prefer to express their views without espousing violence.  Abhishek Banerjee, a right-wing columnist, says this is similar to divisions among those on the left.  ""As the right's position has become influential in politics and power, they are becoming more vocal and visible,"" he adds.  Trads - more right than the right  A young Dalit man, who only wants to be referred to as HR - the initials of his Twitter handle - told the BBC how he was drawn into the trad world.  Dalits (formerly untouchables) are at the bottom of an oppressive Hindu caste system.  In March 2020, HR was invited to join an Instagram group whose stated purpose was to ""disseminate true information about Hinduism"". The person who invited him said he was impressed by HR's skill at arguing ""with Muslims online"".  He was asked to add 14-15 year olds to the group. HR says he was happy to join because he was ""proud"" of the Hindu faith, but was soon disillusioned by the incessant hate members spewed - not just at Muslims but also Dalits.  ""They believed Dalits were not Hindus, that it was okay to rape Muslim women to build a Hindu India and that even the murder of children could be justified,"" he told the BBC through messages on Twitter. HR never disclosed his caste identity to the group and left it six months after he joined. He says he now ""fights"" against trads by reporting their social media handles. ""Trads praise lynching, oppose both Muslims and Christians, believe in the oppressive caste system, and hate all outspoken modern women, whether Hindu or Muslim,"" says writer Saniya Sayed, one of the women whose photos were uploaded on the fake auction apps.  Ms Sayed says she was often added to trad groups online by her harassers so she could see the objectionable comments they made about her.  Delhi Police have said that the man who allegedly created the fake auction app was part of a trad group. Mona Sharma, who calls herself a ""rayta"", says she and other right-wing women have also been targeted by trads online because they do not conform to their notions of how women should behave. She was abused online and her husband's personal information was leaked, says Ms Sharma - she adds that she herself trolls liberals and is subjected to trolling by them on Twitter, but that this is a ""harmless"" activity. ""For the trads, modern educated women are not Hindu enough,"" she says.  Police have had limited success in disrupting this entrenched ecosystem. ""Law enforcement doesn't have the wherewithal to monitor and track millions of accounts on platforms that are owned by foreign companies,"" says Brijesh Singh, a senior Mumbai Police officer. Experts say the problem goes much deeper than social media hate. Ms Poonam believes the radicalisation of Hindus is a grave danger to India's secularism. ""When I am out reporting, you would be surprised at how many times ordinary people keep bringing up Pakistan as a model for India to follow,"" she says. ""There is a strong feeling among a large section of Hindus that India should be for the Hindus, and they feel freer to express it today,"" she adds. Mr Jha tells the BBC his actions were ""morally wrong"" but says people like him are being ""used"".  ""We don't realise how hatred takes root in our mind. It doesn't benefit anyone, except those who are running a hate agenda."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-59250820,What's coming up in Parliament this week?,"Parliament reconvenes, and the Opposition will be trying to force as many votes on awkward subjects as they can.",12 Nov 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Parliament's brief November half term has interrupted a tense political moment, with the aftershocks of the Owen Paterson case still continuing. And, if you look at events a little further back, many government backbenchers are still nursing bruises from the social media backlash over the sewage amendment to the Environment Bill.  With the Lords sending back a number of issues from current legislation for MPs to reconsider, the government whips could be asking their troops to cast some uncomfortable votes, starting on Monday with a vote concerning the removal of the ""triple lock"" on the value of state pensions. Maybe nothing will happen, but the Opposition will certainly be trying to test Tory unity by forcing their MPs into as many awkward votes on sensitive issues as it can. And watch out for the direct ramifications of the Paterson kerfuffle; a vote on the Standards Committee's report is due on Monday, although probably without debate, and moves to reshape the system for policing MPs' ethics look likely to follow. Meanwhile two of the great powers of the land face interrogation by select committees - Yorkshire County Cricket Club and the prime minister. Here's my rundown of the week ahead. MPs resume (14:30) with an hour of Defence questions, probably followed by government statements or urgent questions. Then MPs will deal with the Lords amendments to the Social Security (Uprating of Benefits) Bill.  The Lords amended the normally routine legislation, which uprates a variety of benefits, because it removed the ""triple lock"" on the value of the state pension for a year. This broke a manifesto pledge, because ministers broke the link between pensions and the rise in earnings, after concerns that a post-pandemic rise in average wages would have meant pensions increasing by 8%. The main debate will be on the second reading of the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill, which has already cleared the Lords. The bill aims to reform the technical education system, and introduce a lifelong loan entitlement, as part of a flexible lifetime skills guarantee. And lurking the end of the business is a little item entitled Committee on Standards (Motion), which would approve the original report of the committee on the Owen Paterson case, which recommended a 30 day suspension from the Commons for the now-departed MP.  But the motion will not be debated if the previous business (and any statements or urgent questions) have taken up all the available time, when the music stops at 22:00. At that point remaining business is taken without debate - unless it is objected to, which it might be, if someone wants to push the MPs standards issue further. In Westminster Hall, Monday is Petitions Day, and (16:30) MPs will consider two e-petitions 323926 and 575620 on traffic offences for fatal collisions. The first, signed by 104,324 people, calls for tougher sentences for hit-and-run drivers who cause death. The second, also known as Ryan's Law, calls for the legal definition of causing death by dangerous driving to be widened to include failure to stop, call 999, or render aid on scene. It attracted 167,470 signatures. Then (18:00) they turn to e-petition 582336, entitled Ban Water Companies discharging raw sewage into water courses, which received 111,434 signatures. Committee action includes Treasury (14:30) questioning the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, and members of its Monetary Policy Committee in the wake of their recent decision not to raise interest rates.  In the Lords (14:30), proceedings open with the introduction of two new bishops, the Lord Bishop of Exeter, the Rt Rev Robert Atwell and the Lord Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Rev Paul Bayes, after which ministers face questions on the publication date for the long-awaited White Paper on levelling up, and on the government's definition of Islamophobia. Then peers respond to the Commons in the latest round of parliamentary ping pong on the Telecommunications (Security) Bill. The main event will be day eight of the marathon committee stage consideration of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - this was supposed to be the final day, but the debate has gone slowly and committee will now continue on Wednesday. The Commons opens (11:30) with an hour of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Labour's Emma Hardy, is on flood protection. This is a huge issue in her Hull constituency, where thousands of people live in areas at significant risk. The bill would set national minimum requirements for flood mitigation and protection measures.  The main legislative work is the second reading of the Finance Bill, the measure which puts the October budget into law. Watch out, too, for the adjournment debate led by the former Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland, on funding for autism and neurodiversity research. He wants the government to build on the work he began when he was in charge of the prison system, to assess the number of people in jail who have autism and other conditions.  In Westminster Hall (09:30), Conservative MP Bob Blackman, who's chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health, leads a debate on the delivery of a new Tobacco Control Plan. His group wants to end smoking by 2030 and make the tobacco manufacturers ""pay to end the epidemic"". Labour's Tulip Siddiq has a 90 minute debate on the continuing plight of Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, whose husband is on hunger strike, to pile the pressure on to ministers, and highlight her case. (14:30) Committee action includes Digital, Culture, Media and Sport turning its attention to Yorkshire County Cricket Club's handling of racism allegations from the former player Azeem Rafiq. He's due to give evidence and there is speculation that he will use parliamentary privilege to discuss how senior managers at the club dealt with his case. Given the current turmoil at Headingly, it is not clear which senior figures will appear from the club itself, although the committee will expect to hear from the newly-installed Chair, Lord Patel. And while Yorkshire will be the focus of discussion, it is possible that events in other counties may also feature.   Elsewhere, Justice has a hearing with Lord Burnett, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales - which could see some pungent comments on mooted reforms to the Human Rights Act, and on court backlogs. In the Lords (14:30), questions range across self-isolation rules, and abuse against health and care staff . Next, peers respond to whatever the Commons has done with their amendment to the Social Security (Up-rating of Benefits) Bill. Then there's the report stage of the Dormant Assets Bill - which extends the existing scheme to release money languishing in unused and forgotten bank accounts, to cover around £880 in other dormant assets. The Commons opens (11:30) with half an hour of Wales questions, followed by Prime Minister's Questions. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, proposed by the Conservative Robert Largan, calls for a ban on using disposable barbecues on open moorland, and would give councils the power to ban their sale - Mr Largan has regularly highlighted how they cause moorland wildfires. The big committee event (15:00) is the Liaison Committee holding one of its twice-yearly evidence sessions with the prime minister - will Standards Committee Chair Chris Bryant and maybe Procedure Committee Chair Karen Bradley have a chance to quiz him on his decision to challenge the original verdict of the Standards Committee to suspend former Tory MP Owen Paterson from the Commons for 30 days? Earlier, Work and Pensions (09:15) takes evidence on the Health and Safety Executive's approach to asbestos management with campaigners and HSE managers. In the Lords (15:00) there are questions to ministers on sentencing guidelines for pregnant women offenders, the Dimbleby report on a National Food Strategy and an independent commission on the future constitution of Wales. The main event is an extra day of committee consideration of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Progress has been so slow that there may be a further extra day on Monday 22 - suggesting a marathon report stage in December. The Commons day begins (09:30) with 40 minutes of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport questions, followed by a mini-question time for the Attorney General. There will also be the weekly statement on forthcoming Commons business from the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees Mogg (more Paterson-related argy-bargy?) Then the Commons will yomp through all stages of the Critical Benchmarks (References and Administrators Liability) Bill, a measure to tidy up the implications of the abolition of the LIBOR interest rate. It has already cleared the Lords. Meanwhile, in Westminster Hall there are two Backbench Business Committee debates - on access to Automatic External Defibrillators (13:30) and on visa and permit-free working for musicians in the EU (15:00). In the Lords (11:00), there are questions to ministers on the government's pledge to build 40 new hospitals and on ensuring leaseholders don't pay the cost of repairing safety defects in their building, for which they are not responsible. And that's followed by the monthly half hour question time for the government's Brexit supremo, Lord Frost, the Minister of State at the Cabinet Office. Then come the usual Thursday backbench debates, opening with Labour's Baroness Young of Old Scone on the outcome of COP26, with the Environment Minister, Zac Goldsmith, answering for the government. Labour's Baroness Donaghy leads a debate on initial teacher training, the recruitment of new teachers and the role of universities and other bodies in ensuring the supply and education of new teachers. MPs meet (09:30) to discuss private members bills, and this could be one of those days where several are voted through their second reading (their initial debate) - starting with the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Bill which aims to stop children being forced into marriage by raising the minimum age from 16 to 18.  At the moment, the only way for a child to prevent their marriage is to report that they have not consented which places the burden on children to speak out - and can endanger the child.  The bill was originally proposed by the former Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, and was taken over by Pauline Latham when he was brought back into the government. It has government and cross party support. Second on the agenda - and with a good chance of being debated - is the Conservative Dr Ben Spencer's Planning (Enforcement) Bill, which seeks to clamp down on repeat breaches of planning controls and create a national register of repeat offenders. He hopes this will help end the cycle of ""endless applications and planning breaches on problem sites"". Third is the Conservative Jane Stevenson's Glue Traps (Offences) Bill - this would ban the use of glue traps as a method of pest control, on the argument that they are inhumane and can cause immense suffering to animals. She says her bill has the support of government and animal welfare charities like the RSPCA. There are plenty more bills on the order paper, but it would be surprising if MPs had a chance to debate, still less vote on, more than the first five. The Lords are also sitting (10:00) to debate private members' bills, starting with the second reading of the Age Assurance (Minimum Standards) Bill, which would set the rules for age assurance systems for accessing an online or digital service and ensure they protect the privacy of users. The bill is proposed by the Crossbencher Baroness Kidron, who has long campaigned for greater protection for children online. That is followed by the second reading of Baroness Hayman's Onshore Wind Bill, which deals with planning applications for onshore wind installations, and then by debate on the Coroners (Determination of Suicide) Bill which will require the coroner or jury at an inquest to record an opinion as to whether gambling addiction or other factors are involved in a suicide  - it is proposed by the Bishop of St Albans, Dr Alan Smith, who has regularly raised concerns about fixed odds gambling machines fuelling problem gambling."

Luke Skelton, who was said to have racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic views, was accused of preparing to commit acts of terrorism in the year to October 2021. After seven hours of deliberation, a jury at Teesside Crown Court failed to reach a verdict on the single charge. Mr Skelton, 18, from Oxclose, Washington, could now face a retrial. The prosecution claimed the Gateshead College student took photos of Forth Banks police station in Newcastle last September to carry out ""hostile reconnaissance"". He was said to be a right-wing extremist who idolised Adolf Hitler, approved of the mass murder of Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, researched how to make explosives and had written a ""final note"".  Mr Skelton, who has autism, said in his defence that he was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" of the views he expressed last year and insisted he had no intention of carrying out acts of terrorism. Police found neo-Nazi material that Mr Skelton had downloaded on to his computer, but he said he was ""pushing boundaries"" by having it and told the jury: ""I was being an idiot."" The court heard he had been referred to the government's anti-terror Prevent programme. He had eight sessions with a caseworker before he disengaged with it, when he turned 18. Judge Paul Watson QC praised the jury for their close consideration of the trial when he discharged them from deliberating further. He said: ""You have clearly given this case a great deal of attention and I am grateful to you for it.""  The prosecution was given until Thursday to decide whether to ask for a retrial.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52320900,India stars under fire for 'anti-Muslim' tweets,Tweets by international medallist Babita Phogat and a Bollywood figure linked Muslims to Covid-19.,17 Apr 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"An international medallist and the sister of a Bollywood star have been criticised for tweets attacking Muslims over the spread of coronavirus in India.  A hashtag calling on Twitter to ban wrestler Babita Phogat is trending. She had used a hashtag derogatory towards Muslims and had said that for India, they were a bigger problem than even the virus. The trend comes a day after Rangoli Chandel was suspended by Twitter. Ms Chandel, who is the sister of actress Kangana Ranaut, attracted many complaints after she advocated violence against Muslims and ""secular media"", accusing the community of attacking and killing doctors. There have been some attacks against medical staff but Ms Chandel did not specify what she was referring to. Some videos purporting to show violence ""by Muslims"" have been discredited. Phogat's account has not been suspended, but many people who are using the hashtag asking Twitter to take action said they were tired of the hate. However, hours later a trend supporting her also emerged on Twitter. Phogat is a Commonwealth gold medallist and recently joined India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). India has seen a rise in Islamophobic tweets related to the virus after an event linked to a Muslim body - the Tablighi Jamaat -  spawned clusters of Covid-19 cases across the country. Police have since brought charges of manslaughter against the head of the organisation, saying that he ignored two notices to stop the event after India went into lockdown. The Tablighi Jamaat has denied all wrongdoing. However, the news has caused many Indians to associate the spread of the virus with Muslims. Many Muslim vendors and shopkeepers have complained that people no longer trade with them, and have even chased them away. The government has called for an end to divisive tweets and posts, and even taken action against some people."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66080504,Iran won't send ambassador to Sweden over Quran burning,Many Muslim countries have summoned Swedish ambassadors to express their condemnation for the act.,2 Jul 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Iranian government has refused to send a new ambassador to Sweden after a protester burned a Quran outside a mosque in the capital, Stockholm.  An Iraqi-born refugee burnt the Muslim holy book outside a mosque on the first day of Eid al-Adha.  Swedish police charged him with agitation against an ethnic or national group last week. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, blamed the government for granting him the protest permit. Plans to burn copies of the Quran have sparked riots in Sweden in recent months. Police had rejected similar protest applications recently, but courts then ruled that they should be allowed on freedom of expression grounds. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Mr Amirabdollahian said despite appointing a new ambassador, Tehran would not be sending them.  ""The process of dispatching them has been held off due to the Swedish government's issuing of a permit to desecrate the Holy Koran"", he said in a statement on Twitter. Iraq's foreign ministry also asked its Swedish counterpart to extradite the man who burned the Quran. They argued that since he still holds an Iraqi citizenship, he should face trial in Baghdad. After the incident, thousands of Iraqi protesters raided the Swedish embassy in Iraq at the instigation of the the populist Shia cleric, Moqtaha al-Sadr. They left after fifteen minutes when a security force was deployed.  The prime minister of Sweden, Ulf Kristersson, denounced the raid on the embassy, but also said it was time for Sweden to reflect on its identity. ""It is of course completely unacceptable for people to unlawfully break into Swedish embassies in other countries. I think we also need to reflect in Sweden. It is a serious security situation, there is no reason to insult other people,"" he said. Following an emergency meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah on Sunday, the Saudi-based organisation called for member states to take ""unified and collective measures"" to stop countries burning copies of Islam's holy book.  The secretary general, Hissein Brahim Taha said the burnings of the Quran were ""not mere ordinary Islamophobia incidents"" and urged countries worldwide to adhere to international law ""which clearly prohibits any advocacy of religious hatred"".  Morocco, Kuwait, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates - among other countries - have recalled their ambassadors to Stockholm following the incident. It has also sparked anger in other Muslim-majority nations including Turkey - a Nato member which has a say over whether Sweden also gains membership. On Wednesday, the country's foreign minister tweeted that it was ""unacceptable to allow anti-Islam protests in the name of freedom of expression""."

The paper says a ""barrage"" of letters demanding a no confidence vote have been submitted.   ""The vultures are circling"" is the Daily Mail's headline. Just as with Margaret Thatcher in 1990, it says rebellious MPs began seeking to oust their leader when she was out of the country.  The Financial Times reports that the prime minister's supporters insist she would win any such vote, but it acknowledges there is now a more ""mutinous mood"" at Westminster than previously.  The Daily Telegraph suggests a vote on her leadership could take place as early as this week - but some Tories want senior ministers to intervene and replace Theresa May with a caretaker before it happens.  The Spectator says there's very little chance Mrs May would resign before a vote were held. As one long-time backbench ally explains: ""She's in defiant mood."" ""France hit once again by terrorism"" is the headline in Le Figaro, as it reports on the attack in Strasbourg. The ""bloody shootout"" burst out in a country already ""bogged down"" by the violence associated with the yellow jacket movement, it says.  'Liberation' has dramatic testimony from the scene, where one of its journalists watched what happened from a fourth floor window. She describes people squatting on the ground behind a soldier, ""screaming and crying"". Most politicians have praised the response of the police and security services, Le Monde says, but others have been more critical: ""What are we waiting for finally to fight to eradicate the fundamentalism that has declared war on us?"" one regional leader has tweeted.

Transport for London has agreed a £2bn rescue package with the government to enable it to complete the first phase. Repaying that bailout, the FT says, will eat into money earmarked for the second scheme, which would link Surrey and Hertfordshire. The Times, meanwhile, says the Mayor, Sadiq Khan, is now facing calls to scrap his prized freeze on Tube fares in order to balance the books. Children as young as 11 have been arrested for selling the illegal drug known as Spice, according to an investigation by the Daily Mirror.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-49894354,Researchers urge action over BAME discrimination,"A survey suggests there are more reports of discrimination, but fewer people believe the current laws are working.",2 Oct 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Researchers at Edinburgh University have called for more government action to tackle racial prejudice.  They said levels of discrimination against black and ethnic minority (BAME) Scots were persisting.  The Scottish government introduced a Race Equality Framework in 2016 to tackle racial discrimination.  However, a survey published on Wednesday suggested fewer people from the BAME community believed the current anti-discrimination laws were working. The polling company Survation questioned more than 500 members of the BAME community on their experiences since the last survey was conducted in 2017.  More than a third (34%) of those questioned said they had experienced discrimination in the past two years.  Of these more than a quarter (27%) felt it was becoming more frequent.  Lead researcher Professor Nasar Meer, of the Edinburgh University's School of Social and Political Science said: ""This survey builds on others in previous years and points to a persistent trend of racial discrimination black and ethnic minority Scots. ""It is encouraging that black and ethnic minority Scots still have faith in Scottish institutions to tackle racism, but this trust has decreased over time.  ""Although levels of non-reporting have improved, they still remain high so more targeted support is needed to help overcome this."" Researchers found 49% of those who had experienced discrimination did not report it - down from more than 60% in previous years, which they said suggested a greater willingness to register complaints. A total of 42% agreed the Scottish government was doing enough to tackle racial discrimination - down from more than 50% in previous surveys.  A similar pattern was true of reported confidence in the laws (60%), which was lower than in previous years. Instances of discrimination included; Of those who had experienced discrimination at work, 25% said it had happened when applying for a job, 18% said it had affected their promotion chances and a further 18% their attempts to seek equal pay. A Scottish government spokesperson said racism and discrimination have no place in Scotland and it was continuing to take decisive action, including a campaign with Police Scotland to tackle hate crime, explicitly targeting racists. The statement added: ""In addition to our Race Equality Framework, which sets out our long-term goals, our Race Equality Action Plan outlines more than 120 actions we are taking over the course of this Parliament to secure better outcomes for minority ethnic communities in Scotland."""

The investigation, undertaken by the board of governors at Holland Park School in west London, found a culture of ""fear, favouritism and inequality"". It said very little support was provided to students after traumatic events such as the Grenfell fire. Pupils and teachers were also subject to sexism, Islamophobia, and racism. The local authority, Kensington and Chelsea, published a statement saying ""last week a child was harmed and a teacher was taken seriously ill"".  It added: ""This week a teacher has left the school in tears and more than 200 pupils were involved in a riot to protest against the future plans being made about their school and to express their concern about their teachers"". Complaints investigated by the board of governors came from students and staff, and included misleading Ofsted inspectors, safeguarding flaws risking students' welfare, and bullying of both teachers and students. The independent investigation looked into claims of safeguarding breaches, bullying, discrimination and inequality in respect of both teachers and students. It also found a failure to support students who had been victims of peer-on-peer sexual abuse.  The complaints and evidence span from 2004, when the school was under the control of Kensington and Chelsea council, to September 2013 when it became a Single Academy Trust, and then from September 2013 to December 2021. Some former staff and students were ""still traumatised by their experiences at Holland Park School"" and ""at times interviewees were extremely distressed in having to revisit their time at Holland Park School and were visibly shaken"", the report said. The Department for Education previously issued the school with a Notice to Improve in November 2021, highlighting financial mismanagement as well as leaders' ""excessive salaries and failure to seek prior approval from the government for 'novel and contentious' expenditure"". The school announced last year that then-head teacher Colin Hall would retire early, while a new chair of governors was appointed. Before he left the school, Mr Hall said: ""We don't recognise the characterisation of the school or our leadership in the allegations raised."" Sarah Newman, executive director at children's services at Kensington and Chelsea Council, said the situation ""has now escalated to such a level that the council is calling for immediate intervention by the Department for Education"". The board of governors said it was taking the findings ""very seriously"" and would be starting a disciplinary investigation in respect of three staff members. A statement added: ""The board of governors has been reconstituted since the events contained in the report occurred, with almost all governors appointed since September 2021.  ""However, the current board deeply regrets that the independent investigation has concluded that these events have occurred."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-58980384,"Clean out online cesspit now, Starmer tells PM","Boris Johnson promises to push through ""tough"" online safety laws, at Prime Minister's Questions.",20 Oct 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Sir Keir Starmer is demanding urgent government action to ""clean out the cesspit"" of online extremism. The Labour leader offered to work with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to fast track new online safety laws. Mr Johnson promised to get the first stage of the long-awaited Online Safety Bill through the Commons by Christmas. He said it would include criminal sanctions for those allowing ""foul content"" - but did not confirm whether that would include company directors.  Labour is calling for the directors of internet firms to be held liable for the content of messages posted on their sites. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said it was now three years since the government had promised a crackdown on online extremism and hate speech but the proposals had yet to begin their passage into law. ""Meanwhile, the damage caused by harmful content online is worse than ever,"" he told MPs. He criticised ""dangerous algorithms"" on Facebook and Instagram - and said he had been shown examples of ""violent Islamism and far-right propaganda"" on TikTok, a social media site popular with teenagers. But he added: ""Telegram has been described as the app of choice for extremists."" Telegram, which has half-a-billion users, is a messaging app, which also has ""channels"" allowing individuals to broadcast to an unlimited audience. Telegram has risen to global prominence as an app of choice to co-ordinate global protest movements; but has also been accused of not doing enough to purge extremist channels run by those involved with the so-called Islamic State group and the Capitol Hill riots. Campaign group Hope Not Hate and the Board of Deputies of British Jews had both said the free-to-use encrypted messaging service had ""facilitated and nurtured a sub-culture that cheerleads terrorists"", Sir Keir said. The messages shown to Sir Keir by Hope Not Hate, posted by anonymous Telegram users, include threats to ""kill all women"", ""kill politicians"" as well as homophobic, Islamophobic and racist abuse. Sir Keir said ""tough sanctions"" were needed - but the government's proposed legislation did not include criminal sanctions against the directors of online platforms. Mr Johnson said the government would look at ways to ""toughen up"" the law and promised to ""come down hard on those who irresponsibly allow dangerous and extremist content to permeate the internet"". He added: ""What we hope for also, is that no matter how tough the proposals we produce, that the opposition will support it."" Regulator Ofcom would have the power to levy fines of up to £18m or 10% of global profits, whichever is higher, on social media platforms which fail to comply with the new online safety laws. The regulator would also be given the power to block services from the UK if they are deemed to present a risk of significant harm to UK citizens. The bill also includes an option to introduce a new criminal offence for senior managers if further action is needed to ensure compliance - something Labour has been calling for. Asked if Mr Johnson was now backing criminal sanctions, a Downing Street spokesperson said the government was ""alive"" to the issue, adding: ""We will continue to listen and work with the companies involved."" Conservative MP and chairman of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport committee Julian Knight said a quicker timetable for the bill risked undermining scrutiny of it. ""We find ourselves in an unworkable situation where, at the whim of the prime minister at the despatch box, the process of scrutiny of this important piece of legislation to tackle online harms will be undermined. We need urgent clarity on this matter,"" said Mr Knight. By Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed that the messaging app Telegram is ""the app of choice"" for extremists. But is he right? Extremist content has been largely forced off mainstream social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and terror groups have moved elsewhere in attempts to spread their ideologies. Telegram has half a billion users, the vast majority using the service in the way it was designed - to exchange messages, images and video with friends, family, and people with shared interests.  In countries like Iran, it's one of the few platforms where people can speak freely about social issues and politics without fear of persecution. However, there are significant numbers who use Telegram to share extremist content and illegal pornography.  Attracted by the platform's secret chats with end-to-end encryption and its seemingly relaxed content moderation policies, Telegram became a haven for jihadist groups, earning it the name ""Terrorgram"". Working with international law enforcement agencies, Telegram has been successful in eliminating most jihadist content. But other extreme content, including what might be defined as ""terrorist"" is still present. It's easy to find racism, sexist and homophobic abuse, anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism, violent imagery, and encouragement of criminal activity on Telegram from users in the UK and around the world. Telegram told the BBC that it was ""surprised"" by Sir Keir's statement, saying that ""calls for violence are expressly forbidden on Telegram"".  ""Our moderators routinely remove content that violates this rule using a combination of proactive monitoring of public spaces and user reports,"" the Telegram statement concluded."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48687744,BBC defends debate imam vetting process,Abdullah Patel's controversial tweets have led to him being suspended by his employer and his mosque.,19 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The BBC has defended its vetting process after it emerged a guest on its leadership debate show had shared allegedly anti-Semitic tweets. Imam Abdullah Patel said he was sure he had not criticised Jewish people but stood by criticism of Israeli policy.  The broadcaster said: ""Had we been aware of the views he expressed he would not have been selected."" Mr Patel has been suspended as deputy head of a girls' school and also by the Masjid e Umar mosque in Gloucester. The BBC said the tweets had come to light after Mr Patel re-activated a previously inactive Twitter profile in the aftermath of Tuesday's debate, and had not been visible to its researchers before then.  Separately, the BBC faced criticism on Wednesday for choosing as a guest on the programme a solicitor who has previously worked for Labour and once stood as a councillor for the party. It defended the decision, saying: ""A background in politics doesn't disqualify anyone from taking part in a debate show."" A screenshot of Mr Patel's Twitter feed from 2014 posted on the Guido Fawkes website showed he shared a graphic of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"". Labour MP Naz Shah was temporarily suspended from her party three years ago after it emerged she had shared the same image on Facebook.  Another screenshot showed a tweet from Mr Patel, apparently giving advice to women on how to avoid being assaulted by men, saying: ""Generally men are the predators, but women need to realise this and be smarter. It takes two to tango, and if you put yourself in that position, don't expect every man to pass up the opportunity to take advantage of you. Don't be alone with a man!"" BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast presenter Nicky Campbell apologised for having Mr Patel as a guest on his show on Wednesday morning, after the imam had reactivated his controversial social media account, saying it contained ""extremely disturbing"" comments that should have been checked.  Al-Ashraf primary school in Gloucester released a statement saying Mr Patel had been suspended ""from all school duties"" while it investigated comments attributed to him in the media.  It added: ""The 'school' and 'trust' do not share the views attributed to him."" A statement from the Masjid e Umar mosque said: ""We are fully aware of the allegations made against our Imam Maulana Abdullah Patel regarding the contents of historic tweets. We have decided to act immediately and have chosen to give him some time away to allow us the opportunity to conduct a detailed investigation into this matter."" Mr Patel, who has now deactivated the Twitter account again, told the BBC Asian Network the school was ""within its right"" to conduct an investigation. ""I don't wish to comment on their decision,"" he added.  Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire earlier, Mr Patel said he had a very good relationship with the Jewish community. ""The criticism was not of the Jewish community because if you go through my tweets, you'd see support for the Jewish community,"" he said.  ""They're our brothers and sisters, and the Jewish community and I - especially in Gloucester - work very closely together. We actually visited a synagogue just a while ago."" However, he said he stood by any criticism of ""Israel's policy"". Mr Patel was one of several members of the public who were invited to ask the five Conservative leadership candidates questions during the televised debate. He asked MPs about the Islamophobic rhetoric faced by members of the Muslim community and whether they agreed that ""words had consequences"".  BBC presenter Emily Maitlis took responses from the Conservative leader candidates, with Sajid Javid taking the opportunity to ask all the candidates to agree to commit to an independent investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, which they appeared to do. Responding to the controversy over Mr Patel's participation in the debate, Mr Javid tweeted that the imam should ""practise what he preaches"". Former Conservative cabinet minister Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, who earlier welcomed the idea of inquiry, warned the controversy over Mr Patel's social media posts should not be allowed to distract from their ""important commitment"".  ""Are we really going to focus on the vile views of this insignificant questioner to undermine the significant answers on a serious issue from five powerful men, one of whom will become PM?"" she asked on Twitter. In response to criticism about choosing a solicitor who had worked for the Labour Party as a guest on the debate programme, the BBC said: ""Last night's questioners held a range of political views and we did not specify these views nor their backgrounds although some chose to do so themselves. ""The last questioner on the debate is a solicitor who was seconded by his law firm to the Labour Party in the past, rather than being a Labour 'staffer'. He is a Labour supporter and once stood as a councillor."""

Up and down the country, candidates for the 2019 general election were forced to pull out of the race - and be replaced - before getting their names on ballot papers.  The stories behind these party-managed deselections are all different. But while some candidates have been forced to step down for more traditional reasons, such as policy differences with their parties, many have found themselves hostages to their past lives on social media.  Of the 23 identified by BBC research to have stood aside in the run-up to the deadline, about a third did so because of some kind of past online transgression.   Seven of Labour's selections lost their status in the run-up to the 14 November deadline. Art critic Matthew Collings had secured his place in South West Norfolk until allegations were made about posts on his social media accounts dismissing claims of anti-Semitism in the party as a ""witch hunt"" and describing a former chief rabbi as a ""notorious hate-filled racist"". He denied posting anything that ""could possibly be anti-Semitic"" but was removed just a day after his nomination.  Kate Ramsden was due to run in Gordon, Aberdeenshire, until the Jewish Chronicle highlighted a blog post from her in which she compared Israel to an abused child who becomes an abusive adult. The party withdrew its support and she quit.   And Frances Hoole lost her candidacy in Edinburgh South West over a social media post showing her with a bottle of Cillit Bang cleaning spray pointed towards an image of her SNP rival Joanna Cherry. The next three candidates were knocked out for different reasons. Gideon Bull, who was set to run as a candidate in Clacton, Essex, stood down after admitting to using the Jewish slur ""Shylock"" in a private council meeting - though he said he hadn't realised it was offensive.  Sally Gimson was selected by local members to run for the seat of Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, but then removed by Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) after  complaints from members of another local party where she used to be a councillor. And Laura Davies - who ran for the party in both 2015 and 2017 - was deselected by the NEC for the Shrewsbury seat after she disagreed with her local party over plans to shake up hospital provision in the area. Finally, Ed Murphy was ditched as Labour candidate in Cambridgeshire North West at the last minute before the deadline - with no reason made public by the party.  Three of the candidates chosen by the Conservative Party lost their chances to run before Thursday's cut-off point. Former BBC presenter Nick Conrad stood down after critics attacked comments he made on the radio in 2014, saying women should ""keep their knickers on"" in a discussion on rape. Antony Calvert had been due to run for the seat of Wakefield, but Facebook posts were discovered where he criticised the appearance of his Labour rival, Mary Creagh. Mr Calvert also said if the deceased Libyan dictator Col Muammar Gaddafi had wanted to walk the streets unrecognised ""he should surely have fled to Bradford"". He said the posts were more than 10 years old and had not intended to cause offence - but still had to step down.  The former MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, Chris Davies, had been chosen as the candidate for Ynys Mon. But he pulled out after some of his fellow Welsh Tories criticised his candidacy because of a previous conviction for claiming false expenses. And, in the Scottish constituency of Aberdeen North, Conservative candidate Roger Houghton has been suspended from the party. over alleged anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and homophobic comments. He will remain a candidate, but without the party's support. The Liberal Democrats have lost five of their selected candidates. Two went in September, even before the mad rush to get all the seats covered. Galen Milne stood for the party in Banff and Buchan in 2017 and had been due to run again. He was deselected after posting on social media that Tories should be ""burned at the stake"". Kirsten Johnson bowed out of running in North Devon over a race row that erupted after an interview she gave on BBC radio.  Kevin McNamara had been the Lib Dem's candidate in Thurrock until he resigned after social media posts of his from a decade ago were shared,  allegedly containing homophobic and racist comments. Rob Flello used to be a Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent South, and had been set to run for the Lib Dems in the same seat - until the party discovered he had voted against gay marriage and gay adoption. They said his values ""greatly... diverge from ours"".  For Tim Walker, the decision to stand down was more political. He decided not to be the Lib Dem candidate in Canterbury as he did not want to split the Remain vote between himself and Labour's Rosie Duffield, who had only won the seat from the Tories by 187 votes. The Brexit Party decided not to run candidates in the end in 317 Conservative seats. Besides this, eight of its candidates have been deselected or stepped aside for other reasons.  The party's ""Workington Man"" Philip Walling was removed from running in the constituency after he took to Twitter to back Boris Johnson's deal. This was before Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage moved towards the PM's view. Jill Hughes had been due to stand in the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen, but stood down after social media posts revealed some unusual beliefs, including a claim that extra-terrestrials were working with world governments in a ""hush-hush"" arrangement. Prabhjit Dhillon was going to take on Warwick and Leamington for his party - but gave up the candidacy after posts were discovered on his social media, saying ""moderate Muslims... sit back and look the other way while jihadists fight"".  Calum Walker quit from running in SNP-held Dundee East after Mr Farage's decision to stand down 317 candidates in Tory-held seats. He tweeted that he feared splitting the Leave vote in the area could lead to a Labour government ""propped up by the SNP"".  Louis Stedman-Byrce pulled out in Labour-held Glasgow North East for the same reason.  On deadline day, Rupert Lowe decided not to contest Labour-held Dudley North for fear he would ""split the vote"" with the Tories, and allow Labour back in. Andy Wood also pulled out in Hove, urging voters to back the Conservative candidate.  Finally, Owen Prew was not nominated in Canterbury - where he had been expected to run. The reason is not clear.  In many of these cases, it's clear social media is proving a check on people's ambitions for public life. Tweet dredging - going through people's social media history to look for incriminating posts - has grown massively. And it's not just in politics, says the BBC's digital elections reporter Joe Tidy. ""Just ask the actor and comedian Kevin Hart who lost his dream job of Oscars host last year thanks to the internet unearthing homophobic jokes from the actor's dusty old Twitter archive,"" he says.  So the 2019 election was undoubtedly going to see the effects. ""The methods have improved a great deal because of how much more schooled on internet use everyone has become,"" said Tidy. ""Every year, more and more people are graduating from 'the school of the internet' - able to carry out bulk searches of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram pages to dredge up stuff that has long been forgotten about. "" Many of such controversial comments were posted several years ago at a time when both the posters and the internet were less enlightened, so, he says, ""you can see how easy it is for careers to crumble"". There is some talk in the tech world of an ""auto-delete"" function to permanently erase posts after two or three years. Tidy says this could reduce the chances of people's careers being ruined by silly youthful outbursts online.  ""Then again,"" he adds, ""some argue that these glimpses into the past are a useful insight into the true characters of the people being thrust into public life."" So has there been an unusual rise in candidates standing down before this election? That is statistically very hard to work out, says our political correspondent Jessica Parker. ""There are no official records and it's worth remembering that people can pull out, under the radar, for all sorts of unremarkable reasons,"" she says. ""After rows about allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour and Islamophobia in the Conservatives, parties feel under pressure to show a zero-tolerance approach."" Brexit is another ingredient, she says, leading, as it does, to people withdrawing so as not to split the Leave or Remain vote.  Maybe it won't be like this forever. Parker says would-be politicians may learn to be more cautious online.  ""But whether Brexit will continue to test party loyalties in the same way: well,"" she concludes, ""that's anyone's guess."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55049627,The secret behind India's ruling party's success,"The BJP is a rare Indian party that remained united despite internal differences, says a new book.",2 Dec 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"There is little doubt that the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has ruled India uninterruptedly since 2014, has become the country's dominant party.  Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing states, steadfastly expanded its pan-Indian footprint.  The main opposition party, Congress, is adrift and enfeebled; the once-powerful regional parties appear to have exhausted much of their potential; and no credible challenger to Mr Modi is visible on the horizon.   Political scientist Suhas Palshikar calls the BJP India's ""second dominant party system"", the first being former PM Indira Gandhi's Congress which ruled the republic for more than half a century. The BJP is the only and first party to win clear majorities since Rajiv Gandhi of Congress did so in 1984 elections. After Indira Gandhi, who was murdered in 1984, Mr Modi is the ""only leader to truly claim mass appeal almost throughout the country"".  The BJP's electoral success is largely attributed to Mr Modi's charisma and the politics of religious polarisation and strident nationalism.  Its campaign is powered by an indefatigable network of workers, many of whom are foot soldiers of its ideological fountainhead, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), or Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a group described by a political scientist as a ""clamorous and militant sibling of the RSS"".  In recent years, the BJP has also thrived on generous and ""opaque funding""; and the unwavering support of a wide swathe of uncritical mainstream media.  But step back a bit and the ""secret sauce"" of success of the BJP, as well as the RSS, may well be their ""unbending focus on unity"", argues Vinay Sitapati, a political scientist, in his new book Jugalbandi: The BJP Before Modi. (The title loosely means a duet of two solo musicians in Indian classical music, and alludes to the partnership of two of BJP's well-known founders, Atal Behari Vajpayee and LK Advani.) From a very early age, cadres belonging to the RSS, the 95-year-old bedrock of Hindu nationalism, are taught a particular version of Hindu history where ""glorious Hindus lose out because they stab each other in the back and they are not united"", says Prof Sitapati, who teaches political science and legal studies at Ashoka University.  This is reinforced, among other things, through selective telling of history and the group's fabled physical training exercises which are ""not just exercise, but exercise done together"". Cadres are taught to march together, stand on top of each other in a pyramid, and play ""games"" that are more associated with team bonding exercises in private firms. ""All this is to highlight the importance of unity. This unifying belief has become an organisational ethic. This is not like every cadre based party,"" Prof Sitapati told me. The BJP aims at uniting Hindus, who comprise more than 80% of Indians, and make them vote as one. That's why it downplays caste - which has traditionally divided Hindus and their political allegiances - ""ups the volume on Islamophobia"", and emphasises the importance of ancient Hindu texts, according to Prof Sitapati.  Like other parties, the BJP has suffered from its share of discord. It has been in power for barely 12 years of the four decade-long life in electoral politics. Being out of power meant there was no patronage to dole out to its workers for a long time.  Relations between the top leaders - Atal Behari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani - were often rocky. It is well documented, for example, how Vajpayee - now deceased - and a few members of his cabinet were unhappy with Mr Modi's continuation as the chief minister of Gujarat after the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the state under the latter's watch. The riots began after 60 Hindu pilgrims died when a train carrying them was set on fire. Still the party stuck together. ""They have sometimes been like an unhappy family which stays together. Their obsession with unity is based on the deep understanding of the flaws of Indian society,"" says Prof Sitapati. Political parties are coalitions of competing interests and factions usually held together by charismatic leaders, ideologies, organisational prowess and, in India's case, caste. Dissent and intra-party conflict are common. India's parties have been splintered by competing egos of leaders and factional feuds. Leaders have broken away from the Congress to form successful regional parties. Nothing of that sort has happened with the BJP - yet.  Led first by Vajpayee and Mr Advani, and now by Mr Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, the party, with ample support from the RSS, has held together . ""I am revealing no secrets when I say that many BJP leaders dislike Mr Modi. Many BJP, RSS and VHP leaders I interviewed admired Mr Modi's fidelity to ideology and knack for winning elections. But many found him ruthless, self-aggrandising and solitary,"" says Prof Sitapati. It helps that the BJP, in the words of Milan Vaishnav, a political scientist, is an ""unusual party"". ""It is the political wing of a broader constellation of Hindu nationalist organisations. It is very hard to separate the political entity from allied and nominally political entities associated with it. The networked model means that the BJP gains a lot of strength from its grassroots organisations and its dense networks help keep individuals inside the tent, so to speak,"" Prof Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, told me. It is not that dissenters have not left the BJP. ""The puzzle is that they don't survive politically and return to the party. Perhaps the reason is BJP is a deeply ideological party and the ideological glue holds it together - and you will find this in the parties on the Left and Right,"" says Rahul Verma, a political scientist and co-author of Ideology and Identity, a book which explores the role of ideology in Indian politics. Whether the BJP will stick together forever is impossible to predict. Its take-no-prisoners style of politics means they have thrown open their doors to defectors - often tainted - from other parties. This can lead to inevitable contradictions over ideological 'purity'. ""How long you can manage the contradictions?"" wonders Mr Verma.  For as long as the party is winning, surely.  That's why elections are the cornerstone of BJP's existence. Mr Verma says BJP's social base is expanding but their leadership still remains predominantly upper caste. That's another contradiction the party might have to grapple with in the future.  Critics believe BJP's unabashedly majoritarian politics is altering the ""idea of India"", one which was more tolerant and informed by secular values. ""Their idea of India won,"" says Prof Sitapati, ""because they worked as one."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53322950,Why are there so few ethnic minority MSPs?,"With an election on the way in 2021, will Holyrood's record of BAME representation improve?",8 Jul 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"MSPs have hit out at the lack of ethnic minority representation at Holyrood as the Black Lives Matter movement continues to reshape politics. But why has Holyrood had so few members from minority backgrounds, and how could this change in 2021? The Black Lives Matter movement has been debated in the Scottish Parliament, but it has also raised questions about why there are only two MSPs from ethnic minority backgrounds to take part in such debates. In five Holyrood elections since 1999, each electing 129 MSPs, Holyrood has had a total of four members from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities - all of them men of Scots-Pakistani heritage. One of the four - Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf - said that a record of ""no black MSP ever, no female BAME MSP ever"" was ""frankly a failure of all of us, regardless of party"". In a recent speech he also pointed out that the director general of every Scottish government department and the chair of every public body is white, saying ""that is not good enough"". With parties now working on their candidate lists for the 2021 elections, what needs to change? With many MPs and MSPs beginning their careers in local politics, the issue extends to Scotland's councils too. Soryia Siddique is a Labour councillor in Glasgow, and stood for the party in the last Holyrood election in 2016. She told BBC Scotland's The Nine programme that she has had to deal with racism, sexism and Islamophobia, saying that people would frequently mix her up with a colleague who also wore a hijab, with even council officials apparently ""not being able to differentiate between us"". She said: ""When I stood in 2012 as a Muslim woman of colour, some of the comments I heard were 'she's unelectable', 'she needs to be more modernised'.  ""That hurt - you would hear people saying I don't come across as being Scottish enough because of the way I choose to dress. ""In 99% of the meetings I go to I'm the only woman of colour at that meeting. In policy decisions and in terms of policy shaping, it's not acceptable. ""I know there's no lack of talent, no lack of aspiration or lack of ambition. There has to be a recognition that something is happening before people get to that stage. ""Children from a BAME background don't see themselves for example in a senior management role, as senior teachers, or as policy makers and these things have an impact, without a doubt."" Fatima Zahra Joji - an SNP activist from Aberdeenshire - said more has to be done by political parties ""that claim they are progressive and inclusive"", but have not delivered results. She said that ""diversity is key in terms of societal progression, and if you look at today's Scottish society, we have failed in that aspect"". She said: ""If you look at our black and minority ethnic population, we've got 1% who are black and if you include Asian and minority ethnic it's about 5%.  ""It might seem small, but if you look at 5% of 5.5 million, you're talking about hundreds of thousands people. That's hundreds of thousands of people that you're ignoring. ""I think we need to look at our Scottish history, and how our society is rooted in systemic racism and oppression and unconscious bias, to the point where we don't even realise we're doing it. ""You need the diverse experience, the lived experiences if you want to make a society that you claim is representative and progressive, and when many people are held back it's going to affect people who claim they are not."" Efforts are being made to get more young people to at least get a taste of life at Holyrood. The John Smith Centre - a think tank at the University of Glasgow - has recently doubled the number of recruits to its parliamentary internship programme, with the aim of half of them being taken up by students from BAME backgrounds. Rafe Uddin is a student who went on one of these internships, and said that ""the moment you walk into Holyrood, it's quite obvious that you're one of a few people in parliament from an ethnic minority background"". He said too often the onus is put on people from ethnic minority backgrounds to fix the problem themselves - that they are ""sort of burdened with having to find the solution to problems that are very much out of their control"". Rafe said having candidate shortlists that deliberately promote black and Asian women could help boost representation. He said: ""All-women shortlists have been incredibly effective in the Labour party in particular, it's reshaped the composition of that party and put more women in politics and actually at the fore of politics too. ""You can have ethnic minority shortlists as well, and there's nothing to say you couldn't have shortlists with black women and Asian women in particular to actually help both with gender composition and ethnic minority representation."" The SNP said Holyrood needs to ""better reflect our population"", saying the first job was to ""encourage many more BAME members to come forward"" as candidates. A party spokesman said legislation might prevent them from ""addressing this in the same way that we did to increase the number of women being elected"", but said they would ""be taking steps to make sure that BAME candidates are involved in selection contests in as many seats as possible"" The Scottish Conservatives have set up a commission led by former MEP Nosheena Mobarik which aims to get more women and ethnic minority candidates elected. A spokesman said the party has ""a vibrant and diverse range of members, activists and staff from all backgrounds that are now working through the ranks"", and that the best way to improve representation was ""removing barriers that are stopping people from standing"". Meanwhile, the Lib Dems are considering plans to put candidates who are women, disabled or from minority ethnic backgrounds forward in their ""most winnable"" seats in 2021."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-40158469,London attack: Fake news spread online,Find out what's buzzing in the social media world today.,5 Jun 2017,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Fake stories, images and misinformation have been circulating on Twitter in the days following the attack on London Bridge.  It's not a new phenomenon, but does seem to be a growing trend, as fake images also circulated online in the aftermath of the Manchester attack last month. Seven people were killed and 48 injured when three attackers drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed several in Borough Market on Saturday night. Soon after the news broke images of the ""missing"" started circulating.   Among the many false missing images shared online was that of David Sherratt. A Twitter user unknown to David shared his image claiming he was his ""missing brother"" and appealed for retweets. David, 20, is based in Cardiff and runs a YouTube page called Alternative Facts. He says he hadn't been to London in months and was only alerted to the tweet by a follower.  David told BBC that he was concerned ""people were going to waste resources looking for me instead of actual victims"". Many YouTubers were also victims of fake missing tweets, including US-based Jacob Sartorius, with one user claiming he was their child. The Twitter account responsible for that post has since been taken down. Other YouTubers whose images were posted with claims they were some of the missing include MattyBraps, Vinny (Vinesauce), and Devon Sweeney. Another user tweeted a photo of Infowars editor Paul Joseph Watson, claiming he was worried about ""his boyfriend who hasn't returned my calls"". The BBC spoke to one of those sharing the fake tweets who told us his aim was to ""see if people would pick up on it"". While a 17-year-old from Pennsylvania, US responsible for another fake tweet said the tweet was a ""public service"" because it made ""people [retweeting it] feel good about themselves"". *We have chosen not to include some of the images and profiles of accounts circulating fake images to prevent the spread of misinformation* Shortly after the attack, many Facebook users in London used the Safety Check feature to reassure family and friends they were ok.  But the tool was also misused by users who requested food or transportation despite being located outside the UK. Others used it to share Islamophobic messages.  Meanwhile, people who weren't located in the area also used the feature to offer their assistance.  One Facebook user living in Wales volunteered to host a family affected by the attack for a weekend while another extended her ""time and support"" and a listening ear in addition to material help. Other online trolls shared a photo supposedly showing the ""suspect that ran down pedestrians on London Bridge"". The man in the image was identified as US comedian Sam Hyde Hyde has been wrongly accused by online trolls of perpetrating a wide range of mass shootings and attacks in the United States.  Users on the social network 4chan have helped perpetuate that narrative. The alt-right Twitter account Tennessee tweeted a screen grab from a live broadcast on Al-Jazeera's Facebook page which it suggested showed ""moderate Muslims"" laughing at the attack. A similar image was also spread online following the Westminster attack in March, and from an Al-Jazeera live Facebook video. The video in question, screen grabbed from Al-Jazeera's page, appears to show a relatively low number of people reacted with a laughing emoji with many more people adding the crying and angry emojis to the stream.  It's also difficult to ascertain the religion and nationality of all the users who reacted to the post from their Facebook profiles.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-66376865,University 'dismissed complaints' over sexist farmer,Two veterinary science students say they were asked to take their tops off and clean holiday lets.,4 Aug 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Two students who said they faced sexist harassment while on a farm placement claim their lecturer dismissed their concerns. The University of Bristol veterinary science students said that while on the farm they were asked to take their tops off and clean holiday rentals. One said a senior lecturer was ""dismissive"" of their concerns, saying it was ""typical farmer behaviour"". The university said it had suspended the farm from its list of placements.  One student, who originally spoke to the Bristol Tab, said she had been worried because she had received a text message from the farmer promising to ""give us alcohol and make it a party"".     Speaking to BBC West, she said the lecturer had warned cancelling would have been ""unprofessional"".  There were ""lots of little comments"" from the farmer, she said.  ""[There were] comments about us being women, not strong, not made for farm work - he made a comment about another girl taking her top off for him to do some painting."" ""When we cleaned his holiday lodge rentals, he said 'you're women, that's your job'."" The students claim they were instructed by lecturers to report anything that made them uncomfortable to the farmer's wife, rather than the university's emergency phone number.  ""There was a helpline we could ring and we were told that was for immediate danger emergencies,"" she said.   The student claimed that after the placement a senior lecturer had been ""really dismissive"" of their complaints.  ""She laughed at us during the meeting, she said it was typical farmer behaviour,"" she said.  ""It was so disappointing to hear it, she literally said 'what do you expect?'."" The pair said the farmer admitted he had previously been removed from the university's placement list following complaints by students.  But he had been asked to take students again during the pandemic due to a shortage of work experience opportunities.  ""The fact they knowingly sent us on the placement was upsetting,"" the student said.   The second student said she felt uncomfortable being left alone with the farmer.  On a warm day, he told her ""it's take-your-top-off weather"", adding he would ""pay to see that"".  As well as cleaning holiday lets, the students were asked to paint walls.  ""He said we should take our tops off to paint,"" the student said.   The farmer also sent her a video of two scantily clad girls dancing, adding he expected ""to see that in the shed on Saturday"".  Professor Sheena Warman, deputy head of the university's veterinary school, said the students' concerns were being taken seriously. ""The behaviour and attitudes they experienced during their placement were completely unacceptable and I am sorry for the distress this has caused,"" she said.  ""I agree that the feedback received from their lecturer when this was raised with them afterwards was disappointing and they have contacted the students themselves to apologise directly."" Prof Warman said the university would be updating its guidance to students ahead of placements and reminding staff ""how best they can offer support"".  ""Whilst we continue to look into the concerns raised, we have taken the farm in question off our placement list and will decide in due course whether it should be removed completely,"" she added. Following the students' complaints, the Association of Veterinary Students UK and Ireland (AVS) said it had received similar allegations of harassment from others on farm placements.  It set up an anonymous survey for members to report concerns and said the results would be released imminently.  Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Luke Skelton, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, harboured racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic views, the jury was told. Teesside Crown Court heard the 18-year-old took photos of Forth Banks police station in Newcastle in September. He denies preparing to commit terrorist acts in the year up to October 2021. Setting out the case for the prosecution, Nicholas de la Poer QC said the purpose of the photographs was to carry out ""hostile reconnaissance"" and Forth Banks was one of three police stations the Gateshead College student considered as potential targets. Mr de la Poer said: ""Luke Skelton believed in an extreme right-wing ideology. An ideology which lionised Adolf Hitler. ""An ideology which approved of the terrible attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. ""An ideology which is racist, sexist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic."" 'Racial war' The jury was told Mr Skelton's autism may be used as factor in his defence, but the Crown maintains he was planning acts of terror. Concerns were raised at the defendant's college about images in his workbook and he told a tutor he had strong right-wing views, the court was told. He was referred to the Prevent programme and had eight sessions with a caseworker before he left the service when he turned 18. In January last year he searched how to make dynamite and began composing a so-called ""final note"" on his phone, intended to be read by others after something had happened, the jury was told. Mr de la Poer said: ""He states the purpose of the final note is to 'clarify the reasoning for why I have committed these acts is to accelerate the coming collapse and racial war'. ""The hope Luke Skelton is expressing is for his act to spark this war."" Mr Skelton was first arrested in June, leading him to change his username for an online group to ""Adolf Hitler"" - ""so the police don't suspect me"", he told Discord users. He was held on suspicion of possessing documents useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, but after he was released he told followers he felt like a coward as he had not done anything yet. In the following days he downloaded a video of the Christchurch mosque atrocity and edited the Friends theme tune over it, which the prosecution allege was done because the lyric ""I'll be there for you"" suggested a kinship with the mass murderer. Mr Skelton also wrote the recipe for an explosive in part of his phone, the jury was told. He talked online about murdering rape gangs and attacking a drag queen and in August wrote a note on his phone about bombing a police station, Mr de la Poer said. He was arrested for a second time in October and charged with a terrorist offence. The next day police found a piece of A4 paper on which he had written a speech expressing his fascist views, Mr de la Poer said. The trial continues.

The party has yet to ask Transport Scotland officials for evidence in the case of a councillor who made controversial remarks about Transport Minister Humza Yousaf. Mr Yousaf said Labour's promise of swift action appeared to ""ring hollow"". Scottish Labour said investigations were continuing. It is understood the investigation is still at a ""preliminary"" stage. In March, Dumfries and Galloway councillor Jim Dempster was suspended by Labour following a complaint. He had apparently told transport officials that ""no-one would have seen (Mr Yousaf) under his burka"" when he visited the area. The councillor apologised and said he was ""ashamed and embarrassed"". But Mr Yousaf said he should be expelled by Labour. The party leader, Richard Leonard, ordered an investigation. But almost three months later, Transport Scotland said there had been ""no contact at all"" from Labour. In an interview with BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Humza Yousaf said: ""I was told there would be a swift investigation - I've not heard anything.  ""I was heartened a few weeks after the complaint that I made, when Richard Leonard said there would be a zero tolerance approach and he'd be personally accountable for that.  ""Almost three months later, for nothing to have happened, his words really ring hollow"".  It is understood the case is to be considered by Labour's ruling body - the NEC - next month. The party said it would inappropriate to comment. It's not the only racism case under investigation. In January, the Labour MSP Anas Sarwar said the party's council group leader in South Lanarkshire had told him ""Scotland wouldn't vote for a brown, Muslim, Paki"". The councillor - Davie McLachlan - categorically denied making the remarks but was suspended by the party. It's understood this case has been referred to UK Labour's national constitutional committee for a hearing later this year. In February, the MP Hugh Gaffney apologised for making what he said were ""deeply offensive and unacceptable"" remarks about Chinese and LGBT people. He was reprimanded by the party and sent for diversity training. In March, when Councillor Dempster's case was made public it led to further allegations against him. A Sanquhar man of Pakistani origin told the BBC that he had been repeatedly racially abused by Jim Dempster before he was elected. Councillor Dempster has strongly denied that allegation. Around this time, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard told an anti-racism rally that ""we need to be impatient and angry in our pursuit of justice and equality"". A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: ""Investigations into alleged misconduct are continuing and as a result it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."" In May, five members in the Glasgow south-west constituency said they felt ""not wanted and not welcome"" in the Labour party because of their Asian background. They made the complaint in a letter to the party leadership and it's understood they have been invited to discuss their concerns with Mr Leonard after Ramadan. Scottish Labour adopted a plan to tackle racism at its Dundee conference in the spring and Mr Sarwar has established a cross-party group at Holyrood to tackle Islamophobia."

Brenton Tarrant, 32, has filed an appeal against his case and sentence, court officials said. No hearing for the appeal has been set at this stage. Tarrant was jailed to life without parole in 2020 for the murder and attempted murder of Muslim worshippers. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said he was attempting to ""revictimise people"". Asked about his appeal, Ms Ardern told reporters: ""His is a name that shouldn't be repeated and I'm going to apply that same rule in commenting on his attempts to revictimise people. We should give him nothing."" Her government refuses to publicly name Tarrant to deprive him of any platform or notoriety. Imam Gamal Fouda, a survivor of the attack at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, said he was ""struggling to understand"" a motive for Tarrant to appeal given ""he himself pleaded guilty"". ""I cannot help but think that this is another action from this terrorist to harm his victims again by keeping alive the memory of him and his terrorist actions,"" he told The New Zealand Herald newspaper. Tarrant, an Australian national who moved to New Zealand in 2017, stormed two mosques in the southern city on 15 March 2019, armed with military-grade semi-automatic guns. He had the intention of killing as many Muslim people as he could, his trial heard in 2020. He livestreamed the attack on Facebook via a headcam and also published a 74-page manifesto on extremist forums.  During his trial, he chose to not give any testimony. He pleaded guilty to the charges of murder, attempted murder and terrorism and also declined to oppose the prosecution's call for the maximum sentence possible. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole - the first time New Zealand handed down the punishment. The country does not have the death penalty. His sentencing judge at the time noted Tarrant showed no contrition, remorse or shame for his actions. ""Your crimes are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment,"" said Judge Cameron Mander. A coronial inquest is currently underway in New Zealand into the attack. Authorities on Tuesday said they would consider whether the appeal might affect the inquest. The Christchurch attack was the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's history. The shootings prompted parliament to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners.  51 people lost their lives in the attack on two mosques in the New Zealand city in 2019."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62150063,Diverse line-up in race for PM signals Tory shift,What does the diversity of candidates vying to be Conservative party leader and PM tell us about British politics?,14 Jul 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Whoever wins the race to be the next prime minister, it will have been the most diverse major party leadership contest in UK history. What does this tell us about British politics? Four of the eight Conservative MPs who made it through to the first round of voting are women, and five - Rishi Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat - are from ethnic minority backgrounds. Mr Zahawi was voted out in the first round, along with Jeremy Hunt, and Ms Braverman was knocked out in Thursday's second round. Before Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti dropped out, a third of the Conservative Party's 22 non-white MPs were bidding to be its next leader. In a matter of weeks, the Conservatives could elect only the third national leader from an ethnic minority in Western Europe, after former Irish premier Leo Varadkar, whose parents are white Irish and Indian, and the first, Antonio Costa the prime minister of Portugal whose parents are half Portuguese and half Indian from Goa. This is quite a turnaround for a party that was historically seen as an exclusively white domain, but it did not happen by accident. It is largely the product of a 17-year long effort to increase the diversity of Conservative MPs, launched by former leader David Cameron. When Mr Cameron was elected leader in 2005, the party had just two ethnic minority MPs, both men.  In the teeth of opposition from traditionally-minded colleagues, he created an A-list of diverse candidates for winnable seats, saying he wanted to make the party more representative of modern Britain. Rob Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, said Mr Cameron ""deserves credit"" for persuading local Conservative associations to adopt diverse candidates, whether they were on the A-list or not. The fact that many have risen rapidly through the ranks, into cabinet positions and are now leadership contenders, is no accident either, he argues. ""Cameron wasn't just looking for anyone off the street. They were looking to get really impressive, high flying people from diverse backgrounds."" There is a sense that ""their time has come"", argues Professor Ford. ""They are not just seeing themselves as the right people for this moment, they are being seen by colleagues as right for the moment."" All of those vying to be the next Tory leader have tried to project a compelling personal story - but none have so far made an issue of their race.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who is not among the contenders, said: ""I have always found in the Conservative Party that people were less bothered about where you come from, in terms of your ethnic background, your social background, than they were, for example, in the Labour Party, or in other parties."" He argues that the Conservatives are a ""individualistic"" party where people ""take you as they find you"" and are not interested in ""identity politics"". ""I don't understand why it is incumbent on ethnic politicians to represent their race in a way that it isn't incumbent on other people of the majority population. No one says 'he is a white politician, he is representing me'."" The Conservative Party still lags behind Labour when it comes to ethnic minority representation at Westminster. A record number of 41 black, Asian and minority ethnic Labour MPs were elected in 2019, and there are now more female Labour MPs than men for the first time. Ethnic minority voters still overwhelmingly vote Labour, according to House of Commons library research.  Analysis of the 2010 general election, by Oxford University's Professor Anthony Heath, suggested minorities were not as ""progressive"" in their political views as white British voters, but backed Labour ""because of belief, based on collective experience, that Labour looks after ethnic minorities while the Conservatives do not"". The Conservatives have gained a little ground since 2010 - with 20% of black and minority ethnic voters backing them at the 2019 general election, according to pollsters Ipsos. That support may grow with a black or Asian Tory prime minister.  But many on the left argue that the colour of those in the cabinet, or even at the helm of the party, is irrelevant, as the Conservatives have harmed race relations in the UK. They point to the Windrush scandal, plans to deport illegal immigrants to Rwanda, and an ongoing investigation into Islamophobia in the party, as evidence of deep-rooted discrimination. In a 2020 interview with The Independent, former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott claimed the government was in ""denial"" about systemic racial prejudice within the police, immigration services and the criminal justice system.  Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City university, said: ""It is the most diverse government in history, but it also has the most racist policies of any government."" He argues that black and Asian Conservative ministers are essentially ""fronts for white oppression"", saying they are able to introduce policies that white political leaders would not be able to get away with. There is also the question of social class. The race to be the next PM may be diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity, but most of the contenders fit the traditional Tory profile of well-off, privately educated and from comfortable middle class homes. Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University London, said: ""I do worry that the group that is most missing from Parliament - and most missing from this leadership contest - will be people who come from backgrounds that many people would identify with, and are considered ordinary."" There's no denying that Parliament is now more visibly representative of the country - and this Conservative leadership contest reflects that evolution.  And having a prime minister of colour would undoubtedly be an important milestone in British politics. But the question of representation is a thorny and complex one. Some might feel inspired to see someone who looks like them in a position of power and feel more invested in the government of the day. Others might be put off by wealth, private education, an elite university degree - or any other experience they can't relate to. And still others might see no need for a prime minister to have a similar background to them, so long as they can deliver policies that make a positive impact. Whoever wins this race will be drawing from all different parts of their identity and life story to determine what policies to pursue in office."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47699841,Row over Tory councillor's re-instatement,Andrew Bowles was suspended two weeks ago after sharing a message hailing Tommy Robinson as a patriot.,25 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Conservative council leader suspended for sharing a message describing anti-Islamic activist Tommy Robinson as a ""patriot"" has been re-instated. Andrew Bowles, who leads Swale Council, was disciplined after appearing to endorse a claim Mr Robinson's Facebook ban was a ""disgraceful injustice"". He has apologised for any offence caused and agreed to attend training on the better use of social media.    Labour said the Tories were in denial about Islamophobia in their ranks. The party has come under fire in recent weeks for its handling of allegations of anti-Muslim prejudice. Former Conservative chairwoman Baroness Warsi has accused party officials of failing to deal with complaints properly and ignoring her warnings about the scale of the problem. The current chairman Brandon Lewis has insisted swift action has been taken when complaints are made although the party has declined to say how many cases are currently being investigated.  Mr Bowles, who has led Swale Borough Council in Kent for 16 years, was suspended after appearing to back a message criticising Facebook's decision to ban the former English Defence leader from its pages. The message contained a doctored image of the movie The Patriot featuring Mr Robinson's face superimposed on the body of the main character, played in the film by Mel Gibson. It said Mr Robinson's Facebook ban was due to him being ""racist to Muslims"", arguing that this was a ""disgraceful injustice"" and ""this corruptness needs to stop"". At the time of his suspension, Mr Bowles insisted he had not meant to endorse Mr Robinson's ""racist and intolerant views"" which he found abhorrent.  Instead, he said he had wanted to make the point that ""silencing"" the campaigner risked turning him into a martyr.  Speaking on Monday, he again apologised for any offence caused by his tweet and disclosed he had received an email from the Mr Lewis' office reinstating his party membership.  The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said no reason had been given by the party for the decision. A Conservative Party spokeswoman said its complaints process was rightly confidential, so as to ""protect the anonymity of potential complainants, so they can come forward in confidence"". ""Selective cases do not provide a complete picture of how complaints are dealt with,"" she said. Shadow equalities minister Naz Shah expressed concern about the speed with which Mr Bowles had had his suspension lifted, suggesting it showed the Conservatives were not taking the issue seriously.  ""They can start by adopting the All-Party Parliamentary Group for British Muslims' definition of Islamophobia, as Labour has done,"" she said. ""But what the Tories really need is an independent inquiry to root out this and other forms of racism within their ranks."" Facebook removed Mr Robinson's official page and Instagram profile last month, saying its contents violated its policies on hate speech and the social network's community standards."

The one-time communist and adviser to former first minister Jack McConnell was given the award just five months into her role by the Herald newspaper. Ms Freeman saw off competition from fellow SNP cabinet member Mike Russell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson to win the title. Mental health campaigner Gillian Murray was named Campaigner of the Year. Her work helped secure a review of care services offered by NHS Tayside following the death of her uncle David Ramsay by suicide in 2016. Ms Freeman took on the role of health secretary in a reshuffle when Shona Robison resigned, citing personal challenges, amid accusations that she had presided over a series of failings in the NHS.  She made changes within weeks of being promoted to Nicola Sturgeon's Cabinet and went on to set out a three-year plan, backed with £850m of funding, in a bid to meet a series of key waiting time targets for NHS Scotland. She also announced NHS board debts were being written off as part of the introduction of a new medium-term financial framework. Speaking after being given the prize at an awards ceremony at Edinburgh's Prestonfield House Hotel, Ms Freeman said: ""I've come a long way from being a student communist, haven't I, and it was a fine discipline to learn. ""One of the things you learn when you move on from that discipline is the point of politics is to make a difference, and the make a difference you have to get elected."" She added: ""The point of politics is to make a difference, that's why we do it. We shouldn't do it to be somebody, we should do it to do something."" Labour's Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney won Best Scot at Westminster, in part in recognition for his lobbying of the UK government in immigration cases such as that of Giorgi Kakava, a 10-year-old orphan who had been threatened with deportation following the death of his mother. While Mr Russell lost out on the top prize, he was named as the Donald Dewar Debater of the Year after spending much of his last year taking on the Tories over Brexit. Meanwhile former minister Bruce Crawford was honoured as the Committee MSP of the Year after the finance and constitution committee he chairs sat through marathon sessions scrutinising the Scottish government's Brexit continuity bill. Kate Forbes, who was made Digital Economy Minister was named as the One to Watch following both her promotion to the government and her campaigning efforts to try to end the use of plastic drinking straws. Efforts to tackle the problem of everyday Islamophobia by Labour MSP Anas Sarwar saw him receive the award for Community MSP of the Year, with Mr Sarwar having set up a cross party group at Holyrood as part of this work. Meanwhile, Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser was given the Politics in Business Award, and Ms Sturgeon was awarded the E-Politician of the Year for her effective use of Twitter, and Dundee City Council leader John Alexander was named Scottish Local Politician of the Year."

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said teachers should be able to ""appropriately show images of the prophet"" in class. Protests have been staged outside Batley Grammar School, where a teacher has been suspended. The West Yorkshire school has apologised ""unequivocally"".  Head teacher Gary Kibble said the member of staff had been suspended since the image was used in a lesson on Monday.  Demonstrators gathered for a second day on Friday morning, but had moved on by mid-afternoon. The school, which had been due to break up for the Easter holiday, was understood to have switched to a day of remote learning and the gates remained locked. Mr Jenrick called for the ""deeply unsettling"" scenes outside the school to ""come to an end"". ""In a free society we want religions to be taught to children and for children to be able to question and query them,"" he told the BBC. ""We must see teachers protected and no-one should be feeling intimidated or threatened as they go into school."" Protesters had demanded the teacher's sacking, while some parents who spoke to the BBC said they didn't agree with the demonstrations and found them ""intimidating"". As a crowd gathered on Friday, one protester read out a statement at the school gates. He said the group ""do not accept that the school has taken this issue seriously, given that it's taken them four days to merely suspend only one of the teachers involved"". Another protester, who gave his name only as Mr Hussain, told the PA news agency he was a parent at the school and said: ""We would not like any form of extremism, any extremist viewpoints, to be taught to children."" MEND, which helps Muslims engage with British media and politics, said its Islamophobia Response Unit had been helping ""several"" parents liaise with the school over the issue. Deputy chair Dr Shazad Amin, said he saw ""no problem"" with blasphemy being discussed at the school but said the particular image shown to pupils was ""deeply offensive"" and ""furthered stereotypes and anti-Islamic tropes"". As a result, he said people in the local community had ""a right to feel hurt and a right to feel angry"" but called for them to allow the matter to be properly investigated. He said parents were ""fairly positive"" with the action taken so far by the school. Former Conservative Party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the debate has been hijacked by ""extremists on both sides"" to fuel a ""culture war"" at the expense of ""kids and their learning"".   She told the BBC she had spoken to pupils and parents over the last 24 hours and ""that many pupils were left distressed because of what happened"". Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, she said: ""It's about safeguarding children and making sure the school look again, as should every school, to ensure that every pupil in their school is being taught in a way which creates a positive, unifying learning environment."" By Corinne Wheatley, BBC News Around a dozen or so protestors who remained outside Batley Grammar School for most of the morning have now left.  The school was due to break up for the Easter holiday today, but the gates are locked and the school is shut.  The protesters here this morning said they wanted to keep things peaceful after concerns were raised yesterday about threats and intimidation towards school staff.  Some passers-by told me they wanted the protest to wind down so they could work on a dialogue with school and to bring an end to the disruption to the local community. Labour MP for Batley and Spen, Tracey Brabin, condemned those who ""seek to fan the flames of this incident"", and said she welcomed the school's apology. In a statement, she said: ""No teacher should be facing intimidation or threats, there is no excuse for that. ""The focus must be on the welfare and education of the children at this school."" West Yorkshire Police said no arrests had been made and officers remained at the school.  Parts of the Koran are taken to mean that neither Allah nor Muhammad can be captured in an image by human hand and any attempt to do so is seen as an insult. Head teacher Mr Kibble said the teacher had ""given their most sincere apologies"" and been suspended pending an investigation. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called for the school to be allowed to investigate the matter ""without a running commentary in the media, on social media, and outside the school gates"". A petition calling for the teacher to be reinstated has received more than 10,000 signatures. In a statement on Thursday, the Department for Education said it was ""never acceptable to threaten or intimidate teachers"" and that they encouraged dialogue between schools and parents when issues emerged. Kirklees Council said Batley Grammar is an academy school so the authority only has a ""very limited role"" in its running but said it was pleased to see the school had taken ""swift action"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-54432509,'Close mosques' councillor did not breach code,"Councillors accept the ruling on Conservative Beverley Dunlop, but condemn her comments.",6 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A Tory councillor accused of making Islamophobic comments on social media did not breach a council's code of conduct, an investigator has ruled. In one post, Dorset councillor Beverley Dunlop suggested banning mosques. Independent investigator Tim Darsley said she had been acting in a personal capacity when she made the comments.  Members of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council's standards committee accepted the report but condemned the ""unacceptable"" remarks. Several posts made by the Moordown ward councillor in two different Facebook groups were included in a dossier sent to The Guardian, highlighting alleged Islamophobia among Conservative councillors, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. In one of the posts, Ms Dunlop said: ""I hate to ban anything really but I'd suggest we start with mosques."" In another she said fundamentalists were ""hiding in plain sight in the Muslim community"" and that this would not change ""until they are more frightened of the British government (because they and their families might get deported) than they are Isis"". Ms Dunlop said her comments had been taken out of context. However, a formal complaint was made to the council by Bournemouth University lecturer Osman Ahmed in November last year. He said the comments brought the council ""into disrepute"" and Ms Dunlop should be ""removed from her position"". The council's standards committee agreed to accept Mr Darsley's finding. However, chairman Steve Baron, from the Poole People Party, said the remarks ""could be looked at as bringing the council into disrepute"". Green Party councillor Chris Rigby said the comments were ""not acceptable"" whether made in a public or private capacity. Conservative member Ann Stribley said: ""This 'get out of jail' card is not a good enough excuse if we want to be respected in the public arena."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50079997,Don't stigmatise Muslims says Macron amid veil row,"Protests erupt in France as a Muslim mother accuses a far-right politician of ""racial violence"".",17 Oct 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"French President Emmanuel Macron has warned against ""stigmatising"" Muslims or linking the Islamic religion with the fight against terrorism. ""We have to stand together with all our fellow citizens,"" Mr Macron said during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday. It came as a French woman said she was taking legal action against far-right politicians who criticised her for wearing an Islamic headscarf in public. France has about five million Muslims. It is the largest Muslim minority in Western Europe. Wearing the Muslim headscarf or veil - known as a hijab - is banned in French schools, and for public servants at their place of work. France is officially a secular state and body-covering garments have been at the centre of a number of controversies in recent years. Last week, a Muslim mother who wore a headscarf during a school trip with her son to the regional parliament in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in eastern France received verbal abuse from the chamber.  An image of the woman - given the name Fatima - embracing her son was widely shared after footage of the incident was posted on social media. It also sparked street demonstrations in the area and has renewed a national debate over the Muslim veil. France currently has no law banning mothers from wearing the hijab on school trips.  On Wednesday, Mr Macron called for a better understanding of the Muslim religion in France and condemned what he described as the ""fatal shortcut"" of linking Islam with terrorism. ""There is a lot of irresponsibility among political commentators,"" he said, adding: ""Communalism is not terrorism."" Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer made clear that the law did not ban women accompanying children from wearing headscarves, although he then said his personal opinion was that wearing a headscarf was ""not desirable in our society"". The incident at the regional parliament building in eastern France occurred during a school trip on Friday 11 October in which Fatima accompanied her young son.  A politician from Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally - formerly known as the National Front - saw her during a debate and ordered her to remove her veil.  Julien Odoul posted his verbal exchange on Twitter along with a message citing a fatal knife attack on four police officers in Paris earlier this month which has been linked to Islamist radicalisation.  ""After the murder of our four policemen, we cannot tolerate this [provocation],"" he wrote.  In an interview with the group Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), Fatima said she was sitting quietly in a corner of the room when she heard someone shout ""in the name of secularism"".  ""People started screaming and getting upset,"" she told CCIF (in French), adding: ""The only thing I saw was the distress of the children - they were really shocked and traumatised. ""I tried to reassure them... my son approached me and jumped on me, crying. I told them I could not stay."" Her lawyer, Sana Ben Hadj, said her client felt ""humiliated"" after images of the incident were widely shared. CCIF said Fatima was filing a complaint in the city of Dijon over ""violence of a racial nature committed... by persons with public authority"", adding that a further complaint would be filed in Paris for ""incitement of racial hatred"". The incident has also sparked a debate over mothers wearing a headscarf going on school trips, when teachers are not allowed to.  The education minister was widely criticised for suggesting the veil was ""not desirable"", and Marine Le Pen has called for it to be banned on school trips. A ban on Muslim headscarves and other ""conspicuous"" religious symbols at state schools in France was introduced in 2004. It received overwhelming political and public support in a country where the separation of state and religion is enshrined in law. In 2011, France became the first European country to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public places, while alternatives such as hijabs, which cover the head and hair, remained legal. Under the ban no woman, French or foreign, is able to leave their home with their face hidden behind a veil without running the risk of a fine. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose administration introduced the ban, said veils oppressed women and were ""not welcome"" in France. Correction 20 November 2019: This article has since been updated to make clear that the ban on headscarves in public relates to public servants in their place of work."

Yasmin, 17, was racially abused as she walked home with a friend in Oswestry. She said her mother, who wears a hijab and has also been racially abused, would have preferred her not to have gone to the police, due to a lack of trust in authorities. However, Yasmin said this attitude meant incidents going underreported, particularly in rural areas. She said a young boy, whom she believed to be in primary school, shouted a highly offensive term. ""I laughed a bit and said I'd not heard that for a while - it's been a couple of years,"" she said. It led to her recalling other incidents in the past which she did not report. ""I remember this one boy, before he'd even met me, went round after the Manchester attack and kept telling everyone that teachers should check my bags in case I had a bomb coming into the school,"" she said. Yasmin said if her friend had not been with her last month, she probably ""wouldn't have told anyone"". ""My family doesn't talk about racism, it's the elephant in the room which is covered up,"" she said. The teenager, who turns 18 this month, was interviewed by West Mercia Police after her friend reported the latest abuse.  When the 17-year-old gave a statement to officers, she said her mother was ""a bit angry"".  ""I told her I wasn't the one in trouble but she said 'no, it's still the police'. She's scared that something might happen to harm us more."" Yasmin said she believed such attitudes meant racism going unnoticed in areas like rural Shropshire. ""My mum, because she wears a hijab, she gets comments, people laughing at her, pointing at her,"" Yasmin said. ""It's very common, but it's not very talked about. We just think there's nothing you can do about it, so we don't make a big deal out of it."" In the 2020-21 financial year, there were 1,524 hate crimes recorded in the West Mercia Police force area, 69% of them having a racial marker. Police and Crime Commissioner John Campion told the BBC these offences were higher than previous years, which he called ""a worrying trend"". ""We need to make sure all communities in West Mercia have confidence in their police service,"" he said. ""What's worrying is that loads isn't reported - there's lots out there that people are just putting up with. ""We don't have to put up with these crimes, something can be done.""

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has appealed for calm and promised to take strict action against the attackers.  The victim, a tailor named Kanhaiya Lal, was killed in Udaipur district in north India on Tuesday by the men, who filmed the act and posted it online. They said the act was in response to his support for a politician's dividing remarks about the Prophet Muhammad. The National Investigative Agency - India's top anti-terrorism agency - is carrying out a probe. A senior police officer told reporters that the police had found early evidence that one of the accused men had links with a group in Pakistan. Islamabad, however, has denied such reports, calling them ""mischievous"". The BBC's Nitin Srivastava, who's in Udaipur, said the streets were empty and communities were living in fear of religious violence.  He added that there was heavy deployment of police forces across the city and senior officers were constantly appealing for peace. Most people were unprepared for a curfew, with many now struggling to get hold of even basic rations.  ""Daily wagers are worst affected,"" said Mukesh Gardiya, a local man. ""All that's happened is a big shock.""  The government has suspended internet services and banned large gatherings. Police have arrested the two men, who had identified themselves in the video. In another video, the accused boasted about the murder and also issued threats to Prime Minister Narendra Modi while brandishing cleavers. A top Rajasthan police official asked media outlets not to broadcast the video of the murder as it was ""too grisly to watch"". The men posed as customers to enter Kanhaiya Lal's shop, and attacked him while he was taking their measurements.  The victim had allegedly put up a social media post supporting former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nupur Sharma, who made controversial comments about the Prophet Muhammad last month. Her comments sparked a diplomatic row with several Islamic countries registering strong protests with India. The BJP subsequently suspended Ms Sharma from the party. The controversy also led to religious protests in India which turned violent after demonstrators threw stones and damaged public property. Three weeks before his murder, Kanhaiya Lal had been arrested by the police for allegedly hurting religious feelings, the Indian Express reported. He had asked for police protection after his release, citing threats to his life. The police then called some Hindus and Muslims for a peace meeting, after which Kanhaiya Lal said he didn't ""need any more action against any one"", a police official told the newspaper. The incident has been condemned by prominent politicians across party lines in India.  Former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who belongs to the BJP, blamed Mr Gehlot's Congress party government, saying ""a situation of communal frenzy and violence has arisen in the state"". Some BJP leaders have said they will march in the national capital Delhi to protest against the killing.  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the murder and called for immediate punishment for the attackers. Some prominent Muslim organisations have also condemned the murder. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board called the incident ""highly condemnable"", adding that it was against both Indian law as well as Islamic strictures. ""Nobody can be allowed to take the law into their hands and declaring someone a criminal and then murdering them is a highly condemnable act,"" the board said in a statement."

Stephen Antony Savva, a candidate for Brimsdown ward on Enfield Council, made the Twitter comments in 2017 and 2018. In one post, he asked people coming to the UK to ""stop dressing funny"". Enfield North Conservatives said Mr Savva had been suspended from the party after ""reports of offensive tweets"". The association said: ""We are currently investigating the matter and take reports such as these extremely seriously."" One tweet from Mr Savva's account, uncovered by national anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate, stated: ""How about the removal of all immigrants?""  The tweet continued: ""Wouldn't that be wonderful? Just think of all the homes that would suddenly become available? All those school places?"" A reply from Mr Savva's account to an article about TV chef Nadiya Hussain, revealing that she suffers Islamophobic abuse on social media, stated: ""As a westerner she shouldn't wear a headdress. If she integrated more, she wouldn't suffer any abuse."" A further post stated that Mr Savva believed ""those who are privileged enough to come and live here should live by our ways. And stop dressing funny"". Mr Savva previously stood for the Conservatives in Southbury ward, Enfield, in 2014. Gregory Davis, a researcher at Hope Not Hate, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service before the suspension was announced that the comments had made clear that Mr Savva was a ""wildly inappropriate candidate"". Mr David said Mr Savva ""cannot possibly represent the best interests of a diverse constituency"". Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission said Mr Savva would still appear as a Tory candidate on ballot papers during England's local elections on Thursday. ""The nomination process for the elections is now complete and the ballot papers have been printed so a candidate cannot be removed,"" a spokeswoman said.  However, the Conservatives were no longer required to consider Mr Savva as representing the party. ""It would be a matter for the party to make clear to electors that a candidate no longer represented the party if that was the case,"" she added. The controversy comes weeks after another party member in Enfield, Colin Davis, resigned from his position as chair of Enfield Southgate Conservative Association when a photo appearing to show him wear Nazi uniform in the 1980s was uncovered.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49234594,Tories 'will order Islamophobia inquiry',But the party chairman is criticised for saying it must settle on a definition of Islamophobia first.,5 Aug 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservative Party will order an independent inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia within its ranks, the chairman has confirmed. But James Cleverly was criticised for saying the party must agree a definition of Islamophobia first. Earlier this year, the Tories rejected a definition created by a cross-party group of MPs and backed by several other parties, including Labour. Tory peer Baroness Warsi accused her party of ""political hypocrisy"". She said Labour had used exactly the same argument around a definition when it was accused of failing to tackle anti-Semitism, and her Tory colleagues had ""rightly criticised"" them for that. ""And yet we are now adopting exactly the approach we condemned,"" the party's first female Muslim cabinet member tweeted. Since 2018, the Muslim Council of Britain has been calling for the Tories to launch an independent inquiry into alleged Islamophobia, and in May, the council formally asked the UK's human rights watchdog, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), to hold one. The MCB has listed a series of complaints against figures in the party, including Boris Johnson for comments he made about Muslim women before becoming prime minister.   Asked on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether there would be an independent inquiry into the issue, Mr Cleverly replied: ""Yes there will be."" Pressed on whether it would look specifically at Islamophobia or more broadly at all forms of prejudice, he continued: ""One of the things we need to get is the definition of that, so specifically on that point we will be guided by a formal definition of Islamophobia. ""But the point is we do, and will always, take firm action on anyone who steps outside the boundaries of appropriate behaviour."" During the Conservative leadership race, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid challenged the other candidates to commit to an external investigation and the others appeared to agree to it. Later though, Mr Johnson claimed he understood they had committed to an inquiry ""into all types of prejudice and discrimination including anti-Semitism"", not Islamophobia specifically. The EHRC is already investigating Labour over allegations of anti-Semitism. The MCB said the definition of Islamophobia must reflect the lived experiences of Muslims. ""An inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party has been long-awaited and will be welcomed if it is sufficiently independent and robust. Words must be followed by action."" The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims came up with its definition earlier this year and it was endorsed by Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Conservatives and several Muslim groups. It states: ""Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."" A government spokesman said the wording needed ""further careful consideration"" and had ""not been broadly accepted"". Concerns were raised, including by the chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, that the definition was too vague and could undermine efforts to tackle extremism."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44410597,Austria to shut seven 'political' mosques,The government's crackdown mostly targets imams alleged to have Turkish nationalist links.,8 Jun 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Austria has said it will close down seven mosques and expel imams who it says are funded by foreign countries.  Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the move was a crackdown on political Islam. Some mosques are suspected of having links to Turkish nationalists. In April images emerged showing children in Turkish army uniforms re-enacting the World War One Battle of Gallipoli. The Turkish president's office called Austria's move ""Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory"". Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin took to Twitter to condemn the move. The Austrian government says 60 of the 260 imams in the country are being investigated, of whom 40 belong to ATIB, an Islamic organisation in Austria close to the Turkish government.  ""Parallel societies, political Islam and radicalisation tendencies have no place in our country,"" said Chancellor Kurz on Friday. The Gallipoli re-enactment performance took place in a Vienna mosque reported to be run by ATIB.  The WW1 battle, one of the last victories of the Ottoman Empire, stopped Allied forces reaching its capital, Constantinople. Austrian media report (in German) that the child actors played dead and were covered with Turkish flags.  Separately, Austrian public broadcaster ORF says photos of children doing the Turkish nationalist Grey Wolves greeting came from a mosque in Vienna's Favoriten district run by the Grey Wolves, a group with branches in several countries. The government is dissolving an organisation called the Arab Religious Community. Six of the mosques targeted for closure are run by it: three in Vienna, two in Upper Austria and one in Carinthia.  In neighbouring Germany, police have been probing links between certain imams and the Turkish state, which funds a Muslim organisation called Ditib. The Austrian authorities have been working with a Muslim community body called IGGÖ to identify mosques and imams suspected of radical Islamist or nationalist connections. They have soured significantly in recent years.  Mr Kurz's election campaign last year drew heavily on anxiety about immigration and the integration of Muslims. His conservative People's Party (ÖVP) formed a coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). Mr Kurz wants the EU to break off Turkey's EU membership negotiations - a stance that has angered Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In May 2017 that anger led Turkey to veto Nato's co-operation with Austria. The move disrupted Nato's partnership activities with 41 countries. Turkey is a key player in Nato operations. President Erdogan's ruling AK Party has roots in political Islam and espouses traditional Muslim values.  He is campaigning for re-election, and both Austria and Germany are wary of his political influence in their Turkish communities.  The governments in Austria and other Central European countries - Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland - want to restrict Muslim immigration to Europe. There is friction between them and Germany, which took in about one million mainly Muslim asylum seekers in 2015.  Turkey is housing more than three million Syrian refugees and says the EU is not doing enough to help."

These could include closing schools, encouraging home working and holding sporting and other events behind closed doors.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47609814,Erdogan shows NZ attack video at rallies,New Zealand says airing footage of the mosque attacks at Turkish rallies endangers its citizens.,18 Mar 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been criticised for showing some of the New Zealand mosque gunman's video to bolster support at election rallies. Mr Erdogan said part of gun suspect Brenton Tarrant's manifesto was to keep Turks from Europe. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters told Turkish officials showing the video was ""unfair"" and endangered his country's citizens abroad. Friday's attack on two mosques in Christchurch left 50 people dead. The attacker live-streamed video of the killings and it was widely shared and downloaded as social media firms raced to take the footage down. In New Zealand the footage has been classified as an objectionable publication and it is an offence to distribute or possess it. Sunday's rallies were aimed at galvanising support among his conservative power base ahead of a local election at the end of this month. The prime motive was to condemn global Islamophobia - along with the West's response to it - and to criticise political opponents inside Turkey as weak. Mr Erdogan pointed to specific mentions of Turkey by the suspect in his manifesto. The president said the suspect had visited Turkey twice and wanted Turkish Muslims removed from Turkey's European territory on the western side of the Bosphorus. Mr Erdogan told a rally in Gaziantep: ""What does it say? That we shouldn't go west of the Bosporus, meaning Europe. Otherwise, he would come to Istanbul, kill us all, drive us out of our land."" Semi-blurred footage of part of the mosque attack was shown on screens at at least three rallies, along with extracts said to be from the online manifesto. Mr Erdogan also criticised the leader of Turkey's main opposition CHP party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, showing a clip of him talking about ""terrorism rooted in the Islamic world"". Mr Peters said he had made clear his opposition to Turkish officials who have travelled to New Zealand in the wake of the killings, including Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. Mr Peters said: ""Anything of that nature that misrepresents this country - given that [the suspect] was a non-New Zealand citizen - imperils the future and safety of the New Zealand people and our people abroad and it's totally unfair. ""We had a long dialogue on the need for any other country, or Turkey for that matter, to ensure that our country, New Zealand, was not misrepresented."" CHP spokesman Faik Oztrak, quoted by the Anadolu news agency, condemned Mr Erdogan for trying to make political capital out of the tragedy. ""Is it worth showing this bloody massacre in order to gain a few more votes?"" he asked. The attacks were live-streamed on the suspect's Facebook page and, despite the original being taken down, footage was quickly replicated and shared widely on other platforms, including YouTube and Twitter. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack around the world in the first 24 hours. But it also found its way on to the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. In the UK the Daily Mirror and MailOnline came under attack for publishing the footage and several Australian media outlets also broadcast it. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that Facebook and other social media giants had ""further questions"" to answer about how they responded to the event. ""Obviously these social media platforms have wide reach,"" she said. ""This is an issue that goes well beyond New Zealand."" An 18-year-old appeared in court in New Zealand on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream under a law experts said was commonly used to target the sharing of child pornography.  The teenager was also charged with publishing a photograph of the mosque with the message ""target acquired"" and faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each charge, according to the prosecution."

One worshipper knocked the axe from the man's hands, and held him down until police arrived, local media reports. A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene in the suburb of Mississauga, and he has since been charged. Some congregants had minor injures from the bear spray, the mosque's imam said. One of the worshippers said the experience was ""terrifying"" and described hearing a scream before turning around to see a man holding an axe and using bear spray - similar to pepper spray - against three people. ""By the time he was spraying, the people in the first row realized something was going on and one of the young men turned around and knocked away the axe before he had a chance to use it,"" Noorani Sairally told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. The young man then held the alleged assailant down until police arrived, the witness said. ""Before he could inflict harm on any worshippers, several congregants bravely were able to stop him in his tracks,"" imam Ibrahim Hindy said in a statement, describing the moment the attacker entered the site. ""Our community will never be broken and we refuse to be intimidated,"" he added. Police have named the man they arrested as Mohammad Moiz Omar, and charged him with six offences including assault with a weapon and administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm. Following initial uncertainty over a possible motive, investigators now say they believe the attack was a ""hate-motivated incident."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of a number of high-profile Canadian public figures to condemn the attack, which he described as ""incredibly disturbing"" and applauded the courage of the worshippers at the mosque. Canada's Muslim community has been targeted in a number of deadly attacks, including in 2017 when a shooting at a Quebec City mosque killed six people and left another eight wounded. And last year, four members of the same Muslim family were killed after a vehicle hit them in London, Ontario, which was described by police as a deliberate Islamophobic attack."

The Ealing Central and Acton MP described then-chancellor Mr Kwarteng as ""superficially black"", at a Labour Party fringe event in September. Labour suspended the whip, which meant she had to sit as an independent MP. Ms Huq, who said she fully accepted the sanction, has apologised and completed anti-racism training. She made the remarks during a Q&A session at a fringe event called What's Next for Labour's Agenda on Race? Ms Huq said: ""He's superficially, he's, a black man but again he's got more in common... he went to Eton, he went to a very expensive prep school, all the way through top schools in the country. ""If you hear him on the Today programme you wouldn't know he's black."" Mr Kwarteng, who had become chancellor earlier that month, was born in east London and has Ghanaian heritage. A recording of those comments was published by the Guido Fawkes website, causing a backlash. Then-Conservative Party chairman Jake Berry described Ms Huq's comments as ""racist"" and ""disgusting"". Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the remarks were ""unacceptable"", while the party's foreign affairs spokesman David Lammy described the comments as ""unfortunate"" adding: ""I wouldn't have made them myself."" Ms Huq then tweeted an apology, saying she had offered ""sincere and heartfelt apologies"" to Mr Kwarteng directly for her ""ill-judged"" comments.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61679347,Anti-terror strategy 'failing to engage Muslims',"The UK is failing to explain its counter-extremism programme to Muslim communities, an advisor says.",3 Jun 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The government's flagship counter-extremism Prevent strategy is failing to engage with Muslim communities, a government adviser has said. Dame Sara Khan said a ""vacuum"" of information about its purpose had been left by the government, which was then being filled by Islamists.  She added the government must address the concerns of Muslim communities. Dame Sara also said fears of racism accusations made some local authorities uncomfortable with tackling extremism. The controversial Prevent scheme was launched in 2007 and was designed to stop people becoming terrorists and to reduce the terror threat to the UK by stopping people from being drawn into terrorism. In the year to March 2020, just over 6,000 people were referred to the Prevent scheme in England and Wales, because of concerns they were at risk of radicalisation. However, it has long been criticised by some Muslim groups for what they see as an unfair focus on their communities.  Speaking on the BBC's Political Thinking podcast, Dame Sara said the government had failed to explain what the counter-terror strategy is to Muslim communities, which ""in essence... left a vacuum"" about the purpose of the scheme to be ""dominated"" by Islamists. ""So those types of challenges have continued and I think continuing to engage with communities, explaining what the programme is, addressing concerns - that's got to continue in a much better way than we've seen previously,"" she added. Dame Sara - a human rights campaigner who advises the government on social cohesion - has been a vocal supporter of Prevent, but has faced previous allegations of being too close to the Home Office.   This intervention, from an adviser admired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, comes as ministers are preparing to publish a review into how effective the strategy is.  Dame Sara, who now advises levelling up secretary Michael Gove on how local communities can counter extremism, also claimed that some groups have used accusations of Islamophobia as a cover for extremist practices.  She said she had seen examples of local councillors who felt unable to push back against the radicalisation of young Muslims.  Dame Sara is not the only Conservative critic of the scheme, with former justice secretary Robert Buckland arguing last year that it needs urgent work and a more ""joined up"" approach, following the killing of Sir David Amess. It later emerged that the man suspected of killing Sir David had been referred to Prevent in the past. You can listen to Political Thinking: The Sara Khan One on BBC Sounds"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-12375175,Eyewitness: EDL return to Luton,"What happened when the English Defence League staged a ""homecoming"" demonstration in Luton?",6 Feb 2011,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"This video can not be played Abdul Salaam supports the EDL even though he says he is a Muslim Abdul Salaam is not exactly the kind of person the English Defence League expected to recruit. But there he was, a Muslim willing to stand in the middle of a crowd chanting ""Muslim Bombers off our Streets"".  We found Glaswegian Abdul in Luton's St George's Square - and he explained why he, a follower of Islam, was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with an organisation accused of Islamophobia.  ""The EDL are supporting England, supporting Britain, and I'm British, so why can't I support my country?"" he said.  ""Have you seen me getting any racist abuse? They applauded me. Why are other Muslims not here? This demonstration is nothing to do with colour or religion. These are people who have watched their country being bombed and they are angry. These are patriotic Englishmen, red-blooded Englishmen."" EDL divisions: Groups from all over the UK Mr Salaam said he wasn't particularly assiduous about praying five times a day - and that he probably didn't get to a mosque as much as he should. But he insisted he was a true Muslim who thought deeply about his faith - and it was his duty to speak out alongside the EDL.  ""I'm here to support Britain and to defend Islam as well,"" he said. ""There are people who, under the name of Islam, blew up trains. They're not Muslims, they're hypocrites. When people have dragged Islam through the mud, it's my duty to speak out as a Muslim."" This was not the demonstration the EDL hoped it would be.  The police say there were 1,500 EDL supporters in the town, plus another 1,000 in the Unite Against Fascism counter-demonstration.  What had been billed as a demonstration ""Back To Where It All Began"" did not have the air of a triumphant movement sweeping all before it.  The EDL is almost two years old - but police forces have now developed tactics to prevent a repeat of some of the early three-way violent clashes between EDL supporters, anti-racism campaigners and fired-up young Muslim men.  The risk of those clashes disappeared behind massive steel barriers that the police used to seal the EDL in to St George's Square. They wanted to make a show in the hometown of their founders - but there was nobody around to see it.  On the streets of England: Police barrier in Luton Luton was a ghost town. Large parts were deserted from 10am. Police had warned businesses what to expect - and owners shut up and boarded up. The massive Â£800,000 police operation worked - but at some cost to the local economy.  But many of the EDL's supporters who turned out for the speeches thought it was still a day well spent. Their leaders described the movement as a bulwark against terrorism. They praised Prime Minister David Cameron's speech earlier the same day, in which he attacked multiculturalism.  Stephen Lennon, aka Tommy Robinson, one of the movement's founders, looked on chuffed as the crowd sang about joining ""Tommy's revolution"".  The EDL's leaders say the movement isn't racist - but many of the placards were pretty offensive to the few ordinary Muslims who saw them. And with the British National Party suffering internal battles, the organisation is now attracting the attention of a wide spread of international far right anti-Islamic activists.  Among those who had flown in was the bearded figure of Nachum Shifren, a controversial Los Angeles Rabbi.  ""I'm a supporter of the EDL,"" he said, standing next to a group of cropped-haired men from the EDL's Walsall, Leeds and Essex ""divisions"".  ""I see radical Islam popping up, I see governments caving in to it. I see a lot of lawlessness going on because of political correctness. ""I believe in the EDL and I don't want England to go the way of Paris. Do you realise there is a mile down the street where I cannot walk and get out alive?"" He was referring to Bury Park, the heart of Luton's Muslim communities - and this claim of ""no go"" areas for white people around the country was repeated time and time again by EDL members we interviewed.  Communities in fear But when we went to Bury Park, it was fairly clear that it was the local Muslim residents who were scared.  Standing by in Bury Park: Young men on the watch Just like in town, entire parades of shops had closed. Women and children were nowhere to be seen on what should have been the busiest day of the week.  Men and teenage boys were out in some force, nervously looking in the direction of the town centre and the police lines at the bottom of the hill.  Conspicuous by their absence, though, was the small group of hardcore Islamists whose 2009 protest against soldiers returning to Luton from Afghanistan had caused so much anger across the town. Stewards - one of whom was a local Christian clergyman - politely asked visitors to identify themselves - but also asked anti-racist campaigners to keep out to avoid inflaming tensions.  Jangir Khan, chairman of the Bury Park Business Association, was among those involved in organising the community's security - but like everyone else, he wasn't happy.  ""This is the busiest day of the week for the local economy,"" he said. ""If you close, then you lose 100% of income. Those who've stayed open have probably lost 90% because nobody is coming out. They are stuck in their homes.  ""We asked for the EDL to be banned from this town and the police said it couldn't be done. Well what about our human rights to go about our daily lives without fear?"" Some young men had travelled down from Birmingham, presenting themselves as the ""Muslim Defence League"". They were small in number and did not attempt to stage a public show of strength.  Overall, the Bury Park community had decided, in the words of one local leader, to make a dignified stand together, rather than to puff out their chests and make confrontational noises.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64360528,Turkey condemns 'vile' Sweden Quran-burning protest,Turkey earlier called off a visit by Sweden's defence minister Pal Jonson over the planned protest.,21 Jan 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Turkey has condemned the burning of a copy of the Quran during a protest in Sweden, describing it as a ""vile act"". It said the Swedish government's decision to allow the protest to go ahead was ""completely unacceptable"". It comes amid growing diplomatic tension between the two countries. Turkey, which had appealed to Sweden to stop the protest, earlier called off a visit by Sweden's Defence Minister, Pal Jonson, saying the trip had ""lost its significance and meaning"".  It was hoped the trip could dispel Ankara's objections to the Scandinavian country joining the Nato military alliance. Turkey has so far held up both Sweden and Finland's Nato applications. Turkey wants political concessions, including the deportation of critics of its President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Kurds that it claims are terrorists. Turkey is already a Nato member, which means it can block another country from joining. Sweden and Finland both applied to join Nato after Russia invaded Ukraine.  Rasmus Paludan, a politician from the Danish far-right Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, burnt a copy of the Quran during the protest on Saturday afternoon outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Turkey is a majority Muslim country. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement denouncing the act, which it said happened despite ""repeated warnings"". ""Permitting this anti-Islam act, which targets Muslims and insults our sacred values, under the guise of 'freedom of expression' is completely unacceptable,"" it said. It added that the burning of the Quran was another example of the ""alarming"" extent to which Islamophobia, racism and discrimination had reached Europe, and it called on the Swedish government to take ""necessary measures"".  Sweden's Foreign Minister, Tobias Billstrom, called the act ""appalling"".  ""Sweden has a far-reaching freedom of expression, but it does not imply that the Swedish government, or myself, support the opinions expressed,"" he wrote on Twitter. Separate protests both in support of and against Turkey were also held in Stockholm. After Turkey cancelled the Swedish defence minister's trip, Mr Jonson tweeted: ""Our relations with Turkey are very important to Sweden, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue on common security and defence issues at a later date."" Demonstrators in Stockholm last week hung an effigy of President Erdogan from a lamppost in what Sweden's Prime Minister said was an effort to sabotage Sweden's Nato application.  Mr Paludan held rallies last year at which he threatened to burn the Quran, sparking riots."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56314173,Switzerland votes to ban face coverings in public,"The referendum, brought by a far-right party, could affect Muslim women who wear the burka or niqab.",8 Mar 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Switzerland has narrowly voted in favour of banning face coverings in public, including the burka or niqab worn by Muslim women. Official results showed the measure had passed by 51.2% to 48.8% in Sunday's referendum. The proposal was put forward by the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) which campaigned with slogans such as ""Stop extremism"". A leading Swiss Islamic group said it was ""a dark day"" for Muslims. ""Today's decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority,"" the Central Council of Muslims said in a statement, adding that it would challenge the decision in court. The Swiss government had argued against the ban saying it was not up to the state to dictate what women wear. According to research by the University of Lucerne (in German), almost no-one in Switzerland wears a burka and only around 30 women wear the niqab. About 5% of Switzerland's population of 8.6 million people are Muslim, most originating from Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo. Swiss people are given a direct say in their own affairs under the country's system of direct democracy. They are regularly invited to vote on various issues in national or regional referendums. It is not the first time Islam has figured in a Swiss referendum. In 2009 citizens went against government advice and voted to ban the building of minarets - a proposal also put forward by the SVP which said minarets were a sign of Islamisation. The proposal in Sunday's referendum did not mention Islam directly and was also aimed at stopping violent street protesters from wearing masks. However, the vote was widely referred to as ""the burka ban"". The latest proposal predated the coronavirus pandemic, which has meant all Swiss adults having to wear masks in many settings. Analysis by Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Geneva Was today's vote about all face coverings, from niqabs and burkas to the scarves rioters sometimes pull over their faces?  That's what the Yes campaigners from the Swiss People's Party insisted - but their posters and literature said otherwise, showing threatening looking women in black niqabs, and warning of Islamic extremism.  So does the result mean the Swiss are becoming more extreme? Are they Islamophobic?  Perhaps not. In the end, the ban only just squeaked through. In the past the Swiss People's Party has had much bigger majorities for its populist initiatives, often aimed at restricting asylum and immigration.  It successfully pushed through a ban on minarets in 2009 with a similar campaign to this one. But the debate around face coverings touched all sorts of different nerves. Many Swiss feminists view the burka and niqab as oppressive to women but they also oppose laws telling women what they can and cannot wear. When it came to voting they were torn. A regular answer from women asked whether they would support the ban was ""Jein"", a cross between ""Ja"" (yes) and ""Nein"" (no). Today's close vote in Switzerland was probably very much a ""Jein"" as well. Sanija Ameti, a member of Switzerland's Muslim community, told the BBC that the campaign - and the depiction of Muslim women in the posters - had been upsetting.  ""So many Muslims in Switzerland will feel insulted and not part of this society, and pushed into a corner where they don't belong. We don't look like these women in the pictures, we just don't,""  she said. However, others in the Muslim community supported the ban.  Imam Mustafa Memeti, from the city of Bern, told the BBC he thought the motivation behind the campaign was ""probably Islamophobic"". But he said he supported the ban anyway because it could help to emancipate Muslim women in Switzerland. Ahead of the vote, Walter Wobmann, chairman of the referendum committee and an SVP lawmaker, described Muslim face coverings as ""a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland"". ""In Switzerland our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms,"" he said. Amnesty International spoke out against the proposed ban, calling it ""a dangerous policy that violates women's rights, including to freedom of expression and religion"". The wearing of Islamic veils in public has been a controversial topic in other European countries. France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 while the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria and Bulgaria have put in place full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-47830317,Week ahead in Parliament,A lot of the agenda is up for grabs after the Easter recess was cancelled - but Brexit will feature.,5 Apr 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Abandon certainty, all ye who enter... Next week's Parliamentary agenda exists - it's right there on the order papers for the Commons and Lords - but no one believes it provides any reliable guide to how events will unfold.  Brexit developments can be expected to reshape each day's agenda. Among the likely additions to the schedule are another round of ""indicative votes"" on alternative Brexit options, a report back from the emergency EU summit on Brexit, and votes on orders to trigger the European Parliamentary elections and to postpone Brexit Day again.  There might even be another attempt by the government to secure a ""Meaningful Vote"" on the prime minister's withdrawal agreement, perhaps with some added content to win over Labour MPs.  I'm not sure where these would be fitted into the schedule, but the leader of the House has left plenty of room for them, so she won't need a crowbar. And after a week which has seen nude protests, a tied Commons vote (not to mention a couple of near-ties), the constitutional innovation of MPs legislating to compel the government to change policy, a surreal filibuster in the Lords and then a flood which forced MPs out of the Commons, who is to say what might happen next?  In between times, there are bleak little jokes about ensuring MPs are supplied with copious quantities of used envelopes, so they can scribble new rules of procedure on the back of them as they go along. I'm told the Commons will be able to convene in their Chamber next week after the flood which struck on Thursday - officials are now confident they won't need to activate their contingency plans for an alternative.  And because this was original scheduled to be a recess week, there's not much action on the Committee Corridor, because the process of organising hearings with panels of witnesses can take quite a while.  So what follows is a brief canter through a rather thin-looking agenda, plus some speculation on the events which may be expected to disrupt it:   The Commons opens at 14.30 BST with Housing, Communities and Local Government Questions. As ever, expect a rash of ministerial statements and urgent questions to follow at 15:30, with the strong likelihood of a statement from the prime minister - or at least a UQ on her request to extend Britain's EU membership until the end of June.  MPs are then expected to consider two Brexit-related Statutory Instruments.  Then there will be a General Debate on UN International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.  But this could be interrupted to allow MPs to consider Lords amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 5) Bill - the measure proposed by Yvette Cooper, which would give the Commons some control over any proposed extension of UK membership of the EU.  The day after the Bill achieves Royal Assent, the prime minister will be required to put down a motion on the date of exit, which will be amendable by MPs.   In the Lords at 14:30, a scheduled debate on the residential construction sector has been cancelled in favour of continuing consideration of the Cooper Bill - aka the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 5) Bill.  Having disposed of the Second Reading on Thursday - after a long filibuster around the Business of the House Motion allowing the Bill to be considered - it has been agreed that peers will complete the Committee stage, Report stage and Third Reading by ""around 20:00"", allowing it to be sent back to the Commons so MPs can consider any amendments that have been made. First up in the Commons at 11.30 is Treasury Questions - which may see some open Brexiteer attacks on the Chancellor, Philip Hammond.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Conservative MP Bob Blackman - who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health - is the Tobacco Companies (Transparency) Bill, which will require the companies to disclose profits, taxes paid, and brand-specific sales and marketing data.  This would include data broken down to local authority level, by product type.  Mr Blackman says this information is already compiled and some of it is provided to HMRC, so his Bill would simply make existing information available to the public. MPs then vote on a series of Brexit SIs maintaining international sanctions against a series of countries - Burma, Venezuela, Iran and Guinea-Bissau to approve the (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.  And that is followed by a general debate on Housing. In Westminster Hall, Scottish Conservative John Lamont will lead a debate on the devolution of welfare at 9.30.  The Scotland Act 2016 devolved 11 DWP benefits totalling about £3bn to the Scottish Parliament.  Mr Lamont will focus on the Scottish Government plans to replace PIP, DLA, attendance allowance and carers allowance, which will not now be completed until 2024.  Other subjects for debate include regulation of the incineration of waste (at 11:00) and NHS funding for age-related macular degeneration (at 16:00).  On the Committee Corridor at 10:45, the special Joint Committee examining the Draft Domestic Abuse Bill will hear from a series of witnesses, including Councillor Simon Blackburn, chair of the Local Government Association's Safer, Stronger Communities Board, Hestia Housing and Support, and Donna Covey, the chief executive of AVA (Against Violence and Abuse). In the Lords at 14:30, peers will consider a series of Brexit related SIs.  MPs begin with 30 minutes of Northern Ireland questions at 11:30, followed by Prime Minister's Question Time at 12:00.  It may be that the PM is absent at the special EU summit on Brexit, in which case her stand in will be the de-facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Labour frontbencher Louise Haigh, is the Parental Rights (Rapists) and Family Courts Bill, designed to remove parental rights from men who father children through rape. The main debate is on the 50th Anniversary of the Continuous at Sea Deterrent - the UK's submarine-launched nuclear missiles.  Expect a key theme to be the issue of replacing the existing Trident submarines.  In Westminster Hall debates include:   On the Committee Corridor at 14:45, the Procedure Committee will ponders whether there should be a Commons Budget Committee, designed to provide better scrutiny of the overall way the government spends taxpayers' money. In the Lords at 15:00, peers will consider Commons amendments to the Offensive Weapons Bill and vote on a series of devolution-related statutory instruments. The Commons opens at 09:30 with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox - now an important player in Brexit issues.  That will be followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom.  If MPs are to sit on Friday to deal with urgent Brexit business, this is when the announcement may come.  Also possible is a report back from the prime minister on that EU summit, and talks about the postponement of Brexit Day.  The main scheduled business is a Backbench Debate on the definition of Islamophobia. In Westminster Hall at 13:30, Labour ex-minister David Hanson will lead a debate on preventing retail crime. In the Lords (11:00) there is another battery of SIs for peers to consider and they also debate the Draft National Policy Statement for Water Resources Infrastructure  And the agenda also contains an ominous little line: ""If necessary, the consideration of secondary legislation relating to exiting the EU"". This is the current default date for Britain to leave the EU.  At the moment, neither House is scheduled to sit. But Mrs Leadsom has warned that could change if there's a need to pass emergency legislation."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51567971,'Far-right extremist' behind Germany killings,Nine people are shot dead in two shisha bars in Hanau in a case being investigated as terrorism.,20 Feb 2020,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A suspected far-right extremist has killed at least nine people in attacks on two shisha bars in a city in western Germany, officials say. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were many signs the attacker in Hanau had acted out of racism.  Federal prosecutors are treating the case as terrorism. Turkey says at least five of the dead were Turkish citizens. The 43-year-old suspect killed himself, police say. He was found dead at his home along with the body of his mother. Local media have identified the suspect as Tobias R, a German citizen. The Bild tabloid reports he had a firearms licence, and that ammunition and gun magazines were found in his car. Authorities are examining a video that appears to be from the suspect, posted online days before the attacks, in which he expresses right-wing conspiracy theories. German media say he also left a letter of confession. The attack comes amid growing concerns about far-right violence in Germany. Speaking in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said: ""Racism is a poison. Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.""  The shootings took place around 22:00 (21:00 GMT) on Wednesday, and the first target was the Midnight shisha bar in the city centre of Hanau. Witnesses reported hearing about a dozen gunshots. The suspect then travelled in a dark car to the Kesselstadt neighbourhood, some 2.5km (1.5 mile) away, and opened fire at the Arena Bar & Cafe. Shisha bars are places where people gather to smoke a pipe known as shisha or hookah. Traditionally found in Middle Eastern and Asian countries, they are also popular in many other parts of the world. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expected the German government to make ""necessary efforts to throw light on all aspects"" of the attack. The shootings sparked an hours-long manhunt through the night while officers, supported by helicopters, searched for what they thought could have been more than one attacker. Police identified the gunman through information from witnesses and surveillance cameras. Early on Thursday, they stormed the suspect's home, near the scene of the second shooting, and found him dead near his 72-year-old mother.  Can-Luca Frisenna, whose father and brother run one of the two bars attacked, told Reuters news agency: ""I heard my father was affected and my little brother... I saw them both - they were horrified and they were crying and everything. So everyone was shocked."" Hanau, in Hesse state, is a city of 100,000 residents about 25km east of Frankfurt.  Hesse Interior Minister Peter Beuth said authorities were also examining a website attributed to the suspect. ""What we know so far is that there is definitely a xenophobic motive. Whether there are claims of responsibility or documents, that's still being investigated,"" he said. The suspect was not known to the authorities, Mr Beuth added. In a brief statement, Mrs Merkel also vowed to do everything possible to clarify the background to the attack, saying: ""There are many indications at the moment that the perpetrator acted on right-wing extremist, racist motives, out of hatred towards people of other origins, religion or appearance."" Gun laws in Germany are among the most stringent in the world, and were tightened further in recent years after other mass shootings.  Nazi salutes, banned swastika emblems and even the playing of the Horst Wessel, the one-time Nazi 'anthem' - all have been cropping up in far right extremist circles as Germany struggles to contain a growing wave of home-grown extremism.  The problem has been particularly acute in - but not confined to - the east of the country, in the former East Germany. There, unemployment levels have been higher than in the rest of Germany and a simmering resentment by some of recent immigrant arrivals has manifested itself in arson attacks on hostels.  In 2015 Germany opened its borders to an estimated 1.5 million refugees from the Middle East. Although the number of subsequent incidents involving them has been very small, their arrival has been used by far right extremists to stoke ethnic tensions and recruit more young men and women to their cause. Hanau Mayor Claus Kaminsky said it had been the ""hardest day in our history"". He said the city had seen centuries of peaceful coexistence between different faiths and cultures - ""That is why it is so hard to understand"". Katja Leikert, who represents Hanau in the German parliament, the Bundestag, said: ""Hopefully the injured recover swiftly. It is a horrific scenario for us all."" Hesse state leader Volker Bouffier said the state parliament had travelled to Hanau to show its solidarity with the victims and their families. He said the attack ""came out of a climate"" that existed ""to some degree worldwide"" in which people are targeted because they are different. ""We will do everything to show that people don't have to be afraid and show them that they belong with us, "" he said. In other reaction: Were you in the area?

Lord Alf Dubs, a former child refugee, has called on the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey's governments to ""share"" the responsibility. More than 11,000 Syrian refugees have been accepted by the UK since 2014 but none have been accepted by the islands. The Home Office would ""welcome"" the assistance, Minister Baroness Williams said. However, the island governments have re-iterated their position of not accepting refugees as part of the UK's Vulnerable Persons Relocation scheme. They cite legal hurdles and also point to the ""life-saving humanitarian aid"" they have funded since the conflict in Syria began. Lord Dubs was the architect of a 2016 scheme which saw hundreds of unaccompanied children come and live in the UK, although it was later scrapped. On the islands taking refugees, he said: ""I have a sense that there is support in the Crown Dependencies, certainly in the Isle of Man there's quite a lot of support. ""It's a matter of sharing responsibility.  ""I think small as the territories are, Jersey and Guernsey are able, I think, to provide a bit of support.  ""They are quite wealthy, they have the resources, and I think in the spirit of international cooperation they could do a little bit to help take some of the refugees - either children or families,"" he added. On Monday 15 October, Lord Dubs was told the UK Government would ""welcome"" any offers from the dependencies to house refugees as part of UK schemes ""now or in the future""."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60108377,PM orders inquiry into 'Muslimness' sacking claim,Tory MP Nusrat Ghani says she was told her faith was given as a reason for her sacking as a minister.,24 Jan 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a Cabinet Office inquiry into claims made by a Muslim MP who says her faith was given as a reason for her sacking as a minister in 2020. Nusrat Ghani said a government whip told her ""Muslimness was raised as an issue"". The Conservative MP welcomed the inquiry, saying all she wanted was for the matter to be taken seriously. Conservative Chief Whip Mark Spencer said the claims were completely false. He said Ms Ghani was referring to him and that he considered her allegations to be defamatory. Mr Johnson declined to say if the chief whip could stay in his job while the investigation was conducted.  He said: ""This is something I take extremely seriously. We must wait and see what the investigation produces."" The new Cabinet Office inquiry comes at the beginning of what could be a difficult week for the prime minister, with the expected completion of a report into gatherings on government premises that took place when coronavirus restrictions were in place. Senior civil servant Sue Gray has been asked to look at the nature and purpose of the gatherings, including who went to them ""with reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time"". Mr Johnson has faced calls from some of his MPs to resign over the matter, but others say they are withholding judgement until the findings of Ms Gray's report are published.  On Monday the PM's former aide, Dominic Cummings, said he had sent Ms Gray written evidence but would not be meeting her. Nus Ghani's allegations come at a time when there all these different fuses that have been lit. There are small flames travelling along the line towards Downing Street: whether it is this story, or whether it is the story about a small group of 2019 MPs who have their own claims that the whips have gone beyond what is normal - and MP William Wragg will be talking to the police about all of that. But the biggest threat to Boris Johnson is the Sue Gray report, which might emerge on Wednesday or Thursday. Despite lots of frenzied reporting nobody, other than Ms Gray and her team, knows exactly who she has been talking to, or the evidence being gathered.  The expectation is we will get a series of conclusions, but I would expect calls from the opposition and some Conservative MPs for the whole thing to be published.  Why does the report matter so much right now? It is not just because the public want to know what has been going on. Many MPs see the Sue Gray report as the crucial piece of evidence that will help them make up their mind about whether it is time to end the Johnson leadership. It is going to be a very, very significant week for Downing Street. Responding to news of the inquiry, Ms Ghani, a vice-president of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, said: ""As I said to the prime minister last night all I want is for this to be taken seriously and for him to investigate. ""I welcome his decision to do that now. The terms of reference of the inquiry must include all that was said in Downing Street and by the whip."" No 10 has said that when Ms Ghani first made the allegations, the prime minister recommended that she make a formal complaint to Conservative Campaign Headquarters, but she did not take up this offer. The prime minister's spokesman could not provide details of the terms of reference for the investigation but said officials should be able to ""investigate freely"".  Speaking on Sunday, Ms Ghani said when she had not used the Conservative Party's internal process because it was ""very clearly not appropriate for something that happened on government business"". Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it was ""important"" for the inquiry to go ahead, adding that Ms Ghani was a ""valued colleague"".  He told BBC Breakfast he hoped she would present evidence to the Cabinet Office, adding that it had taken ""a lot of bravery"" to make the allegations. Conservative peer Baroness Sayeeda Warsi - who has frequently spoken about Islamophobia in her party - said Ms Ghani should never have been asked to go through the party's complaint process.  ""This allegation relates to comments made in Downing Street, not Conservative headquarters; it relates to a job in government, not a job in the Conservative Party; the allegations were made by the chief whip, not by the chief executive or chairman of the party,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  ""This was not a party issue, this was a government issue."" Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to attend cabinet, said Ms Ghani's experience had been ""an open secret in Westminster"" and that she had ""struggled to be heard"" for nearly two years.  The former party chair said that she believed there was a ""pattern"" with Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, where ""Islamophobic racism is not viewed as seriously as other forms of racism"" and ""action is rarely taken until the media is involved"". She called for the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to intervene, arguing the government might have broken the law.  Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the prime minister's standards adviser Lord Geidt should investigate if the chief whip broke the ministerial code with his alleged comments. Ms Ghani was appointed to a post at the Department for Transport in 2018, becoming the first female Muslim minister to speak in the Commons. She lost that job in a mini-reshuffle of Mr Johnson's government in February 2020. Speaking to the Sunday Times, Ms Ghani said that when she asked for an explanation, a government whip had told her that ""Muslimness was raised as an issue"" during discussions about the reshuffle, and her status as a ""Muslim woman... was making colleagues uncomfortable"". The Wealden MP said she had dropped the matter after being told that if she ""persisted"" in asking about it she ""would be ostracised and her career and reputation would be destroyed"". After her allegations were published, Mr Spencer identified himself as the person Ms Ghani's claims were made about, saying he did not want other whips to be ""drawn into this matter"".  The Sherwood MP said he had previously provided evidence to the Singh investigation which he said had ""concluded there was no credible basis for the claims"" but he later added the phrase ""to be included in the report"". Prof Swaran Singh's 2021 report - which examined how the Conservative Party dealt with discrimination complaints - found that while ""not systemic"" there was ""evidence of discrimination"" in the Conservative Party, and it called for the complaints process to be overhauled. The report made 16 recommendations - eight of which the Conservative Party says are still to be implemented. The EHRC has said it is monitoring the progress made by the party."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63818164,New Malaysia PM's honeymoon will be brutally short,He finally got his dream job - but Anwar Ibrahim faces a divided country and a weak economy.,3 Dec 2022,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The honeymoon - if there even is one - will be brutally short.  Anwar Ibrahim became Malaysia's 10th prime minister last week, after an epic career in which he had sought the job, and come close to getting it, over a quarter of a century. But whatever jubilation he might have felt must have been tempered by the daunting task now confronting him.  The 75-year-old is a skilled orator with extensive political experience and personal charisma, but he has, in the past, also shown lapses of judgement. He must now muster all his strengths to fix the economy, satisfy long-suppressed demand for reform, ease racial mistrust and keep an unwieldy coalition together. His reformist, multi-ethnic Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition won 82 parliamentary seats in last month's election - more than any other political bloc, but well short of the 112 needed to form a government. Malaysia had its first hung parliament.  It then took five days of intense haggling among the different blocs for King Abdullah to choose Mr Anwar to lead the government. This was only possible because his old nemesis, UMNO, the party whose 61-year monopoly on power had been challenged and eventually ended by Mr Anwar and his allies in 2018, agreed to partner with him. But it's an arrangement that leaves many in both UMNO and PH uneasy. Mr Anwar's first problem has been allocating cabinet posts. UMNO and its allies won only 30 seats in the election. But its price for cooperating with PH was to be given several cabinet posts.  The most controversial is the appointment of Ahmad Zahid, the powerful UMNO president, as one of the two deputy prime ministers. There was strong opposition to the appointment because Mr Zahid faces multiple criminal charges dating back to his time in the discredited administration of former prime minister Najib Razak, who is serving a 12-year prison sentence for corruption.  For its part UMNO has promised to support Mr Anwar in the confidence vote he plans to hold in parliament on 19 December, but said little about how this uncomfortable alliance will work. ""At the moment, the collection of parties backing the Anwar administration seems stable,"" says Tricia Yeoh, CEO of the independent Malaysian think tank IDEAS. ""However, it is a precarious situation where any major faux pas by Anwar could cause dissatisfaction among the UMNO rank-and-file, which may then escalate to the division chiefs, who are the influential power-brokers within the party."" UMNO's general assembly in December will be a test, she adds - rising dissatisfaction could lead to an internal party vote to withdraw support for Mr Anwar as PM. ""If Anwar survives till the end of December, events in the coming year may prove to be additional tests, such as UMNO's party election, expected within the first quarter of 2023, and passing the full 2023 budget,"" Ms Yeoh says.  Then there is the economy, still struggling to recover from the Covid pandemic. The first PH administration in 2018 was accused of neglecting bread-and-butter issues like jobs and food prices, instead pushing its political reform agenda. Mr Anwar, however, has already said that his top priority is helping the living standards of ordinary Malaysians.  The post of finance minister plays a critical role here, and Mr Anwar has decided to take that job himself rather than entrust it to anyone else.  Race, which remains a big factor in multi-ethnic Malaysia's politics, could perhaps pose the trickiest challenge for Mr Anwar. Ethnic Malays, who make up just over half the population, enjoy special protection under the constitution. Since the 1970s, successive governments have given them privileged access to jobs, business opportunities and education. UMNO's main policy since its founding in the 1940s has been to protect that status.  That mantle has now passed to Perikatan Nasional, an alliance comprising PAS, a conservative, Islamist party, and Bersatu, a Malay-based party of politicians who broke away from UMNO. PN, which won 73 seats, refused the king's request that it join a broad national unity government led by Mr Anwar.  For more than 20 years, Mr Anwar's own Keadilan party has tried to persuade Malays to back its vision of a reformist, multi-racial and multi-cultural Malaysia - but with limited success.  In this election it lost seats, dropping from 48 to 31. Mr Anwar's daughter Nurul Izzah, an MP since 2008, lost a seat the family has held for nearly 40 years to a rival from PAS. Keadilan is now a smaller component of PH than the mainly ethnic Chinese Democratic Action Party, which won 40 seats. This makes the new government vulnerable to the charge that it is dominated by ethnic Chinese interests, and all the more dependent on UMNO to show that Malay interests are sufficiently represented.  One of Mr Anwar's long-running goals has been to slim down Malaysia's bloated state-owned enterprises and reduce the risk of corruption. But doing that will open him to accusations that he is attacking the very sector which in the past has given Malays more opportunities. Leading politicians in Perikatan Nasional have a track record of fanning the flames of racial resentment. Bersatu leader and former PM Muhyiddin Yassin was caught on camera ahead of the polls claiming that PH was sponsoring a campaign by Jews and Christians to ""Christianise"" Malaysia. PAS leaders have accused PH of Islamophobia, of being backed by Israel, and suggested those who vote for them would go to hell. ""The primary danger to Anwar is a PN that chooses to be an opposition on the grounds of race and religion, and not on the grounds of policy,"" Ms Yeoh says.  ""That they have chosen to be the main defender of Malay and Muslim interests means they will likely attempt to destabilise Anwar's government precisely on those issues. If this continues, the rhetoric used by PN during the campaign period will not cease, but instead intensify, which will provide dangerous, fertile soil in which the seeds of further ethnic polarisation can grow."""

Speaking anonymously to BBC News, the former Home Office specialist said the threat of right-wing terrorism was not being taken seriously.  Last year, the highest number of right-wing referrals to counter-terrorism programme Prevent came from the north. The government said it recognised far-right extremism was an emerging threat.  However, the UK's security services said extreme Islamist-based terrorism remained the country's most pressing national security concern.  In the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, ""Simon"" - who worked as a counter-terrorism specialist for the Home Office - said the north of England faced a growing danger from far-right extremists and neo-Nazis.  ""We've got former mill towns and cities across the north where this ideology, that white people are supposedly superior to everyone else, is growing and becoming more entrenched. ""I've no doubt that there are far-right extremists across the north who are planning to use violence to target Muslim or Jewish communities. ""They'll harbour the ambition to copy what happened in Christchurch. He added: ""We've already seen in Yorkshire how this extreme ideology has been used to target members of Parliament.""  Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered in her West Yorkshire constituency in 2016 by Thomas Mair, who was described in court as a lonely Nazi sympathiser.  Prof Matthew Feldman, director of the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, said the threat of right-wing extremists carrying out an atrocity in the UK similar to the Christchurch shootings remained low. ""The biggest barrier to the far right, is the fact that in the UK we have extremely tight gun laws."" ""The far-right do represent a threat to some communities in our country, but more often than not, these are people who are alone online, radicalising themselves, so they don't have a direct support network that could help them to gain access to weapons.""   Statistics from the government's counter terrorism programme Prevent shows that regions in the north accounted for the highest number of initial referrals for right-wing extremism in 2017-18. The number of religious or racially motivated hate crimes in England and Wales, increased from 37,417 in 2013-14 to 79,587 in 2017-18, according to the Home Office. Labour MP Naz Shah said there was a definitive link between a rise in levels of hate crime and support for extreme far-right groups. ""We've seen across the country a rise in Islamaphobia and race hate crimes - this hatred is fuelling support of the far right,"" the Bradford West MP said. ""I've been talking about this problem for years, and it is a growing issue and one that I don't think the government is talking seriously enough.""  Addressing the House of Commons earlier this week, Security Minister Ben Wallace acknowledged far-right extremism was a growing problem.  He added that the UK's counter-terrorism strategy was designed to address all forms of terrorism, whatever ideology it was driven by, and funding would be directed ""wherever the threat emerges"". Det Ch Supt Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said his officers had brought a number of successful prosecutions against extreme right-wing suspects in recent years. ""We are committed to tackling all forms of toxic extremist ideology which has the potential to threaten public safety."""

Make-up vlogger Em Ford tells Newsbeat she ""fundamentally disagrees"" with his controversial video made in Japan's Aokigahara forest. ""It's disappointing to not see any of the good things championed,"" Em tells Newsbeat. Em is annoyed a 2017 campaign raising over £700,000 for Mexico earthquake victims got little media interest. She's part of YouTube's Creators For Change programme, which aims to inspire creators who share positive messages through their videos. Em talks about make-up with her million subscribers for My Pale Skin, but it's showing her struggle with acne that inspires her followers. ""You could look at my channel and say I just review foundations or talk about face masks,"" she says. ""When you have acne, that foundation is the one thing that can give you back the control that acne has stripped away from you and make you feel better about yourself."" (Warning: Third party videos may contain adverts) ""I will keep posting pictures of my face and I will keep encouraging other women to post pictures of their faces regardless of pigmentation, colour or whatever society issue is going on there, until it becomes normal,"" she adds. ""I should not be called 'brave' for posting a picture of my face without make-up."" Both Em and Humza Arshad, who has close to 400,000 subscribers on his Humza Productions channel, say that despite a lack of media coverage for some positive efforts by YouTubers, the impact is seen in the response to their posts. Humza posts mostly comedy videos but one of his most watched clips is a hard-hitting piece on Islamophobia in the UK. It has been watched more than a million times across the world. (Warning: Third party videos may contain adverts) ""It took me maybe 5 or 10 minutes to write but it came from the heart,"" Humza tells Newsbeat.  ""Because it was real it was authentic, I knew a lot of people would relate and react to it."" Humza has tried to put a message in all his YouTube videos since he started uploading comedy sketches about a wannabe gangster called Diary Of A Badman. ""I wanted to do videos that were funny and made people laugh but think at the same time,"" he says. ""I thought it was very important to leave a positive message and not just do pointless comedy."" Humza says YouTubers like him, Em and others working to promote positive messages can ""genuinely change a life,"" and believes even Logan Paul's controversial video prompted a positive discussion about suicide. And Em says that the success she has found on YouTube goes against modern stigma against young people and how they rely on technology and social media. ""There's this stigma that young people are just glued to their phones, YouTube or TV all day long,"" she says. ""When I was 24 I started a company through my phone. ""Had it not been for that phone, had it not been for the internet or the programmes that inspired me on TV when I was younger I would never had made a film and I would never be trying to get out a positive message.""

Police found a stash of material on Pawel Golaszewski's computer, including weapon-making instructions and ""silent assassination"" techniques. A judge at the Old Bailey said the 34-year-old's views were ""Islamophobic and of an extreme right-wing nature"". Golaszewski, from Leeds, had previously been convicted of terror offences.  The court was told Golaszewski, of Wensleydale Mews, Armley, was arrested in February by Counter Terrorism Police. He claimed he had obtained the documents as research for work as a security guard and private investigator, and said he had an ambition to join the army. At his home police found a sheathed knife on the wall, two smoke grenades, a lock-knife and a torch with a concealed knife. In a video retrieved from his hard drive, the defendant described Mr Khan in racist terms and voiced ""anti-Muslim and anti-immigration"" views. Golaszewski had denied six counts of possessing terrorist documents but was found guilty on all charges.  Judge Rebecca Oulet QC said: ""Most of these texts contained viable recipes and clear instructions for workable explosive devices or IEDs. ""These were written for someone without expert knowledge. ""They provide step-by-step instructions to inflict serious harm or death on a victim, including silent assassination techniques."""

Rizwan Ahmed, from Bristol Muslim Cultural Society (BMCS), is behind the initiative. He said the ""under-reporting of Islamophobic abuse"" made it difficult to gauge the scale of the problem.  The idea is part of a move by the Tackling Islamophobia Working Group (TIWG), set up to unite Muslim communities, police and other agencies. Rizwan Ahmed said he came up with the idea after the success of a graphic he designed a few years ago, which used important dates from the Islamic calendar to help people plan time off work.  He said it was ""so effective"" that some of his friends in Bristol were ""sent it from as far as Singapore."" He said Islamophobia was ""becoming a growing issue"" and people were not aware of what they could report, such as verbal abuse.  Hasina Khan, from Bristol, is working with TIWG  and said her experience of anti-Muslim hate crime ""still brings back traumatic emotions"".  Ms Khan said: ""My immediate reaction was not to contact the police and to be by myself, stay at home."" She added: ""The aim of this communication is to let Muslims know they do not have to suffer and they aren't alone. People may not be aware that what is happening to them is actually against the law."" She said ""youth in particular who may be more familiar with the hostile environment"" needed to ""realise they have the same rights as everyone else"". Supt Andy Bennett, who deals with hate crime for Avon & Somerset Police, said: ""Tackling all forms of hate crime, including Islamophobia, is a priority for us.  ""We know hate crime remains under-reported, and these figures don't show the full picture, so we're keen to encourage more victims to come forward.""

The Ricketts family, which owns the Chicago Cubs, has made the shortlist of bidders to buy the club. But there are concerns over the bid after it emerged that the family's patriarch, Joe Ricketts, was accused, external of Islamophobia three years ago. The Chelsea Supporters' Trust (CST) said it is against the family's bid. The CST said it had conducted a snap survey of its membership on 1 April to see if ""they had confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club"" and ""whether they supported"" the bid. It did not say how many members took part but that ""72% of those who responded do not currently have confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, with 5% of respondents believing they would"". The CST added: ""Similarly, 77% of members who responded do not support the Ricketts family's bid for Chelsea FC and 3% of respondents are in support. ""The CST board is guided by our membership, and thus we do not currently believe it is in the best interests of our members for the Ricketts family's bid to succeed."" Chelsea were in action against Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday and and some Blues fans protested against the Ricketts family's bid before the game. ""Over the past fortnight, our bid team has met with several supporter groups to explain our vision for Chelsea Football Club,"" said Tom Ricketts. ""In those meetings, and by letter to all groups, we have shared a set of specific commitments we will make to fans, if our bid is successful.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43246496,Driver guilty of hate crime car attack,Paul Moore knocked over a Somali woman in his car and then went back to run her over as she lay on the ground.,2 Mar 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A man has been convicted of the attempted murder of a Somali woman after knocking her over in his car and then going back to run her over as she lay helpless on the ground.  Mother-of-nine Zaynab Hussein suffered life-changing injuries in the attack in Leicester last September. Her life was saved after extensive specialist surgery but she remains confined to a bed. Paul Moore, 21, from Leicester, was found guilty at Nottingham Crown Court. Jurors also convicted him of the attempted grievous bodily harm of a 12-year-old Somali girl, for trying to drive into her minutes after the first attack. Moore - who has previous convictions and was on bail for a charge of causing grievous bodily harm when he was arrested for the attack - looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out. In the hours leading up to the attack, which happened five days after the Parsons Green attack in London, Moore had been drinking heavily with friends.  Mrs Hussein was returning home after dropping off her two youngest children at school when she was knocked down.  She was thrown by the force of the impact into the wall of a house in the Beaumont Leys area of Leicester.  In two witness statements provided from her hospital bed, she said she could feel blood on her forehead and had lost sensation in her limbs, believing them to be broken.  She tried to reach her mobile phone to call family and was crying for help. Two drivers stopped to ask if she needed help, but then drove on.  Mrs Hussein was left with a fractured pelvis, spine and multiple other injuries including severe breaks to her limbs.  Two young men who had been in the car told police that Moore, who is unemployed, had told them he wanted to run someone over. After he first hit Mrs Hussein, sending her flying, the pair jumped out of the still-moving car.  Moore performed a U-turn to return to the scene. He drove past Mrs Hussein and seeing her on the ground, he turned the car around, mounted the pavement and drove over her with all four wheels.  He then drove off again and spotted a 12-year-old Somali girl, identified by him as a Muslim because of her headscarf, walking to school with her cousin. Moore drove at her, apparently mounting the pavement again, but this time he clipped her side, sending her bag flying. The girl was unharmed but shaken.  During the trial, the jury heard that after the attack Moore turned up severely drunk at the home of his half-brother, Lewis Welsh, and told him in offensive, racist terms, why he had attacked the woman.  ""I don't think he knew what he was saying or doing. But he did tell me that he had ran over a 'Paki',"" said Mr Welsh. ""He tried to put it down to the London 7/7 bombings. He said he was proud of himself. He was rambling. He was doing the country a favour."" Mrs Hussein remains in pain and is still receiving medical treatment for her injuries - including returning to hospital for more surgery.  She and her husband are too scared to talk publicly about what happened but the wider Muslim community in the Beaumont Leys area remains in shock.  ""Everyone has been talking about how this happened - and why,"" said Zuleika, a community activist in Leicester.  She, like all the others the BBC spoke to, asked to remain anonymous because they are scared there could be another attack.  ""We are just asking ourselves who is going to be next. We have found out about other parents who have been insulted because they are Muslim. Some of them are scared and afraid to raise their voice - for every woman in this community, we now have the same fear."" Paul Moore pleaded denied attempted murder but gave the court no defence to the accusation that his crime was motivated by hate.  National statistics show that hate crime appears to have been rising over the last two years:  Part of the rise was down to better reporting but police were also sure there were spikes after major moments of tension.  The most significant of these were the EU Referendum in June 2016 and the terrorism attacks at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena and London Bridge. The Parsons Green London Underground attack came outside of the period for these statistics - but Moore's attempted murder of Mrs Hussein occurred five days later.  Azhar Qayum of Mend, a campaign organisation tackling Islamophobia, said women were particularly vulnerable to attacks, alongside elderly men, because they tended to be more visible.  ""What's happened to Mrs Hussen is very serious - but it is not an isolated case,"" he said.  ""There has been a long line of very serious crimes like this. We have had the Islamophobic murder of Mohammed Saleem in Birmingham, we have the Islamophobic murder of Mushin Ahmed in Rotherham, an 81-year-old grandfather.  ""And we have had the attack last year on worshippers at Finsbury Park. Although this is very serious, this level of seriousness is not isolated."""

However they also included posts supporting her and her role, and condemning the abuse she suffered. The force said it had reported abusive comments to Twitter and begun its own inquiries.  A police spokesperson said: ""We are supporting our hate crime officer in a number of ways.  ""Unacceptable messages have been reported to Twitter and we have opened our own inquiries into the abuse."" Labour MP for Leicester South Jon Ashworth tweeted: ""This abuse is utterly unacceptable.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50562542,No place for anti-Semitism within Labour - Corbyn,"Jeremy Corbyn urges Jewish community to ""engage"" with him following the chief rabbi's outspoken criticism.",26 Nov 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Jeremy Corbyn has insisted there is no place for anti-Semitism within Labour and those guilty of anti-Jewish racism have been ""brought to book"". He urged the Jewish community to ""engage"" with him following outspoken criticism from the chief rabbi. Ephraim Mirvis had claimed ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in the party. Mr Corbyn said anti-Semitism was ""vile"" and ""rapid and effective"" action had been taken against offenders. At the launch of the party's ""race and faith manifesto"", he said anti-Semitism would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government. He said no community would be ""at risk because of its faith, identity, ethnicity or language"".  Mr Mirvis, the Orthodox chief rabbi of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, earlier warned that ""the overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety"" at the prospect of a Labour victory in 12 December's general election. The chief rabbi, who is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, the largest umbrella group of Jewish communities in the country, said Labour's claim it had investigated all cases of anti-Semitism in its ranks was a ""mendacious fiction"". In an article for the Times, he asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the election.  Asked if he regretted not doing enough to tackle the issue, Mr Corbyn said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Mr Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street.  ""Since I became leader, there are disciplinary procedures that didn't exist before. Where people have committed anti-Semitic acts they are brought to book and, if necessary, expelled from the party or suspended, or asked to be educated better about it. ""I want to live in a country where people respect each other's faiths and people feel secure to be Jewish, Muslim, Hindu or Christian. ""But be absolutely clear of this assurance from me: No community will be at risk because of its faith, identity, ethnicity or language. I have spent my life fighting racism. ""I ask those who think things have not been done correctly to talk to me about it but above all engage. I am very happy to engage."" Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.  The BBC's political editor said one of the Labour candidates present at the party's race and faith manifesto launch had herself been accused of making allegedly anti-Semitic comments.  A number of prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party after being the subject of anti-Semitic abuse on social media while others have accused Mr Corbyn of personally endorsing anti-Semitic tropes and imagery. Ms Ellman said the chief rabbi had been right to speak out and his remarks highlighted the ""gravity of the situation"" facing British Jews. ""It is unprecedented for a major political party - a potential party of government - to be perpetuating anti-Semitism,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One.  ""This is not just about Jewish people, it is about the whole of our society."" Any intervention like this from a significant religious leader would be damaging, but the timing is a nightmare - just two weeks from polling day and on the very day Labour launched its race and faith manifesto. And the language the chief rabbi used - it's all bad, bad, bad. Mr Corbyn didn't really take on the chief rabbi's comments. He talked about how anti-Semitism was vile and evil, how if he was PM he would want to ensure greater security and protection for synagogues and mosques. The nearest he actually got to directly addressing the chief rabbi's intervention was to say ""engage""- appealing to all religious groups to engage with him if they have concerns. I take it from that that Team Labour have decided there is not much they can say or do that is going to make any difference to how he is seen by many, many people in the Jewish community. Team Corbyn take the view that they have introduced new disciplinary procedures, fast-tracked them and, as a result, more people are getting turfed out of the party. Mr Corbyn has said again and again and again that he abhors anti-Semitism, and yet it doesn't really seem to have made any difference to his relationship with large sections of the Jewish community. They almost just had to take the hit, move on and hope this blows over and the election moves on to other issues. Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who had been due to lead an independent review into anti-Semitism before the equality watchdog intervened, urged the party to heed the chief rabbi's words.  ""We deserved an attack that strong,"" he told the BBC. ""We need to deal with anti-Semitism properly."" He added: ""I really hope that the chief rabbi's absolutely extraordinary, but justified, intervention will be listened to by my party."" Rabbi Jonathan Romain said he had written ""to my own community"" to say there was ""a serious problem with Corbyn-led Labour"" and that they should vote for whichever party ""is most likely to defeat a Labour candidate"". And historian Simon Sebag Montefiore said the ""overwhelming majority of the Jewish community"" felt anti-Semitism was ""rife and unchecked"" in the Labour Party. But the Labour peer Lord Dubs, the child refugee campaigner who fled Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in the 1930s, said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the tone of the chief rabbi's remarks.  He said he was reassured that Mr Corbyn - a longstanding campaigner for peace in the Middle East and the rights of the Palestinian people - was not personally an anti-Semite. He said where Labour had failed was in not acting ""a bit quicker"" in dealing with the issue. The Labour leader faced criticism from Jewish groups when he said in last week's general election ITV leader's debate that the party had ""investigated every single case"" raised by complainants. He did not address the chief rabbi's claim that 130 cases were outstanding.  Campaigning in Scotland, Conservative leader Boris Johnson said it was ""clearly a failure of leadership"" on Mr Corbyn's part that he ""has not been able to stamp out this virus in the Labour Party"".  But he faced criticism of his own party's record on racism, after the Muslim Council of Britain accused the Conservative Party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia. South-African born Mr Mirvis became chief rabbi in 2013. In a Facebook post in July, he congratulated Mr Johnson on his election as Conservative leader, describing the new prime minister as a ""long-standing friend and champion of the Jewish community"". According to the British Board of Deputies, there are between 260,000 and 300,000 Jews in England and Wales. Around half belong to the Central Orthodox denomination which includes the United Synagogue, led by the chief rabbi."

Yems, 63, was banned from football for 18 months after admitting one charge and being found guilty of 11 others of racist abuse towards his players. Four further charges were found to be unproven by an FA tribunal. A further charge against Yems relating to racial segregation was dropped. In publishing the written reasons for his ban, the FA disciplinary commission ""accepted that Mr Yems is not a conscious racist"". ""Nevertheless, Mr Yems' 'banter' undoubtedly came across to the victims and others as offensive, racist and Islamophobic,"" the report said. ""Mr Yems simply paid no regard to the distress which his misplaced jocularity was causing."" The FA said the case was ""extremely serious"" and ""involved racist bullying over a significant period of time"". It stressed that Yems' ""lack of remorse or insight"" and the ""repetitive nature of the misconduct"" were aggravating factors. However, the tribunal was told that Yems accepted his ban and was remorseful, adding that ""his attempts at jocularity had been thoughtless and misguided but not malevolent"". Yems, who had been in charge at Crawley since December 2019, was suspended by the club on 23 April 2022 and parted company with the League Two side 13 days later, two days after the FA announced it was investigating the allegations against him. He faced 16 charges at the tribunal, which was held in November, one of which he admitted but ""downplayed its gravity"". He contested the other 15, four of which were found to be unproven. A 17th charge of segregating the players at the club along racial lines was withdrawn by the FA before the hearing. The report said two of the players ""who had complained of racist language by Mr Yems, acknowledged that there had not been deliberate segregation along racial lines"" at Crawley. The evidence the tribunal heard included: How Yems used a racial slur to describe some of the club's black players and deliberately mis-pronounced a name to make it sound like a racially offensive term.  Yems used a racial stereotype to two black players who were playing darts. He then repeated a racial slur and ""made gestures as if using a blowpipe"". How one player feigned illness in order to avoid Yems' 'banter' about eating curry. A Muslim player became the subject of jokes about ""being a terrorist"". He was asked if he slept with a gun and if he carried a bomb in his bag. Yems used a racial stereotype to a black player of African origin by asking if he liked jerk chicken - a dish associated with the Caribbean. Another player returning from international duty was told he should not train with the squad. Yems commented on his colour ""then put his hand over his mouth saying he should not say that"". The report stated how, in his defence, Yems ""categorically denied that he was in any way racist"" and that he ""might be viewed as an 'old school' football manager who might be 'robust and industrial' in his use of language; indeed, he fairly acknowledged that he had been less concerned about speaking in a politically correct manner than he should have been"". In the report's summing up it stated that Yems ""is a man of jocular disposition. His aim is to encourage bonding among players by cracking jokes and joining in fun with them"". But it went on to say that ""he has no appreciation that much of the sort of language which might have been in common usage some 40 or 50 years ago has no place in modern society"". The report went on to state: ""There was a considerable weight of evidence to the effect that Mr Yems was in the habit of, in his perception, cracking jokes which were perceived as racist by those who were the butt of the jokes.  ""Probably, Mr Yems gave no thought at all to the effect of his language on those at whom the 'jokes' were aimed.  ""Nor did he give any thought at all to the likely reaction of others to the language he used."" BBC Sport League Two Crawley Town official site"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45602536,How the anti-Semitism row affected Labour’s support,"Accusations of anti-Semitism could have cost Labour in key areas, a study suggests.",28 Sep 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Accusations of anti-Semitism have led to widespread criticism of Labour in recent months. Some supporters have warned it could lose out at future elections unless the relationship is repaired.  At this week's party conference, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told delegates he wanted the party and the Jewish community to ""work together and draw a line"" under the anti-Semitism row. Indeed, relations have been strained for some time, with an inquiry into anti-Semitism in the party launched in 2016.  Last month Labour adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism, although critics said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermined the international definition.  Now, a study of results at the 2017 general election suggests some damage may already have been done before the row intensified this summer.  It appears Labour may have underperformed in the constituencies with the most Jewish people. Across the UK, there are five constituencies where, according to the 2011 Census (the most recent), more than 10% of the population identify as Jewish. Four of them are in or just outside north London - Finchley and Golders Green, Hendon, Hertsmere, and Hackney North and Stoke Newington, where the local MP is shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. The fifth is Bury South, just outside Manchester. In these seats, Labour's share of the vote at the 2017 general election increased by seven points when compared with the 2015 election. However, this was nearly three points below the 9.8 point overall increase the party saw across the country.  This underperformance appears to be greater still if we look at how constituencies voted in the 2016 EU referendum.  In most cases, the higher the Remain vote was, the better Labour did in the election that followed. Once we take this into account, Labour's share of the vote in the constituencies with the most Jewish voters appears to be about 4.5 points below what might have been expected. In two constituencies, Finchley and Golders Green, and Hendon, this is greater than the margin by which it was beaten. Of course, we cannot be certain that the party's apparent difficulties in these seats was the result of its failure to win the support of Jewish voters.  Labour might have had difficulties winning over the many other voters in these areas. Rival candidates may have fought a particularly good campaign. But it would be quite a coincidence if it had these problems in every seat with a large Jewish population. It is a problem that continued at local elections earlier this year, when the party failed to win Barnet (which incorporates Finchley and Golders Green), despite performing strongly elsewhere in the capital.  Its failure prompted a senior Labour politician to say he ""suspects"" the anti-Semitism row was to blame. Despite these problems, Labour has found greater success with a different group of voters. Jeremy Corbyn has long campaigned against Islamophobia and his staunch opposition to the Iraq War is well documented.  So, we might ask whether the Labour leader's record on such issues has enhanced support among Muslim voters. Certainly, the relationship was strained under Tony Blair, following his decision to join the US-led invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The party lost ground heavily in 2005 in constituencies with large Muslim communities.  Although much of that ground had been recovered by the 2015 general election, Labour did especially well in areas with large Muslim populations in 2017. There are 78 constituencies where more than 10% of people identify as Muslim, according to the 2011 Census. In these seats, Labour's vote increased by an average of 11.8 points - a couple of points better than its performance across the country as a whole. However, these were also seats where support for Remain was higher than in the UK overall - by about five points on average.  But even when we take this into account, Labour's vote increased in these areas by just under a point more than we would otherwise have expected. More like this The difference this will have made to Labour's election performance is limited by the reality that most constituencies with a relatively large Muslim population are already safe Labour seats.  Such a small advantage will have simply bolstered the party's already strong position locally.  At most, there are a couple of seats, Keighley and Kensington, where Labour won only very narrowly and where any additional support from Muslims in these areas could conceivably have been decisive. However, in neither case can we say that this is what happened.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48515506,Trump declines to meet 'negative' Corbyn,The US president reveals he turned down a meeting with the Labour leader during his state visit.,5 Jun 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Donald Trump has turned down a request from Jeremy Corbyn to meet during his state visit, calling Labour's leader ""somewhat of a negative force"". The US president said he had been approached by Mr Corbyn, who boycotted Monday's banquet held in his honour. Explaining his refusal, Mr Trump said: ""I really don't like critics as much as I respect people who get things done."" Earlier, Mr Corbyn said Mr Trump's policies on immigration, human rights, trade and climate change were divisive. Speaking at a protest rally in Westminster, the Labour leader said he was ""very disappointed"" by Mr Trump's latest attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan, whom the president called a ""stone cold loser"".  But he told protesters he was prepared to have ""a dialogue"" with anybody about building a more peaceful, just world.  The Labour leadership confirmed they had sought a meeting with Mr Trump during his three-day visit to the UK and said Mr Corbyn remained ""ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis"".   Meanwhile, Mr Trump spoke by phone to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - one of the favourites to succeed Theresa May - on Tuesday night and is due to meet rival candidate Michael Gove.  He also had a private meeting with the Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, one of the president's strongest political supporters in the UK.  Mr Farage said afterwards it had been a ""good meeting"". Asked about the snub to Mr Corbyn during a press conference with Theresa May, Mr Trump said he had ""never spoken"" to the leader of the opposition.  ""He wanted to meet with me and I told him no,"" he said.  ""I think that he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think people should look to do things correctly rather than criticise."" However, he later told Piers Morgan in an interview for Good Morning Britain that although it had been ""tough"" and ""probably inappropriate"" to meet Mr Corbyn on this occasion, he would have ""no problem"" with meeting him another time. While it is not mandatory for US presidents to meet opposition leaders and other non-government figures during state visits, it has been standard diplomatic practice. Barack Obama held talks with Ed Miliband in 2011 and also met David Cameron during his first visit to the UK as president in 2009. In his speech, the Labour leader did not mention Mr Trump by name but did refer to ""our visitors"", and said all governments had a duty to oppose racism and misogyny. Mr Corbyn told demonstrators he wanted to have a ""conversation"" with the US president despite their multiple disagreements.  ""I am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody. I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about that better, more peaceful world that we all want to live in."" He appealed to Mr Trump to ""chase down"" all forms of racism, including Islamophobia, and take a more compassionate approach to the plight of refugees from war, religious persecution and the effects of climate change.  ""Racism divides, exploitation of minorities divides, exploitation of minorities brings about hatred,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said he would oppose any post-Brexit trade deal with the US that allowed foreign companies ""in to take over the NHS"" - insisting he would defend a health service free at the point of use ""with every breath in his body"".  But after holding talks with Mrs May, Mr Trump said no area could be excluded from future trade discussions, including the NHS. ""When you are dealing with trade, everything is on the table, so the NHS and anything else.""  This prompted an immediate response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, one of the leading candidates to succeed Mrs May in Downing Street, as well as other candidates. And Dominic Raab, who is also standing, tweeted that the NHS ""is not for sale to any country and never would be"" if he became prime minister.  The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue was now likely to be a factor in the leadership race. On Sunday, the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, told the BBC ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. The SNP's Ian Blackford, who also addressed the anti-Trump demonstration, said Scotland must ""stand up for progressive values and against a damaging Tory-Trump trade deal"".  The Welsh government said devolution must be respected and there was ""absolutely no prospect"" of the NHS being included in any post-Brexit negotiations.  Mr Trump later told Good Morning Britain's Morgan that actually he did not see the NHS as being on the table. ""Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Analysis: By Hugh Pym, BBC Health editor There is nothing to stop American or any other foreign firms bidding for NHS contracts under current rules. The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender.  A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts.   Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK.   The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal Mr Trump would like to negotiate for the US. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation.  Asked about the Tory leadership hopefuls, the president said: ""I know Boris. I like him. I have liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job."" Referring to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, he continued: ""I know Jeremy, I think he would do a very good job."" On Mr Gove - to laughter from the audience - he added: ""I don't know Michael - would he do a good job Jeremy?""  Mr Trump said he had only seen one ""very small protest"" on Tuesday, in contrast to what he claimed were the ""thousands of people"" on the streets welcoming him and his family.  ""I heard there were protests so I said 'where are the protests?'... A lot of it is fake news, I hate to say."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-64625388,PM's ethics adviser takes on MP Islamophobia probe,"The inquiry into claims made by Nus Ghani was launched a year ago, but has yet to be completed.",15 Feb 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Rishi Sunak's ethics adviser has taken over an investigation into claims by a Tory MP that she was sacked as a minister for being Muslim. Nus Ghani said a party manager told her ""Muslimness was raised as an issue"". Labour has said it is ""disgraceful"" that an investigation into her allegations launched last January has yet to be completed. The probe was delayed following the resignation of then-PM Boris Johnson's ethics adviser Lord Geidt. He left in June and was not replaced until December when Mr Sunak appointed Laurie Magnus, who will now carry on the inquiry.  Labour party chair Anneliese Dodds has been pushing for the investigation to be completed, saying the delay ""tells you everything you need to know about the Conservatives' commitment to tackling Islamophobia"".    Asked about the inquiry, Head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission Marcial Boo said he would be following up on it with Sir Laurie. Ms Ghani first made her accusation in the Sunday Times in January 2022.  When appointed to a post at the Department for Transport in 2018, she became the first female Muslim minister to speak in the Commons. After losing that job in a mini-reshuffle of Boris Johnson's government in February 2020 she asked Conservative Party whips for an explanation. ""I was told that at the reshuffle meeting in Downing Street that 'Muslimness' was raised as an 'issue',"" she said. She added that she was told: ""My 'Muslim women minister' status was making colleagues uncomfortable and that there were concerns 'that I wasn't loyal to the party as I didn't do enough to defend the party against Islamophobia allegations'."" The Wealden MP told the paper she had dropped the matter after being told that if she ""persisted"" she ""would be ostracised and her career and reputation would be destroyed"". ""I raised it several more times through official party channels.... I was extremely careful to follow procedure, and when the procedure ran out of road I had no choice but to get on with my career."" In a later statement she said: ""Not a day has gone by without thinking about what I was told and wondering why I was in politics... those that have not had their identity and faith questioned cannot fully appreciate what it does to you."" Mark Spencer, who at the time was chief whip, identified himself as the person Ms Ghani was referring to, saying he did not want others in the whip's office to be ""drawn into this matter"". He added that the accusations were ""completely false and I consider them to be defamatory"". The Sherwood MP went on to say it was ""disappointing"" that at the time Ms Ghani had declined to refer the matter for a formal Conservative Party investigation. Following the accusation, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked the Cabinet Office to conduct an inquiry to ""establish the facts about what happened"".  Since then, Ms Ghani has been brought back into government as a business minister, while Mr Spencer has moved from the whip's office to the environment department.  A year on from the inquiry being launched, the BBC has been told that Sir Laurie was taking it over. EHRC chief executive Marcial Boo said he was in regular contact with the author of a 2021 report into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.  When Ms Ghani made her allegations, the EHRC said it would ""consider any findings"" from the government's inquiry, adding: ""If we are not satisfied with progress, we will not rule out the use of our legal powers."" The BBC has contacted Ms Ghani and Mr Spencer for a comment."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67684309,Pressure mounts on Harvard's president to step down,"But more than 500 faculty members urge Harvard to ""resist political pressures"" to force Dr Gay out.",11 Dec 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Harvard University President Claudine Gay is facing mounting pressure to resign over her congressional testimony on antisemitism on campus. Dr Gay, 53, was forced to apologise after she failed to say whether students calling for the genocide of Jewish people would be disciplined.  Hundreds of Harvard faculty rallied behind her over the weekend, urging the university not to fire her. Her fate may be decided at a meeting of the Harvard Corporation on Monday.  Dr Gay's comments, which were widely criticised, were made at a House of Representatives hearing last week alongside Elizabeth Magill and Sally Kornbluth, her counterparts from the University of Pennsylvania and MIT. During tense questioning from Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Dr Gay said she found calls for the genocide of Jews personally abhorrent but whether it would constitute a violation of Harvard's code of conduct regarding bullying and harassment depended on the context.  ""I am sorry,"" Dr Gay said in a subsequent interview with the Crimson, Harvard's campus newspaper. ""When words amplify distress and pain, I don't know how you could feel anything but regret.""  The 13-member Harvard Corporation - one of the institution's two governing bodies - is scheduled to meet later on Monday and will reportedly discuss Dr Gay's fate and the school's potential courses of action.  Over the weekend, more than 500 faculty members signed a petition calling on Harvard to ""resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard's commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay"". By mid-morning on Monday, the number of faculty members who signed the letter had risen to nearly 700.  Alison Frank Johnson, one of the petition's co-authors, told Reuters that staff ""don't want to lose her because of a political stunt"".  ""I get the impression that many people don't know how much support she has as a scholar, colleague, and administrator within the university, including from people who sometimes disagree with her,"" she said.  In July, Dr Gay became Harvard's first black president in its 368-year history.  More than 70 members of Congress have called for her resignation alongside Ms Magill's and Dr Kornbluth's, In a letter, the mostly Republican lawmakers referred to the college presidents' answers as ""abhorrent"" and standing ""in stark contrast to the principles we expect leaders of top academic institutions to uphold"".  ""It is hard to imagine any Jewish or Israeli student, faculty or staff feeling safe when presidents of your member institutions could not say that calls for the genocide of Jews would have clear consequences on your campus,"" the letter added.  On Saturday, President Magill announced that she had ""voluntarily tendered her resignation"". It came after a major university donor withdrew a $100m (£80m) grant in protest over her comments.  Following Ms Magill's announcement that she was stepping down, Ms Stefanik again took aim at Dr Gay and Dr Kornbluth.  ""One down, two to go,"" she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.  College campuses across the US have been the scene of frequent pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli protests, raising concerns about both Islamophobia and antisemitism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-31607165,Thousands stand with Mariam,"A row over an Australian vest has provoked the ire of American white supremacists, and a hashtag campaign as well.",25 Feb 2015,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The slogan on the vest reads 'If you don't love it, leave' Why are Australians rallying behind one Muslim lawyer? Because she has become the target of racist abuse online from far right groups and white supremacists around the world.  The story starts with a vest on sale at Woolworths. Last year, branches of the Australian retailer began selling a singlet, external carrying a controversial patriotic message. Underneath a picture of the Australian flag, the caption on the vest read ""If you don't love it, leave"".  The slogan could be read as a hostile message aimed at immigrant groups in the country, and that's how it was taken by Mariam Veiszadeh. She's a lawyer, and prominent advocate for the Muslim community in Australia. She tweeted a picture, external of the vest on sale in the shop, saying ""I'm outraged that #WOOLWORTHS are allegedly selling these bigoted singlets at their Cairns stores"". Her message of anger began to trend online, and the retailer quickly pulled the item in question.  But that wasn't the end of the story.  In the months since, Veiszadeh has been subjected to online hate from extremists around the world. It began when the Australian Defence League, a far right group, shared her comments with its 5,000 Facebook fans. One of them - a 22-year-old woman - tracked Veiszadeh down on Facebook where she posted a stream of racist abuse. The incident was reported to the police, and last week the woman was charged with harassment by police in Queensland. Then on Friday, a US-based white supremacist blog - with a significant following in Australia - stepped into the fray. The Daily Stormer published an article using abusive language about Veiszadeh, and containing a call to action. Here's an extract, edited to remove some offensive terms: ""Gentlemen, I think we all know what needs to be done here. Get out your Twitter accounts - make as many as you can... We need to be as hurtful as possible when abusing her, and we need to offend her Moslem sensibilities too."" Right on cue, trolls began tweeting Veiszadeh messages of abuse - and in response she called on her followers to report the offending accounts to Twitter. She herself was one of the first to use the hashtag #IStandWithMariam, external. Many of the accounts sending abusive messages now appear to have been been taken down. People in Australia have begun using the hashtag to post messages of goodwill. It has appeared more than 3,000 times in just over two days. ""#IStandWithMariam because her gender, religion and politics are irrelevant. #IStandWithMariam because she is a good &  decent Australian,"" wrote one, external, and ""#IStandWithMariam against racism, bigotry, discrimination & Islamophobia.

Electronic versions of the candlesticks, which are used to mark Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights, have been placed in public locations in the capital. One attack was reported in Islington Green, north London, and the second in Kensal Rise, north-west London. No arrests have been made in either case.  The menorah in Kensal Rise, which was reported damaged on Thursday, was outside Queen's Park recreational ground. The incident in Islington was also reported on Thursday, with inquiries under way and neighbourhood officers providing community reassurance, the Met said. Kaya Comer-Schwartz, leader of Islington Council, said she was ""utterly appalled"". She said: ""The festival of Hanukkah is a celebration of light and joy. ""This horrific antisemitic attack is completely unacceptable and doesn't reflect the Islington we know and love. ""Hate crime has no place in Islington and we will work with the Metropolitan Police to find the culprit of this attack.  ""Islington will not be cowed by hate crime and we will make sure replacement menorah lights are in place for the remainder of Hanukkah to make sure our community can continue to celebrate."" The force confirmed both menorahs were thought to be ""deliberately damaged"". The Met said it had reported a ""massive increase"" in antisemitic incidents in London since the Hamas attacks on Israel and resulting war. The force said it had also reported a rise in Islamophobic incidents. Hanukkah, or Chanukah, runs from 7 to 15 December this year. Events have been held across the capital, including in Golders Green and Trafalgar Square, to mark the festival.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67693315,Why US-Palestinian families are having 'the talk',American-Palestinian parents have been having difficult conversations with their children about racism.,17 Dec 2023,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"After the shooting of three college students in New England and a string of other incidents, Palestinian Americans say they are worried about their safety.  When Samer Elbandak heard that three young Palestinian men were shot over American Thanksgiving weekend in Burlington, Vermont, he immediately feared for his 16-year-old daughter. His daughter, who lives in Florida, is vocal about the plight of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. On her Instagram page, the Palestinian flag is prominently displayed. Embracing her identity is something that Mr Elbandak, a Palestinian-American Christian who was born and raised in Bethlehem and who immigrated to San Francisco 30 years ago, had always encouraged. But a week after the shooting of Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad - three 20-year-old Palestinian-American students - Mr Elbandak said he decided to fly to Florida to have a difficult conversation with his daughter.  ""I explained to her that she needs to be very careful,"" he said. ""There are some people that are blind, that are full of hatred."" Palestinian parents in the US like Mr Elbandak say they are increasingly having their version of ""the talk"" - a conversation about encountering racism that has long been held in African-American and other minority households - after a recent string of incidents where people who are visibly Palestinian have been attacked. Police in Burlington said they are still investigating whether the 24 November shooting of the three men was a hate crime. The suspect, Jason Eaton, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges.  The victims of the attack maintain they were targeted because of their ethnicity.  They were speaking a mix of Arabic and English at the time of the attack, and two of them were wearing keffiyehs - a traditional, Palestinian black-and-white scarf that often serves as a symbol of Palestinian identity and solidarity.  Some say the incident has left them fearful that being visibly Palestinian in the US has become a risk since the Israel-Gaza war erupted on 7 October. Among those who felt this concern is Anne Bordonaro, a mother of two Palestinian college-aged men born and raised in Burlington. ""I looked at the picture of the three young men and I just felt a gut punch,"" Ms Bordonaro said. ""I said, those are my kids.""  She then called her two boys and had a ""painful conversation"", in which she suggested they avoid wearing their keffiyehs in public.  ""My younger son often wears one, it's just a symbol of identity, it is just part of who he is,"" Ms Bordonaro said, but she added she worried it made him a target.  At the time of the Burlington shootings, the Palestinian community in the US - a small diaspora of around 220,000 - was already reeling from the murder on 14 October of a six-year-old Illinois boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume.  Prosecutors have accused the suspect in Wadea's death of deliberately targeting the child and his mother for being Palestinian.  The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said it had received an ""unprecedented"" amount of reports of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias since 7 October, recording a total of 2,171 requests for help across the US as of December. The wife of a Harvard professor was caught on video harassing a student for wearing a keffiyeh, calling it a ""terrorist scarf"".  On 7 November, a man wearing a keffiyeh was allegedly assaulted while he was at a playground with his son in Brooklyn, New York.  In another incident 10 days later, it is alleged that a Yemeni-American Muslim woman was targeted on the New York subway by a man who called her a ""terrorist"", hit her and broke a Palestinian flag she was carrying.  Ayah Zaki, a civil rights attorney for Cair in New Jersey, said that Palestinian mothers have recently been coming to her for advice on how to speak with their children about the issue. ""There's a fear-saturated conversation happening in households between the children who want to speak up about their identity, and moms who are absolutely terrified of them being in harm's way,"" Ms Zaki said.  Ms Zaki said much of the racism Palestinians are facing is rooted in prejudices against Arabs and Muslims in the US that peaked after the attacks of 11 September 2001. She added the divisive political discourse in the US around the Israel-Gaza war is part of the problem. Abeer Ramadan-Shinnawi, an education consultant and mother based in Maryland, said that as a Palestinian born and raised in the US, she has often felt ""othered"" in American society - something that she said is also experienced by other minorities in the country.  ""There is no sense of acceptance,"" Ms Ramadan-Shinnawi said.  But amid the fear and frustration is also resilience. A few days after the Burlington shootings, two vigils were held back-to-back in the city to honour the three young Palestinian men who were shot. One was held across from the hospital in which they were recovering, where a few people arrived wearing keffiyehs.  And some like Ms Bornadaro have since been reflecting on the agonising conversations they have had with their children. ""I have decided to get myself a keffiyeh again,"" she told the BBC, a few weeks after the Burlington shooting had passed.  ""I used to wear one many years ago,"" she said, adding that she feels compelled to wear it again in solidarity."

The Most Reverend Justin Welby said ""this year, the skies of Bethlehem are full of fear rather than angels and glory"" during a service at Canterbury Cathedral. He also referred to conflict elsewhere including in Ukraine, saying ""around the world, we are beset with violence"". And he talked about the ""age-old sin"" of antisemitism in the UK.  He compared the turbulent background of Jesus' upbringing with the struggles of children in the region today. He said: ""Today a crying child is in a manger somewhere in the world, nobody willing or able to help his parents, or her parents, who so desperately need shelter.  ""Or perhaps lying in an incubator, in a hospital low on electricity, like the Anglican Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza, surrounded by suffering and death. ""Or maybe the newborn lies in a house that still bears the marks of the horrors of 7 October, with family members killed, and a mother who counted her life as lost."" On 7 October, the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which governs Gaza, led a massive attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 240 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a war against it in response, which has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Archbishop Welby also referred to antisemitism in the UK, saying: ""Or maybe they are not a newborn, but someone thinking of next term, having again to hide their Jewishness on their way to school in this country.   ""Or a playgroup in our own cities, fearful of the age-old sin, the atrocious sin, of antisemitism"".  The archbishop said ""serving, not in being served"" was the answer to resolving problems such as climate change, terrorism, economic inequality, antisemitism, Islamophobia and racism. God ""confronts our cruelty with his compassion"" and ""responds to our selfishness with service"", Archbishop Welby said. He referred to a visit to a US church which among other things took in guns from the streets, and said he himself was wearing a cross made out of a melted-down automatic rifle - ""transformed into a sign of hope and life"". He also paid tribute to King Charles III, whose coronation he led in May 2023. ""Two thousand years later, in our culture, it seems natural and right for a king in royal robes to answer a child, 'I come not to be served, but to serve' - and we know that that is the right way to be a king."" Peace was also a strong theme for the leader of Catholicism in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, who spoke about the ""terrible war ravaging parts of the Holy Land"" at Midnight Mass in Westminster Cathedral. ""The angels cry, they cry out for peace - and let our voices join with theirs in prayer for such peace; for a cessation of violence, for the relief of such suffering, and for the release of hostages,"" he said. Pope Francis has also appealed for peace against the ""futile logic of war"" during Christmas Eve mass. The Pope told worshippers at Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican: ""Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world."""

Oscar-winning British filmmaker Steve McQueen's mammoth documentary Occupied City arrives in US cinemas on Christmas Day, presenting a chilling chronicle of the systematic and brutal efforts to remove the Jewish population from Amsterdam during World War Two. It is a bold undertaking, four hours and 22 minutes long, and quite different from McQueen's other celebrated features, including 2014 best picture winner 12 Years a Slave, for which he is probably best-known. More like this: -       Small Axe: 'The most exhilarating director working today' -       The artists who outwitted the Nazis -       Did a magician help vanquish the Nazis in WW2? McQueen tells the BBC his interest in the Nazi occupation comes from personal circumstances; he has a Dutch wife, historian and filmmaker Bianca Stigter, and for 25 years has been living in Amsterdam, where history feels ever-present. The Nazis invaded Amsterdam in May 1940, when the city's Jewish population was almost 80,000. By the time the war was over, it's estimated that around 80% of Amsterdam's Jews had been deported and slaughtered at concentration camps.  McQueen says he always felt there was something lurking in the shadows of the city that he wanted to uncover, which is what Occupied City attempts to do. ""I think sometimes the things that you're looking for are right under your nose,"" he tells the BBC. ""When I first started living in Amsterdam, I thought that I was living with ghosts, that there was another narrative going on other than my own. It was the evidence of things not seen."" Stigter provided that evidence, laying the groundwork for the film in a comprehensive book, Atlas of an Occupied City: Amsterdam 1940-1945, published in October 2019. ""The book documents street by street, house by house, and sometimes even floor by floor the extremes of what happened during the Second World War, it was written as a kind of travel guide to the past of Amsterdam,"" she tells the BBC. In the documentary, McQueen uses research from the book and visits 130 Amsterdam addresses once inhabited by Jews. ""In some ways, it is a sort of archaeological dig. We look at the locations which were occupied, where the food was delivered, [where] the people were hiding,"" he says. Viewers, party to this tragic tour, hear the names of Jewish city dwellers read out in a narration provided by actor Melanie Hyams, together with other personal details – and then we learn of their fate. More often than not, their final destination is a concentration camp, which Hyams names, uttering the word ""Auschwitz"" with a shocking finality. The cumulative effect of this constant cataloguing of Jewish lives destroyed is emotionally powerful. Watching the documentary has been described as an immersive experience because it can feel as if you're trapped inside 1940s Amsterdam as the Nazi menace roams the city streets. Hyams's narration adds to the impending doom as she describes the escalating restrictions on Jews as they're banned from parks, pools, shops, cafes and then from all public life. What is conveyed is a growing sense of dread that the extinction of Jewish life was not only imminent but also inevitable. In a bold move, McQueen illustrates his documentary with contemporary footage of life in the city shot during the Covid-19 era. We don't see archival pictures from the 1940s; we don't hear from survivors; there are no talking heads. McQueen is drawn to the dissonance of audiences hearing the text of the commentary detailing the past horrors of Nazi-era Amsterdam while seeing images of the Dutch city today. As Stigter explains: ""You get a double portrait and it is for the viewer to see the connections or not see the connections between the two."" As McQueen sees it, it is a narrative device designed to engage the mind. ""Sometimes the present erases the past, and sometimes it's kind of like knocking into each other, sometimes it merges. It could connect, it might not connect."" He is keen for his documentary to energise people, to instil in them a sense of responsibility for forestalling the kinds of horrors that defined the Nazi era. ""In some ways, [it's] a call to arms in being active in our everyday to change things,"" he explains. ""We have to be proactive, particularly in these times. I think the film is meant to stir the pot."" 'Resilience and triumph' Occupied City arrives in cinemas while Israel and Gaza face international pressure to broker a ceasefire, and amid numerous accounts of a rise in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. The director thinks these incidents and the recent election of Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders add resonance to his documentary. ""That may have made the film more vital, more urgent, if anything,"" he says. McQueen is mindful of the sensitivities regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict, and makes clear his film is not an account of Jewish life, or death, to the exclusion of any other group, nor are its lessons confined to the story of Amsterdam during World War Two. ""This is Jewish people as in us all – Jews, non-Jews – who are resilient. This is about resilience and triumph,"" he says. To that point, the documentary does end on a life-affirming note, perhaps illustrating the sustaining power of human connection in the face of adversity. ""Love is supreme. I think that's the biggest thing about this film, is a want and need to find love,"" says McQueen, who believes his film is a testament to human strength. ""We're so resilient as human beings, and no matter what's put in front of us, we sort of keep on going, and do we have a choice? Not really. Because we don't know what's around the corner. That's hopefully the triumph of the film: Let us not forget, let us not forget."" The documentary's long running time could intimidate those contemplating seeing it. But McQueen maintains that once audiences start watching, they forget about its length. ""Time doesn't really come up in the conversation,"" he says. McQueen's opus certainly has lengthy antecedents including the landmark 1985 nine-hour French Holocaust documentary Shoah from Claude Lanzmann, which relied on oral histories from survivors. But as Stitger points out, documentaries like Occupied City are having to develop new strategies to tell the story of the Holocaust. ""There is no other way, because the eyewitness will not be with us for much longer. So to keep this story in our presence, so to speak, you will have to look for other ways to bring it to the fore,"" she says. As for the film's critical response, Variety's chief critic Owen Gleiberman describes it as ""a trial to sit through"" and ""stultifying"". But Occupied City has won some significant endorsement, from Manohla Dargis of the New York Times, and garnered five stars from The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw. In their view, and among its admirers, Occupied City is monumental cinema from one of Britain's top directors: an artful and original excavation of the terrifying darkness that enveloped Amsterdam just over 80 years ago, brought into stark relief in the context of today. Occupied City is released in the US on 25 December.

Sanjay Bhandari, chair of Kick It Out (KIO) and has been appointed MBE for services to sport. The charity, which started in 1993, has been headed up by Mr Bhandari, of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, since 2019.  He said more supporters were ""calling out racism"", which he saw as progress.  ""I am humbled and honoured to receive an award like this,"" he said. ""It is a recognition of the team that I have a privilege to lead. This is just as much a recognition of that fantastic team, as it is of my small contribution to it."" Mr Bhandhari, 55, said he had seen a drop in racism at matches.  ""For the first 20 years of watching football, I heard racist chants every single match,"" he said. ""Now, I can't remember the last time I heard those particular chants. ""We think that there is less racism and discrimination inside grounds than 30 years ago. We feel KIO has made a positive impact on that. We feel more confident that people want to report incidents, and are less tolerant of discrimination.""  Mr Bhandari has has given evidence at DCMS select committees looking into the challenges of managing online hate. He has also led football's collective efforts to bring forward recommendations for the Online Safety Bill.  Earlier this week, two people were arrested over alleged racist chants at a match between King's Lynn Town and Boston United.  ""There are incidents of racism from crowds to players, like we have seen this week, but thankfully they are isolated incidents; one or two people, not whole crowds,"" he said. ""It's still not good enough. People are now calling it out, which didn't happen 30 years ago and there is consequences for those actions. That in of itself is progress."" Despite progress in tackling racism, Mr Bhandari said the group had seen a rise in other forms of discrimination in football.  ""We want to change the culture of the game, so it's more welcoming to under-represented communities, focussing on homophobic and misogynistic chanting, the rise of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism,"" he said. KIO recently secured a major sponsorship agreement with Sky Sports, guaranteeing it £3m over three years. ""I wanted to bring more partnership with commercial organisations that share our values and ambitions,"" said Mr Bhandari. ""We want to make football a game where everyone feels they belong. That's our mission.""  Mr Bhandari said he planned to take his mother - who turns 96 in several weeks - with him to the palace to receive his honour.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-57387884,Teen calls on victims to speak out against racism,A 17-year-old who was targeted last month says racism is too often ignored by victims.,8 Jun 2021,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"A teenager has called for victims of racist abuse to speak out more after being targeted last month. Yasmin, 17, was racially abused as she walked home with a friend in Oswestry. She said her mother, who wears a hijab and has also been racially abused, would have preferred her not to have gone to the police, due to a lack of trust in authorities. However, Yasmin said this attitude meant incidents going underreported, particularly in rural areas. She said a young boy, whom she believed to be in primary school, shouted a highly offensive term. ""I laughed a bit and said I'd not heard that for a while - it's been a couple of years,"" she said. It led to her recalling other incidents in the past which she did not report. ""I remember this one boy, before he'd even met me, went round after the Manchester attack and kept telling everyone that teachers should check my bags in case I had a bomb coming into the school,"" she said. Yasmin said if her friend had not been with her last month, she probably ""wouldn't have told anyone"". ""My family doesn't talk about racism, it's the elephant in the room which is covered up,"" she said. The teenager, who turns 18 this month, was interviewed by West Mercia Police after her friend reported the latest abuse.  When the 17-year-old gave a statement to officers, she said her mother was ""a bit angry"".  ""I told her I wasn't the one in trouble but she said 'no, it's still the police'. She's scared that something might happen to harm us more."" Yasmin said she believed such attitudes meant racism going unnoticed in areas like rural Shropshire. ""My mum, because she wears a hijab, she gets comments, people laughing at her, pointing at her,"" Yasmin said. ""It's very common, but it's not very talked about. We just think there's nothing you can do about it, so we don't make a big deal out of it."" In the 2020-21 financial year, there were 1,524 hate crimes recorded in the West Mercia Police force area, 69% of them having a racial marker. Police and Crime Commissioner John Campion told the BBC these offences were higher than previous years, which he called ""a worrying trend"". ""We need to make sure all communities in West Mercia have confidence in their police service,"" he said. ""What's worrying is that loads isn't reported - there's lots out there that people are just putting up with. ""We don't have to put up with these crimes, something can be done.""

Stephen Antony Savva, a candidate for Brimsdown ward on Enfield Council, made the Twitter comments in 2017 and 2018. In one post, he asked people coming to the UK to ""stop dressing funny"". Enfield North Conservatives said Mr Savva had been suspended from the party after ""reports of offensive tweets"". The association said: ""We are currently investigating the matter and take reports such as these extremely seriously."" One tweet from Mr Savva's account, uncovered by national anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate, stated: ""How about the removal of all immigrants?""  The tweet continued: ""Wouldn't that be wonderful? Just think of all the homes that would suddenly become available? All those school places?"" A reply from Mr Savva's account to an article about TV chef Nadiya Hussain, revealing that she suffers Islamophobic abuse on social media, stated: ""As a westerner she shouldn't wear a headdress. If she integrated more, she wouldn't suffer any abuse."" A further post stated that Mr Savva believed ""those who are privileged enough to come and live here should live by our ways. And stop dressing funny"". Mr Savva previously stood for the Conservatives in Southbury ward, Enfield, in 2014. Gregory Davis, a researcher at Hope Not Hate, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service before the suspension was announced that the comments had made clear that Mr Savva was a ""wildly inappropriate candidate"". Mr David said Mr Savva ""cannot possibly represent the best interests of a diverse constituency"". Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission said Mr Savva would still appear as a Tory candidate on ballot papers during England's local elections on Thursday. ""The nomination process for the elections is now complete and the ballot papers have been printed so a candidate cannot be removed,"" a spokeswoman said.  However, the Conservatives were no longer required to consider Mr Savva as representing the party. ""It would be a matter for the party to make clear to electors that a candidate no longer represented the party if that was the case,"" she added. The controversy comes weeks after another party member in Enfield, Colin Davis, resigned from his position as chair of Enfield Southgate Conservative Association when a photo appearing to show him wear Nazi uniform in the 1980s was uncovered.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49234594,Tories 'will order Islamophobia inquiry',But the party chairman is criticised for saying it must settle on a definition of Islamophobia first.,5 Aug 2019,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"The Conservative Party will order an independent inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia within its ranks, the chairman has confirmed. But James Cleverly was criticised for saying the party must agree a definition of Islamophobia first. Earlier this year, the Tories rejected a definition created by a cross-party group of MPs and backed by several other parties, including Labour. Tory peer Baroness Warsi accused her party of ""political hypocrisy"". She said Labour had used exactly the same argument around a definition when it was accused of failing to tackle anti-Semitism, and her Tory colleagues had ""rightly criticised"" them for that. ""And yet we are now adopting exactly the approach we condemned,"" the party's first female Muslim cabinet member tweeted. Since 2018, the Muslim Council of Britain has been calling for the Tories to launch an independent inquiry into alleged Islamophobia, and in May, the council formally asked the UK's human rights watchdog, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), to hold one. The MCB has listed a series of complaints against figures in the party, including Boris Johnson for comments he made about Muslim women before becoming prime minister.   Asked on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether there would be an independent inquiry into the issue, Mr Cleverly replied: ""Yes there will be."" Pressed on whether it would look specifically at Islamophobia or more broadly at all forms of prejudice, he continued: ""One of the things we need to get is the definition of that, so specifically on that point we will be guided by a formal definition of Islamophobia. ""But the point is we do, and will always, take firm action on anyone who steps outside the boundaries of appropriate behaviour."" During the Conservative leadership race, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid challenged the other candidates to commit to an external investigation and the others appeared to agree to it. Later though, Mr Johnson claimed he understood they had committed to an inquiry ""into all types of prejudice and discrimination including anti-Semitism"", not Islamophobia specifically. The EHRC is already investigating Labour over allegations of anti-Semitism. The MCB said the definition of Islamophobia must reflect the lived experiences of Muslims. ""An inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party has been long-awaited and will be welcomed if it is sufficiently independent and robust. Words must be followed by action."" The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims came up with its definition earlier this year and it was endorsed by Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Conservatives and several Muslim groups. It states: ""Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."" A government spokesman said the wording needed ""further careful consideration"" and had ""not been broadly accepted"". Concerns were raised, including by the chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, that the definition was too vague and could undermine efforts to tackle extremism."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44410597,Austria to shut seven 'political' mosques,The government's crackdown mostly targets imams alleged to have Turkish nationalist links.,8 Jun 2018,2024-10-15,Islamophobia,BBC,International,"Austria has said it will close down seven mosques and expel imams who it says are funded by foreign countries.  Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the move was a crackdown on political Islam. Some mosques are suspected of having links to Turkish nationalists. In April images emerged showing children in Turkish army uniforms re-enacting the World War One Battle of Gallipoli. The Turkish president's office called Austria's move ""Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory"". Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin took to Twitter to condemn the move. The Austrian government says 60 of the 260 imams in the country are being investigated, of whom 40 belong to ATIB, an Islamic organisation in Austria close to the Turkish government.  ""Parallel societies, political Islam and radicalisation tendencies have no place in our country,"" said Chancellor Kurz on Friday. The Gallipoli re-enactment performance took place in a Vienna mosque reported to be run by ATIB.  The WW1 battle, one of the last victories of the Ottoman Empire, stopped Allied forces reaching its capital, Constantinople. Austrian media report (in German) that the child actors played dead and were covered with Turkish flags.  Separately, Austrian public broadcaster ORF says photos of children doing the Turkish nationalist Grey Wolves greeting came from a mosque in Vienna's Favoriten district run by the Grey Wolves, a group with branches in several countries. The government is dissolving an organisation called the Arab Religious Community. Six of the mosques targeted for closure are run by it: three in Vienna, two in Upper Austria and one in Carinthia.  In neighbouring Germany, police have been probing links between certain imams and the Turkish state, which funds a Muslim organisation called Ditib. The Austrian authorities have been working with a Muslim community body called IGGÖ to identify mosques and imams suspected of radical Islamist or nationalist connections. They have soured significantly in recent years.  Mr Kurz's election campaign last year drew heavily on anxiety about immigration and the integration of Muslims. His conservative People's Party (ÖVP) formed a coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). Mr Kurz wants the EU to break off Turkey's EU membership negotiations - a stance that has angered Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In May 2017 that anger led Turkey to veto Nato's co-operation with Austria. The move disrupted Nato's partnership activities with 41 countries. Turkey is a key player in Nato operations. President Erdogan's ruling AK Party has roots in political Islam and espouses traditional Muslim values.  He is campaigning for re-election, and both Austria and Germany are wary of his political influence in their Turkish communities.  The governments in Austria and other Central European countries - Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland - want to restrict Muslim immigration to Europe. There is friction between them and Germany, which took in about one million mainly Muslim asylum seekers in 2015.  Turkey is housing more than three million Syrian refugees and says the EU is not doing enough to help."

Mr Normal, who describes himself as a ""trans ally"", said the tweets, dating back to 2011 and 2015, did not reflect his current views and values and ""reading them now, I am horrified and deeply disappointed in myself"". He added that he had referred himself to the Labour Party for investigation. ""These messages were written before I was active in the Labour Party. Since being elected as a local councillor, I have been a dedicated campaigner for equality and against homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, Islamophobia or any other form of discrimination.
