More than a third of MI5’s recent, priority investigations have involved links to overseas terrorist groups, the agency’s Director General Ken McCallum said in a speech in London, with ISIS in particular resuming “efforts to export terrorism.”                 And more than one in eight people being investigated by the service for involvement in terrorism are minors, McCallum said, a three-fold increase since 2021.                 McCallum’s speech comes amid a string of Western warnings about the increasing risk of state-sponsored sabotage by nations including Russia and Iran, and as wars in Ukraine and the Middle East rock global security.                 Overall, his agency has prevented 43 late-stage terror attack plots since March 2017 – with organizers often “in the final days of planning mass murder” – McCallum told reporters. About three-quarters of the agency’s work tackles Islamist extremism, while a quarter relates to far-right groups, he said.                 “We are powerfully alive to the risk that events in the Middle East directly trigger terrorist action in the UK,” he said. But while a rise in public disorder and hate crime has occurred, it hasn’t yet translated into terrorist activity, he said.                 ISIS, however, is once again firmly in the crosshairs of the agency. Five years since the fall of ISIS’ self-proclaimed caliphate across Iraq and Syria, the group has morphed into a terror network with cells spread around the world, including in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.                 “After a few years of being pinned well back, they’ve resumed efforts to export terrorism,” he said. And al Qaeda “has sought to capitalize on conflict in the Middle East, calling for violent action.”                 McCallum said on Tuesday that Russia’s GRU intelligence agency was pressing ahead with a “sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets,” conducting operations that included “arson, sabotage and more.”                 And he revealed that MI5 and British police had responded to 20 Iran-backed terror plots in Britain since the start of 2022.                 “MI5 has one hell of a job on its hands,” McCallum said. “The first 20 years of my career here were crammed full of terrorist threats. We now face those alongside state-backed assassination and sabotage plots, against the backdrop of a major European land war.”                 Speeches by the domestic intelligence chief are uncommon, and tend to be used as an opportunity to update Britain’s public on the nature of the terror threat faced by the country.     Related articleHow ISIS has Europe and the US in sights after deadly Moscow attack             The UK has joined allies including the US in loudly publicizing allegations of Russian sabotage since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Despite the expulsion of more than 750 Russian diplomats from Europe – “many of them spies” – McCallum said “we should expect to see continued acts of aggression here at home.”                 The GRU has long been accused by the West of orchestrating brazen and high-profile attacks, including cyberattacks, interference in US presidential elections and the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England.                 In February, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the American agency had disrupted a network of over 1,000 hacked internet routers that the GRU was using for cyber-espionage operations against the United States and its European allies.                 “If you take money from Iran, Russia or any other state to carry out illegal acts in the UK, you will bring the full weight of the national security apparatus down on you,” McCallum said on Tuesday. “It’s a choice you’ll regret.”                 He meanwhile highlighted a series of new trends his agency was responding to. Among the most striking was the rise in minors being investigated for terrorism offenses; far-right terrorism in particular ropes in young people, he said, “driven by propaganda that shows a canny understanding of online culture.”                 He listed three recent convictions of British teenagers to underline the diversity of threats faced. “One planned to attack a British synagogue. Another posted material that inspired deadly mass shootings in the US. A third drew up plans to stab people at a music festival and shared terrorist propaganda online,” McCallum said.

Inspector-General of Police Razarudin Husain said the raids were conducted after investigations into allegations of child abandonment, deviant teachings and sexual assault at the homes, run by the Global Ikhwan Services and Business Holdings.                 Some 201 boys and 201 girls, aged between 1 to 17 years, were rescued from 18 homes in central Selangor state and two in southern Negeri Sembilan state, he said. The 171 suspects — 66 men and 105 women — included religious teachers and caretakers, he said.                 Children were sexually abused not only by the caretakers but were also forced to do the same to each other at the facilities, Razarudin said in a televised news conference.                 “Those who were sick were not allowed to seek medical attention until their condition became critical,” he said. Some young children were also burnt with a hot spoon when they made mistakes, and caretakers had touched the children’s bodies as if to conduct medical checks, he said.                 Police believed that Global Ikhwan exploited the children and used religious sentiments to collect donations, he said.                 Investigations showed that the children at the welfare homes belonged to members of the Global Ikhwan group, placed by their parents at the homes since they were infants, he said. The children would undergo medical assessment amid ongoing investigations, he added.                 According to its website, Global Ikhwan was founded by Ashaari Mohamad, who headed the Islamic sect Al Arqam which was deemed heretical and banned by the government in 1994. It said the group had undergone a series of rebranding since Ashaari died in 2010.                 The group recently also came under the radar of Islamic authorities amid claims that it was still involved with the deviant teachings of the Al-Arqam sect.                 Global Ikhwan, in a statement Wednesday, denied allegations that it exploited children and said that it would cooperate with authorities. But it made no mention of allegations of sexual abuse against them.                 “The company will not compromise with any activity that goes against the law, particularly regarding the exploitation of children as workers,” the statement said.                 Global Ikhwan’s website said it is involved in a wide range of businesses including food and beverage, media, medical, travel and property. It employs more than 5,000 people and has branches in 20 countries including a chain of restaurants in London, Paris, Australia and Dubai among others.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

The global growth of Islam, and the rise of extremism across religions, also made this an urgent priority.","Sep 5, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Kathleen Magramo,International,"Since his papacy began in 2013, Pope Francis has signaled his intention to build bridges with other faiths. The global growth of Islam, and the rise of extremism across religions, also made this an urgent priority.                 On Thursday, in the biggest mosque in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, the pontiff used a joint statement with Indonesia’s Grand Imam Nasaruddin Umar to pinpoint “two serious crises” facing the world: dehumanization and climate change.                 “The global phenomenon of dehumanization is marked especially by widespread violence and conflict, frequently leading to an alarming number of victims,” said the statement, signed in the sprawling capital Jakarta.                 “It is particularly worrying that religion is often instrumentalized in this regard, causing suffering to many, especially women, children and the elderly,” it continued. “The role of religion, however, should include promoting and safeguarding the dignity of every human life.”                 On climate change, the declaration stated that “human exploitation of creation” had led to “various destructive consequences such as natural disasters, global warming and unpredictable weather patterns,” and an “obstacle to the harmonious coexistence of peoples.”                 Francis arrived at Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, in the morning, driving past streets lined with well-wishers in a metropolis that is one of the fastest sinking cities in the world. That concern has sparked a controversial and expensive plan to relocate Indonesia’s capital entirely.                 Indonesia, a vast archipelago in the tropics, is vulnerable to sea level rise driven by human-caused climate change, as well as hazards triggered by extreme weather, including floods and landslides.                 The mosque is next-door to the city’s Catholic cathedral, and the pope visited an underpass known as the “tunnel of friendship” which connects the places of worship.                 As part of the event, the pope also listened to Islamic prayers being recited by a young blind girl named Syakila, the winner of a national Quran recitation competition.                 His Indonesia trip and the signing of the declaration are in keeping with his bridge-building approach. But while about 87% of Indonesia’s 280 million people practice Islam, the visit also puts the spotlight on its 8.6 million Catholics and other minorities.                 His arrival in the archipelago nation “is good news for us, something that strengthens our faith,” said Father Hieronymus Sridanto Ariwobo, a Catholic priest in Jakarta.     Related articleThese women are about to play Glastonbury. That should be no surprise given their nation is mad about metal             “And secondly, the pope will come here as a symbol (of) the relationship between the Christian and Muslim here in the country.”                 Historically, the country’s form of Islam has been moderate and syncretic, often sitting comfortably alongside animist and other pre-Islamic practices, while the state ideology, known as “Pancasila,” encourages religious freedom and social justice.                 “Indonesia is a great country, a mosaic of cultures, ethnicities and religious traditions, a rich diversity, which is also reflected in the varied ecosystem,” Francis said during Thursday’s inter-faith meeting, which the pontiff spent in a wheelchair. “May no one succumb to the allure of fundamentalism and violence.”                 The 87-year-old is currently on the longest trip of his pontificate, despite facing health challenges and having started to use a wheelchair in recent years.                 He is scheduled to hold a mass at Jakarta’s National Stadium later Thursday, which is expected to be attended by about 80,000 people.                 The following day he leaves for Papua New Guinea, the second leg of a marathon 12-day visit of four countries in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, which also includes East Timor and Singapore.                 Indonesia is a symbolically strong choice for the kind of inter-faith approach Francis has embraced.                 In the 13th century, traders from Arabia, Gujarat and China reached what is now Indonesia, buying cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. Some of those spice-trade merchants also brought with them Islam and, as some settled on the islands of Java and Sumatra, the religion gradually blended with local animist beliefs.                 Christianity came to Indonesia with Portuguese traders more than 200 years later, mainly in the eastern islands of Maluku and Timor. The Jesuit missionary St. Francis Xavier worked in the Maluku islands, but by the late 1600s the Dutch East India Company had expelled all Catholic missionaries.                 After Japanese occupation during the Second World War, nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence in 1945. Muslims and Christians have coexisted in Indonesia for decades since its modern founding, and most of its Islamic believers are broadly moderate and syncretic.     At the start of his Asia-Pacific tour, Pope Francis says the Catholic church is going to step up its efforts to tackle religious extremism and violence across the world. Christopher Lamb explains the Pope's strategy.   Related videoPope Francis warns against religious extremism             But there have been occasional bouts of religious tension. In 2021, two suicide bombers attacked Sacred Heart Cathedral in Makassar on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island during a Palm Sunday Mass, injuring at least 14 people. In 2018, at least seven were killed in three church bombings in Indonesia on the same day.                 Religious minorities have at times faced attacks from vocal Islamist extremist groups and some parts of Indonesia are more conservative, such as the province of Aceh, which practices strict Islamic laws.                 “Indonesia [is] like a huge laboratory for experiencing a different kind of Islam, a different kind of democracy,” said Ulil Abshar Abdalla, a leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s biggest Islamic organization.                 Milawati, a Catholic who like many Indonesians goes by one name, said she hopes the pope’s visit will send a message to her compatriots to “live a life of mutual love, respect and tolerance between other religions” so that the country may progress.                 “⁠As Catholics, we view all religions as having the same goal, living a good and righteous life and believing in God the Creator,” she said.                 And Elia Dimas Indahputro, a 47-year-old sound engineer, said the significance of religion is sometimes overstated in parts of Indonesia, adding that mingling between people of different creeds is common.                 “Even my wife has a different religion, she is Muslim, while I am Catholic,” he told CNN.                 Francis’ Indonesia visit follows trips to other majority-Muslim nations such as Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, with the latter marking the first time a pope had travelled to the Arabian Peninsula. While in Abu Dhabi in 2019, he signed a historic declaration on inter-faith co-operation with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the leading Sunni Muslim leader.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

It’s only getting worse,"The widespread anti-immigrant riots in the United Kingdom of the past week, and the false viral claims that fueled them, may be the clearest, most direct example yet of the way unchecked misinformation on social media can produce violence ...","Aug 9, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Brian Fung,International,"Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index              Latest Market News              Hot Stocks              The widespread anti-immigrant riots in the United Kingdom of the past week, and the false viral claims that fueled them, may be the clearest, most direct example yet of the way unchecked misinformation on social media can produce violence and harm in the real world.                 Even after authorities identified a UK national as the suspect behind a series of deadly stabbings targeting children, false claims about the attacker’s name and origins continued to stoke anti-immigrant fervor and propel far-right demonstrations.                 The fake claims have circulated widely, particularly on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, extremism researchers said. And police have openly blamed that misinformation for the violence that has wracked the country in recent days, with rioters throwing bricks at mosques, setting cars on fire and chanting anti-Islamic slogans while clashing with officers in riot gear.                 The events of the past week are hardly the only example of the link between online misinformation and politically motivated violence: From the Rohingya genocide to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, false and misleading claims have consistently been at the center of high-profile incidences of political unrest and violence.                 It is a pattern that keeps repeating despite years of calls by governments and civil society groups for social media platforms to rein in inflammatory, hateful posts, as well as pledges by companies themselves to do more.     A recent retreat from content moderation by some major platforms, however, suggests that the problem of violence fueled by misinformation may well get worse before it gets better.                 For nearly a decade, governments and civil rights groups have increasingly argued that online platforms have created enormous societal costs.                 Critics of social media have repeatedly accused the industry of putting corporate profits before users’ mental health, or opening the door to foreign meddling, without doing enough to shield the world from those risks.                 An economist might call these negative externalities – like pollution, they are byproducts of a profit-seeking business that, left unaddressed, everyone else must either learn to live with or mitigate, usually at great collective expense. The consequences tend to play out over long timeframes and with large-scale, systemic effects.     Related articleElon Musk says ‘civil war is inevitable’ as UK rocked by far-right riots. He’s part of the problem             This week, it is hard to avoid wondering whether politically motivated violence based on nothing more than bad-faith, evidence-free speculation has become a permanent fixture among social media’s various externalities, and if we are being asked to make peace with it as a condition of living in a digitally connected world.                 Many social media companies have invested heavily in content moderation over the years. But the industry’s recent track record hints at a bet – or perhaps a hope – that just maybe, the public will tolerate a bit more pollution.                 There are some signs of pushback. In the European Union, officials are looking to hold social media companies accountable for spreading misinformation under the new Digital Services Act. In the UK, the Online Safety Act could take effect as soon as this year, requiring, among other things, social media platforms to remove illegal content.                 And even tougher rules may be on the way as a result of the riots. “We’re going to have to look more broadly at social media after this disorder,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a video distributed to media Friday.                 But punishments for online wrongdoing are already being handed out to individual perpetrators. On Friday, Jordan Parlour from Leeds, England, was sentenced to 20 months in jail after being convicted of publishing written material intended to stir racial hatred. The 28-year-old had posted the material on Facebook.                 The United States has lagged on platform regulation, partly due to congressional dysfunction and partly because of legal and constitutional differences that grant online platforms more freedom to manage their own websites.                 Still, lawmakers made some moves last month when the US Senate passed the Kids Online Safety Act, which aims to combat mental health harms for teens linked to social media.                 It may be tempting to dismiss social media’s role in the UK riots as merely a reflection of latent political trends or the result of activism that would have happened on other platforms anyway.                 But that distracts from the calculation that some platforms appear to have made: At least some of the time, some amount of misinformation-fueled violence is a reasonable cost for society to pay.

Imam Hussein bin Ali’s death in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD is believed to have cemented the split between Shiites – who consider him a rightful successor to the prophet – and Sunnis, the world’s most populous Islamic sect.                 Shiites comprise the majority of Muslims in Iran, Iraq and Azerbaijan, with sizable minority populations in a number of countries including Pakistan and India.                 Ashura, or “the 10th day,” falls on the 10th day of Muharram, the first month in the Islamic calendar. It is the holiest day for Shiites, many of whom make pilgrimages to a shrine in Karbala, Iraq, traditionally believed to be Hussein’s tomb.                 Some Shiites express mourning by beating themselves on the back with chains – intended to connect them with Hussein’s suffering and death as an aid to salvation on the Day of Judgement.                 Hussein’s martyrdom is widely interpreted by Shiites as a symbol of the struggle against injustice, tyranny, and oppression.                 Symbols of Shiite piety and repentance include red flags for Hussein’s blood and black garments for mourning.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The Sunni-Muslim Islamist group said in a statement late on Tuesday that three of its “suicide attackers” fired on worshippers at the mosque and exchanged gunfire with Omani security forces until morning, Reuters reported. The group also published what it said was a video of the attack on the Telegram  messaging app.                 The incident has shocked a country that avoided the sectarian violence that gripped some Middle Eastern states, including some of Oman’s oil-rich neighbors, after ISIS declared a state in Iraq and Syria a decade ago and sought to expand throughout the Arabian Peninsula. The group considers Shiites heretics.                 The Royal Oman Police said on Tuesday that nine people were killed in the shooting in the capital Muscat’s Wadi al-Kabir district, including the three perpetrators and a policeman. More than two dozen people of various nationalities were injured, including four Omani first responders, the police said. It didn’t identify a motive for the attack or reveal the identity of the attackers.                 The attack took place at the Imam Ali mosque, according to video obtained by Reuters and geolocated by CNN, during Ashura, the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram, which holds particular significance for Shiite Muslims.                 The oil-producing nation is one of the most stable in the Middle East and is becoming an emerging regional tourism destination as the government promotes the sector to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons.                 Unlike the rest of the Sunni-ruled Gulf states, Oman follows the Ibadi sect of Islam but has a sizable Sunni population and a small but influential Shiite minority. Religious and political leaders often emphasize sectarian harmony and religious tolerance as key to the country’s stability. About 57% of the country’s population of five million are expatriates, many of whom are Hindu or Christian.                 Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday that four Pakistanis were among the dead. Another 30 Pakistanis were injured and currently receiving treatment in hospital, the ministry added. It condemned the incident as a “dastardly terrorist attack.”                 “We are heartened that the government of Oman has neutralized the attackers,” the ministry said.                 Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X Tuesday that he had been “deeply saddened” by the incident.                 “My heart goes out to the families of the victims. I have instructed the Pakistan Embassy in Muscat to extend all possible assistance to the injured and visit the hospitals personally,” he wrote.                 One Indian citizen was killed and another injured, India’s embassy in Muscat announced in a post on X Tuesday.                 The US embassy in Muscat issued a security alert for US citizens, advising them to “remain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities.”                 It said visa appointments scheduled for Tuesday would be canceled as a safety precaution.                 Oman police said military and security procedures have concluded, and an investigation is ongoing.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Announcing the positions on Tuesday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East had caused “a great deal of grief” for Jewish and Islamic communities in Australia.                 “Australians overwhelmingly do not want conflict brought here. What they want here is harmony and for people to be able to get on with each other,” he said.                 The appointments come amid protests in Australia and dissent within the ranks of Albanese’s ruling Labor Party over a war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced more than 2 million people in Gaza.     Related articleDevelopments in Gaza ceasefire talks raise hopes but challenges persist. Here’s what to know             More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, when Israel launched a devastating response to an attack by Hamas militants that killed more than 1,100 Israelis and saw hundreds of others kidnapped to Gaza.                 The two sides remain locked in conflict amid deeply polarized protests around the world over how Israel is fighting the conflict in Gaza where millions of Palestinians are facing famine and Hamas continues to hold hostages.                 Albanese said Tuesday that Jewish lawyer Jillian Segal had been appointed to consult Jewish Australians, experts and the wider community about ways to best address antisemitism.                 “One of the things that I have found quite shocking is the lack of knowledge and experience about antisemitism and about where it leads,” Albanese said from the Jewish Museum in Sydney where he made the announcement.                 “I have spoken with members of the Jewish community here, in Melbourne, right around Australia, who have not felt safe, members of the Jewish community whose children are worried about wearing their school uniform in our capital cities. That’s not acceptable,” he said.                 The Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), which represents the Jewish community, recorded a spike in antisemitic incidents from October to November 2023. The group said Tuesday reports of antisemitic incidents in Australia are still running 400-500% higher than before the conflict.                 In some of the most high-profile incidents in Melbourne this year, windows were smashed on the office of a Jewish lawmaker and antisemitic slogans were written on a Jewish school.                 The Australian government supports a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East and has backed calls for a ceasefire, the safe passage of humanitarian aid, and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.                 Albanese said a “special envoy for Islamophobia” will be appointed “shortly” in a similar role to work with the Muslim community to promote social cohesion.                 Most countries recognize Palestinian statehood, and in May a United Nations resolution on Palestinian membership passed with the support of 143 nations, including Australia.                 In recent weeks the government’s own cohesion has been tested by the resignation of a West Australian senator, who crossed the floor to vote with a rival party on the issue of Palestinian statehood.     Related articleSlovenia becomes latest European country to recognize Palestinian state             “With a heavy heart but a clear conscience, I announce my resignation from the Australian Labor Party,” Sen. Fatima Payman announced last Thursday.                 Payman, Labor’s first Muslim senator, voted with the Greens Party on a motion to recognize Palestinian statehood and threatened to do it again, breaking party rules.                 She was indefinitely suspended from Labor’s parliamentary caucus and later resigned to serve as an independent, accusing her former colleagues of attempting to intimidate her – claims the party denied.                 Protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza are continuing in Australia with four people arrested for climbing onto the roof of Parliament House last week.                 University protests that saw hundreds of students pitch tents on campus grounds around Australia have since ended, with threats of expulsion for some students who took part.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The Texas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations identified the family as Muslim and Palestinian and called on state and federal law enforcement authorities to investigate the incident “as a hate crime and take all precautions to keep the Muslim family and the Muslim community safe,” the organization said in a news release Friday.             On May 19, Euless Police Department officers responded to a call at an apartment complex pool regarding a disturbance between two women. Witnesses told officers “a woman who was very intoxicated had tried to drown a child and argued with the child’s mother,” police said in a news release.                 The woman, identified as Elizabeth Wolf, 42, was approached by officers as she tried to leave and placed under arrest for public intoxication.                 The victim’s mother told police Wolf was questioning where she was from and if the two children playing at the pool were hers, the release said. The mother was visibly Muslim and wore a hijab, or Islamic headscarf, and modest swimwear, according to the council.     Related articleCAIR says it received more than 8,000 complaints of anti-Muslim bias in 2023 – a 56% increase over previous year             Wolf also made statements about the mother not being an American and made other racist statements, according to police.                 “When the mother answered her, she stated that Wolf tried to grab her 6-year-old son but he pulled away from her grasp, which caused a scratch on his finger. The mother began helping her son when Wolf grabbed her 3-year-old daughter and forced her underwater,” the news release said.                 The mother was able to pull her daughter from the water but she “had been yelling for help and was coughing up water.”                 Both children were medically cleared by the Euless Medics, according to the release.                 “We are American citizens, originally from Palestine, and I don’t know where to go to feel safe with my kids,” the council quoted the mother, identified only as Mrs. H, as saying. “My country is facing a war, and we are facing that hate here. My daughter is traumatized; whenever I open the apartment door, she runs away and hides, telling me she is afraid the lady will come and immerse her head in the water again.”                 The Euless Police Department confirmed to CNN that Wolf posted bail out of Tarrant County Jail.                 “The bond for the Attempted Capital Murder charge was $25,000. The bond for the Injury to a Child charge was $15,000,” Capt. Brenda Alvarado told CNN.                 CNN has reached out to Wolf’s attorney for comment.                 “We ask for a hate-crime probe, a higher bail bond, and an open conversation with officials to address this alarming increase in Islamophobia, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian sentiment,” Shaimaa Zayan, the council’s Austin operations manager, said in a statement.                 Texas Rep.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/unauthorized-hajj-muslim-pilgrims-death-intl/index.html,"For many Muslim pilgrims, a dangerous unauthorized Hajj is the only option","The tragedy has brought attention to the shadowy industry of unauthorized pilgrimage agents who profit from Muslims’ desire to fulfill their religious obligations by sidestepping official procedures, leading pilgrims on potentially ...","Jun 25, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"Abdelzaher Abdo Salem, 81, decided to make the pilgrimage to Mecca from Egypt after fulfilling a mission to get his youngest son Mahmoud married two years ago.                 “This was his last wish,” his son Mahmoud said. “He couldn’t perform the Hajj before that because of the lack of money, and because I was going to get married, and there were a lot of expenses.”                 Due to the high cost of Hajj through official channels – 150,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,091), in addition to plane tickets – Salem had resorted to a representative of an unlicensed company to organize the trip, at a lower cost of around 100,000 Egyptian pounds ($2,061).                 But Salem never made it back to Egypt. He was among the more than 1,300 pilgrims who died during this year’s Hajj as temperatures in Saudi Arabia reached record levels.     Related article‘We are happy he’s buried in Mecca,’ says daughter of man who died in Hajj heat wave             Saudi authorities said that the vast majority of those who died were not authorized to conduct the rituals.                 The tragedy, resulting in one of the highest Hajj death tolls in years, has brought attention to the shadowy industry of unauthorized pilgrimage agents. These agents profit from Muslims’ desire to fulfill their religious obligations by sidestepping official procedures, leading pilgrims on potentially hazardous journeys.                 Saudi authorities said many of those who died “walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort” as the temperature reached a record 125 degrees Fahrenheit (51.7 degrees Celsius).                 For Salem, the process to get to Mecca involved obtaining a personal visit visa to Saudi Arabia instead of a special Hajj visa that would authorize him to access the holy cities and pilgrim facilities, including air-conditioned venues and medical services. A visit visa however bars entry into Mecca, so its holders are forced to take a desert path to access the holy city, often on foot.                 Salem, who was traveling with his wife, had been promised by a representative of the Egyptian travel agency that a bus would be provided to transport the group. However, there was no transport for them to and from Mount Arafat, his son Mahmoud said, so the two had to walk towards Mina, around 8 miles away, to complete the “stoning the devil” ritual.                 On the way, Salem’s wife became exhausted and sat down to rest. Determined to complete the rituals, her husband continued walking. He promised his wife he would return, said Mahmoud.                 But contact with Salem was subsequently lost. His wife searched for him for five days until she found his name on the list of deceased at Al-Ma’aisam Hospital in Mecca.                 “Our mother informed us of the news via a voice message on WhatsApp. The news was a tragedy for us,” Mahmoud said. “Our mother is there, devastated, and no one is there to comfort her.”                 Each year, Saudi authorities issue licenses permitting legal access to Mecca for pilgrims. These licenses provide access to air-conditioned transportation and accommodation facilities for worshipers. However, the number of licenses is limited – 1.8 million this year –  and they can cost several thousand dollars.                 Every country is allocated a number of licenses that is proportional to its Muslim population. This process excludes those who cannot afford the license or are not included in the allocation.                 Hajj is a once-in-a-lifetime religious obligation for every able-bodied Muslim. Many Muslims wait their entire lives to make the journey, often delaying the pilgrimage into their old age until they have saved enough money and fulfilled their family obligations. However, millions are left disappointed when they cannot secure a spot through official channels.                 Each country traditionally gets one Hajj license for every 1,000 Muslims – that’s a 0.1% rate. But according to Egyptian officials cited in state media, Egypt, a Muslim-majority country of 110 million, was allocated 50,000 Hajj licenses this year, a rate of approximately 0.05%.                 This has given rise to a lucrative industry of travel agencies that promise to get pilgrims to Saudi Arabia unofficially, often with assurances of transport and accommodation that may not be fulfilled or are below standard. Coupled with the extreme heat this year, this spelled tragedy for many pilgrims.                 While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year’s gathering was held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom.                 Atef Aglan, a member of the Egyptian Travel Agents Association, says there is a lack of awareness about the procedures of the Hajj among many Egyptians, which allows inexperienced tour operators and some mosque imams to exploit the poor, promising a cheaper Hajj without the appropriate visa or accommodation and transport.                 He proposes criminalizing the phenomenon because “it has become a profession for those with no profession.”                 “This is premeditated murder because this broker knows that the temperatures are above 50 degrees (Celsius), and he knows that these people do not have decent accommodation,” Aglan said.                 A Hajj package from a licensed agency costs pilgrims approximately $4,760, while unauthorized trips cost around $3,700, Aglan says.                 The average annual household income in Egypt is $1,429 as of 2019, according to the latest figures.                 The tragedy has also underscored Saudi authorities’ inability to curb unauthorized pilgrimages or provide adequate care for those who undertake such journeys, which have been taking place for years.                 It is unclear how many unauthorized pilgrims made it to this year’s Hajj, but Saudi news outlet Al Sharq Al Awsat reported Tuesday that 141,000 such pilgrims received free medical treatment during the Hajj season. That amounts to approximately 8% of the 1.8 million pilgrims this year.                 In recent decades, the sheer size of Hajj crowds has been a factor in the number of deadly incidents during the pilgrimage, including a stampede that killed more than 700 people in 2015.     Related articleThe Hajj is back and Saudi Arabia is hoping to cash in             Recognizing the economic potential of religious tourism, Saudi Arabia plans to increase Hajj pilgrim numbers to 5 million by 2030 from just under 2 million now.                 But some pilgrims have lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of the Hajj. Even those on official tours can spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in searing heat.                 Hania Hassan Salama, 65, a homemaker from Egypt, asked her children to draw a mural of the Kaaba on the wall of their house, a tradition in Egypt to announce a pilgrimage. The day the mural was completed, the children lost contact with her. The family was later informed that she had died, her relatives told CNN. Salama had purchased a Hajj package from a licensed tour operator.                 Her nephew Mustafa Mohammed said responsibility for the large number of deaths partly lies with Saudi authorities.                 “This year there was negligence, medical negligence. People were dying in the street and no one was helping them,” he told CNN. “Even if some people went on a visa not designated for Hajj, they do not deserve to be left to die in the street without finding medical help.”                 Two other pilgrims who recently returned from Hajj told CNN there were insufficient medics or basic facilities to protect worshipers from the effects of the sweltering heat in Saudi Arabia last week. Even those pilgrims who made the journey through official channels said authorities failed to provide enough water, shade or medical support to worshipers.                 Some witnesses have told CNN of how they saw worshipers losing consciousness and walked past bodies covered in white cloth.                 A 44-year-old Indonesian man who only wished to be referred to as Ahmad, recalled seeing many dying from the heat.                 “Along the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom (white fabric) cloth.”                 CNN has reached out to Saudi authorities regarding the reportedly inadequate response to this year’s heat and has yet to hear back.                 Before this year’s Hajj season started, Saudi authorities warned pilgrims against using agents selling unauthorized Hajj packages and had been in contact with other governments in an effort to crack down on the trend. Authorities had also arrested some illegal agents and issued warnings about penalties for those found to assist unauthorized pilgrims.                 Ahead of the pilgrimage this month, Director of Public Security and Head of the Hajj Security Committee, Lieutenant General Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Bassami, laid out efforts to crack down on unauthorized pilgrims in a televised address, saying “the security of the pilgrims is a red line.” Regional papers subsequently said that more than 300,000 people had been barred from performing the rites as a result.                 Since the tragedy, Egyptian authorities appear to be clamping down on unauthorized agencies. The government has ordered the revocation of the licenses of 16 Hajj tourism companies involved in making unauthorized pilgrimages to Mecca and has referred their managers to the public prosecutor.                 Salem, the 81-year-old Egyptian who died during the Hajj, was buried in the Al-Baqi cemetery in Medina, Saudi Arabia according to an Islamic tradition that a pilgrim is buried in the holy land if he dies during the pilgrimage. His wife plans to return to Cairo Friday after completing the rituals.                 Until she returns, Mahmoud said the family “is trying to contact her to calm and comfort her, and to urge her to take care of herself because she is there alone.”       CNN’s Abbas Al Lawati and Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Officials are now searching for evidence that Houthi weapons have been delivered to Somalia, and are trying to work out whether Iran, which provides some military and financial support to the Houthis, is involved in the agreement.                 The US has been warning countries in the region about this possible cooperation in recent weeks, according to a senior administration official, and African countries have also begun to proactively bring it up with the US to raise their concerns and get more information.                 “This is a pretty active area of conversation that we’re having with countries on both sides of the Red Sea,” this person said. “And it’s being viewed with a considerable seriousness.”                 It’s not a natural alliance for the two groups, which are divided by sectarianismand are not known to have had a relationship in the past. The Houthis are Zaydi Shiites, and al-Shabaab traditionally has been deeply ideologically opposed to Shiism. But they are separated by only a single body of water — the strategically significant Gulf of Aden — and they both count the United States as a top enemy.                 The intelligence raises the alarming possibility that a marriage of convenience could make things worse both in Somalia and in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, where the Houthis have launched regular attacks on commercial shipping and US military assets since the war in Gaza began.                 A potential deal could offer a new stream of financing for the Houthis, at a time when US officials say there are signs that the group’s primary patron, Iran, has some concerns about the group’s attack strategy. “Being able to sell some weapons would bring them much needed income,” the senior administration official said.                 For al-Shabaab, it could provide access to a new source of weapons — including potentially drones — that are far more sophisticated than their current arsenal and could offer the group the ability to strike US targets.                 There has been some routine smuggling of both small arms and commercial material between different groups in Yemen and Somalia for years. But a weapons agreement between al-Shabaab and the Houthis would be something new, according to US officials.                 “It would be the clearest sign that two organizations that are, ideologically, diametrically opposed to one another — that they prioritized something they have in common, which is hostility towards [the United States],” said Christopher Anzalone, a professor at the Marine Corps University’s Middle East Studies department. “It would be very significant because it shows there is a level of pragmatism in both organizations.”                 Any form of military cooperation between the Houthis and al-Shabaab could also undermine an informal, and fragile, ceasefire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia that has held since 2022, the senior administration official said. And it would “definitely” go against the spirit of a proposed UN roadmap for a more lasting peace, the official said.                 “We still have a strong interest in supporting the roadmap process in Yemen,” the official added, “but this sort of trafficking between the Houthis” and al-Shabaab “would certainly complicate and undermine that effort.”                 Officials say at this point, they aren’t sure what kinds of weapons the Houthis might provide to al-Shabaab. Right now, the Somali group generally only has access to rockets, mortars and homemade IEDs that it has used in its fight against the Somali government — deadly, but relatively smaller arms. The Houthis, by comparison, have weaponized drones, including underwater drones. They also have short-range ballistic missiles. There is a sense that the deal would cover “bigger kit” than just rockets and mortars, said one US official, but beyond that, the intelligence is murky.                 No matter what the Houthis provide, there’s likely limited opportunity for al-Shabaab to fire directly at US assets in the region. Even if the Houthis were to provide them with some of the smaller missiles the group has used to target US MQ-9 drones, Anzalone said, al-Shabaab would likely have to fire them from the north of the country. Pockets of that region of the country are controlled by an increasingly powerful branch of ISIS. Al-Shabaab is often fighting to contest territory there, and as a result, has a much more limited presence and freedom to maneuver.                 “They would love to do that,” Anzalone said, referring to striking directly at US assets. Al-Shabaab views the internationally recognized government of Somalia as a puppet of the United States. But, he said, “I think they would find it hard to do. This is where the intra-jihadist fighting between Shabaab and ISIS is the heaviest.”                 The US has about 480 US troops in Somalia, according to a US official. The US has continued to carry out counterterrorism strikes against both al-Shabaab and ISIS targets in Somalia throughout the Biden administration.                 One major question for US intelligence officials is the degree of involvement Iran might have in the arrangement. There is no direct evidence yet, officials said, but the US is still looking. It fits the pattern of broader Iranian efforts to widen the front against the US and the west by directly or indirectly providing arms to proxy groups.                 “That’s something we definitely have our eyes on,” the senior administration official said.                 But the Houthis are also one of the most independent-minded of the different Iran-aligned groups and are the one over which Tehran exercises arguably the least amount of control. Iran broadly has sought to tightly manage any potential escalation arising from the war in Gaza, calibrating its response to extract costs from the US and Israel without allowing it to spiral into direct conflict.                 And so some US officials are skeptical Iran is involved.                 “Don’t think Iran is actually part of this,” said one military official. “Houthis be a’ Houthi-ing on their own.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

With the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) steadfastly refusing to allow my community even a token representation in corridors of power, India’s largest minority, the third largest Muslim population in the world, is left voiceless.                 For the first time since India’s Independence in 1947, the ruling party did not have a single Muslim Member of Parliament.

My community may once again not have an MP in the government.                 With the BJP back in power – albeit without the supermajority it had vowed – my only hope lies in a politically weakened Modi now. A weakened Modi shall, hopefully, translate into a more robust India and more secure minorities.                 It may still be a long haul though.                 After the recently concluded, hate-driven campaign led by Modi himself, things may only get worse. As it was before the vote, India is poised to continue transforming itself from a secular democratic republic into possibly a Hindu majoritarian state, with reduced rights and presence of minorities in general – and of Muslims in particular.                 If after Modi’s first victory in 2014, there was a sense of cautious hope, 10 years later, my Muslim community stands orphaned, not just jettisoned by the ruling BJP, but repeatedly marked out as the group responsible for the supposed ills of the nation. There is an overriding feeling of belonging to a group under siege.                 The prime minister kickstarted the invidious campaign by calling India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” in one of his early election speeches.                 His vitriol was, to put it mildly, unprovoked; the state of Rajasthan where he delivered his divisive speech has a strongly guarded border with Muslim-majority Pakistan. The state has only sent one Muslim candidate to the Lok Sabha – the Lower House of Parliament – since the first election back in 1952.             In this year’s election, the two leading political parties, the BJP and the Indian National Congress (INC or, simply, “Congress”), did not give a ticket to a single Muslim to contest the elections in Rajasthan. Yet the invisible Muslim ghost was punched with relish by Modi. It’s worth remembering this is the man who, back in 2002, was the Chief Minister of the state of Gujarat when large-scale violence claimed over 1,000 lives, a vast majority of them Muslims. (Modi denied any wrongdoing, and the Supreme Court cleared him of complicity).                 But let us return to 2024. As the 6-week-long election wore on, Modi mocked the Muslim community’s supposed high fertility rate and repeatedly targeted the community using the opposition – especially Congress – as a mere pretext, accusing it of reserving 15% of the Union Budget for Indian Muslims. (Congress rejected the claim).                 Of course, Modi denied discriminating against Muslims, and in a widely televised interview claimed to have celebrated the Muslim festival of Eid with his friends.             Meanwhile the Islamophobia within the BJP hit a new low when the party’s promotional video showed caricatures of Congress party leaders placing an egg marked “Muslims” in a nest next to three eggs marked “SC,” “OBC” and “ST” (three lower caste groups). As the eggs hatch, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is shown feeding “funds” to the chick wearing a skullcap while ignoring the other chickens. The allusion was not lost on anyone. The video ran for days on social media before the Election Commission wrote to Twitter to take action.                 Muslims stood silenced by the unceasing vitriol. Some were intimidated. Others hoped the election would bring an end to BJP rule. It proved a false hope. The BJP’s much-hyped claim of getting over 400 seats in the Lower House of Parliament did not materialize. The party, in the end, needed help from allies, Telugu Desam and Janata Dal (United), to form a government for the third time in succession – a feat hitherto performed only by the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s Congress immediately after Independence.             Muslims stood silenced by the unceasing vitriol. Some were intimidated. Others hoped the election would bring an end to BJP rule. It proved a false hope.             Ziya Us Salam                 Except for one candidate in the constituency of Kerala, the BJP refused to put up Muslim candidates. This had an unfortunate ripple effect with the number of Muslims getting tickets from other parties showing a decline.                 The main opposition party, Congress, failed to put up a Muslim candidate in the capital, New Delhi, as well as in the commercial center Mumbai and in Mahatma Gandhi’s home state, Gujarat. In fact, the number of Muslim candidates put up by major political parties showed a steep decline, falling from 115 in the 2019 elections, to 78 in 2024.             In the days and months to come, things could get seriously tough for Indian Muslims. With the prime minister failing to condemn the frequent lynching of Muslim men by right-wing vigilantes since 2015, and state governments ruled by the BJP using bulldozers to demolish Muslim establishments as a means of cowing even the odd voice of protest, it is going to be a question of survival for my community.                 Our food habits, clothing, education centers and places of worship are all likely to be under greater scrutiny, possibly even violent attacks in the days of come.                 Already, medieval Indian mosques, some as old as 900 years, are being contested by Hindu outfits in various courts. There have been noises that the world-famous Taj Mahal was originally a Hindu temple, and that the historic Qutb Minar in Delhi was built after demolition of temples.                 A community which has seen the 16th century mosque, the Babri Masjid, become a Hindu temple during Modi’s second term has reason to fear the worst.                 We’ve seen BJP leaders talking of closing Islamic seminaries across the states of Uttar Pradesh and Assam. In the state of Uttarakhand, a hurriedly cobbled together Uniform Civil Code is in place – essentially a single set of laws for all residents that does not take into account the customs or religious laws of different religions or minority groups. It could be the norm for the rest of India soon as the BJP tries to deny Indian Muslims the right to follow Islamic laws in civil matters, a right granted by the Indian Constitution.                 With Hindu Rashtra a virtual reality, it is difficult to see a silver lining for Indian Muslims who chose pluralist India over the theocratic state of Pakistan at the time of Independence.                 In the summer of 2024, my community stands betrayed, forsaken and forlorn.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

As turnout in the polls so far shows a slight dip from five years ago, the popular leader – and overwhelming favorite – has embraced negative campaigning, they say, and received little pushback from civil society or election authorities.                 Followers of Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – and some of its top figures – have long been accused of using inflammatory language to describe the country’s 200 million Muslims, but rarely Modi himself. However this election has brought a clear shift, critics say.                 “What is unique about what we’ve seen recently, is that these statements are being uttered by the Prime Minister himself,” Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Not necessarily by surrogates – the Home Minister, or by the chief minister – or by other kind of party apparatchiks.”                 The shift in tone is making many Indian Muslims nervous.                 “Modi and the BJP have for a long time been making references to the community, but it’s moved on from the dog whistle,” said political researcher and columnist Asim Ali. “It’s painting us as an existential threat to Hindus. It’s coming directly from the prime minister. It’s anti-Muslim, and it’s dangerous.”                 Modi and his BJP have repeatedly said they do not discriminate against minority groups.                 But analysts and observers have noted multiple speeches he’s made during this six-week election campaign, that began last month, specifically refer to Muslims and paint them in a negative light.     Related articleCampaign video targeting Muslims faces India police probe as critics accuse Modi’s party of divisive election tactics             Calling Muslims “infiltrators” with “large families,” Modi has accused his main opposition, the Indian National Congress, without evidence, of intending to redistribute the country’s wealth to Muslims. He warned women that the opposition would take their gold and redistribute it to Muslims. He accused Congress of wanting to choose players on the Indian cricket team “on the basis of religion.” And he has claimed the party is conspiring to commit “vote jihad” by uniting “a certain community” against him.                 The BJP did not respond to a request for comment on the rhetoric being used by party leaders during this campaign. BJP national spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill previously told CNN that the party is not prejudiced against Muslims, and the community has benefited from Modi’s leadership.                 For Irfan Nooruddin, a professor of Indian politics at Georgetown University, the rhetoric has “become much more starkly and overtly communal.”                 “These are very central views within the BJP that are sometimes suppressed to avoid negative press or civil society pushback. With the media and civil society neutralized, the BJP no longer fears such consequences and so can pull back the veil,” he said.                 “The BJP understands that its path to a majority in parliament – especially a super-majority that would allow it to amend the constitution – is to consolidate the Hindu vote and to prevent the opposition from making inroads through economic appeals,” added Nooruddin.                 The prime minister has set an ambitious target for his alliance to win 400 seats in the country’s Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament, in this election.                 Many in the country say their lives have been transformed under his leadership, aided by his far-reaching welfare and development schemes. Weeks before voting began, analysts were certain his party would sweep the polls yet again.                 Since April 19, millions have flocked to polling booths to cast their vote. But turnout across six phases so far has slightly dipped from the record highs of 2019, and this might be causing anxiety among BJP leaders, analysts say.                 The chief minister of Delhi, popular opposition leader and staunch Modi critic, Arvind Kejriwal, was temporarily allowed out of prison earlier this month after being arrested on corruption charges, in a case his allies claimed was politically motivated. His release has galvanized a once flattened opposition, uniting them to deliver a tough fight to Modi and his BJP.                 “This election is becoming competitive,” said political researcher Ali, suggesting that a tighter race in key seats might be motivating the ruling party to ramp up the inflammatory language. “The BJP is a favorite but their target is ambitious, and this rhetoric appeals to their vote bank.”                 Many have accused the prime minister of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his Hindu-nationalist credentials, while diverting from policy failures – such as youth unemployment, which now stands at close to 50% among 20- to 24-year-olds, and the vast wealth gap in the country, which according to a recent study is more unequal than it was during British rule.                 “The BJP’s track record on economic growth, job creation, and poverty alleviation is weak,” Nooruddin, from Georgetown University, said. “These bread-and-butter issues are central to election campaigns and the opposition has really sought to emphasize them. So, I think the BJP’s resort to overt communal rhetoric is an effort to fight an election on its preferred terms rather than on issues where it is vulnerable.”                 Muslim independent journalist Alishan Jafri noted that the day-to-day struggles brought by poverty and unemployment are “affecting Muslims as much as it’s affecting poor Hindus,” pointing to some 800 million people dependent on rations provided by the government.                 “To tell (Hindus) that Muslims will take away even half of that is surely going to scare them and divide the communities on religious lines. That the mainstream media has refused to push back tells us two things: they are compromised, or they support it.”                 Modi’s government posits India as a leader on the global stage. His calendar last year included diplomatic trips to Australia and the United States, and he presents himself as a statesman cementing the country as a modern power.                 Last year India overtook China to become the world’s most populous nation, while the year before it surpassed former colonial power Britain to become the world’s fifth-largest economy. According to Vaishnav, the muted response to Modi’s divisive language from Western leaders must be seen through the prism through which they view India – as a balance against an increasingly assertive China.                 At home, analysts say, his grip on power has allowed him to make such comments with little pushback from civil society.                 “The Election Commission is pretty toothless and what powers it has had have been further weakened by changes made to how commissioners are appointed by making the Prime Minister’s Office more central to that process,” Nooruddin said.                 Modi’s April 21 speech about “infiltrators” has ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians, and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking specifically about undocumented migrants.                 The election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations. But opposition groups and critics say the response is not strong enough.                 Globally, independent polls suggest that India’s image is declining in some countries around the world and there is some criticism about the government’s Hindu nationalist ambitions.                 “The anti-Muslim rhetoric used on the campaign trail will unfortunately further damage India’s reputation globally. This is unnecessary at a time when India should be ascendant,” Nooruddin said.                 For Jafri, the journalist, the effects are clear.                 “I can’t express what millions of people feel as a collective, but I am sure that nobody likes being constantly abused, bullied, betrayed, and singled out,” he said. “Some feel attacked and humiliated. Many have become cynical, and they don’t expect any better from this regime and its supporters.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             When I was growing up, most of my South Asian friends and peers were pushed into medical careers. I was able to go in a different direction, initially attending law school, only to realize early in my first semester that a legal career wasn’t what I wanted.                 Coming from a literary and scholarly Pakistani-American family, I yearned to learn more about my faith. I wanted to challenge misperceptions about Islam. I wanted to teach and empower.                 A year after graduating from college, I enrolled at Columbia University’s Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies, eager to study with the many scholars who approached Islam on its own terms, with respect, rigor, nuance and a love of inquiry.                 In the nearly decade and a half since I graduated with a master’s degree, I’ve continued to draw on the remarkable education I received. That has included designing historical experiences immersing travelers in the Muslim legacy in Europe: A new kind of Sunday school for middle and high schoolers. And global leadership programs for young Muslim professionals from across the West, strongly influenced by the kind of creative and open-ended inquiry I often experienced at Columbia. That is why I found what transpired at Columbia University these last few months so profoundly disappointing.                 The weeks of student protests (which continue at some campuses) should provoke us to reflect on the larger impact of this movement — especially at my alma mater, where the main commencement ceremony, which had been scheduled for this week, was canceled. (Protesters and their supporters organized their own ceremony.)                 The media line fed to the public about weeks of protests at Columbia — and the administrative crackdown that followed — has been selective at best. I know this as an alumnus, a parent with two kids on the verge of college and as someone who teaches young Americans, including high schoolers. I know adolescents and young adults are far more passionate, curious, creative and courageous than older adults sometimes casually assume.     Related articleOpinion: The antisemitic lie at the heart of too many campus protests             America’s universities are the envy of the world and are meant to be laboratories for democracy and engines of innovation, keeping our society democratic and vigorous, economically dynamic and forward-facing. But instead, it appears too many this spring have seemed intent on suffocating debate they don’t endorse, rather than promoting and protecting the exchange of ideas.              I’m incensed by the same realities the student protesters are outraged by: Israel’s occupation and brutalization of Palestinians with our country’s active assistance. Columbia students have made clear that that’s what drives their protests. What’s less widely reported is how they are also driven by double standards in how our leaders address Israeli and Palestinian issues.                 When was the last time you heard a news report about anti-Arab or anti-Muslim animus on campuses? Where is the outcry for the pro-Palestinian students threatened with professional consequences only for protesting? Why, even as numerous students at Columbia and elsewhere have been doxxed, harassed and bullied, were no congressional hearings called?                 Long before our protracted national conversation about antisemitism got underway, some Columbia faculty members have quite arguably crossed a line into anti-Palestinian agitation, with no apparent consequences. And at UCLA, pro-Israel demonstrators even attacked pro-Palestinian student encampments for hours. Police were nowhere to be seen.                 For months now, we’ve seen pro-Palestinian students, including Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims, as well as students of other backgrounds and faiths (including many Jewish students), held to different standards and demonized when they are in fact standing up for fundamental human, basic American and common civic values. There may be no better symbol of this than Columbia’s President Minouche Shafik, who last week was on the losing end of a no-confidence vote by faculty over her handling of the protests.                 When Shafik was called to testify before a biased congressional hearing, she faced a hard choice. Two of her fellow Ivy League president predecessors did not hold onto their jobs very long after appearing before the same House panel, some of whose members seemed gleeful at the prospect of taking down another.                 In my view, Shafik capitulated. She told Republican lawmakers everything that they appeared to want to hear. But she did not have to capitulate. She could have questioned the dubious, even dangerous assumptions inherent in the questions themselves. She could have taken a stand on principle, in support of students expressing their views in the best tradition of campus protest. She might have considered the blatant double standards at her and peer institutions.                 She might have told lawmakers that all speech is free, or none is. She might have invited our national leaders to engage in a more difficult conversation — one which would have been less sensationalistic than the congressional hearing they held, but probably far more substantial.                 Such a dialogue could have addressed how we balance free inquiry in a country of robust pluralism. It might also have raised the question about what it means to balance strong beliefs, academic rigor and mutual respect.     Related articleOpinion: The conversation we can’t avoid about pro-Palestinian campus protests             That’s the kind of engagement we sorely need more of in this country. It’s the kind of discussion a university president such as Shafik would have been uniquely positioned to lead. She capitulated to bad-faith interrogators after the collapse of days of talks, then invited heavily armed police onto campus. Somehow, she and other authorities seemed more concerned with the purported unruliness of the protest than the horrors that prompted it.                 Palestinians in this country, as well as pro-Palestinian demonstrators, have been shot at, menaced, struck with vehicles, merely for who they are or what they stand for. But there has been no congressional hearing about these crimes and hardly even acknowledgement in many quarters that these crimes have happened. That Shafik even had to appear before Congress is just another example of how deeply entrenched our double standards are.                 Students aren’t out of touch with America. A majority of Americans disapprove of Israeli actions in Gaza. Student protesters are confirming what more and more Americans cannot deny, even while many of our elites remain seemingly indifferent. We might on reflection appreciate that it is better to see young Americans exceedingly committed to freedom, debate and challenging our hypocrisies than not.                 That hardly means we are all going to agree on how to protest or on what approach is better — but we should all agree on the right to protest — and the responsibility of the protesters to push our country to do better.                 Just a few weeks ago, I joined some 50 or so American Muslims and allies in Washington, DC, leaders and activists from diverse backgrounds, coming together to explore what it might mean to continue to advocate for our faith communities. That included continuing to hold our government to account for our role in Israel’s war and protecting freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.                 There was a special level of interest in protecting our universities from governmental and elite interference, preserving the unique space campuses provide for hard conversations, political exploration and civic formation. Most of us were deeply disappointed by how our respective alma maters put select donors over institutional integrity. But the energy and engagement underscored the commitment to this cause.                 We left inspired to continue standing up for the right to protest and leverage our resources to put pressure on these colleges and universities to maintain academic freedom, to uphold standards that do not privilege certain politics or positions and to maintain and extend the opportunities our colleges had opened for us — a commitment I believe continues down to this present moment.                 When Shafik arrived at those hearings, she faced some lawmakers who acted as if they believed universities, and those on campus who are allies of the Palestinians, were enemies of America.                 But if Columbia students didn’t care about their university and the values it claims to uphold, they wouldn’t have risked so much with their protests. By the same token, if students didn’t care about our country, they wouldn’t protest so vocally against its policies.                 Maybe these students are mirrors of America, revealing how much work we have left to do. But they also reveal that there is enough passion, commitment and courage that our causes are not lost. Our struggles are not pointless. A better future can be ours.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

The police probe comes as the world’s most populous nation votes in a mammoth weeks-long election in which Modi’s Hindu-nationalist party is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term.                 The party has long denied being anti-Islam but opposition politicians and prominent Muslims have warned that its leaders have been deploying openly divisive rhetoric to turbo-charge their campaign.                 According to a police report seen by CNN on Tuesday, Karnataka state police are investigating whether local BJP leader B. Y. Vijayendra and the unnamed holder of the party’s official local X account “promoted enmity” between religious groups after the clip was posted online on May 4.                 The 17-second animation depicts leaders of India’s main opposition Congress party giving benefits to Muslims, alongside a caption in the local Kannada language: “Beware… Beware… Beware…!”                 It shows caricatures of Congress’s national leader Rahul Gandhi and its Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah feeding “funds” to a large bird wearing a Muslim skullcap, while giving nothing to three smaller birds portraying other marginalized minorities. The large bird then kicks the other birds out of their nest as the Congress politicians laugh.     Related articleModi’s Muslim remarks spark ‘hate speech’ accusations as India’s mammoth election deepens divides             The video was removed Wednesday after a request to X from India’s Election Commission to take it down.                 CNN has reached out to Vijayendra, the BJP and X for comment.                 Critics said Congress’ manifesto makes no mention of redistributing wealth to Muslims, while Congress lawmaker Manickam Tagore said the video was a “blatant demonization of minorities by ruling BJP,” and urged the Election Commission to address its “divisive tactics.”                 Many of India’s more than 200 million Muslims have expressed fear at the prospect of Modi’s re-election, and critics said the video fits a pattern of openly Islamophobic rhetoric during the BJP’s campaign.                 Last month, the BJP’s Instagram account published another animation that claimed the Congress planned to prioritize Muslims.                 “If you are a non-Muslim, Congress will snatch your wealth and distribute it to Muslims,” said a voiceover in the clip, which has since been removed from Instagram.                 That video echoed similar comments by Modi, who sparked a row over hate speech last month while campaigning in BJP-ruled Rajasthan state, when he accused Muslims – who have been present in India for centuries – of being “infiltrators” who deliberately have large families to outgrow the majority Hindu population.                 Modi’s speech ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants.                 The election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations.

Speaking in front of a large crowd in the country’s western Rajasthan state, Modi said if voted into power, the country’s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, would distribute the country’s wealth among “infiltrators” and “those who have more children,” in apparent reference to the Muslim community.                 “When they (the Congress) were in power, they said Muslims have first right over resources. They will gather all your wealth and distribute it among those who have more children. They will distribute among infiltrators,” Modi said to thunderous roars from the audience.                 “Do you think your hard-earned money should be given to infiltrators? Would you accept this?” Modi said.                 Those remarks have been seized on by the opposition, who have long accused Modi and the BJP of using divisive rhetoric to turbo-charge their increasingly popular brand of Hindu nationalism.                 Opposition members have called on the Election Commission of India (ECI) to investigate whether Modi’s comments break the body’s code of conduct.                 The code states politicians must not appeal to voters based on “caste” and “communal feelings.” Activity which “may aggravate differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension” between communities and religions, is also not allowed.                 CNN has contacted the ECI for comment.                 Modi received widespread backlash from members of the Muslim community for his comments at a time when many fear a third BJP term will deepen the communal fissures already running through the country.                 “This is not a dogwhistle, this is a targeted, direct, brazen hate speech against a community,” prominent Muslim journalist Rana Ayyub wrote on X.     Related articleNarendra Modi: India’s popular but controversial leader seeking a transformative third term             Muslim lawmaker and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, Asaduddin Owaisi, said: “Modi today called Muslims infiltrators and people with many children. Since 2002 till this day, the only Modi guarantee has been to abuse Muslims and get votes.”                 Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge described Modi’s comments as “hate speech” and “a well thought out ploy to divert attention.”                 “Today the prime minister did what he has learnt from the values of the Sangh,” referring to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) a right-wing Hindu paramilitary organization, which Modi was once a youth member of and to which the BJP is affiliated with. “In the history of India, no prime minister has lowered the dignity of his post as much as Modi has.”                 Modi swept to power in 2014 on a promise of development and anti-corruption, rising in popularity during his term and getting re-elected five years later – the second time on a more openly Hindu nationalist ticket.                 Over the last decade, Modi and his BJP have been accused of driving religious polarization with their Hindu nationalist policies, giving rise to a wave of Islamophobia and deadly communal clashes in the world’s largest secular democracy.                 India’s minority Muslim population is enormous – some 230 million people – and Muslims have lived in what is now modern India for centuries. But a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists is to accuse Muslims of being somehow outsiders and spreading a false narrative that they are displacing the country’s Hindu population by deliberately having large families.     Related articleIn face of Modi juggernaut, India’s opposition appears increasingly weak             The BJP has repeatedly said it does not discriminate based on religion and treats all citizens equally.                 But research, reporting and rights groups say divisions have increased in the country of 1.4 billion people.                 Anti-Muslim speech has risen dramatically, a recent report by the Washington-based research group India Hate Lab showed, which documented 668 such cases in 2023. Of these cases, 75% took place in BJP-ruled states, the report said.                 India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section which criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs, but rights groups say there is a lack of immediate and adequate action against the alleged perpetrators of such acts, giving right-wing extremists tacit support.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/09/style/muslims-in-america-photography/index.html,Photos challenge misconceptions about what it means to be an American Muslim,British artist Mahtab Hussain felt compelled to photograph the US Muslim community in an ongoing series that celebrates diversity and cultural nuances.,"Apr 9, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Leah Dolan,International,"Editor’s Note: This feature is part of CNN Style’s series Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.             In one photo, Julo stares down the camera dressed in a tie-dye t-shirt, dreadlocks and a red snapback cap. In another, Adbul wears low-waisted jeans, a motorcycle jacket and a decadent fur scarf. Candace is pictured in a pair of Nike Air Jordans, her long platinum hair stark against her black shirt. These are some of the faces featured in “Muslims in America,” an ongoing photography series by British artist Mahtab Hussain.                 “I grew up always being told that Islam is a way of life, but I didn’t really know what that meant,” Hussain told CNN over a video call. “But going to the US and meeting all these communities, people from all walks of life, all over the world, it’s really interesting how this Islam fits in with the culture.”                 Like an intricately woven tapestry, the series stitches together the many people who share his identity, which is underrepresented in the US. In 2017, the Pew Research Center estimated there were 3.45 million Muslims living in the US — and projected that by 2040, Muslims would replace Jews as the country’s second-largest religious group after Christians. By 2050, the same study also predicted that the US Muslim population would grow to a total of 8.1 million, or 2.1% of the total population. Despite these figures, the experience of Muslims today can be misconstrued or entirely lacking from the cultural conversation.                 According to the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, just 1% of all speaking characters across 200 popular TV shows in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand were Muslim. The visibility that does exists has often perpetuated harmful stereotypes. In another study that focused on the portrayals of Muslims in movies, also by the USC Annenberg, nearly 40% of primary and secondary Muslim characters across 200 top-rated films were depicted as perpetrators of violence. “The representation of Muslims on screen feeds the policies that get enacted, the people that get killed, the countries that get invaded,” wrote actor and producer Riz Ahmed, in an accompanying call-to-arms document called “The Blueprint for Muslim Inclusion.” The project outlines ways to boost Muslim representation in TV and film in order to help combat anti-Muslim hate, erasure and stereotypes.                 Hussain, who was born in Glasgow to first-generation immigrants from Kashmir and Pakistan, felt compelled to challenge the misconception of Muslims in America, particularly after Islamophobia rose after the 9/11 attacks. He began the project in 2021, two decades on, as a way to visually commemorate the anniversary from another perspective. “When 9/11 happened, so many people in the communities in the US and the UK shut down, because they were fearful of being seen as being Muslim. The religion was hijacked, their narrative was completely hijacked, a lot of interesting filmmakers, musicians and cultural creatives stopped,” he said. “But in the last 20 years, I’ve seen a new wave of pride emerge about being Muslim.”                 So far, Hussain has documented subjects living in New York, LA, Baltimore and Toronto, Canada. His sitters are a mix of people responding to open casting calls as well as ones he spots while riding his bike through city streets. Some wear hijabs and kufi hats, others are dressed in tank tops, hoodies, cargo pants and mini skirts. As a British Pakistani Muslim, he says he’s noticed that the makeup of the community across the pond is more diverse. “The major difference is diversity. I’ve met people from all over the world in the US who are Muslim: Palestinians, people from all over Africa. LA has one of the largest Iranian populations. It’s not the same in Britain.”     Related articleA new photo series highlights the diverse experiences of breast cancer patients             The result is a rich portfolio, capturing people of different ages and ethnicities as well as their clothing choices — some appear covered up, while others show more skin and tattoos. Not only do Hussain’s photographs visually challenge the way American Muslims have been portrayed, he has also offered space for his subjects to share their experiences. In transcribed interviews printed alongside the images, they open up about issues such as the balancing act of embracing aspects of US culture and honouring their faith. Whether to wear a hijab or not, for example, played on the mind of some of the women he has lensed, while others reflected on the stigma of dressing modestly in a Western society. “There’s no narrative that I’m trying to push through,” he said. “It’s about what the community is saying, and who these people are. That’s how I’ve always made my work.”                 According to Hussain, many of the people he met saw Islam as something forgiving and evolving, rather than strict and fundamentalist. “I’m learning so much from the people I meet,” he told CNN. “The LGBTQ community in New York City absolutely schooled me with regards to what Islam means to them. There’s a narrative that says if you’re gay or queer, you can’t be religious. But they (embraced) their journey and struggle.”                 His next installment will take place in Dearborn, Michigan, a city with the largest population of Muslims in the entire nation. In 2022, Democrat Abdullah Hammoud became Dearborn’s first Arab American mayor, and has been in the spotlight recently for raising concerns about US President Joe Biden’s response to the conflict in Gaza.                 “I worry Biden will be remembered not as the president who saved American democracy but as the president who sacrificed it for Netanyahu,” the mayor wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times in February.                 Many members of  Dearborn’s Arab American and Muslim American communities have openly rejected Biden for his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Hussain, who typically tries to keep the project as positive in tone as possible, is planning a trip to the city in order to capture Muslim residents in this politically-charged atmosphere. (Michigan is a key state in the 2024 election).                 “I think it’s really important there’s a chapter in the work that talks about this,” he said. “Yes, this (series) is about looking positively at a new identity that’s formed in the US, but October 7 shifted the conversation again.” This month, the Pew Research Center published a survey that found 70% of US Muslims believe discrimination against Muslims has increased since the Israel-Hamas war began, and over 50% say they feel  afraid of news around the war.                 “It just shows how delicate this all is, especially for Muslims in the US.”                 Hussain says the response to the series has so far been affirming, with many participants celebrating his mission to broaden Muslim representation. “Everyone was really open to being part of the work,” he said.                 “Strangers would come up to me and hug me. The love that I received, it absolutely changed me as a person.”     More of Mahtab Hussain’s work can be found here.

Ramadan, regarded as the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, is celebrated by Muslims around the world who abstain from eating, drinking, and sexual acts during daylight hours and break their fast after sundown.                 It is a month of deep spiritual reflection and celebration with friends and family – but can also be far from easy, as anyone who has tried fasting can attest.                 In many parts of Malaysia, Muslims caught eating or drinking during daytime hours can find themselves on the wrong side of the law.                 Around 20.6 million of Malaysia’s 34 million-strong population are Muslims, but the country is also home to sizeable ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities that include Buddhists, Christians and Hindus, as well as indigenous communities.     Related galleryIn pictures: Muslims observe Ramadan around the globe             Under the country’s unusual dual track legal system, which is also federal and varies from state to state, Muslims are subject to sharia law on a host of social issues including marriage, divorce and fasting.                 Religious police tend to ramp up their presence during Ramadan, activists note, which ends later this week, patrolling the streets more visibly and staking out at popular eateries – sometimes in disguise – to catch those breaching the rules.                 Those caught eating or drinking during daytime hours face fines of up to 1,000 Malaysian Ringgit (about $200) and prison terms of up to a year. Non-Muslims caught selling food, drinks or tobacco to Muslims during fasting hours are also subject to penalties.                 Arrest figures have not yet been released for this year but in 2023, religious officials in the state of Malacca, a major tourist destination, recorded nearly 100 arrests of Muslims caught eating in public during the fasting month, an increase from 41 arrests the previous year, they said.                 This year, more than 10 “hotspots” were identified throughout the state, said the chairman of its Islamic Religious Department, JAIM.     Related articleOktoberfest is back. But religious politicians in this country want it banned             Rahmad Mariman announced that “frequent monitoring and inspections” were being carried out at popular bars, restaurants, malls and parks. “Through these operations, JAIM enforcement officers will detain Muslims found eating in public and will not hesitate to take action against traders involved in selling food to them,” Mariman said in a statement.                 Up north in the state of Perak, JAIM’s counterpart, the Gerik Islamic Religious Department (JAIPK), took to TikTok to share videos of inspections and fasting raids religious officers had conducted throughout March.                 In one video, set against a spaghetti western soundtrack, JAIPK officers wearing their distinctive black and white uniforms and reflective vests were seen arriving at an open-air eatery in the town of Gerik during the day to question restaurant staff and catch Muslims buying food.                 One man wearing a blue motorcycle helmet, whose face is pixelated in the video, was seen fleeing the restaurant with a plastic bag of food.                 “This was not a reenactment by professionals. It is an actual video of what took place during our recent operations,” JAIPK wrote in a caption accompanying its TikTok video, which went viral – racking up more than 1.7 million views and continuing to draw thousands of comments since it was uploaded on March 15.                 Like much of South and Southeast Asia, Malaysia has historically practiced a moderate form of Islam but religious conservatism has been on the rise in recent years.                 At the forefront of this shift, experts say, is the ultra-conservative hardline Islamist political party PAS, which made historic gains during Malaysia’s 2023 general election and wields great influence in its stronghold conservative states in the north.                 PAS party leader Hadi Awang, also a religious teacher, regularly expresses his support for harsher sharia laws.                 CNN reached out to multiple state religious bodies across Malaysia for comment. One religious enforcement officer from Malacca said that more raids had been carried out this year at various roadside stalls, restaurants and parks as compared to 2023 and 2022.                 “It is our responsibility to protect and preserve the name of Islam during this important time,” said the male officer, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak with international media.                 But not all cases result in arrests, he also stressed. “It is also important that we show compassion, especially on very hot days when we see people drinking water – sometimes it can’t be helped.”                 Moral policing during Ramadan is a longstanding issue in the country, according to Malaysian women’s rights group Sisters in Islam, which advocates against religious policing and points to another controversial area of concern – “khalwat” laws.                 Also known as “close proximity laws”, they vary from state to state and are part of the civil sharia legislation that only applies to Muslims. They are used to prosecute unmarried couples deemed to be overly close to each other.     Related articleWear a rainbow Swatch watch in Malaysia and you could face 3 years in jail             On March 8, religious police raided a luxury condominium in the capital Kuala Lumpur and arrested two actors, a married male and a single female, under these laws, a move that generated significant local media coverage.                 Complaints were made to the state religious department, media reports said, and the scandal caused a national stir – drawing scorn from conservative politicians and prompting public apologies from the celebrities.                 Sisters in Islam told CNN that overzealous application of religious laws had gotten worse in recent years.                 “These acts of moral policing violate personal freedoms and paint a distorted image of Islam and raises important questions,” said SIS spokeswoman Ameena Siddiqi.                 It is also common practice during Ramadan for public schools in Malaysia to shut their canteens, leaving limited options to eat and rest during the day, Siddiqi notes.                 “This has led to instances where non-Muslim students are forced to ‘respect’ their fasting peers and eat their recess meals in toilets,” Siddiqi said, adding sensitivities around fasting add to “heightened tensions.”                 “Restaurants and eateries have refused to serve food to pregnant women during Ramadan, which goes against the very essence of Islam,” Siddiqi added.                 Anisah Mahmood, a 42-year-old mother of two from Kuala Lumpur now living in London, said she was suspended by her company in 2018 after she was caught eating in public. She was breastfeeding at the time.                 “There are valid reasons for not fasting, mostly medical,” she said. “But this is severely misunderstood in Malaysia, even if you are tired or sick, you will be shamed and made to feel like a bad person.”                 The issue of shuttered school canteens has been hotly debated over the years and was recently revived in parliament by Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek.     Related article‘I don’t trust myself.’ For Muslims with eating disorders, fasting in Ramadan brings another set of challenges             Non-Muslim students, she argued, “should not be forced to eat in storerooms or other inappropriate places” during Ramadan “when canteens are available.”                 Her comments drew criticism from PAS.                 “We think it’s common today that everyone respects those who are fasting and the children that are still learning to fast,” PAS lawmaker Haji Ahmad Bin Yahaya, said in a statement shared online.                 For those who struggle to fast or adhere to the rigors of the faith they were born with, Ramadan can be a stressful time.                 Yusuf, a Malay Muslim man in his 30s who lives in the southern state of Johor, recalled how he was caught buying food during Ramadan by religious police in 2019.                 “As long as you look Malay, you must fast during Ramadan – those are the rules,” Yusuf told CNN.                 He asked not to publish his full name and age given the sensitivities of the topic.                 “No one likes to admit when they don’t fast – especially if they are in Malaysia,” he said.                 “I try to fast and try to be consistent, but it gets mentally taxing and can feel almost impossible when all you want is coffee and a cigarette to help get you through the day.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The opinions in this article are those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.             As the conflict in the Middle East reverberates around the world, many in the West have fallen into the emotional traps of anger, fear and righteousness toward the perceived other side. Exporting the conflict will not bring peace any more than it will bring victory, and the only way to reduce the flames is to learn to coexist.                 My work as an imam and focus on spiritual coexistence in Israel and Palestine has shown me that the best personal defense against destructive emotions is to find the other inside ourselves. A complex identity is a natural antibody that inoculates against hate, and I myself identify as a Muslim, a Bedouin, a Palestinian and an Israeli.                 It is currently the month of Ramadan. This year my coexistence organization, Abrahamic Reunion, has hosted our 20th annual coexistence Iftar meal, this time in Jerusalem. It is especially meaningful to break my fast with my non-Muslim partners in the current context of the war. Ramadan is a time when Muslims have to think about the other who is less fortunate than themselves. Through fasting and charity, we are supposed to come out of the month with a renewed appreciation for our role in this world. That is the essence of spiritual coexistence, in which your self-image makes room for the humanity of others.                 Many people resent that I refuse to choose only one side of my identity; they want me to be angry, empty and broken like them. Members of my own Bedouin Muslim community have threatened and attacked my family and me for simply acknowledging the humanity of Jewish Israelis. My house was shot at after I spoke out against denying the crimes of Hamas on October 7.                 This is not a recent phenomenon. In 2008, after my wife was honored with lighting a torch at a celebration of Israel’s Independence Day, our family’s car was bombed. But these attacks have only ever strengthened my resolve to advocate for spiritual coexistence, and so I have spent years teaching Jewish Israelis about Islam and our need to recognize that both Muslims and Jews belong in this land.     Related articleOpinion: Why antisemitism and anti-Zionism are so deeply intertwined             This has been my life’s mission. My wife Sana and I cofounded the Abrahamic Reunion in the aftermath of the violence of the Second Intifada of the early 2000s, when terror attacks and military operations drove deep divisions between every sector of Israeli and Palestinian society. Abrahamic Reunion’s dream is to reunite the children of Abraham in the Holy Land, and to that end we have had tens of thousands of Muslims, Christians, Jews, Israelis and Palestinians join our activities over the years.                 Spiritual coexistence means building bridges out of celebration, grief and the acknowledgment of God above us, no matter your faith. And it is how we cultivate the other within ourselves. Almost anyone who participates in experiences like these will find themselves more immune to the emotional pull of identity-driven hate, even amid a devastating and personal war such as this one.                 Abrahamic Reunion included participants from Gaza until Hamas made participation illegal in 2013. Before then, we would sit on a hill next to the border and talk through megaphones with Gazans on the other side of the fence. Organizations that feel threatened by coexistence know that it is the greatest threat to their power.                 You can always coexist with other people, but not with every ideology, and on October 7, Hamas declared war against every element of my identity. They murdered Muslims. They kidnapped Bedouin from the desert. They continue to oppress Palestinians in Gaza, stealing aid and using their homes and mosques to launch attacks. They are committed to destroying Israel and every Israeli. I am at war with Hamas because this is their path, but I will never be at war against the people of Gaza.     Related articleOpinion: The crux of Israel’s challenge             My religion is Islam, and as the imam of the southern Israeli town of Tel Sheva, I provide spiritual and moral guidance to my community, as my father and grandfather did before me. My ancestors are related to the Hashemite family, the traditional protectors of Islam’s holy sites.                 The Islam of my tradition has nothing in common with those who proclaimed “Allahu Akbar” while inflicting unspeakable violence upon innocent civilians on October 7. It is because I am a Muslim that I call to immediately release the remaining hostages seized from Israel, Bedouin Muslims among them, and to provide help to Palestinians in desperate need of humanitarian relief in Gaza.                 My ethnicity is Bedouin, and my people have called the Negev desert home for centuries, as nations and empires rose and fell around us. Bedouin tribes are part of the Arab fabric of this land, and I trace my history, traditions and communal codes back to the sands of the Negev. Despite being from a nomadic people, I am not at home anywhere else.                 The Bedouin community in Israel has long suffered from neglect and marginalization by the state, and our society today is riddled with both crime and a lack of respect for its elders. My mission to deliver Tel Sheva back from the hands of criminals is connected to the need to return Islam from the broken souls of political extremists.                 My people are the Palestinian people, and I am inextricably connected to the souls in Gaza for whom the weight of this war is unbearable. I feel their fear, hunger and suffering as my own, and I cry at the images of destruction and loss. Members of my community have family in Gaza, and we pray for their safety every day.                 A solution to this conflict will only come from securing a path to Palestinian freedom, under a government that represents and cares for its people. War will not turn that hope into a reality, and neither will leaving Gaza under the moral vacuum of Hamas.                 My nationality is Israeli. An Israeli who loves the country he has built alongside his Jewish and Arab neighbors. An Israeli whose wife was the first Bedouin woman honored with lighting a torch at Israel’s national Independence Day ceremony. An Israeli who knows that his country must now fight for peace as hard as it fights for survival because the two are dependent on each other. On October 7, Bedouin Muslims like myself saved the lives of our Jewish neighbors, and the Israel Defense Forces defended our homes the same way they did the homes of Jewish Israelis.                 My wife, may Allah have mercy on her, passed away last year. Her final instruction to me was to look after our four beautiful children and continue the journey we started together. I do so today because, beyond my identity as a Muslim, a Bedouin, a Palestinian and an Israeli, I am first and foremost a human being: a father, a husband and a servant of God.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group released its annual civil rights report, which documents incidents reported to CAIR and an analysis of the state of American Muslim civil rights.                 “The new data confirms our worst suspicions: what we are witnessing since October 2023 is nothing short of the largest wave of anti-Muslim hate seen in this country in more than a decade,” Farah Afify, the report’s co-author and CAIR research and advocacy coordinator, said in a statement to CNN.     Related articleCAIR received an ‘unprecedented’ 1,283 reports of anti-Arab and Islamophobic bias in the last month, new data shows             The number of complaints last year had a significant jump – 56% – from 2022, when the group said it received 5,156.                 That year, however, was an aberration because it showed a significant drop in reports – the only such dip in the past 28 years. In 2021, for instance, the number of incidents reported was 6,720.                 CAIR noted the main factor behind the increase in bias complaints was the Israel-Hamas war, which began in October. Just over 44% of the total 2023 complaints were reported in the last three months of the year, the group said.                 CAIR said its local chapters and headquarters record incidents of bias using 20 different categories.  Overall, the top category in 2023 was complaints of immigration and asylum cases with 1,637 reports, followed by 1,201 reports of employment discrimination and 688 complaints of discrimination linked to education settings but excluding instances of bullying or sports discrimination, according to the new data.                 Complaints were, however, broadly spread among the categories. “There are other types of cases that help paint a fuller picture of the experience of being a Muslim in the US,” Corey Saylor, CAIR’s research and advocacy director and one of the report’s authors, told CNN.                 Saylor cited discrimination by financial institutions, a case of a court-appointed attorney making Islamophobic or racist social media posts, and law enforcement approaching people for being Muslim, their origin or speaking a language other than English.                 The full breakdown of complaints made to CAIR and shared with CNN shows there were complaints tracked last year that fell under each of the categories used by the group. In addition to several types of discrimination, other examples include bullying, hate crimes or incidents, placement on the terror watchlist and encounters with law enforcement.                 But the wave of Islamophobia in the last months of the year had a significant impact on the workplace and education settings.     Related articleReports of antisemitism, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias continue to surge across the US, new data shows             “Employers, universities, and schools were among the primary actors suppressing free speech by those who sought to vocally oppose Israel’s genocidal onslaught on Gaza and call attention to Palestinian human rights, particularly Muslims, Arabs, and Palestinians,” the authors wrote in the report.                 In the final months of 2023, there were 662 complaints of employment discrimination, 472 of hate crimes and incidents, and 448 of education discrimination, the data shows.                 The report’s findings “represent the reality on the ground for Muslims, Arabs, and Palestinians, who have been subjected to Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian rhetoric in virtually every sector of American society for vocalizing their support of Palestinian human rights,” Afify said.                 “We suspect that, until we see our political leaders come out forcefully against Islamophobia and with substantive support for a permanent and immediate ceasefire in Gaza, we will continue to see horrifying attacks on American Muslim communities well into 2024.”                 The group said the wave of Islamophobic bias surpassed the one tracked by CAIR following the implementation of the Trump administration’s travel ban on seven Muslim-majority nations in 2017, which saw a 32% jump over the previous year.                 “These findings demonstrate that, even amid moments of perceived progress, Islamophobia persists as an underlying force that is always capable of reemerging to significantly impact the lives of Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim,” the report’s authors wrote.                 In its report, CAIR included a series of recommendations. The group urged public officials and corporate and education leaders who comment on the events in Israel and Palestine to give “equal weight and attention” to “Palestinian suffering.”                 CAIR urged Congress to enhance anti-doxxing laws that limit the dissemination of personally identifying information on the internet. It says students and employees who expressed support for Palestinians in Gaza have been subjected to such intimidation in recent months.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

But last week’s attack on a Moscow concert hall reminded the world of the enduring danger of Islamist terrorism and the ambitions of what is known as IS Khorasan (ISIS-K) far beyond its camps in the mountains of Afghanistan.                 Analysts believe the group has a growing focus on Europe – and point to events such as this year’s Paris Olympics as potential targets.                 ISIS claimed responsibility for the Moscow attack. The fact that Tajik nationals were allegedly involved indicates ISIS-K was responsible; the group draws many members from central Asia and has a record of previous plots in Russia. US officials have also said there is evidence ISIS-K carried out the attack.                 ISIS-K was created nine years ago as an autonomous ‘province’ of the Islamic State, and despite many enemies has survived and proved itself capable of launching attacks in Pakistan, Iran and central Asia. Before the Crocus City attack, it had planned others in Europe and Russia. The commander of US Central Command, Gen. Erik Kurilla, assessed recently that ISIS-K “retains the capability and the will to attack US and Western interests abroad in as little as six months with little to no warning.”                 UN experts and others – including the Russian security services – estimate the strength of ISIS-K at between 4,000 and 6,000 fighters. Sanaullah Ghafari became the group’s leader in 2020 and, despite occasional reports of his demise, terrorism analysts believe he remains an effective leader.                 Both the Taliban and the United States have sought – though not in concert – to expunge ISIS-K from its safe havens in eastern Afghanistan. But a recent analysis in Sentinel, the journal of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, said it “remains a resilient organization, capable of adapting to changing dynamics and evolving to survive difficult circumstances.”                 Edmund Fitton-Brown, a senior adviser to the New York-based Counter Extremism Project, told CNN that ISIS-K “has the desire and a growing ability to project beyond Afghanistan and carry out regional attacks” in Pakistan, Iran and central Asia, bolstered by a robust media output in Tajik, Uzbek and Russian. Fitton-Brown said that in Afghanistan the Taliban’s “Pashto chauvinism has helped ISIS-K recruit from other Afghan ethnic groups.”                 ISIS-K’s most infamous attack until now was the suicide bombing at Kabul airport in 2021 that killed nearly 200 people, including 13 US soldiers guarding the airport.                 It has continued a campaign of suicide bombings and assassinations against the Taliban, which it regards as insufficiently radical and beholden to outside powers. Just last week, an ISIS-K suicide bomber detonated his explosive belt among Taliban militia in the Afghan city of Kandahar, inflicting dozens of casualties, according to local accounts.     Related articleRussia’s security services knew of ISIS threat before concert attack, new evidence from investigative body suggests             But ISIS-K has also expanded its orbit. Amira Jadoon, who has written a book about the group, said that over the last three years ISIS-K “has grown more ambitious and aggressive in its efforts to gain notoriety and relevance across South and Central Asia, launching its most aggressive multilingual propaganda campaign and expanding the types of attacks it conducts.”                 “It has effectively fused a wide range of regional grievances into its global jihadist agenda,” Jadoon told CNN.                 Last year the group executed a devastating bombing against an election rally in Baujur, Pakistan, in which more than 60 people were killed. It has also established a foothold in the restive Pakistani province of Baluchistan bordering Iran.                 In January, ISIS claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings in the Iranian city of Kerman, killing 90 people and injured more than 200. Jadoon, an associate professor at Clemson University, said that given its “proximity to the attacks, its highly sectarian attack strategy, and its diverse membership base, it is highly likely that ISK [as the group is also called] played a role in the Kerman attack.”                 ISIS-K has ambitions far beyond south Asia, aiming to target Russia, western Europe and even the United States. European security agencies are paying heightened attention to the threat, even if ISIS-K’s capabilities are yet to match its ambitions.                 Hans-Jakob Schindler, senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, notes that in July last year seven men were arrested in Germany suspected of planning high-profile attacks and being in contact with ISIS-K planners. All the suspects were from central Asia.                 This month, two Afghan citizens were detained in Germany, accused of making “concrete preparations” to attack Sweden’s parliament in retaliation for a spate of Koran burnings in the country. One had joined ISIS-K last year, prosecutors asserted, and their plans were made “in close consultation with” ISIS-K operatives.                 Christine Abizaid, director of the US National Counterterrorism Center, told Congress last autumn that so far “ISIS-Khorasan has relied primarily on inexperienced operatives in Europe to try to advance attacks in its name.”                 Fitton-Brown – former coordinator of UN sanctions and threat assessment regarding ISIS, al Qaeda and the Taliban – agreed that so far the threat in Europe has been “naïve and embryonic” but warned that ISIS-K “has plugged into the central Asian diaspora, primarily in Russia and Turkey and to some extent in Germany.”                 He regards the Moscow attack as a “breakthrough success” for the group, demonstrating a level of planning not previously seen beyond south Asia. ISIS claimed that the Crocus City Hall had been intensively reconnoitered.                 A leaked US Defense Department assessment last year noted that “ISIS has been developing a cost-effective model for external operations that relies on resources from outside Afghanistan, operatives in target countries, and extensive facilitation networks.”                 Following the Moscow attack, France – which hosts the Olympics this year – raised the terrorist threat level to the maximum. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said thousands more soldiers were ready to boost its counter-terrorism force, adding: “The Islamist threat is real…We are constantly preparing for all scenarios.”                 Fitton-Brown does not see that as alarmist. “I hope I’m wrong,” he told CNN, “but I’m very worried about the Paris Olympics.” He described a “perfect storm” of ISIS-K’s growing reach, ambient rage among radicalized individuals at the situation in Gaza and the release of former jihadis from European jails after serving their sentences.                 Jadoon said the risk of ISIS-K’s “brand resonating with individual sympathizers in Western countries cannot be overlooked.” She explained that as militants see it as “an inspirational and growing force, it may attract individuals from Western nations who are drawn to its ideology. This could lead to attempts by individuals to travel to conflict zones to join its ranks or carry out attacks in their home countries on behalf of the group.”                 Russia may be particularly vulnerable to ISIS-K. Ten years ago, then ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi denounced “the crusaders, their allies, and with them the rest of the nations and religions of kufr (infidel), all being led by America and Russia.”                 A year later, ISIS’ franchise in Sinai claimed responsibility for the bomb that brought down a Russian charter jet flying from Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg, killing all 224 people onboard.                 ISIS’ loathing of Vladimir Putin stems from the Russian role in Syria in support of the Assad regime and the brutal Chechen wars in the early years of the century. Russia’s support for authoritarian regimes in central Asia – which ISIS-K has described as Russia’s “puppets” – has deepened the animus.                 ISIS-K has also derided the Taliban for “befriending Russians, the murderers of Chechen Muslims.” In 2022, an ISIS-K suicide bomber attacked the Russian embassy in Kabul, killing two employees.                 Now it’s clear that the group is trying to establish itself inside Russia. Earlier this month, the Russian security service – the FSB – said it had that killed two ISIS-K operatives in the region of Kaluga who were planning an attack on a Moscow synagogue.                 Jadoon told CNN that “geographic proximity, the inclusion of Central Asian fighters within its ranks, and its determined regional and global propaganda strategy indicates that IS-K likely played a role in this attack, possibly by deploying its own affiliated militants or by providing financial support or training to the perpetrators.”                 Fitton-Brown regards Russia as extremely vulnerable to further attacks, with its security services preoccupied by Ukraine and a vast pool of migrant workers from central Asia, at least some of whom have likely been radicalized. All those arrested since the Crocus City attack are Tajik.                 Several previous ISIS-inspired or claimed attacks in Russia have involved Tajik, Uzbek or Kyrgyz nationals. In 2017 an Uzbek national carried out a suicide bombing on the St Petersburg metro, killing 15.                 Russia’s vulnerability may be heightened by easy travel from Turkey. Turkish security sources confirmed to CNN that two of the alleged Crocus City attackers spent time in Istanbul before flying back to Russia at the beginning of March, a factor that Fitton-Brown regards as “highly significant” given the presence of Tajik migrant workers in Turkey. One Tajik national, Shamil Hukumatov, who according to the UN was one of the group’s “most active propagandists and high-ranking recruiters,” was arrested in Turkey last year.                 The attitude of the Russian government, both pre- and post- the Moscow attack, may not help it confront the threat. After the US warned in early March of the possibility of terror attacks at “large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts,” Putin lambasted “provocative statements by a number of official Western structures…All this resembles blatant blackmail and an intention to sow fear and destabilize our society.”                 Schindler at the Counter Extremism Project said that even if the FSB were aware of such plots, protective deployment of security forces at concerts would have smacked of contradicting the Kremlin - and would therefore have been unwise.                 After the attack, Putin said it was carried out “by the hands of radical Islamists,” but was sponsored elsewhere, suggesting Ukraine had been involved, something strenuously denied by Kyiv and Washington. And according to the director of the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, three countries were behind the terrorist attack: the US, UK and Ukraine.                 The narrative from Moscow is that even if ISIS-K or individuals inspired by it step up their campaign in Russia, they’ll be seen as puppets of darker forces. That may distort intelligence-gathering.                 For ISIS-K, the Moscow attack is a coup. Rita Katz, executive director of SITE Intelligence, said: “ISIS’ global support rests in no small part on its image as a capable organization, and this devastating massacre in Russia will only feed into that image.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Russian authorities have accused four men from the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan of being behind the attack, which left at least 137 people dead and more than 100 injured. The suspects, who are charged with committing a terrorist act and face possible life imprisonment, have been remanded into pre-trial detention through May 22 after appearing in court in Moscow on Sunday.                 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that “radical Islamists” carried out the assault, but also claimed without proof that a “window” had been prepared for the attackers to escape to Ukraine. Kyiv has denied the allegations.                 US officials have tied the attack to ISIS-K, an affiliate that operates in central Asia, which has become one of the region’s most brutal and feared terror groups.                 Since November, the US has received a stream of intelligence that ISIS-K was determined to mount an attack in Russia, sources told CNN, and passed those warnings on to Moscow. US Vice President Kamala Harris said Sunday that “what we know to be the case is that ISIS-K is actually, by all accounts responsible for what happened.”                 Here’s what we know about ISIS-K.             ISIS-K was formed in 2015 and has been active in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. It is a branch of ISIS, the terror group that emerged in Syria and Iraq and, at its peak, controlled a huge stretch of territory.                 Five years since the fall of ISIS’ self-proclaimed caliphate across Iraq and Syria, the group has morphed into a terror network with cells spread around the world, including in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.                 The connection between ISIS-K and its apparent parent group is not entirely clear. The affiliates share an ideology and tactics, but the depth of their relationship – such as the chain of command and control – has never been fully established.                 By 2018, ISIS-K was ranked the world’s fourth-deadliest terror group, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, which monitors global terrorism.                 The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, and the withdrawal of US troops from the country, thrust ISIS-K into the global spotlight – especially after the group orchestrated a deadly bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 US military personnel and 170 Afghans.                 It was ISIS-K’s most globally consequential action to date and drew a promise of retribution from US President Joe Biden.                 The United Nations estimated in 2021 that the group has up to 2,200 core fighters based in Afghanistan’s Kunar and Nangarhar provinces.                 Like its parent organization, ISIS-K aims to create a “pure Islamic state,” according to CSIS – describing the group’s vision of a “global, transnational caliphate” governed by Sharia law.                 ISIS-K has a mutual hatred of the Taliban and attracts those with views even more radical than the Islamist group that rules Afghanistan. It refuses to acknowledge the Taliban as a legitimate Islamic leader because it relies on a narrow base “instead of committing to a universal Islamic jihad,” according to CSIS.                 As such, ISIS-K’s recent attacks have largely been aimed at the Taliban and other symbolic targets, as well as at Afghanistan’s Shia Muslim minorities, in particular the ethnic Hazaras.                 The group’s hatred of the West, including the United States, Britain and Europe, also features prominently in their agenda – as does its enmity toward Russia.                 ISIS has a longstanding animosity against Russia and Putin, several experts told CNN.                 “Russia has been at the top or near the top of the list of ISIS for many years,” said Daniel Byman, director of Georgetown University’s security studies program. He pointed to Moscow’s crucial role in the Syrian civil war, when it intervened in support of the Syrian government and against ISIS.                 ISIS-K has also criticized the Taliban for being “too close to Russia,” Byman added.                 There are other historical grievances, too. ISIS propaganda has long targeted Russia for its brutal tactics in the various Chechen wars, and its scorched-earth policies in the Caucasus affecting Eastern European and Eurasian Muslims, according to John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst.     Related cardWhat we know about the four suspects in the Moscow concert hall attack             In 2022, ISIS-K claimed responsibility for a suicide blast near Russia’s embassy in Kabul, which killed six people, including two consular staff.                 Over the past month, Russia has thwarted several ISIS-related incidents, according to state-run news agency RIA Novosti. At least four incidents in March alone have been reported across Russia that local authorities said involved people connected to ISIS, RIA reported.                 Russian state media reported on March 7 that the FSB, Russia’s security service, prevented an ISIS attack on a synagogue in Moscow, according to Reuters. The ISIS attackers were killed in a gunfight, the reports said.                 To date, the majority of ISIS-K’s most devastating attacks have been in Afghanistan and Pakistan – the Kabul airport blast being a prominent example.                 Others include a May 2020 attack on a Kabul maternity ward that killed 24 people and an attack on Kabul University in November 2020 that killed 22, according to CSIS. ISIS-K was also believed to be behind a horrific car bombing outside a girls’ high school in May 2021 that killed at least 85 people.                 The group was particularly active during its peak around 2018 – when an ISIS-K suicide bomber killed 128 people at an election rally in Mastung, Pakistan, one of the bloodiest attacks anywhere in the world that year.                 While it’s no longer as strong as it was in 2018, ISIS-K continues to plan attacks in Afghanistan. It is the most active terror group in the country, responsible for 73 deaths in 2023, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace.                 The Kabul airport attack had raised global concerns that ISIS-K could pose a major threat across the region and beyond.             In March 2023, the head of the US Central Command told lawmakers that ISIS-K was becoming more emboldened, and that Europe or Asia were more likely targets for terrorist attacks originating in Afghanistan than the US.                 In a 2023 threat assessment report by US intelligence agencies, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said ISIS-K “almost certainly retains the intent to conduct operations in the West and will continue efforts to attack outside Afghanistan.”                 And earlier this year, the UN Security Council warned in a report that ISIS-K was planning or conducting “operational plots” in Europe. Seven people linked to the group were arrested in Germany last year while planning for “high-impact terrorist attacks,” including obtaining weapons and possible targets, the council said.     Related videoRussia expert explains why Putin treated US warning about possible terror attack as ‘blackmail’             It is not the first time that ISIS has struck a concert venue. In November 2015, ISIS gunmen attacked the Bataclan theater in Paris – part of an assault that hit other targets in the city – killing at least 130 people. In May 2017, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena, England, that killed 22 people. ISIS has also inspired terrorists in the US, including the gunman who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 in what was then the most lethal terrorist attack in the US since 9/11.                 Earlier this month, the US government had information about a planned terrorist attack in Moscow – potentially targeting large gatherings, to include concerts – which prompted the State Department to issue a public advisory to Americans in Russia. The US also shared this information with Russian authorities.                 The intelligence that Washington had been getting since November was “fairly specific” and the US intelligence community warned Russia, but it’s not clear if this is directly tied to the March 7 warning by the US embassy in Moscow.                 Putin rejected the US embassy warnings about terror attacks as “provocative” in a speech to the FSB, saying they “resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society.”       CNN’s Rob Picheta, Eliza Mackintosh, Ehsan Popalzai, Antonio Jarne, Lou Robinson, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Mariya Knight, Anna Chernova and Darya Tarasova contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

He is the author of “The Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             If ISIS was indeed responsible for the attack Friday at a Moscow-area concert venue that killed at least 133 people, it would suggest that, unfortunately, the terror group is making something of a comeback.                 ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack; a US official told CNN the US has no reason to doubt it.                 Back in its heyday of 2014 and 2015, ISIS had controlled territory in Iraq and Syria around the size of the United Kingdom and a population of millions of people. During that period, the group also carried out a number of terrorist plots in Europe, including an attack in Paris that killed 130 people in 2015. ISIS had also inspired terrorists in the US, including the gunman who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 in what was then the most lethal terrorist attack in the US since 9/11.     Related articleOpinion: Vladimir Putin’s sham election             But between 2017 and 2018, ISIS lost its so-called geographical “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria, and it has since devolved into a loosely allied group of ISIS affiliates in Africa and Asia with seemingly scant capabilities to carry out large-scale attacks elsewhere.                 One of the most virulent affiliates is ISIS-K in Afghanistan, which killed 13 American service members and some 170 Afghan civilians at Kabul Airport as the Biden administration pulled all US troops from Afghanistan in August 2021.                 Yet, the understanding at the time was that ISIS affiliates in Afghanistan and certain African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo or Somalia were not capable of carrying out major international attacks. But then came a large-scale terrorist attack in Iran in January that killed 84 people at a memorial service commemorating General Qasem Soleimani, one of the most powerful military leaders in Iran who had been killed by a US drone strike in 2020. Through that attack, ISIS-K showed that the group, which is very anti-Shia, could target a hostile state like predominantly Shia Iran.                 In March alone, a Russian state news agency said the country had thwarted multiple ISIS-related incidents, including a plan to attack a synagogue in Moscow.     Related articleOpinion: What Biden needs to know about Rafah             The US embassy in Russia also said on March 7 that it was “monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow,” including concerts. According to a US National Security Council spokesperson, “The US Government also shared this information with Russian authorities in accordance with its longstanding ‘duty to warn’ policy.” But Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the US’ warning as “provocative,” saying, “These actions resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society.”                 Taken together, the fact that Russian authorities had detected a number of ISIS-related plots earlier this month and that US authorities were warning of an attack at the same time indicates that there was an active terrorist threat in Moscow from ISIS that was known not only to the US but also to the Russians.                 But Russian President Vladimir Putin linked the suspects in Friday’s attack to Ukraine during a five-minute address on Saturday. State news agencies said that authorities arrested the four men suspected of attacking the Moscow-area concert venue while they were trying to cross the border into Ukraine, and that they “had relevant contacts on the Ukrainian side,” according to the FSB.                 Ukraine has emphatically denied any role in the attack, and both Ukrainian and American officials expressed concerns that Putin’s comments may be used to justify an escalation in the ongoing war.                 ISIS-K certainly has the capability and motive to attack Russia. When it comes to motive, the Russian support for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, which helped him remain in power during the Syrian civil war, certainly comes to mind. For ISIS, Assad is a mortal enemy, both because he is a member of a Shia sect and because he has systematically killed Sunnis in Syria. Also, historically, Russia has brutally repressed Muslim minorities like the Chechens. As for capability, the ISIS-K attack in Iran earlier this year demonstrated that the group could carry out a large-scale attack outside of its home base in Afghanistan.                 What we do know is that Putin made a glaring mistake by denouncing the US’ warning. And if ISIS-K did attack the concert hall, the Biden administration would have to ask itself some serious questions about whether the decision to pull all American troops out of Afghanistan allowed ISIS to regroup there with the capability to carry out large-scale attacks in other countries. If that were the case, that would be a blow for the Biden administration.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/10/us/atheism-beliefs-explained-cec/index.html,Why people are reluctant to call themselves atheists,"Many people are hesitant to identify as atheists because of social stigma they may face, making it hard to pinpoint connections and differences among this group.","Mar 10, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Harmeet Kaur,International,"In September, standing before a room full of Christian conservatives, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made a bold pronouncement: “I don’t know how you could be a leader without having faith in God.”                 Being an atheist is still a political liability in the US — though it’s not as bad as DeSantis would have you think. While a 2020 Gallup poll found that six in 10 people would vote for a well-qualified atheist presidential candidate, fewer people said they would be willing to vote for an atheist than a candidate who was gay, lesbian or Muslim. Only socialists ranked lower among poll respondents.                 Though the share of Americans who say they don’t believe in a higher power has increased in the past decade, some people still view atheists negatively. A 2017 study found that people believe atheists are more likely to be serial killers than believers, even though federal data suggests they are far less likely to commit crimes than religious people.                 Just like people of faith, not all atheists believe the same things. Aside from their lack of belief in a higher power ﻿or powers, atheists vary widely in their answers to spiritual and existential questions.                 Given the misconceptions surrounding this group, many people are reluctant to say that they’re atheists — which means it’s hard to pinpoint connections and differences among their numbers.                 An atheist is someone “who does not believe in the existence of a god or any gods,” according to Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary.                 Because atheists are defined by what they don’t believe, it’s difficult to generalize what they do believe. In the words of comedian and outspoken atheist Ricky Gervais on X, “Saying ‘Atheism is a belief system’ is like saying ‘not going skiing, is a hobby.’”                 Some atheists, like evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and neuroscientist Sam Harris, are steadfast in their rejection of organized religion. Others are skeptical or apathetic when it comes to philosophical questions of whether a god exists.                 Because of the social stigma atheists may face in the US and around the world, some people have complicated feelings about the term, said Nick Fish, president of the organization American Atheists. Plenty of people who fit the definition of an atheist don’t self-identify as such, instead preferring less fraught terms such as agnostic, humanist or freethinker, he added.                 Then there are the cultural Catholics, the non-practicing Jews, the secular Muslims — people who don’t necessarily believe in a deity but identify with a particular faith because of their family upbringing, ethnicity or culture.                 “A simple dictionary definition doesn’t necessarily encapsulate people’s self identity, and people use a variety of terms even when ultimately they believe the same thing,” Fish said.                 Atheists also have different interpretations of what it means to not believe. While nearly all self-described atheists don’t believe in the God described in the Judeo-Christian Bible, 23% do believe in God or some other higher power or spiritual force in the universe, according to a Pew Research Center report published in January.                 Belief for atheists goes deeper than the question of whether there is a higher power.                 Notably, a fifth of self-described atheists consider themselves spiritual, Pew’s recent survey on the religious “nones” found. The report contains other surprising insights, too: Most atheists say the natural world is all there is, but nearly a quarter believe there’s something spiritual beyond our present environment. About a third believe animals other than humans can have spirits or spiritual energies, and a slightly smaller share believe spiritual energies can be found in parts of nature, like mountains, trees or rivers. Just under one in five atheists believe cemeteries or memorial sites can have spiritual energies, while fewer than one in 10 say the same about objects such as crystals. Nearly a third of atheists believe humans have souls or spirits in addition to their physical body.                 These responses might seem confusing or contradictory, but atheism and spirituality aren’t necessarily at odds. Though some people associate spirituality with a connection to a god, for others it can mean feeling connected to other people or to something else bigger than oneself.                 Indeed, there are atheists who believe in cosmic interconnectedness or in transcendent moments of wonder without considering themselves religious. Long distance swimmer and self-proclaimed atheist Diana Nyad discussed this distinction in a 2013 interview with Oprah.                 “I’m an atheist who’s in awe,” she said. “I think you can be an atheist who doesn’t believe in an overarching being who created all of this and sees over it. But there’s spirituality because we human beings, and we animals and maybe even we plants — but certainly the ocean and the moon and the stars — we all live with something that is cherished and we feel the treasure of it.”              It’s hard to know just how many atheists there are when some people are reluctant to claim the label.                 While a 2018 Pew survey found that 10% of US adults say they don’t believe in any higher power or spiritual force, only about 4% of US adults identify as atheists. A 2022 Gallup poll puts the number of nonbelievers higher, with 17% of Americans saying they don’t believe in God.                 Some scholars, however, consider these numbers underestimates — an analysis by psychologists Will Gervais and Maxine B. Najle suggests the true count is closer to 26%. Gervais points to Cold War era associations of atheists as “godless communists,” as well as Christianity’s enduring influence on American culture, as some reasons people may be hesitant to identify as nonbelievers.                 “The term atheist has attracted some unsavory connotations,” he added. “Also, religion (in the US) is politically and socially rewarded, so people might be reluctant to out themselves as an atheist.”                 It’s also worth noting that atheism — at least in the West — is often defined in relation to monotheistic traditions, namely the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. As the organization American Atheists notes on its website, older dictionaries previously defined atheism as a “belief that there is no God” — the singular, proper noun typically used by Christians and some Jews. Even Gallup’s 2022 poll asked about belief in “God.”                 Framing atheism in these terms doesn’t capture a range of other beliefs that atheists could conceivably hold. Strands of atheist thought can be found in non-theistic traditions such as Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, as well cultures around the world that practice animism.                 There are all kinds of labels to describe nonbelievers. While atheism and agnosticism are among the most common, there are some differences between those terms.                 Though the two are often considered distinct worldviews, technically, they aren’t mutually exclusive. Rather, the terms atheism and agnosticism answer different questions, Nick Fish of American Atheists said. Atheism answers whether a person believes in a god or gods, and agnosticism answers whether it is possible to know if a supreme being exists.                 But again, dictionary definitions prove limiting here. In reality, many people think of agnosticism as a less stringent form of atheism.                 “If you spend a bit of time digging in, I think (many agnostics) will ultimately say, ‘I don’t believe in a God but I’m not sure, so I’m agnostic,’” Fish said.                 Jocelyn Williamson, co-founder of the Central Florida Freethought Community, doesn’t believe in a higher power but says she can’t be certain. Technically, that fits the definition of an agnostic atheist. But she said she typically tells people who ask about her religious beliefs that she’s a secular humanist.                 “Most people don’t know what that means, and then I can actually have a conversation,” Williamson said. “There’s too many preconceived notions if I just say I’m an atheist.”                 The term atheist only conveys what she doesn’t believe in, Williamson said. The term humanist, meanwhile, signals that she’s motivated by compassion for others and that she believes societal decision-making should be grounded in reason and science.                 One of the most common misconceptions about atheists is that they lack morals that others typically attribute to religion.                 In a 2019 Pew survey, 44% of US residents said belief in God was necessary to be moral and have good values — in other countries, that share is much higher.                 Williamson is all too familiar with such notions. When she was first getting to know faith leaders in her state, through her work with the Central Florida Freethought Community, she recalls a clergy member asking her what stops her from killing other people if she doesn’t believe in a higher power.                 “I had always thought that was a meme, a trope,” she said. “I didn’t think anybody actually believed that.”                 In fact, various studies suggest that atheists are no more immoral than religious people. They’re also just as likely to participate in civic life as those who are affiliated with a religion and just as likely to engage in community service, according to Pew’s recent survey of religious “nones.”             Atheists also get stereotyped as angry people who vehemently oppose religion and its followers. Like any other population, though, they aren’t a monolith. Williamson, for example, is part of the Interfaith Council of Central Florida and works with faith leaders toward common goals. Plenty of nonbelievers volunteer with religious organizations out of a desire to serve their communities, she added — her father worked as a local director for the Christian nonprofit Habitat for Humanity despite not being religious.                 Another misconception about atheists is that they’re certain or unwavering in their beliefs, Fish said. People often tell him that they aren’t sure on the big existential questions, and therefore can’t be atheists. But many atheists are figuring it all out, too.                 “Just because we don’t believe in a god doesn’t mean that we have all the answers to everything else,” he said. “In fact, for many, for most of us, it’s the opposite. We recognize that we don’t.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Such violations and crimes include “extrajudicial and unlawful killings and murder, unnecessary and disproportionate use of force, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, torture, rape, enforced disappearances, and gender persecution,” the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a press release Friday.                 It cited a report by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran, a task force set up by the UN Human Rights Council to look at claims of deteriorating human rights conditions in Iran.                 The report said these violations came about in the context of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests sparked by the death of 22-year-old Iranian-Kurdish woman Jina Mahsa Amini in September 2022 after she was arrested for allegedly not observing Iran’s mandatory hijab law.     Related articleIran announces record low election turnout despite calls on voters to participate             She became the face of women calling for greater rights and freedoms curtailed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Protests erupted across Iran again in September last year on the first anniversary of her death.                 The mission said it found that physical violence while in custody of the morality police, a unit dedicated to enforcing strict dress codes for women, such as wearing the compulsory headscarf, led to Mahsa Amini’s “unlawful death.”                 “Rather than investigating this unlawful death promptly, effectively, and thoroughly – as required under international human rights law – the government actively obfuscated the truth, and denied justice,” the UN press release read.                 In a government crackdown against the country-wide protests, Iran mobilized “the entire security apparatus of the state to repress” protesters, the UN Office said, adding that as many as 551 protesters are thought to have been killed by security forces, among them at least 49 women and 68 children.                 The UN Fact-Finding Mission found evidence that forces used “unnecessary and disproportionate force” resulting in “unlawful killing and injuries of protesters,” the UN Office said, citing “a pattern of extensive injuries to protesters’ eyes,” which CNN had previously reported on.              A CNN report in November 2022 also found that Iran’s security forces used rape to quell protests in the country.                 The UN report found that state authorities at the highest levels “encouraged, sanctioned and endorsed human rights violations through statements justifying the acts and conduct of the security forces.”                 Authorities in Iran have also obstructed repatriation efforts of victims and their families, the UN said the mission found, adding that victims face a justice system lacking “independence, transparency and accountability.”                 Chair of the Fact-Finding Mission Sara Hossain urged Iran’s government to stop repressing peaceful protesters, particularly women and girls.                 “These acts form part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in Iran, namely against women, girls, boys and men who have demanded freedom, equality, dignity and accountability,” she said, according to the OHCHR.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The twin demolitions in Uttarakhand state and Delhi came just weeks after Modi inaugurated the controversial Ram Mandir, a temple built on the foundations of a centuries-old mosque that was torn down by hardline Hindu crowds in the early 1990s.                 That ceremony marked a seismic shift away from modern India’s secular founding principles and was hailed by Hindu nationalists as a crowning moment in their decades-long campaign to reshape the nation.                 Deadly violence erupted in Uttarakhand’s Haldwani city last week, after government officials, accompanied by police, razed a mosque and madrassa (an Islamic school), citing “illegal encroachment.”                 But advocates working on behalf of the Muslim community point to court documents, seen by CNN, that show no such order had been given.                 The demolitions drew incensed residents onto the streets and at least six people have been killed in clashes with police. Authorities have imposed curfews, but scared Muslim families told CNN they just want to leave. About a third of Haldwani’s 220,000 people are Muslim, according to the most recent census from 2011.                 Pushkar Dhami, Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, said his government will take strict action against “rioters and miscreants.”                 “Every rioter who indulged in arson and stone pelting is being identified, no miscreant who disturbs harmony and peace will be spared,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.                 The clashes come one week after another madrassa, a centuries-old mosque, a Sufi shrine and dozens of Muslim graves were demolished by government authorities in Delhi, also for alleged “illegal encroachment,” prompting anger and outrage in the Indian capital.     Related articleModi’s ‘divine India’ vision threatens to marginalize millions             Analysts say these incidents underscore an uncomfortable reality in the world’s largest democracy and fear that inter-religious tensions will increase as Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continue to push their populist, yet divisive, policies in the lead up to a nationwide election in just a few months’ time.                 The image of India that Modi wants to project is one of a confident, vibrant, and modern superpower. But many of the country’s 230 million Muslims say they are being sidelined and marginalized in the world’s largest democracy.                 “This is the worst possible time to be a Muslim in India,” said author Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, adding that it has “become normal to demolish mosques in India.”                 “The stigmatization of Muslims is an old story, seen as the new normal. No longer does it shock people.”                 CNN has reached out to the BJP but is yet to receive a response.                 The mosque demolitions come against a backdrop of increased religious polarization and accusations that the BJP is building a Hindu-first state in what is constitutionally meant to be a secular country.                 They follow the opening of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a 16th century mosque that was destroyed by hardline Hindus some 30 years ago, setting off a wave of deadly sectarian violence not seen in India since its bloody 1947 partition.                 Modi presided over a lavish consecration ceremony, where he played the role of a priest and hailed the beginning of a “new divine India.” But his vision is a far cry from the ideas of the modern country’s founding fathers, analysts say.                 And during his decade in power, Modi’s BJP has isolated millions among India’s sizable minorities, analysts say.                 Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform India’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he and his party also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India is inherently a land meant for Hindus.                 About 80% of India’s 1.4 billion people are Hindu, but the country is home to a diverse group of religions and faiths, including Sikhs, Buddhists and one of the world’s largest Muslim populations of some 230 million.                 When he stood for reelection in 2019, Modi’s Hindutva policies became more brazen, according to analysts.                 A few months after winning, he announced he was stripping the statehood of India’s only Muslim-majority territory, Jammu and Kashmir, and turning it into two union territories while bringing it under federal control.     Related articleIndia’s Modi inaugurates Abu Dhabi’s first Hindu temple             And earlier this month, the BJP-ruled state of Uttarakhand became the first in independent India to pass the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a set of contentious common laws that have been criticized by some minority groups for trying to replace their personal religious laws.                 In India, a country of diverse faiths, religious groups follow their own laws for matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. But these have long been considered by some to be regressive, including by many more secular figures.                 The BJP’s attempt to reform these religious laws is seen by some as a welcome move, but critics fear the government’s Hindu nationalist policies could unduly influence the legislation.                 Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim opposition lawmaker, criticized the law, saying it forces Muslims to follow a different religion.                 “I have a right to practice my religion and culture, this Bill forces me to follow a different religion and culture,” he wrote on X. “In our religion, inheritance and marriage are part of religious practice.”                 Earlier this month, a report from Amnesty International said between April and June 2022, a total of 128 properties largely belonging to Muslims across five states were bulldozed by government authorities.                 “The demolitions adversely impacted at least 617 people, including men, women, and children, either rendering them homeless or deprived of their sole livelihood,” the report said.                 Author Mukhopadhyay added: “It is a 360 degree Islamophobic campaign that is going on in every sphere of life.”                 A sense of despair among many Muslims lingers in Delhi’s Mehrauli district, where government authorities razed the 600-year-old Akhondji Mosque to the ground late last month.                 Late last month, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) – the governing body operating under India’s ruling BJP – bulldozed the structure, alleging “illegal encroachment.”                 But Mohammed Zakir Hussain, the mosque’s 40-year-old cleric, says the building was under the control of the city’s Waqf Board, a statutory body established to protect Islamic affairs, and should never have been destroyed.                 He felt “helpless” as he pleaded with authorities to stop tearing the building to the ground, he said.                 The DDA’s lawyer Sanjay Katyal told the Delhi High Court that the body had bought the land for planned development.The case is expected to be heard again later this month.                 Delhi, a metropolis of more than 20 million people, has seen rapid urbanization over the past few decades, with a vast, modern metro system, and a burgeoning middle class that has come to symbolize India’s economic growth.                 But between its meandering roads stand centuries-old monuments and medieval ruins that put the Indian capital on a par with the world’s great ancient cities, historians say.                 Historian Rana Safvi said the architecture of the Akhondji Mosque was typical of the Sultanate era, which flourished in India between 1192 and 1526. Its arched roof and pillars of grey stone had stood for some 600 years before it was torn to the ground.                 “It is like erasing a part of Indian history,” Safvi said. “It is a loss of a mosque, a safe place for one to congregate to pray, especially at a time when namaz in the open or in public areas is frowned upon.”                 And along with the mosque, authorities also broke down the Islamic school that housed dozens of children, including orphans, and destroyed an old graveyard that stood beside it.                 Mohammad Arif, 22, whose father, grandmother and grandfather’s graves are among those ruined, said he arrives at the site every day to try and restore what’s left of it.                 “I come here every day to ask (the guards) to let me go inside and put mud to restore their graves at least. They do not allow it,” he said.                 Mohammad Aman, 32, mourned the deepening divide between Hindus and Muslims.                 “(The government) rationalizes everything by blaming Mughal emperors,” he said, referring to India’s ancient Islamic rulers. “But you’re doing the same thing now. What is the difference between you and him then?”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Read more opinion at CNN.             In a different world, President Joe Biden’s decision Thursday to sanction certain Israeli settlers involved in violence against West Bank Palestinians might be meaningful. In the world we live in, confronting the shocking violence by the Israel Defense Forces in its war on Gaza that Biden has enabled, empowered and endorsed, it’s a particularly severe instance of far too little and far too late.                 From young voters to Black Christians, many people in solidly Democratic constituencies are reconsidering backing Biden because of his support for Israel. American Muslims might be among the most disillusioned of all. Over the last two decades, we’ve mostly backed Democrats. In the last few months, I’ve talked politics with hundreds of my fellow Muslims. Though not voting for Biden will effectively mean voting for former President Donald Trump if he wins the GOP nomination, I can count on one finger how many Muslims have said they are still riding with Biden.                 After the undeniably awful October 7 attacks Hamas perpetrated on Israelis, Biden could have chosen to pursue a response that acknowledged history and weighed Israeli and Palestinian lives equally. Instead, he has overseen what former State Department advisor Wa’el Alzayat called “an illogical disaster,” offering tepid, toothless criticism of Israel’s military tactics while continuing to ship arms and provide diplomatic cover for a war that has killed more than 27,000 people in Gaza in just months. These numbers are collected by Gaza’s Ministry of Health, which is part of Hamas’ government in Gaza, and their statistics have been relied upon by the United Nations.                 For the American Muslims I’ve spoken to, it’s impossible to overlook these choices. Biden was not compelled to pursue the policies he has. The world is suffering the consequences, and we are now seeing an escalation in bias and bigotry in our own country.                 Amina Barhumi, executive director of the Ohio chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told me about a surge in anti-Muslim “hate crimes, assaults and discriminatory incidents” since October 7. Reports of such incidents rose 172% nationwide year-over-year, she said, with a “600% increase into CAIR-Ohio offices in the four weeks” after October 7. She charged that “one-sided statements from our elected officials” about the conflict contributed to those numbers.     Related articleOpinion: I criticized the war in Gaza. Then I was fired from my job as Santa             Across the US, Muslims have faced violence including at Columbia University, where students protesting about Gaza were targeted with a chemical agent, according to reporting from The Intercept. In Georgia, a young student’s teacher allegedly threatened to behead her. Three Palestinian college students were shot in Vermont, one paralyzed for life. A mother, Hanaan Shahin, was brutally attacked in her own home; badly injured, she survived, but her 6-year-old son, Wadea Al Fayoume, was stabbed 26 times and died.                 When people ask me how American Muslims can abandon Biden in the face of Trump, I wonder if they see what we do. I wonder how anyone would make sense of the incredible moral discrepancies at work.                 Like many American Muslims, I’m in favor of a ceasefire in Gaza followed by a serious commitment, at long last, to a meaningful and fair process that provides Palestinians peace, security and dignity. Instead, through our government’s largely uncritical support for Israel, the US is propelling a violent military operation cheered on by openly eliminationist rhetoric that would face many more obstacles without determined American support.                 In so doing, Biden has seemingly abandoned even the pretense of neutrality, which the US should be committed to defending. It’s morally outrageous. It’s also strategically bonkers. We benefit from international institutions, too, after all. So this approach isn’t just unprincipled. It’s perilous. Many analysts warned Biden’s policies risked American lives; with the recent attack in Jordan, killing three of our soldiers and injuring many more, we are entering ever more worrying territory.     Related articleOpinion: An anti-Muslim tirade inspires a beautiful response             Credible observers warn of the conflagration spreading further, putting more American lives and resources on the line. As far as I know, no Americans voted for this chaos and conflict. Most Americans, including half of Republicans, back a ceasefire, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Yet Biden has time and again declined to use the United States’ enormous leverage to promote de-escalation.                 Have we learned nothing from our recent history? After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, our elites led us into trillions of dollars’ worth of short-sighted, sometimes disastrous responses, worst of all in Iraq. A nation that posed no credible direct threat to us was invaded on false premises. Thousands of Americans and roughly 300,000 Iraqis died, and no one was held responsible.                 Biden, then a US senator chairing the Foreign Relations Committee, voted in support of the resolution authorizing the US invasion of Iraq and has hardly acknowledged his culpability in that catastrophe. Worse still, he might not believe he has to.                 We Americans deserve better. We should demand better, too. For a long time, establishment Democrats wielded Trump like a threat. If you don’t vote for us, they warned, you’re voting for him. But if these Democrats were really concerned about what Trump represented, they’d draw a clearer contrast. If they can’t convince us to vote for Biden, that’s on the party — not on the voters. Biden had a preview of what he can expect when he visited Michigan on Thursday.                 Despite having just issued his executive order against violent Israeli settlers, he was treated to diminished representation from the American Muslim community, which is a considerable voting bloc in the Midwest swing state’s electorate. Days before Biden’s visit, local Muslim leaders were among those who cancelled a meeting with the president’s campaign manager. In December of last year, Muslim leaders gathered in Dearborn, Michigan — the city with the largest per capita Muslim population in the US — to officially launch an effort to “Abandon Biden.”                 A second Trump presidency would be difficult, even harrowing. But I believe the United States can survive four more years of Trump. I’m less certain we can survive four more years of so-called good guys who act so clearly otherwise.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

That’s how critics have described White Christian nationalism, a deviant strain of religion that has infected the political mainstream. White Christian nationalists believe the US was founded as a Christian nation, although the Constitution never mentions God and enshrines the separation of church and state. Its adherents twist biblical language to justify violence, sexism and hostility toward people of color.                 But there is another cost to the spread of White Christian nationalism that no one mentions.                 The relentless coverage of White Christian nationalism is spreading a racist myth: that Whiteness is the default setting for evangelical Christianity.                 This is one of the unintended consequences of the media and public’s fascination with the subject. Feeding this perception is an avalanche of books, articles and now a Hollywood film on the beliefs of White evangelical Christians — the biggest followers of Christian nationalism. In a February 2023 survey, nearly two-thirds of White evangelical Protestants qualified as sympathizers or adherents to Christian nationalism.                 The constant linking of Whiteness with evangelical Christianity, though, obscures another major story. There are millions of Black, Latino, African and Asian evangelical Christians who are already profoundly changing America. They represent what one scholar calls the “de-Europeanization of American Christianity.”                 And these non-White evangelicals will likely not only save the American church but transform the nation’s politics.                 This future will belong to people like Pastor Peter Lim, founder of a growing congregation of Asian-Americans called “4Pointes Church of Atlanta.” Lim, a Korean American evangelical, says the media’s hyperfocus on White Christian nationalism often renders communities like his invisible.                 He says he’s attended evangelical conferences where the only people who are featured onstage are White pastors or leaders. He wrote in an essay that Asian-American evangelicals often experience “perpetual invisibility” — akin to what Asian Americans encounter more broadly in this country.                 “You just feel overlooked — your story or your experience is minimized,” he says. “It’s not done intentionally. But you don’t feel like you belong. It tells you that your stories don’t belong. It does hurt.”                 Lim’s experience is the result of a passive form of racism. It’s not deliberate or malign; it’s a sin of omission rather than commission by many journalists, church leaders and commentators who rightly warn about the dangers posed by White Christian nationalism.                 I’ve done it myself: In the past, when I thought about evangelicals, I only saw White Christians.                 The true definition of “evangelical” has nothing to do with a color or a political party. Evangelicals are loosely defined as Christians who share a “born-again” dramatic personal conversion, who take the Bible seriously or literally and believe they’re supposed to spread their faith to others.                 Today, however, the definition of an evangelical Christian has been reduced to one category: a White conservative Republican.                 Click on any story about evangelicals and you’re liable to see a White person, usually a man, clutching a Bible.                 But it may surprise some people to learn that in 2024, the face of evangelical Christianity in the US is more likely to be brown than White.                 The numbers tell the story:                 —According to a 2017 survey, one in three American evangelicals is a person of color.                 —A higher number of Black Christians — 41% — identify as evangelicals than their White Christian counterparts.                 —The fastest-growing segment of evangelicals in the US are Latino Americans.                 —And at least 80% of the members of evangelical student groups at competitive universities like Princeton, Harvard and Stanford are Asian-American, according to one estimate.                 As Carolyn Chen, a professor at UC Berkeley who is an authority on Asian American religion, said during a 2022 speech: “Today’s evangelical leaders are not just White men with degrees from Oral Roberts University.”                 Two Asian Americans, for example, hold leadership positions at major evangelical organizations. Walter Kim, a Korean American, is the president of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE). And Tom Lin, a Taiwanese American, is the president of  InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA, a nationwide campus Christian ministry.                 The Rev. William Barber II, a Black pastor and activist who has been called the “closest person we have to MLK in contemporary America,” also identifies as an evangelical Christian.                 This change of complexion often produces a change in political perspective. Scholars say non-White evangelicals tend to be conservative on issues like sexuality and abortion but more progressive in politics. A majority of Black evangelicals, for example, say that opposing racism is an essential part of their faith.                 Chen predicts that “America will become more secular, and Christianity less conservative” as non-White evangelicals increase in number.                 Chen says the browning of Christianity in the US owes much to the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. That law paved the way for millions of immigrants from Asian, Africa, and Latin American countries to come to the US.                 “When we tell the story about American Christianity, we might start with the Puritans — it’s basically a European story,” says Chen, author of “Work Pray Code: When Work Becomes Religion in Silicon Valley.” “But what if we were to tell the story of American Christianity by what it’s starting to look like and how it’s changing today? That story begins in a place like Taiwan, Korea, or Mexico.”                 The focus on White evangelicals presents their non-White counterparts with a challenge: How do you reconcile belonging to a church that often doesn’t see you?                 That’s a problem Black evangelicals have faced for centuries, says the Rev. John C. Richards, Jr., a Black evangelical pastor at Saint Mark Baptist Church in Little Rock, Arkansas. He wrote in a 2017 essay that “White Christians have historically controlled the evangelical narrative.”                 “Black Christians have always lived in the peripheral vision of White Evangelicalism — our stories remaining unearthed and untold,” he wrote.                 But Black evangelicals have been in the US since the country’s birth. Richards says they have been the “moral compass of our nation,” clinging to their faith during slavery and Jim Crow. He cited the evangelical scholar Mark Noll, who once said:                 “Black Christians are the ones who have experienced the cross most traumatically in American history yet have not been included in the stories of Evangelicalism.”                 Richards deals with this challenge by asserting his evangelical identity in any forum he can. He uses social media, sermons and his “The Questions Worth Answering” podcast to highlight the faith and contributions of Black evangelicals.                 And he continues to claim the term “evangelical,” despite its association with conservative White Americans.                 “I’m not ready to abandon it just because someone co-opted it and just because people are misusing the word,” he says.                 The Rev. John Onwuchekwa, a pastor and entrepreneur based in Georgia, has a different response.                 The son of Nigerian immigrants, he says he grew exhausted trying to defend his perspective on race while he was a pastor with the Southern Baptist Convention, an ultra-conservative, predominately White evangelical denomination.                 Onwuchekwa and the congregation he co-founded, the Cornerstone Church, eventually left the Southern Baptist Convention.                 Onwuchekwa says he no longer uses the term “evangelical” to describe himself.                 “It’s become an unhelpful label,” he says. “It’s almost become an exclusively political term. The point of a label is to reduce the time it takes to communicate. Whenever you use the term ‘evangelical’ in public discourse, it achieves the opposite because you have to say, ‘Oh, but wait, here’s what I mean.’ ’’               Some non-White evangelicals are ignored in a more subtle way. Their perspective is only sought on issues related to race, like Christian nationalism.                 Onwuchekwa says he was once participating in a panel discussion on theology at a large evangelical conference with another Black pastor. Both answered questions about race for 15 minutes. When the other panelists turned the conversation to other theological matters, no one had a question for either of them for the remaining 45 minutes.                 Sometimes your race or ethnicity is ignored; at other times, that’s all White people see.                 “It made me feel belittled, used and it made me feel like this isn’t the space for me,” says Onwuchekwa, author of “We Go On: Finding Purpose in All of Life’s Sorrows and Joys.”                 “There need to be spaces where the full intricacies of my humanity are more fully appreciated,” says Onwuchekwa, who is also a co-founder of the Crete Collective, which opens churches in communities of color.                 Some non-White evangelicals feel overlooked because church leaders don’t acknowledge their pain.                 Lim, the Korean-American pastor, says several Asian-American families joined his church following a 2021 tragedy that rocked Atlanta’s Asian community. A man entered several Atlanta-area spas and shot and killed eight people, including six Asian women. The shooting underscored a recent surge in hate crimes against Asians in the US.                 Some of the new members of Lim’s church had been congregants in large, White evangelical churches. They told him they left because of the spa shootings, he says.                 “It wasn’t addressed at the churches; it wasn’t even talked about,” Lim says. “These Asian Americans, who were key members of the church, felt invisible. Their hurt was overlooked. That was the final straw for them.”                 It may soon be impossible to ignore the importance of non-White evangelicals because of one reason: demographics.                 At first glance, the numbers don’t look good for Christians in America. Commentators have longed warned that Christianity in the US is dying.                 Church membership in the US has been declining and in 2020 fell below 50% for the first time. Church leaders fret that the American church is poised to follow the path of West European churches: soaring Gothic cathedrals with empty pews and shuttered church sanctuaries converted into nightclubs.                 The numbers look grim for White evangelicals as well. They are the oldest religious group in America, and their numbers are declining, Chen, the UC Berkeley professor, says.                 But for evangelicals, the migration of non-White immigrants to the US from Latin America and Asia could represent a more earthbound form of salvation.                 The US has more immigrants than any country. Many of them are evangelicals and they, along with their children, are bringing their religious fervor with them and planting churches.                 “For so long we’ve talked about Christianity or evangelicalism as a White phenomenon,” says Chen, who is also the executive director of the Asian Pacific American Religions Research Initiative.                 “We’re on the cusp of this demographic change and there’s evidence of it all over. But we don’t even see it because we’re so focused on this population that’s dying out.”                 No one is saying there will be a “great replacement” of White evangelicals by hordes of brown or Black migrants elbowing them out of the pews. White evangelicals will remain a potent political force in American politics.                 But there is a rich and vibrant world of non-White evangelicals in America whose stories remain “unearthed and untold.” Not every discussion of evangelicals should feature White faces.                 It’s time to bury the myth that White Americans have a monopoly on evangelical Christianity.

That’s also true of Harvard, where he teaches.","Feb 1, 2024",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"Editor’s Note: Khalil Gibran Muhammad is the Ford Foundation Professor of History, Race and Public Policy at Harvard University, an organizer of the Freedom to Learn movement and co-host of the Some of My Best Friends Are podcast. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. Black History Month, which gets underway this week, is a chance to give Americans the timely reminder that you can’t teach our history honestly without understanding Black struggle and triumph.                 Take race and racism out of the American story and very little about the country is comprehensible. The way we elect our presidents. The civil rights enshrined in the 14th Amendment that gives birthright citizenship to formerly excluded Asian immigrants and grants marriage equality to same-sex couples. The nation’s intergenerational wealth accumulated during 350 years of slavery and segregation. And the outsize cultural visibility of African American creative talent on the world stage.                 Because Black patriots have carried the flame of American democracy for everyone, and for centuries, Black people continue to be overrepresented in pro-democracy movements in the United States — the very movements that some people, particularly some top Republicans and leading figures on the right — seek so desperately to destroy in their zeal to pass voter suppression laws and their efforts to diminish freedom of speech and assembly rights.                 Nowhere are these attacks more evident right now than on college campuses. Many academics who teach about the history of race and racism in America, as I do, are being unjustifiably blamed for the rise in antisemitism on campus and falsely accused of creating racial divisions in the country. This has had the undesirable effect of putting us in the crosshairs of some of the most powerful people in the country, including Republican politicians, conservative activists and billionaire donors.             You can’t teach our history honestly without understanding Black struggle and triumph”             Khalil Gibran Muhammad                 Last week, at my alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, about 100 faculty rallied against what they decried as “anti-democratic” attacks on diversity, academic freedom and free speech. Faculty and staff at private universities across the country now face a similar plight, as do many teachers, librarians and academics at public colleges and universities who have been censored, harassed, physically threatened and fired for doing their jobs over the past year.                 As these dangerous assaults move to private universities, many academics are preparing for the worst. I count myself among them. Last year, for the first time in my 25-year career as an academic historian, my teaching was singled out by a powerful politician for causing hate.                 When GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx opened the December 5 congressional hearing about antisemitism on campus, she targeted a class taught by me as a “prime example” of a “race-based ideology” that has caused Harvard University to be “ground zero for antisemitism following October 7.” Foxx also cited two additional campus examples of “institutional antisemitism and hate” — a Global Health seminar on “Scientific Racism and Anti-Racism” and an initiative at the Harvard Divinity School on “Social and Racial Justice.”     Related articleOpinion: How to fight back against the ‘anti-woke’ movement             Then, on January 2, just hours after Claudine Gay announced her resignation under pressure Foxx promised to keep her congressional investigation into Harvard going because “postsecondary education,” the lawmaker wrote in a statement, has been hijacked by “political activists, woke faculty and partisan administrators.”                 If by “woke” Foxx means teaching the truth about American history, then I’m guilty as charged. There are few aspects of America’s past that haven’t been impacted by conscientious Black people and their resistance to systemic racism and illiberal democracy.                 The charge against me of promulgating a “race-based ideology” that fosters antisemitic views is especially preposterous since the coursework I teach on the history of anti-Jewish hatred and discrimination shows how Blacks and Jews have common enemies in neo-Nazis, replacement theorists and white domestic terrorists in the US. Members of these same groups frequently voice support for the current leader of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump, who has employed language that resembles the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler.                 Right-wing office holders targeting academics is the latest battlefront in a three-year-old political war on education that started with Trump’s ban on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) training in federal agencies, and then metastasized to numerous states criminalizing books and curricula on racism, gender discrimination and sexuality in public primary and secondary schools. Florida recently banned sociology from the core curriculum of the nation’s largest public university system, which serves 430,000 students, because “it has been hijacked by left-wing activists,” according to the state commissioner of education. Related articleOpinion: Three little letters that have Florida’s Ron DeSantis on the attack             Foxx and her political ilk want people to believe that what happens in my classroom and the classrooms of many other academics across the country is a part of a woke conspiracy meant to indoctrinate White Americans to hate themselves and their country. They want the public to believe that those of us who teach the truth about the history of race and racism are the real racists and antisemites in America, as these enemies of racial progress and democracy attempt to stand reality on its head.                 The situation at Harvard has been made more dire by the university’s failure to push back sufficiently against broader political attacks. In his first university statement as interim president, Alan Garber issued a broad affirmation of the university’s commitment to “free inquiry and expression, in a climate of inclusion and mutual respect.” But as the new semester got underway in January, there was no written statement by senior university officials assuring faculty who teach about racism or staff who hold various functions in the area of DEI that we are safe to do our jobs.                 Boilerplate assurances of academic freedom were commonplace before Gay became president and certainly were issued frequently before October 7, when antisemitism became weaponized against anyone teaching about racism or colonialism or who dared to speak about the history of Israel’s occupation of Gaza. And to be clear, I mean anyone — not just Black faculty. Just last week, on the first day of the spring semester, President Garber came under fire for appointing Derek J. Penslar, a prolific and well-respected scholar of Jewish history, to be the co-chair of Harvard’s reconstituted presidential task force combating antisemitism.                 Penslar is accused of being soft on antisemitism by Bill Ackman, the billionaire donor who says DEI is the “root cause” of Harvard’s alleged antisemitism and is a prominent supporter of Foxx’s congressional investigation. Another vocal critic of Penslar is the former Harvard president Lawrence Summers, who was also an outspoken opponent of Gay’s. He wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter) that Penslar’s views are disqualifying because he has invoked “the concept of settler colonialism in analyzing Israel” and has labeled it “an apartheid state.”                 The tragedy is that the academics most committed to learning from the past — who have dedicated their entire careers to staring into the abyss of oppression, in an effort to teach the concept of “Never Again” and how it applies to all people — are the ones least protected in this moment. Black faculty and staff feel especially vulnerable. As my friend who is a Black staffer at a Florida community college told me recently: “I am on the opposite end of the educational spectrum than Harvard, but our realities are the same in many respects.”                 Some Black colleagues on my campus have told me they are concerned about the risk to their careers and reputations from “teaching while Black” in this climate. Even some Black alumni are weighing whether it is safe to speak up about Gay’s swift demise as Harvard’s first Black woman president, especially in light of what was believed by many of us to be a political hit job for her commitment to DEI. “People are afraid,” one alum told me. “If it can happen to her, it can happen to any of us.”                 If the oldest, richest and most powerful American university won’t defend its own people and resist political efforts to interfere with unvarnished truth-telling and academic freedom, then shame on Harvard. As an academic institution, we should be leading the resistance to these assaults on higher education, not bowing to them.                 Silence is a failure of leadership in times like these. Harvard, with its motto “Veritas” — truth — owes it to all of us on the frontlines of these false attacks to defend us for teaching and practicing the very values it claims to uphold.                 And for those of us who believe that a rigorous, equitable, inclusive and above all else honest education is the only kind worth having in a multi-racial democracy, we must be courageous, stand together and continue teaching the truth.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Hordes of illegal immigrants invading the southern border. Gender ideology warping young minds in schools. Sinister globalists plotting in the shadows.                 These are the toxic themes espoused in right-wing media, delivered each day through a mix of internet pipelines and broadcasts to millions of homes across the country. They are also the perturbed views of a 32-year-old man who police say decapitated his father, a federal employee, and then uploaded a highly disturbing video to YouTube showcasing the grisly murder while spewing a toxic potpourri of conspiratorial grievances.                 It’s part of a larger trend of right-wing violence afflicting the country. Over the course of the last several years, America has witnessed a spate of such incidents: the Charlottesville car attack, the Charleston church shooting, the Buffalo supermarket shooting, the El Paso Walmart shooting, and, of course, the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, among others.                 “In recent years, violent and alarming actions by far-right extremists, from seditious plots to interfere with election results to white supremacist mass killing attacks, have thrust the issue of right-wing extremist violence into the headlines on a regular basis,” the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks such incidents, said in a November report. “In today’s America, such terrorism is not merely a threat, it’s a fact of life.”                  The ADL noted in its report that “right-wing extremist terror incidents in the U.S. have been increasing since the mid-2000s,” but stressed that “the past six years have seen their sharpest rise yet.”                 The timing coincides with Donald Trump’s arrival on the national political scene, seizing control of the right-wing media machine and refashioning it into his personal propaganda mouthpiece that pollutes the country’s information environment.                 Prior to Trump’s ascension, conspiracy-laden messages were largely confined to the seedy cesspools of the web like 4chan and Infowars, where fringe hosts such as Alex Jones ranted to marginalized audiences. But the media landscape has deteriorated considerably in recent years. Now, extremist commentary airs regularly on Fox News. It is dispersed on A.M. radios from coast to coast. It is commonplace on conservative news and commentary websites. And it proliferates on social media platforms, where right-wing extremists maintain a loud presence and boast millions of followers.                 “To tap into these ideas, you [once] had to be literally on mailing lists from extremist groups like the Klan,” Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director turned CNN law enforcement analyst, told me Wednesday. “By virtue of logistics, that limited the number of eyeballs consuming this stuff.”                 “Then you have the internet age dawn and outlets like Stormfront bring these views to more audiences. Now, take that times one thousand,” McCabe continued. “You don’t have to go to the fringes. You can just turn your cable news outlet to Fox News or Newsmax or OAN and you’re getting the same kind of content. The same ideas of the Great Replacement Theory. The same ideas of vilifying immigrants. It’s the same messages. It’s a little slicker and better produced. But these messages have the same corrosive effect on people.”                 Millions of people have been trained to distrust credible news organizations and only put their faith in the dishonest voices feeding them a diet of radical rhetoric. And while not everyone who hears such messages will resort to violence, the charged language can suck some people in and eventually lead to real-world action.                 “This act of violence represents the threat posed by mainstreaming hateful and dehumanizing rhetoric,” Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University told me when I asked about the views the suspect in the decapitation recited.                 “This shared belief that a ‘cabal of global elites’ run by Jews and the left are conspiring to steal white America from Christians allows for a tangled web of conspiracies to connect: anti-government extremists, white supremacists, fascists, and everyone in between, sometimes forging unlikely alliances,” Baumgartner added.“This, in turn, allows grievances like a border crisis or a global conflict to inspire a range of ideologically disparate extremists in the name of violence against the other.”                 Too often, however, the public — and journalists whose job it is to shine a bright light on it — turn a blind eye to the dangerous propaganda machine motivating these actors and operating in plain sight.                 Reporters, in particular, very often fail to connect the obvious dots between words and actions. They will note that trees have been cut down in the forest but shy away from pointing out those who are holding the chainsaws in their hands. Media reporting largely is viewed as niche; not vital. Rarely will you see a segment about the information crisis on the evening news or delivered prominently via other vessels of mainstream media. The symptoms of the cancer are discussed at length (election denialism, Trump’s firm grip on the Republican Party, etcetera), but rarely is the underlying disease confronted with the vigor it demands.                 “Top media outlets too often separate political coverage and reporters from incitement/violence/election denialism coverage,” Juliette Kayyem, the faculty chair of the Homeland Security and Security and Global Health Projects at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, told me via email.                 The media figures who peddle extremism to the public, Kayyem added, employ sly tactics to shield themselves from accountability when a perpetrator acts on their words. The language they use, she said, “winks at,” “nurtures,” and “flirts with violence,” but also offers them just enough “plausible deniability” when things go south.                 “The only way to defeat it,” Kayyem said, “is to call it out.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

This represents a 178% increase in complaints compared to a similar period the previous year, the organization said.                 The nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization said the US has experienced a “relentless” wave of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hate since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.                 Corey Saylor, CAIR research and advocacy director, said it’s crucial the public recognizes not only the rise in anti-Muslim, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian incidents happening across the country, but also the emotional impact these incidents have on local communities.                 “The numbers say one thing, but as someone who works on these cases, particularly in October, we were completely shut down with the incoming wave of complaints, intaking people and starting to try to help them out,” Saylor said.                 “I think that it’s always crucial to remember that Islamophobia, anti-Arab bias, anti Semitism, and racism does not contribute to ending the violence,” Saylor said.                 Though the organization has described the number of bias incidents as “staggering,” Saylor said he also recognizes that many more incidents likely go uncounted because people are afraid to speak out.                 “In many cases, Muslims are afraid to reach out to law enforcement, they often also just don’t know where to report it,” he said. “And then the other thing that we’ve found is that the community oftentimes is simply so desensitized, they think it’s normal … All of that is very unfortunate.”                 The three highest categories of complaints the organization said it received were employment discrimination, hate crimes and incidents, and education discrimination.                 Saylor called on American political leaders on both sides of the aisle to demand an end to bias and discrimination.                 “What we’re trying to help people understand is that what’s going on in the Middle East, impacts us here.

Sukru Genc, mayor of the Sariyer district where the church is located, told Turkish independent newspaper BirGün that the man was by the entrance to the church at the time of the attack, which saw two masked gunmen open fire during Sunday service.                 “During the attack, a citizen from Bayburt at the entrance, a Muslim citizen, lost his life,” said the mayor. Turkey’s interior minister Ali Yerlikaya identified the man as Tuncer Murat Cihan in a post on X.                 “According to the priest, he was constantly going to church and the priest knew this person and referred to him as ‘a good person,’” added Genc.                 The priest who was leading mass at the time said one of the attackers’ guns had jammed, according to Genc.                 “When the first gun went off, everyone threw themselves on the ground. After the second explosion, the gun jammed and they [the attackers] came out. It is unknown what would happen next, whether the attack would continue,’” Genc told BirGün.                 Genc said around 35 to 40 people were inside the church at the time, including the Polish Consul General in Istanbul, Witold Lesniak, who was there with his children.                 “Nothing happened to them because they were in the front, but their children and everyone at the service were seriously affected,” he said.                 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s office posted a video on X, showing part of his call with Lesniak.                 “I would be grateful if you would convey my condolences to the entire community,” Erdogan says in the video.

Iranian authorities allege Ghobadlou ran over the official during a protest in Robat Karim, Tehran province, in September 2022, according to rights group Amnesty International.                 He was sentenced to death by judge Abolqasem Salavati – who has been sanctioned by the United States for the notoriously harsh sentences he issued to activists, journalists and political prisoners, CNN previously reported.                 Ghobadlou received two death sentences – one for “corruption on Earth,” issued by a Revolutionary Court and upheld by the Supreme Court, and one for murder, issued by a criminal court in Tehran province, according to Amnesty.                 Mizan reported that the death sentence for “corruption on Earth” was suspended earlier this month until the intentional murder charge was investigated.                 Ghobadlou’s lawyer Amir Raesian said he was not notified about a ruling regarding his client, and called on Mizan to release more information on the execution.                 “If Mizan news agency is telling the truth, it should announce the number and date of issuance of this verdict,” Raesian said in a statement on X.     Related articleProtests erupt in Iran, one year after Mahsa Amini’s death             Amnesty has criticized the death sentences for following what it described as “grossly unfair sham trials, marred by torture-tainted ‘confessions’ and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite (Ghobadlou’s) mental disability.”                 Ghobadlou had been under the supervision of a psychiatric hospital for bipolar disorder since the age of 15, Amnesty said. International law and standards prohibit using the death penalty against people with mental disabilities, according to the rights group.                 Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of Norway-based Iranian human rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR), called Ghobadlou’s execution an “extrajudicial killing.”                 On X, formerly Twitter, he wrote that “the Islamic Republic’s leader Ali Khamenei and his Judiciary must be held accountable for this crime. This execution must be met with strong international condemnations!”                 At least eight protesters are known to have been executed in connection to nationwide demonstrations over the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022.                 Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in the custody of Iran’s morality police after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.                 Protests spread like wildfire in the following weeks – which Iranian authorities responded to with brute force, mass arrests and hasty sham trials, drawing sharp global condemnation and sanctions from the US.                 More than 300 people were killed in the months-long protests, including more than 40 children, the United Nations said. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) placed the number of dead at more than 500, including 70 children.

He is the author of “The Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             The Biden administration has gone to great lengths to prevent a larger regional war in the Middle East. Yet, already, there is a de facto regional conflict raging with all the possibilities for screw-ups and escalatory responses that are inherent in such a conflict. Like a frog in a slowly boiling pot of water, the region may wake up one day soon and realize it’s in the midst of an all-out war.                 The danger of growing conflict is rising and threatens to entangle the United States. That’s partly why US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting the Middle East this week: to try to stop the widening hostilities.                 Consider just the past few days: On Thursday, a US drone strike killed the leader of an Iranian-based militia in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have launched at least 118 attacks against US troops in Syria and Iraq since the October 7 attack by Hamas inside Israel.                 The strike in Baghdad was a calculated risk by the Biden administration, especially since there are growing calls in Iraq to expel some 2,500 US troops that remain in the country on a mission to counter ISIS. The Baghdad strike has amplified those calls to expel US troops, according to the leading Arabic-language newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat.                 In purported support of Hamas, the Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that controls much of Yemen, have launched 23 attacks at commercial vessels in the Red Sea since November 19 using a variety of missiles, drones and sea-based drones.                 The Red Sea approach to the Suez Canal is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, and some key shipping companies have suspended their operations in the area.                 On Wednesday, the US and a dozen other allied nations warned the Houthis that they must stop their attacks on commercial shipping or face unspecified consequences. That followed the sinking by the US three days earlier of three Houthi speedboats in the Red Sea to prevent them from hijacking a commercial vessel.                 On Tuesday, a leader of Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, was killed by a drone strike in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, adding to the growing tensions between Hezbollah and Israel. There have been near-daily tit-for-tat exchanges of fire between them along the Israel-Lebanon border since October 7. Al-Arouri was killed in an area of Beirut dominated by Hezbollah, which has vowed to avenge his death.     Opinion: Netanyahu’s reckoning comes after the war. That’s a dangerous timeline             On Monday, Israel launched air strikes in the Syrian capital, Damascus, hitting what it said were Syrian military targets. The Syrian regime was aided by Hezbollah fighters during the Syrian civil war, and it has publicly supported Hamas.                 Adding to all of this on Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for two suicide attacks at a memorial service for the key Iranian military leader General Qassim Suleimani that killed at least 84 people. ISIS is a Sunni jihadist group that regards the Shia clerics who run Iran as heretics. Attacks by Sunni jihadist groups inside Iran have been relatively rare, and this attack marks a significant escalation by ISIS against Iran. Iran’s leaders have promised to seek revenge against the terrorist group.                 The growing conflicts in the region are partly the result of advances in military technology over the past two decades and the growth of proxy warfare in the Middle East during the same time period. It’s easy to forget that before the 9/11 attacks, there were no armed drones capable of carrying out targeted strikes far from the base of the attacker. The use of armed drones by the US became a hallmark of the “war on terror,” and today, countries like Israel and groups like the Houthis have also adopted the tactic.                 Meanwhile, during the same time period, the Middle East saw a surge of proxy forces allied in some fashion with Iran. This phenomenon was precipitated partly by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The war in Iraq produced only one real winner, Iran, according to the official US Army history of the conflict. Iran today continues to support militias in Iraq, according to a 2023 report prepared for the British House of Commons.     Wave of attacks heightens fears of wider Middle East war             In Lebanon, Hezbollah has received hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran, and thousands of its fighters have trained in Iranian camps, according to the US State Department. In Syria, Iran also has considerable influence, and its own forces are based there. The Houthis in Yemen are armed and trained by Iran, while Hamas has also received arms from Iran.                 This all makes for a simmering mess, because while armed drones and proxy forces allow powers like the US, Israel and Iran to avoid all-out conventional wars, reliance on drones and proxies is also playing with fire as they move all these powers closer to all-out conflict. The history of warfare, after all, suggests that it is the most uncertain of human enterprises, and seemingly relatively unimportant events like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, which became a key trigger of World War I, can instigate broader conflicts.                 In Israel, there is now a growing lobby for a war with Hezbollah, a far better armed and more militarily proficient force than Hamas. The last time that Israel and Hezbollah fought a full-scale war was in 2006, and the conflict was something of a draw.                 In Lebanon, there is little appetite for another war as the 2006 conflict destroyed a good chunk of the country, which is reeling from its current economic and financial crises.                 But war may come anyway, given attitudes in Israel about the threat posed by Hezbollah and Hezbollah’s own increasingly strident responses to Israeli attacks.                 In Washington, DC, the national security establishment has for many years focused on the rising threat posed by China, and every administration since President Barack Obama’s has tried to lessen US involvement in the greater Middle East. Obama withdrew all US troops from Iraq in 2011, only to deploy American soldiers back to Iraq in 2014 to counter ISIS. President Donald Trump’s team signed a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban in 2020, and President Joe Biden withdrew all US troops from Afghanistan in 2021.                 Yet the United States keeps getting pulled back into the Middle East because of several factors, including its alliance with Israel, the central role that oil and gas play in the global economy and its longtime competition with Iran, none of which are going to change any time soon. The risk now is that a series of increasingly lethal attacks between Iranian proxy forces, and the US and its allies, including Israel, will embroil the region in a larger war.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

At least 84 people were killed and 284 injured in the blasts on Wednesday, state-run news agency IRNA reported, in what was the deadliest attack in Iran since its 1979 revolution.                 ISIS media wing Al-Furqan issued a statement on Thursday – more than 24 hours after the explosions – claiming two suicide bombers, who are brothers, had detonated their explosive vests as Shiite mourners gathered for the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Soleimani near his grave in his hometown of Kerman.                 The statement, titled “And Kill Them Wherever You Find Them,” named the two bombers and said they targeted a gathering of “polytheists” near the grave of their “dead leader” Soleimani.                 ISIS considers the Shia branch of Islam to be heretical and has targeted shrines and religious sites in Iran previously.                 The group offered no further proof and their account of the blasts differs from that given by Iranian media. The death toll provided by ISIS was also significantly higher than that reported by Iranian officials.                 Iran did not immediately comment on ISIS’ claim of responsibility. But Iran’s official state news agency IRNA, as well as its English-language state media outlet Press TV, both reported on the ISIS claim of responsibility.                 Both referred to the group by its Arabic name “Daesh”, with IRNA posting a screenshot of the terror group’s claim that has appeared on multiple ISIS forums.                 Press TV added in their reporting that in a statement posted on its affiliate Telegram channels, the Islamic State had claimed that two of its members had detonated explosive belts.                 Iran’s interior minister said the two blasts happened in short succession, with the second, deadlier blast coming as others rushed to help the wounded.                 Another state media outlet, IRINN, said the first explosion was caused by a bomb placed in a suitcase inside a car and appeared to have been detonated remotely rather than being caused by a suicide bomber.                 Videos showed large numbers of people running in the area after the explosions, bloodied bodies on the ground and ambulances driving through the packed crowds.                 Iran declared Thursday a day of mourning and President Ebhrahim Raisi canceled a scheduled trip to Turkey.                 Accusations flew in the time between the blasts and ISIS’ statement. Iran’s President Ebhrahim Raisi blamed Israel for the explosions and warned it would pay a “heavy price.” The Israeli military told CNN it had “no comment” on the matter.                 Prior to ISIS’ statement, analysts and a US official had speculated that the blast had the hallmarks of a terror attack.                 “It does look like a terrorist attack, the type of thing we’ve seen ISIS do in the past. And as far as we’re aware, that’s kind of I think our going assumption at the moment,” the official said.                 Soleimani, formerly one of Iran’s most powerful men, was killed by a US airstrike ordered by former President Donald Trump at Baghdad International Airport on January 3, 2020.                 Known as Iran’s “shadow commander,” he was head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, an elite unit that handles Iran’s overseas operations and was deemed to be a foreign terrorist organization by the US. He masterminded Iranian military operations in Iraq and Syria.     This is a developing story and will be updated. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Three Palestinian college students were shot in Vermont, and when a six-year-old was stabbed in Chicago, his mother couldn’t attend his funeral because she’d been stabbed, too.              In Georgia, a middle school teacher was arrested after he allegedly threatened to behead a 13-year-old Muslim student.                 But most incidents of Islamophobia don’t make headlines – or even go reported.                 This recent unprecedented surge of anti-Muslim bias prompted the White House to announce a national strategy to combat Islamophobia.                 Corey Saylor of The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) says his organization receives daily reports of Islamophobia, including incidents where people probably could have helped. In one case, they say, a woman was verbally harassed in a crowded grocery store without a single person coming to her aid.                 Saylor says that’s in stark contrast to a recent incident in the Fort Lauderdale airport, where a Muslim woman was harassed by a man who filmed her and threatened to “report” her to authorities. Two bystanders immediately sat down next to her. Others gathered around the victim. From across the room, a woman pulled out her phone and began recording the man, and then posted the video to TikTok.                 Saylor says this is an example of how when one person rushes in to help, others often follow. It’s easy to be paralyzed in an uncomfortable situation, but offering assistance - if it’s safe to do so - is like giving first aid, says Saylor. You might not know exactly what to do, but you do your best in the situation.                 The Maryland office of CAIR is offering bystander or “upstander” intervention training to teach people how they can help if they see someone being harassed.                 He stresses that if there’s any threat of violence, you need to leave immediately. However, if a person is being verbally harassed but doesn’t seem to be in physical danger, you could shout out from a safe distance. That distraction could be enough to disrupt the situation. You could also walk over to and ask the victim if they want you to call the police. If you’re able to record the occurrence with your phone, that can be useful for law enforcement. If you can’t do that, or you just don’t think of it at the time, immediately jot down everything you remember about the incident. This could be a huge help for the victim in the future.                 The focus of the training, according to Saylor, is to directly support the target of the hate bias while ignoring the perpetrator. That way, the person who’s targeted feels supported, and the oxygen is taken away from the perpetrator. Helping could be as simple as offering a reassuring smile or moving closer to the person being harassed.                 CAIR offers its “upstanders” training both in person and online. The courses are free. If you’re interested in booking one, contact info@cair.com             So what can you do to safely de-escalate a situation if you witness one? And what can Muslims do to keep themselves safe? CAIR has these suggestions:     WHAT BYSTANDERS OR “UPSTANDERS” CAN DO: HELP FOR PALESTINIAN, MUSLIM AND ARAB STUDENTS:              While no one wants young people to be fearful, Muslim organizations encourage students to exercise caution, especially right now. Those concerns led CAIR to put out a list of safety tips for Muslim students.                 Some of their suggestions include:     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

It is her grandmother’s memory that she invokes in seeking justice for victims of the 10/7 Hamas ...","Dec 11, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"Editor’s Note: Alexi Ashe Meyers is an attorney and advocate working in New York City. She has started a movement to bring attention to the sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.              Clara Haras was 17 years old, living in Nazi-occupied Tarnopol, Poland, when a German officer told her he’d save her family under the condition that she have sex with him. He proceeded to rape her. The Nazis then brutally executed her grandparents, mother, father, two little sisters and a brother. Somehow, she summoned the will to survive the next four years of terror. But for the next 60 years, she lived with the nightmare of unspeakable trauma. Yet she never abandoned her Jewish identity.                 Clara is my grandmother. My grandfather also survived the Holocaust, having spent four years in concentration camps. Because of his profession as a dentist, he was ordered to comb through the corpses to extract any gold teeth.                 Aspects of both my grandparents’ stories were shared often throughout my childhood in an effort to make certain that we would never forget. My grandparents recounted their stories at the dinner table, in my history class and at my Hebrew school. But it was only when my grandmother was on her deathbed that she shared that last vestige of her history — her rape by a Nazi. And although I lived with the painful truth of her rape, I was motivated by the collective voices that said, “Never again.”                 And then on October 7, never again happened. When Hamas attacked Israel, they used tactics that have been used to subjugate Jewish women and women worldwide for centuries, as they systematically carried out rape and sexual violence on Israeli women and girls. From the early 20th century pogroms to the Holocaust, rape was routinely used as a weapon of war against the Jewish people to torture, terrorize and suppress us.                 For more than two decades, I have fought to embolden victims of rape and empower those who have been sold into the commercial sex trade, sometimes by their own family members. I am often asked why I work to combat gender violence. My response is always the same: My grandparents are Holocaust survivors and their experiences had a deep impact on my life and left me with the responsibility to stand up against hate.                 I was raised with a deep understanding that injustice happens in a vacuum of silence. If people don’t speak up, evil operates with impunity. In the wake of October 7, I have chosen to speak up. But not everyone has.             If people don’t speak up, evil operates with impunity.             Alexi Ashe Meyers     Sheryl Sandberg: Something we can all agree on             There is overwhelming evidence that the October 7 attacks included horrific and widespread gender-based violence, including rape and sexual mutilation. It includes forensic examinations of numerous Israeli victims’ bodies mangled by acts of rape and sexual torture. It includes testimony by survivors of the attacks who witnessed Hamas terrorists raping and mutilating women.                 It includes the testimony of first responders who found Israeli women and girls, murdered, in conditions that made it clear they had been raped. A witness who gave video testimony spoke about seeing a woman being gang raped. It includes the video of a young Israeli woman, her pants bloodsoaked, being dragged by her hair by Hamas abductors, and footage of other women stripped of their clothing.              It includes testimony gathered by a civil commission headed by an international law expert documenting atrocities against women and children by Hamas on October 7. The mountain of evidence reveals the unimaginable viciousness of the Hamas terrorist attacks.               Last week marked two months since the attacks. And still, many feminist organizations — whose core mission is to fight for the right of every woman and girl, of every nationality, religion and community to live free from all forms of violence, including rape — remain astoundingly silent.     Opinion: This Hanukkah, we Jews could use your help             November 25th, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women came and went, and many remained silent. As I’ve continued to advocate for some of New York’s most vulnerable women and girls these past two months — and as I simultaneously speak out for the women and girls in Israel whose voices were taken from them on October 7 — my grandfather’s often-uttered phrase echoes in my ears: “There’s no question the Nazis were evil monsters, but I blame the bystanders.”                 My grandfather felt profoundly betrayed by the people who had a voice and did not use it. He understood the existential evil of the Nazis, but felt most betrayed by the neighbors, the shop keepers and the friends who stood silent. He never accepted that humanity was unwilling to help.                 Now Israeli families want to know if humanity will help them. Devastated by the horrors of October 7 and tormented by fears for the hostages, they need to hear our voices, to know where we stand.                 So I’ll say it loud and clear: Good people can disagree on the pathway to peace. Good people can disagree on many aspects of the conflict. But good people must use their voices to denounce certain unacceptable acts, and one of them is the use of mass rape as a weapon of war.                 There are innocent people still held captive by Hamas, and they include women and girls who in all likelihood have been subjected — and very likely are still being subjected — to sexual assault by Hamas. They also include men and boys who may have suffered the same horror. People of good conscience must demand to bring them home.                 There’s no question that what happened on October 7 evoked the Holocaust in its barbarity. It has also evoked Holocaust denial as people demand proof and evidence of the terror and sexual violence. Organizations whose mission is to combat gender-based violence should be among the loudest voices. We always stand with survivors, even in the most controversial cases where there is little proof other than a survivor’s word.                 Stand up for the victims and survivors of October 7. Stand up for those still in captivity. If you do not, your silence compounds the pain of the survivors, the erasure of the murdered, the anguish of their families. Your silence empowers the perpetrators. Each of us has a voice, however small.                 Call the White House, or your senator or your representative in Congress. Tell them the return of the hostages is a priority for you and a priority for humanity. Demand a full investigation into the sexual violence committed by Hamas terrorists. Never again should the world enable atrocities with silence. It is time to use your voice.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/11/us/adl-cair-hate-crimes-bias-incidents-reaj/index.html,"Reports of antisemitism, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias continue to surge across the US, new data shows",New data from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) reveal a dramatic spike in reported incidents of both antisemitism and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias.,"Dec 11, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Chelsea Bailey,International,"As the war between Israel and Hamas enters its third month, reports of hate crimes and bias incidents targeting Jews, Muslims and Arabs continue to surge across the United States.                 New data from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) reveal a dramatic spike in reported incidents of both antisemitism and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias.                 The ADL said it recorded 2,031 antisemitic incidents in the two months after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, including reports of physical assault, vandalism and “anti-Israel rallies that included classically antisemitic, anti-Zionist and/or terror-supportive rhetoric.”                 The organization said it received reports of 465 antisemitic incidents during the same two-month period in 2022.                 The new data, released Monday, reflects a more than 330% increase in reported incidents of antisemitism from the 2022 timeframe, the ADL said.                 “This is historic but can be directly linked back to the Israel-Hamas war as a majority of the incidents referenced the conflict in one form or another,” said Jake Hyman, a spokesperson for the ADL.                 CAIR said it has tracked a similarly troubling rise in requests for help and reports of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias. After recording an “unprecedented” spike in bias incidents during the first month of the war, the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group said 2,171 requests for help and reports of bias have been made to its national headquarters and chapters across the country since October 7.                 Those reports include incidents of hate crimes and hate speech, as well as workplace discrimination and incidents described as “violations of an individual’s right to free speech and expression,” the group said.                 In a statement shared with CNN Thursday, Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director at CAIR, said the surge in anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias has been “staggering.”                 “From Burlington to Chicago and elsewhere, innocent Americans are suffering the consequences of this wave of bigotry,” Saylor said. “Until our nation stops the violence overseas and rejects bigotry here at home, we fear that both Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism will continue to spin out of control.”                 Attorney General Merrick Garland will instruct law enforcement officials across the country to “remain vigilant in the face of risks of terrorism and hate-fueled violence” at this week’s National Violent Crime Reduction Summit in Indianapolis.                 Garland, who will address the summit Monday, plans to discuss how the Department of Justice is “closely monitoring” the impact of the Israel-Hamas war, and whether the conflict in the Middle East is inspiring extremists both at home and abroad, according to a copy of his prepared remarks.                 He will also note the spike in hate-fueled violence “comes at a time when law enforcement agencies and communities across the country have already been facing significant challenges regarding violent crime.”                 The increase in reported hate and bias motivated incidents has fostered a climate of fear for many Jewish, Muslim and Arab people living in America.                 Though the war is thousands of miles away, Jews across the country told CNN they are changing the way they celebrate Hanukkah this year. Some have decided to break with yearslong traditions and removed the menorah from their windows. Others have grown more defiant and have chosen to boldly declare their Jewish identity despite the rise in antisemitism.                 After three Palestinian college students were shot in Vermont last month, their relatives told CNN they thought the young men would be safer in the United States than in Israeli-occupied Ramallah, where they grew up as childhood friends.                 Now, loved ones are left wondering if one 20-year-old will ever be able to walk again and if the shooting will be investigated as a hate crime.                 As the Israel-Hamas war continues to escalate, extremism experts caution more needs to be done to confront and combat the surge in bigotry in the US.                 “We have seen in the past that when conflict erupts in the Middle East, incidents of bias-motivated hate, whether it be antisemitic incidents or anti-Muslim hate crimes, tend to surge here in the U.S.,” Hyman said. “It is a disturbing reminder that a war half-a-world away has a global impact.”     CNN’s Nicole Chavez, Alisha Ebrahimji, Rikki Klaus and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

FBI data released in October shows hate crimes in the US are the highest since ...","Dec 11, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"US-based advocacy groups are reporting a sustained spike in hate incidents against Jewish and Muslim individuals since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas. The Anti-Defamation League found that in the eight weeks since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, antisemitic incidents in the US increased 337%, according to data shared with CNN.                 The ADL cited 2,031 antisemitic incidents between October 7 and December 7, 1,411 of which were linked to the fighting in Israel and Gaza and 400 of which occurred on college and university campuses. By comparison, there were 465 incidents over the same time frame in 2022.                 The Council on American-Islamic Relations also reported an increase in Islamophobic incidents. Between October 7 and December 2, CAIR recorded a 2,171 reports of bias or requests for help — 172% more than the 2022 two-month average.                 Jews, Palestinians and Muslims in the US told CNN they’re experiencing a growing fear about bigotry and hatred in the wake of the Hamas attack.                 But the recent uptick from the war is part of a years-long rise in hate crimes in the US, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. FBI data released in October shows hate crimes in the US are the highest since collection began in 1991.                 The FBI collects and publishes hate crime data but reporting is voluntary and only about 80% of agencies submit data. Compliance changes from year to year. The data is also an undercount: fewer than half of hate crime victims report to police, according to the FBI’s National Crime Victimization Survey.                 FBI records show a rise in anti-Muslim incidents starting in 2015, with more bias-driven assaults against Muslims in 2016 than in 2001.                 Antisemitic crimes were on the rise long before Oct. 7. Between 2021 and 2022, the number of antisemitic hate crimes increased by 36% to a total of 1,124 – the highest ever recorded by the FBI.                 The ADL’s data, which captures bias incidents outside crimes, matches the pattern in the FBI numbers.                 CAIR Research Director Corey Saylor said the organization has been flooded with reports since October 7.                 “We are responding to incidents around the clock,” Saylor said. “The last time we saw something like this was in December 2015, with Trump’s Muslim ban [proposal].”                 As a candidate in late 2015, former President Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the US. Anti-Muslim events sparked in tandem with his statements on the campaign trail, CAIR said.                 Trump enacted his ban in January 2017, initially against a handful of Muslim countries, and expanded it to include some African countries. President Joe Biden reversed the ban in early 2021, but Trump (currently the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination) recently said he would reinstate and expand the restrictions, pointing to Hamas’ attack on Israel as vindication of his initial policy.                 CAIR’s record of anti-Muslim bias incidents trends differently than the FBI’s hate crime data, showing a consistent increase in reports until 2022, when reports dropped by 23%. In its annual report on the data, CAIR attributed the change to decreased volatility in domestic politics and increased federal targeting of white supremacist groups in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The comments came from Council on American-Islamic Relations Director Nihad Awad at a conference two weeks ago, when – according to a video posted on X, by DC-based Middle East Media Research Institute – he said, “I was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing down the shackles of their own land and walk free into their land, which they were not allowed to walk in.”                 “We condemn these shocking, Antisemitic statements in the strongest terms,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement shared with CNN.                 Bates echoed President Joe Biden in calling the October 7 attacks “abhorrent” and “unadulterated evil,” noting that October 7 “was the deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust.”                 “The atrocities of that day shock the conscience, which is why we can never forget the pain Hamas has caused for so many innocent people,” Bates said in a statement responding to Awad’s remarks.                 In a statement Thursday, Awad said that he condemned violence against all civilians and all forms of bigotry and claimed his comments were taken out of context.                 “What I actually said while discussing international law: Ukrainians, Palestinians and other occupied people have the right to defend themselves and escape occupation by just and legal means, but targeting civilians is never an acceptable means of doing so, which is why I have again and again condemned the violence against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7th,” he said.                 The White House has spoken forcefully against antisemitism and Islamophobia in the months since the October 7 attacks.                 “We can’t stand by and stand silent where this happens. We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. We must, also without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia,” Biden said in an Oval Office address in late October.              The Anti-Defamation League, which tracks antisemitic incidents, reported a “significant spike” in those incidents in the weeks after October 7, per preliminary data. And CAIR has reported a “clear increase in reports brought to a national level” in incidents of bias against Muslims in America.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             After police say he repeatedly taunted an Arab immigrant food cart worker in his Manhattan neighborhood, former Obama-era National Security Council official Stuart Seldowitz was arrested last week by the New York Police Department. He now faces hate crime and aggravated harassment charges.                 The videos of Seldowitz’s rants — which went viral — were despicable. The former government official made vile anti-Muslim comments while jeering at the Egyptian food cart worker about the Israel-Hamas war with remarks such as, “If we killed 4,000 Palestinian children, you know what? It wasn’t enough!”                 Seldowitz, who has pleaded not guilty, told a local New York paper that he regretted the incident, saying, “in the heat of the moment, I said things that probably I shouldn’t have said.” But the “heat of the moment” defense rings hollow given Seldowitz allegedly returned to the food cart several times over a two-week period to spew hate.                 Tragically, these types of disturbing incidents have skyrocketed since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 388% increase in anti-Jewish incidents in the weeks after the war began compared to the same period last year.                 Jewish Americans have seen their places of worship defaced alongside an alarming number of threats against and attacks on Jewish students on college campus. One deeply concerning incident took place at Cornell University when messages vowing to “shoot up” a Jewish dining hall and stab Jews on the campus were posted online. A student was arrested and accused of being behind the threats and has not entered a plea in his first court appearance.                 Just as concerning, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has documented an “appalling” rise in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the month following October 7. Overall, CAIR fielded a 216% increase in requests for help and reported bias incidents as compared to 2022.     Opinion: I’m a Jewish Columbia professor. I wouldn’t allow my children to go here now             Alarmingly, it appears one such horrific incident may have occurred on Saturday in Burlington, Vermont, when three Palestinian students were shot. Two are US citizens and the third is a legal resident. And two of them were wearing the traditional Arab scarf known as a keffiyeh, according to local police. The Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee noted in a press release that they were also speaking Arabic.                 Thankfully, the three students survived the shooting, but two of them were admitted to the intensive care unit and one “has sustained very critical and serious injuries,” according to the ADC. The story is still developing, and police say they are currently looking into the white male shooter’s motive.                 Tragically, however, 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume didn’t survive his stabbing by a man who allegedly targeted the boy for his Muslim faith. He was charged with murder and two counts of a hate crime, among other charges, and he has pleaded not guilty.                 The question is: What can each of us do to counter the hate and make it clear that we won’t allow bigotry to become normalized against any community? One of the best responses is what we saw in New York City after Seldowitz’s hate-filled rants got widespread attention: Elected officials and neighbors came together to stand with the 24-year-old Egyptian food cart worker, Mohamed Hussein, who was subjected to the rants.     Opinion: Being a Muslim American right now is like living on borrowed time             Even before Seldowitiz was charged, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said on social media: “This Islamophobic bigotry is absolutely reprehensible. No one in this city should be subjected to this venom.”                 But it was the response of people in the neighborhood — which deserves far more media attention — that was truly moving. As CBS New York reported, “what happened at the food cart has seemingly only brought people together.” One of the food cart workers, Bahaa Hassan, told CBS: “We have mostly Jewish customer in this building. [Two customers] made cake for us last night.”                 It wasn’t long before people from the neighborhood set up a table next to the food cart in an effort to encourage people to sit, eat and talk together. As Upper East Side resident Stephanie Merabet told CBS about the workers, “They’re really wonderful people and they care about the community that they’re in, and they certainly don’t deserve this.”                 These actions send a powerful message that we will not allow hate to go unchallenged. In this vein, my longtime friend Max Brooks — author of “World War Z,” “The Zombie Survival Guide” and more – asked me to join him in making a short video to counter hate against Jews, Arabs and Muslims. Unbeknownst to us at the time, we filmed this video last weekend in the very neighborhood where Seldowitz had been taunting the Arab food cart worker.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             Max and I have often been told that we look similar. There is good reason for that. We are both half-Italian and half-Semitic. In Max’s case, his Semitic half is Jewish — from his father, Mel Brooks — while my Semitic heritage comes from my late Palestinian father, Abdul. (And yes, Arabs and Jews are both Semites!)                 Each of us can — and must — play a role in countering hate. In a nation as populous as the United States, there will always be some amount of bigotry. It’s how we respond to the hate that matters.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Stuart Seldowitz, 64, pleaded not guilty Thursday to two counts of fourth-degree hate crime/stalking and one count of second-degree aggravated harassment, court records show.                 Seldowitz was released without bail, according to court records. CNN has reached out to his attorney, Scott Laurence Bookstein, for comment.                 Before his arrest was announced, Seldowitz confirmed to CNN in an email it is him in the videos, which were recorded by a vendor from inside a food cart on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and appear to be from different days.                 In the videos posted online this month, Seldowitz mocks Islam, taunts the man about his citizenship status, accuses him of supporting Hamas and references the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.                 “You support killing little children,” Seldowitz says to the vendor in one video. The vendor retorts, “You kill children, not me.”                 Seldowitz replies, “If we killed 4,000 Palestinian children, you know what? It wasn’t enough!”                 The videos come as the US is experiencing an “unprecedented” increase in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, according to the Council on American-Islamic relations.                 At the same time, the reports of antisemitic incidents across the country have also spiked, with FBI Director Christopher Wray saying last month the threat was reaching “historic levels” and the Anti-Defamation League reporting a 388% increase in reported incidents in the weeks following October 7, compared to the same period last year.                 Tensions over the ongoing war in Gaza have also been high in New York City in recent weeks as pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been taking place.                 In one of the videos posted online, Seldowitz tells the vendor, “We’re going to put big signs here saying this guy believes in Hamas.”                 In another video, Seldowitz asks the man whether he’s familiar with Egypt’s General Intelligence Service, better known as the Mukhabarat.                 “Mukhabarat in Egypt will get your parents,” Seldowitz says to the vendor. “Does your father like his fingernails? They’ll take them out one by one.”                 The former government official then holds up his phone, says, “Smile for me,” and laughs.                 Seldowitz also makes derogatory comments about the Prophet Mohammed, ridiculing Islam, which he appears to believe is the vendor’s religion.                 When asked via email for additional comment on the videos, Seldowitz said, “Happy to talk (Wednesday). What was absent from the video is what (the vendor) said before the video.”     ‘Every move I make, I second guess’: These Muslim and Arab Americans say the surge in hate has made them more vigilant             Seldowitz, 64, told the Daily Beast while he started up the conversation with the food vendor about current affairs, the video clips only show one side of the story. He told the outlet the vendor instigated the interaction by allegedly expressing his support for Hamas.                 The former official also told City & State, “I regret the whole thing happened and I’m sorry.” He added, “But you know, in the heat of the moment, I said things that probably I shouldn’t have said.”                 Seldowitz served as acting director for the National Security Council South Asia Directorate in the early 2000s, according to a since-removed profile page on lobbying group Gotham Government Relations’ website. According to his LinkedIn profile, Seldowitz served in the position from February 2009 to January 2011 during former President Barack Obama’s administration.                 “Gotham Government Relations has ended all affiliation with Stuart Seldowitz, an individual who hasn’t contributed to our work in years,” a statement on the New York City-based group’s website reads. “The video of his actions is vile, racist, and beneath the dignity of the standards we practice at our firm.”                 The managing director of an advocacy group representing street vendors across New York City told CNN on Tuesday the man who took the videos told him Seldowitz had been tormenting his food cart since November 8.                 Mohamed Attia, of the Street Vendor Project, said the vendor told him he did not instigate the conversation with Seldowitz.                 Attia said the Egyptian-born vendor, identified only by his first name, Mohamed, doesn’t speak English well and for that reason doesn’t engage in many conversations with his customers, let alone complicated and nuanced conversations about war.                 “Mohamed told me he doesn’t know how to respond to or know what to say to the guy and kept playing it safe by asking the guy to go away,” Attia told CNN.                 The advocacy group is “appalled by the racist Islamophobia” seen in the videos, they said in a statement, adding the vendors at the center of this incident “feared speaking out would put them at risk of displacement.”                 “No one should have to choose between harassment or displacement,” the statement posted on social media reads.                 New York City Council member Julie Menin reached out to the organization and reported the incidents to police, Attia said.                 “This is vile hate speech and harassment and truly abhorrent,” Menin tweeted Tuesday. “There is no place for hate in our community and city.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Nicole was walking through an affluent part of Alexandria, Virginia, with a friend last month, when a man approached her and began screaming.                 He railed about the hijab she wore, saying she looked Muslim, and made comments about Hamas raping Israeli women, she said. Her friend corroborated the account.                 It was just days after the start of the Israel-Hamas war and the encounter left Nicole feeling rattled, worried and frightened. So much so, that she asked CNN to use only her first name, out of fear for her family’s safety.                 “I haven’t stopped wearing hijab. I didn’t after 9/11 either,” she told CNN. “If I have one more person scream at me in public and certainly if someone were to threaten me, I think all bets are off.”                 Nicole, who is in her 40s, said she’s been wearing a hijab for more than half of her life. And while she’s grown used to stares and occasional comments about her headscarf, Nicole said she fears the growing anti-Muslim sentiment in the US could escalate into violence.                 The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said the US is experiencing an “unprecedented” increase in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the weeks since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.                 A week after the Hamas attack, a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy was stabbed to death outside of Chicago. His family’s landlord was charged in what police are calling a hate crime. He’s pleaded not guilty to charges including murder.                 A Muslim postal worker was attacked while wearing a hijab, and many Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian Americans leaders have told CNN they are experiencing post-9/11 levels Islamophobia – or worse. They’ve called on the Biden administration to do more to combat anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias.                 CNN recently asked Arabs, Muslims and Jews in America how they are facing the new reality of hate-motivated attacks against their communities. Nearly 800 people responded from across the country.                 Some, citing safety concerns, are changing how they go about their daily lives. Others have become defiant and more vocal about their identity. These are their stories.                 Although Abdallah Jwayyed has been a registered gun owner for years, he said his gun remained locked away in a safe – until now.                 As reports of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab attacks rose across the country, Jwayyed said he began carrying his concealed weapon when he goes out around his Cleveland, Ohio, home and when he’s shopping with his wife.                 He’s also removed the Palestinian flag hanging from his rear-view mirror and peeled the Allah bumper stickers off his car. He doesn’t want anyone to slash his tires or break his windows, he said.           CAIR received 1,283 requests for help and reports of bias in the month after Hamas attacked Israel. This marks a 216% percent increase in requests for help and reports of bias compared to the previous year, CAIR said.                 The Palestinian American is proud of his heritage, but he said he is doing everything he can to protect his wife and three children.                 “We’re tired of having to hide the fact that we’re Muslim or to hide the fact that we’re Palestinian,” Jwayyed said. “We have to hide who we are to live safely in America.”                 As a father, Jwayyed said he was crushed by the news that a 6-year-old boy was stabbed to death near Chicago. Officials have said Wadea Al-Fayoume was killed because he was Muslim.                 “I have a 7-year-old son, I have a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old daughter. Of course, that affects me,” Jwayyed said. “As a parent, it scares me.”                 Since the war, the 34-year-old said he has stopped taking his children on weekly excursions to the movies and local parks. Now, Jwayyed said they only go to school or to a relative’s house.                 “Baba, why don’t you take us out this week?” he said his children have asked.                 “I don’t want to tell them, ‘I fear for your life. It’s dangerous outside,’” Jwayyed said. “They don’t need to know that.”                 Jwayyed lives in the Little Arabia neighborhood, which is full of Middle Eastern stores and restaurants, but he said he is no longer shopping at stores that carry Israeli products, like his wife’s favorite brand of chips. Instead, he said, the family agreed to stop buying the snacks after the war started and now they only shop at an Arab grocery store.                 “Anything Israeli made, I will boycott it,” Jwayyed said. “And not just any Israeli company, any company that’s sympathizing with Israel will not get my money.”                 Since October 7, Mona said daily activities she used to enjoy have become anxiety-inducing. She’s now limiting her trips to the grocery store, taking her kids to the park and driving alone out of fear of being targeted for being a Muslim woman who wears a hijab and dresses modestly.                 “As a visibly Muslim woman, I’m fearful that I will be targeted,” she said. “Every move I make, I second guess it.”                 Mona, who is in her 30s, asked CNN not to use her last name out of fear for her family’s safety.                 She said she traces her fear and anxiety to the outset of the war and the spike in hate crimes against the Muslim community. As a health care worker near Houston, Texas, she said she was especially heartbroken over the October 28 fatal stabbing of Houston-area Muslim pediatrician Dr. Talat Jehan Khan.                 While local police have said they have not yet found evidence linking Khan’s death to a hate crime, Mona said the attack on Khan has left her shaken.                 “That also makes you think, ‘What, am I going to be next?’”                 She is avoiding social gatherings and meeting in public with her friends who are also visibly Muslim, so they are “not a target collectively.” She’s also not publicly showing empathy and solidarity toward Gaza, out of concern, she said, of being targeted or attacked.                 Instead, Mona now wears a necklace in the shape of the Palestinian territory underneath her clothing – close to her heart – in quiet solidarity.                 Yasmeen Abou-Sayed said she refuses to change the way she lives.                 Instead, since the war began, she said she’s become more civically engaged and has been calling out anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiment when she sees it.                 When her children’s school district posted a statement condemning antisemitism but neglected to mention Islamophobia, the 41-year-old from suburban Washington, D.C., and other parents reached out to the superintendent and the board of education.                 She asked us not to name the school district out of fear for the safety of her children, who have a different last name.                 “Being an afterthought … we had to, as parents, mobilize, reach out to the superintendent and the board of education and point out that their statement completely excluded the experiences of our Muslim and Arab students in the schools,” Abou-Sayed said.                 The next day, the superintendent posted an updated statement acknowledging that Islamophobia should also have been included, according to two statements reviewed by CNN.                 “I will always advocate for myself. I will always advocate for my kids,” Abou-Sayed said. “But it’s just kind of tiring that you always have to take those extra steps to be seen.”                 While anti-Muslim sentiment is nothing new in America, Abou-Sayed said her perspective has shifted since the war began. She said she will now talk to her sons about how some people might view them as they become Muslim men.                 “I never thought about preparing them a little bit more for how the world is going to treat them until now,” she said.                 “I do wear hijab,” she said. “I won’t change the way I live my life because the second you compromise your own values and principles, what are you living for?”                 Abou-Sayed said she remains proud and unwavering about her identity.                 “I will continue in my day-to-day activities, taking my kids to soccer and their clubs at school and doing the things that we do,” Abou-Sayed said. “We’re not going to change our lives because of this, but I will be more vigilant.”     This story has been updated with additional details.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

In response, Musk said: “You have said the actual truth.”                 The antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews want to bring undocumented minority populations into Western countries to reduce White majorities in those nations has been espoused by online hate groups and echoed by Robert Bowers, the convicted killer of 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. It was the deadliest attack against Jews in American history.                 Musk, in subsequent posts, said he does not believe hatred of White people extends “to all Jewish communities.” But he said the Anti-Defamation League “unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel. This is because they cannot, by their own tenets, criticize the minority groups who are their primary threat.”                 It’s unclear what Musk was referring to. Antisemitic incidents in the United States reached a record high in 2022, according to the ADL. Although the ADL said the increase in antisemitism isn’t because of a single group, the organization noted that antisemitic activity coordinated by White supremacist groups doubled last year, according to a March audit.                 Yet Musk suggested that the ADL promotes racism against White people.                 “I am deeply offended by ADL’s messaging and any other groups who push de facto anti-white racism or anti-Asian racism or racism of any kind,” he said. “I’m sick of it. Stop now,” Musk said of the ADL.                 X did not respond to requests for comment.                 In a post on X Thursday, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt accused Musk of pushing antisemitism.                 “At a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one’s influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories,” he wrote.”                 The ADL has been critical of X, particularly since Musk took control of the platform over a year ago. The ADL, the Center for Countering Digital Hate and similar organizations have reported surging hate speech on X over the past year – findings that Musk has criticized or denied.                 Musk in September threatened to sue the ADL for defamation, claiming that the organization’s reports have hurt advertising sales on X. In a statement last month, the ADL said: “Any allegation that ADL has somehow orchestrated a boycott of X or caused billions of dollars of losses to the company or is ‘pulling the strings’ for other advertisers is false.”                 Greenblatt said Musk’s statements about the group have amplified a campaign of antisemitic hate against the organization.                 In early October, after pausing its advertising campaign on X, the ADL said it would resume its ads on the platform “to bring our important message on fighting hate to X and its users.”                 The White House on Friday fired back at Musk’s post.                 “It is unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of Antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN. “We condemn this abhorrent promotion of Antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms, which runs against our core values as Americans.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/business/islamophobia-antisemitism-law-firms/index.html,Law firms accused of fueling Islamophobia and chilling free speech,A coalition of Muslim bar associations is accusing leading law firms of contributing to Islamophobia and a climate of fear in the legal community.,"Nov 15, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Matt Egan,International,"Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index              Latest Market News              Hot Stocks               A coalition of Muslim bar associations is accusing leading law firms of contributing to Islamophobia and a climate of fear in the legal community.                 In a letter to more than 100 of America’s top law firms, 13 national and regional bar associations called for the law firms to address Islamophobia and anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian hate.                 “Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and other legal professionals, including many attorneys of color and Jewish attorneys, are terrified to openly express sympathy for the plight of Palestinians for fear of retribution,” the letter said. “Many legal professionals of Palestinian or Arab heritage, or who identify as Muslim are even afraid to reveal their heritage or religious affiliation to their colleagues.”                 The members of the Muslim bar associations said they were “dismayed” that there was only a “brief reference” to Islamophobia in the recent letter that leading law firms sent warning elite universities to crack down on antisemitism on campus or else the schools and their students would face consequences. That November 1 letter said there is “no room for antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism or any other form of violence, hatred or bigotry on your campuses, in our workplaces or our communities.”                 The firms said they were concerned about: reports of antisemitism on campuses, “including rallies calling for the death of Jews and the elimination of the State of Israel.”                 The competing letters from law firms and Muslim bar associations underscores the complex situation facing employers as tensions and emotions remain high following last month’s Hamas terror attack on Israel and as the Hamas-Israel war continues.                 The new letter, sent Monday, went out to leading law firms including Davis Polk; Dechert; Kirkland & Ellis; Paul, Weiss; and Sullivan & Cromwell. Dechert declined CNN’s request for a comment.                 It notes that while some law firms issued statements of support for Israel after the October 7th attacks, in the weeks since some firms “refused to even acknowledge the killing of thousands of innocent Palestinians” even though employees have loved ones killed in Gaza.                 The letter, signed by the American Muslim Bar Association, the National Association of Muslim Lawyers and other groups, added that some law firms raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of Israel but did not raise money for humanitarian assistance for innocent Palestinians.                 The Muslim bar associations took issue with the November 1 letter to law school deans focusing primarily on antisemitism, arguing that contributes to an “environment of chilling speech advocating for Palestinian human rights.”                 “Taken together, the message being sent is that Israeli and Jewish lives matter,” the letter said, “but Palestinian, Arab and Muslim lives do not.”                 The Muslim bar associations called for law firms to take a series of steps, including issuing a new letter to law school deans addressing Islamophobia, acknowledging the “equal humanity” of Palestinians and Israelis, “equally condemn the killing of all civilians,” launch educational programs on Islamophobia and engage in pro bono opportunities aimed at fighting Islamophobia.                 The November 1 letter was spearheaded by Joe Shenker, senior chair of Sullivan & Cromwell.                 A representative for the New York-based law firm did not respond to a request for comment.                 “Everyone at our law firms is entitled to be treated with respect and be free of any conduct that targets their identity and is offensive, hostile, intimidating or inconsistent with their personal dignity and rights,” the letter said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/opinions/trump-ridiculous-terrorism-claim-bergen/index.html,Opinion: Trump’s ridiculous terrorism claim,Peter Bergen writes that Trump can’t simply write off any terrorism that was committed by far right-wing groups – including the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.,"Nov 14, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Peter Bergen,International,"Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America, a professor of practice at Arizona State University, and the host of the Audible podcast “In the Room” also on Apple and Spotify. He is the author of several books about terrorism, including most recently, “The Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World.”               On the campaign trail on Saturday, Donald Trump asserted that there was no terrorism in the US when he was the president, a claim that is false in myriad ways.                 It’s not the first time he has made the claim, which is also linked to Trump’s plans, should he become president again, to bring back a “Muslim ban” that blocked or made it very difficult to travel to the US from several Muslim-majority countries.                 Despite Trump’s much-vaunted travel ban, there was plenty of terrorism on his watch as the 45th president of the United States.     Opinion: Trump’s mental gaffes can’t be ignored             On October 31, 2017, Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek resident of the US who was inspired by ISIS, plowed a truck into a group of pedestrians in Manhattan, killing eight and wounding 11.                 Two years later, a member of the Saudi military shot and killed three American sailors and wounded eight others at the US Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida.                 During Trump’s presidency, there were also multiple lethal attacks by far-right terrorists, most notably on August 3, 2019, when a white nationalist went on a shooting rampage at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killing 23 people who he believed were Hispanic immigrants, according to the US Department of Justice.                 Also, the most lethal antisemitic attack ever in the United States took place on October 27, 2018, when a terrorist killed eleven people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.                 It seems, at least in Trump’s mind, that lethal acts of terrorism carried out by far-right terrorists don’t count as terrorism.                 Trump, of course, also helped to instigate one of the most spectacular acts of domestic terrorism in American history when he egged on a mob of thousands of his supporters to march on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, which triggered a riot that injured 114 Capitol Police officers, according to a bipartisan US Senate investigation. The riot also led to the deaths of five people.             As for Trump’s remedy to the terrorism problem, his plans to resurrect his so-called Muslim ban go beyond a simple repeat, as he said during a campaign stop in Iowa in July: “When I return to the office, the travel ban is coming back even bigger than before and much stronger than before. We don’t want people blowing up our shopping centers.”     Opinion: Republicans only care about the debt when a Democrat is president             When Trump was in office, the travel ban faced various legal challenges but was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court and included visitors to the US from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen as well as North Korea and Venezuela.                 The ban, of course, did nothing to impede the Uzbek terrorist who killed eight people in Manhattan or the Saudi terrorist who killed three sailors in Pensacola. Nor did it do anything to stop the domestic terrorists that are already here in the US.                 Terrorism did not disappear with Trump, and his proposed “solution,” were he to become president again – amping up the Muslim travel ban – likely won’t accomplish much of anything.                 If he were really serious about trying to reduce the number of victims of terrorism in the US, an excellent place to start would be restricting the ability to purchase the kinds of semi-automatic rifles that were used in the atrocities at the Walmart in El Paso, and the synagogue in Pittsburgh.                 The likelihood that Trump would do much of anything on gun control is, of course, remote. In April, speaking at the National Rifle Association annual meeting, Trump boasted, “I was proud to be the most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment president you’ve ever had in the White House,” adding, “This is not a gun problem, this is a mental health problem, this is a social problem, this is a cultural problem, this is a spiritual problem.”                 As for Trump having any kind of second thoughts about the mayhem he helped unleash during the January 6 riot, forget it. When he was asked at a CNN town hall last year, if he would pardon the rioters who were convicted of federal offenses, he said he was “inclined to pardon many of them.”                 At the same CNN town hall, Trump referred to January 6 as a “beautiful day.” Trump has made a lot of bizarro claims over the years, but this must surely rank among his wackiest.  My wife and I live in Washington, DC, and we were so unnerved by the violence unfolding at the Capitol that we picked up our kids early from school. This was not a beautiful day, but one of the grimmest the Republic has seen in a long time.             As Trump spends more time on the campaign trail, we will surely be seeing more factually challenged statements of this type.                 Fact-checking those statements will likely have zero impact on the MAGA faithful, but it may provide some small solace for those who labor in the fact-based world.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group said it has received 1,283 requests for help and reports of bias in the month since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The organization said in 2022 it received an average of 406 complaints in a 29-day period.                 The new data, CAIR said, reflects a 216% increase in requests for help and reported bias incidents compared to the previous year.                 Corey Saylor, director of research and advocacy at CAIR, said in a statement shared with CNN that the data represents the largest wave of Islamophobic and anti-Arab bias the organization has recorded since then-candidate Donald Trump called for a Muslim Ban in 2015.     American Arabs, Muslims and Jews: How has the Israel-Hamas war changed you?             “The Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian rhetoric that have been used to both justify violence against Palestinians in Gaza and silence supporters of Palestinian human rights here in America has contributed to this unprecedented surge in bigotry,” Saylor said in the statement.                 Throughout the year, CAIR records and monitors incidents of reported anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias from local chapters across the country.                 The new data reflects a sharp pivot from CAIR’s cautiously optimistic outlook earlier this year, when the organization published a report noting 2022 was the first time the US charted a decrease in anti-Muslim bias incidents since they began tracking such reports in the 1990s.                 “One year of declining cases is not a problem solved; it’s a glimmer of hope,” the organization said in the April report. “Securing future declines has never been more urgent.”                 But now, Saylor said, the violence in Israel and Gaza is contributing to an “unprecedented surge in bigotry” in the US. The organization again called on President Joe Biden to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.                 Saylor also urged Biden to do more to address anti-Muslim hate, noting that President George W. Bush visited a mosque in the days after 9/11 to address the rise in Islamophobia.                 All Americans including “political leaders, corporations, media outlets, civic organizations” have a role to play in combatting the increase in anti-Muslim rhetoric, Saylor said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/01/politics/white-house-announces-national-strategy-to-combat-islamophobia/index.html,White House announces national strategy to combat Islamophobia,The White House announced Tuesday the administration will develop a National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia in the United States.,"Nov 3, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Aileen Graef,International,"The White House announced Wednesday the administration will develop a National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia in the United States.                 “President Biden ran for office to restore the soul of our nation. He is unequivocal: There is no place for hate in America against anyone. Period,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in statement.                 The strategy, a joint effort led by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Security Council, aims to create a comprehensive and detailed plan to protect Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim “because of their race, national origin, ancestry, or any other reason, from discrimination, hate, bigotry, and violence,” said a White House official. The White House will be partnering with local communities on coming up with the strategy.                 “For too long, Muslims in America, and those perceived to be Muslim, such as Arabs and Sikhs, have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks and other discriminatory incidents,” Jean-Pierre said. “Moving forward, the President, Vice President, and our entire Administration will continue working to ensure every American has the freedom to live their lives in safety and without fear for how they pray, what they believe, and who they are.”     Democrats’ big tent includes most Jewish and Muslim Americans             The initiative comes as Israel’s war with Hamas – which has seen a rising number of civilian deaths in Gaza –- has increased fears of Islamophobia in the United States, and some of the nation’s largest Muslim American groups have denounced Biden’s approach to the conflict.                 The president on Wednesday traveled to Minnesota – which has a sizable and growing Muslim population – and promised to continue to press Israel to adhere to international laws protecting civilians in conflict and to push for increased aid to Gaza. But Biden’s standing has taken a deep hit among Muslim Americans in recent weeks with polls having shown a drop-off in support as anger swells over his handling of the Mideast crisis.                 Last week, a small group of Muslim American leaders had a private meeting with the president and called on Biden to show more empathy toward Palestinian lives after he cast doubt on civilian death figures in Gaza, two attendees told CNN.                 Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a key Muslim American ally of Biden who attended the meeting, reiterated the call Wednesday after hearing the president speak, telling CNN that forceful remarks from Biden on protecting civilians could “reduce the likelihood” of Israeli strikes like the one that destroyed part of the Jabalya refugee camp.                 The president expressed support for a humanitarian pause to allow for the release of hostages in Gaza Wednesday evening, in response to a protester calling for a ceasefire during a closed-door fundraiser.                 “I understand the emotion,” Biden said, while still stopping short of endorsing a ceasefire. “This is incredibly complicated for the Israelis. It’s incredibly complicated for the Muslim world as well.”                 New graf: Some groups, many of whom led door-to-door voting campaigns for Biden in 2020, have warned that the president’s approach could become a political liability as he seeks reelection. Earlier Wednesday, local Muslim leaders announced an effort to get Muslim American voters to withhold their support for Biden’s 2024 bid after he failed to endorse a ceasefire.     CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that local Muslim leaders are working in their personal capacity to withhold support from the president’s reelection bid.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.             Israel’s response to the October 7 Hamas terror attacks exposes a long-festering divide inside the preferred political party of the majority of Jewish and Muslim Americans.                 President Joe Biden self-describes as a Zionist and made a show of flying to Israel last month to embrace the controversial Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.                 Hillary Clinton, Democrats’ former standard bearer who took part in peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians as secretary of state under then-President Barack Obama, last week rejected the idea of a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons because she said it would be a “gift to Hamas,” allowing the terrorist group to rearm.                 But the party’s left flank is more and more loudly raising concerns about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York described the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a notably conservative, pro-Israel group, as “an extremist organization that destabilizes US democracy” on Tuesday after it criticized a Republican who voted with nine Democrats against a recent House resolution supporting Israel.     Democratic divisions over Israel spill into public view as conflict escalates             Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan – the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress and who, like Ocasio-Cortez, is a member of the so-called “Squad” of young, progressive lawmakers of color – issued a warning to Biden last month at a rally where she called for a ceasefire in Gaza.                 “President Biden, not all of America is with you on this one, and you need to wake up and understand that,” she said, before using the term “genocide” to describe civilian casualties caused by Israel’s military strikes.                 International law defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” But the term has an important historical meaning in the context of the Holocaust, which targeted Jews and other groups and makes it controversial to use with regard to Israel.                 Tlaib joined 15 other Democrats and one Republican in either opposing or voting “present” on the resolution expressing support for Israel, arguing it “rightly mourns the thousands of Israeli civilians killed and wounded in the horrific attacks but explicitly does not mourn the thousands of Palestinian civilians.”                 CNN’s MJ Lee and Kevin Liptak report Wednesday that Biden’s White House is agonizing over the civilian casualties and how to appropriately pressure Israel.     They write: The wide-scale casualties in Gaza are weighing heavily on senior US officials, who are ratcheting up the pressure – both in private and in public – on the Israelis to contain civilian deaths. That pressure has originated from the president on down: Concerns about the safety of Palestinian civilians was front and center yet again when Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone on Sunday.             Tlaib, meanwhile, faced possible censure by the House of Representatives Wednesday evening. A politically motivated resolution offered by Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was blocked, however, and a resolution put forward by a Democrat to censure Greene in retaliation was not scheduled Wednesday. Greene has herself repeatedly been accused of antisemitism.                 It’s hard to find good estimates about the exact number of Jewish and Muslim Americans. PRRI, an independent research organization, conducted what it called a Census of American Religion in 2020 and estimated that about 1% of Americans identify as Jewish and 1% identify as Muslim.                 Both populations tend to be more supportive of Democrats, who have prioritized appealing to non-Christian and non-White minorities.                 PRRI modeled maps with population estimates for each religion. While Jewish Americans are focused in particular areas, including Florida, the Northeast and the West Coast, Muslim Americans are more spread around the country, including in key swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, and in other states that could be competitive like Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, Minnesota and Florida.                 Those are important details headed into what will be a hotly contested presidential election that could again be decided by small margins in a few states.                 It’s hard to believe a shift could happen among Muslim voters toward Republicans. The GOP’s current front-runner, former President Donald Trump, after all, pushed hard for a ban on all Muslims entering the US during his first run for the White House. And Republicans for now appear to be more united behind Israel than Democrats. But a drop in voter turnout could have consequences.                 All three Muslim members of Congress are Democrats, and they all opposed the resolution supporting Israel. In addition to Tlaib, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota has been the subject of controversy with regard to her comments about Israel.                 Rep. Andre Carson, the Indiana Democrat, became angry in a recent interview with CNN’s Manu Raju, calling a Jewish colleague, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, a “punk” for his criticism of his peers who voted against the House resolution supporting Israel. Gottheimer said those who opposed the resolution were “despicable” and said they don’t speak for the party.                 Twenty-four members of the House identify as Jewish, according to the Congressional Research Service and all but two of them are Democrats, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.                 Simply having ties to a religion and a place is not necessarily predictive of a policy position, however. Back in 2016, as they fought for the Democratic presidential nomination, Clinton tangled with Bernie Sanders – the independent senator from Vermont who spent time on a kibbutz in his early years – over how to both support Israel and protect the human rights of Palestinians.                 The arguments they made at a debate in New York hosted by CNN resonate today. Clinton refused to admit that Israel’s reaction to terror attacks was disproportionate to the attacks, as Sanders said.                 “As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run – and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region, which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity,” Sanders said back then.                 That aligns with his current position, which is that Israel has a right to defend itself after horrific terror attacks, but there should also be a humanitarian pause of Israeli attacks on Gaza.

Families in this camp, now a built-up urban community, know exile all too well, denied the right to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. According to the United Nations, there are now some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of that 1948 generation of exiles.                  These refugees say it is a life sentence of separation from family, friends, and their homeland. And for those with loved ones still in Gaza, they say it is a sentence to the cruelest form of anguish.         UN says fuel shortages will halt Gaza aid operations by the end of Wednesday             Israel launched a massive air offensive on the enclave that is home to more than two million Palestinians after Hamas militants from Gaza killed 1,400 people in a brazen attack inside Israel on October 7, and kidnapped more than 200.                    Camp resident Abdel-Munim Dababsheh, 49, says his family moved to Jordan after the 1967 war, when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza from Egypt. He says he left behind most of his family.                     He has lost several family members in successive Israeli wars in Gaza, he says. His mother was killed in 2009 and his sister in 2012, and his aunt and oldest daughter died in the latest round of Israeli airstrikes. “At any given moment, I could get a phone call telling me that my sister and her children have also been killed.        At least 2,789 Palestinian civilians were killed in Gaza in the past 15 years, according to the United Nations, often in operations Israel says were launched to target Hamas and other militant groups.                   The overall death toll in Gaza from the current conflict is now at more than 5,000, according to Palestinian health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave, just over two weeks since Israel launched its relentless air campaign.                     Despite the rising civilian death toll and the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation, Israel has vowed to intensify its aerial bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, and expand it to a multi-pronged operation in the coming days, as it says it seeks to wipe out Hamas, which has been designated by Israel, the European Union and the US as a terrorist organization.                    And with Israel’s thousands of punishing strikes, the fear of history repeating itself – of another Nakba – is being felt across the region.                    While Israel has not said it aims to evict Gazans to Egypt or elsewhere, fears of such prospects arose after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) asked Gazans to evacuate the strip’s north and move southwards, as their military operation continued, as well as after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was in talks with Egypt and Israel to establish a humanitarian corridor in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula for Americans and other civilians fleeing Gaza.                    On Sunday, Blinken said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Israel has “absolutely no intent” to run Gaza.                    But the prospect of hundreds of thousands more Palestinians being forcibly displaced to neighboring countries, or even further afield, is being condemned across the Arab world.                  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said last week that a transfer of Palestinians from Gaza would likely be followed by a similar “expulsion of Palestinians from the West Bank to Jordan.” Jordan’s foreign minister later said such a move would be considered a declaration of “war.”                   Commentators on Arab media outlets have warned that Israel may be planning to de-populate the Gaza Strip of Palestinians and even re-occupy it.                    But some Palestinians would rather die than be made refugees once again.                    “Of course, no one wants to go to Egypt. It’s impossible. My relatives refuse it, I refuse it. This is displacement. Gaza is their home. They will stay there even if it means being wiped out by an airstrike,” Dababsheh says of his relatives.                     Palestinians, he says, won’t accept being displaced this time. “The new generation will not allow it,” he says. “They put their foot down.”                     Of Gaza’s more than 2 million people, 1.7 million are refugees, according to UNRWA.                      “The Israelis were always adamant about no return of refugees, and that’s why the Palestinians cling to… the right of return,” Jordanian Senator Mustafa Hamarneh says, adding that 75 years later, the Arab world has still not recovered from the loss of the Palestinian homeland.                    “I don’t think the West realizes the depth of the collective shame we feel as a result of 1948 and the sense of injustice that has been inflicted upon us that we need to correct this. There is a very deep sense of shame, that what happened to us in 1948 shouldn’t have happened,” Hamarneh says. “Any new mass eviction of Palestinian refugees, for us, is a repeat of 1948.”                     Israeli officials have said they have “no interest” in reoccupying Gaza. Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops from the territory and pulled out Jewish settlers in 2005.                   The struggle of the Palestinians is felt especially keenly in Jordan, where more than half of the population is either Palestinian or of Palestinian descent – including more than two million Palestinian refugees.        Biden snubbed by Middle East allies as Arab world seethes over Gaza hospital blast              But that passion for the Palestinian cause resonates across the Arab world that is home to more than 450 million people.                     In a fiery exchange with CNN’s Clarissa Ward at the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza that went viral on social media last week, an Egyptian activist shouted that despite attempts to “divide” Arabs, “we stand with the Palestinians, and we stand with Arabs.”                    The activist, Rahma Zein, was one of many Arabs around the region impassioned by the war, bloody images from which have made their way to almost every Arab news channel and social media platform.                    For more than two weeks now, protests in solidarity with the Palestinians have erupted in countries including Lebanon, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Iran. Hundreds of thousands have also taken to the streets of several European capitals and US cities, all calling for an end to Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza strip, and to the 17-year blockade of the territory.                     Young people from across the Arab world have chanted the very same rallying cries their parents and grandparents chanted before them. This is a multi-generational cause which, more than 75 years since the dispossession of the Palestinians, has not diminished in salience in the region.                    “For much of the Arab world, the question of Palestine represents the last colonized Arab people trying to gain their freedom,” said H.A. Hellyer, an international security studies expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute in London.                     While Arab states have tended to focus on problems closer to home in recent years, the latest war “has driven the Palestine question back onto the agenda,” he said.                     For many protesters, the demonstrations are not an expression of support for Hamas, nor an expression of indifference to the killing of Israeli civilians. Many protesters say they believe this crisis began long before the October 7 attacks, citing what they say is decades-long Israeli oppression of the Palestinians.                    In the Iraqi capital Baghdad, which saw hundreds of protesters take to the streets over the weekend, 45-year-old Ahmed El-Saied said that in recent years Western governments compelled Arab states and their populations to forget the Palestinian issue, especially as Arabs grappled with “internal and sectarian conflicts.”                    In Egypt, where mass protests were allowed Friday for the first time in a decade, Alya, who took part in the protest, said that the recent wave of Arab normalization deals with Israel brought on a sense of “defeatism.”                     “What we saw after October 7, however, was a shocking reminder to ourselves and the world that actually, this entire situation hasn’t been normalized,” said Alya, who only gave her first name due to fear of reprisal from the authorities.                      Analysts say Arab fears of another displacement of Palestinians are particularly heightened due to inflammatory rhetoric that has come from some members of Israel’s right-wing government in the past.                    Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich in 2017, as a member of parliament, wrote in an essay that emigration of Palestinians should be encouraged and incentivized, adding that the notion that emigration is cruel is “absurd.” The process, he argued, should not be “a cruel expulsion” but be done in a manner that is “planned, willing, and based on a desire for a better life.”                     More recently, he caused an outcry in March after calling for the Palestinian village of Huwara to be “erased” following the murder of two Israeli settlers in the town in a Palestinian attack, which led to revenge rampages by Israeli settlers that one of Israel’s top military generals later called a “pogrom.”               Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was convicted of anti-Arab racism by an Israeli court decades before joining the government and was once a follower of Meir Kahane, a Jewish fanatic who openly called for the expulsion of Palestinians. Ben Gvir’s wife, Ayala Nimrodi, has been cited as saying she wishes to “get rid of” the Palestinians.    Queen Rania of Jordan accuses West of 'glaring double standard' as the death toll rises in besieged Gaza             When asked about the rhetoric of his right-wing coalition partners, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it is his hands that are “on the wheel.”                   Hellyer said that this kind of rhetoric has given Arabs good reason to fear that the expulsion of Palestinians may indeed be on the table.                     “I don’t think it’s unusual (that) many in the Arab world would take them seriously at their word, especially considering the reality that in every previous situation where Palestinians left Palestinian territory, they were never allowed to go back,” Hellyer said.                    Hanya Sabawi, a Palestinian who left Gaza as an infant but whose family remain in the enclave, told CNN she doesn’t know whether her family will have homes to go back to.                     “And the biggest fear of course, is that they’re going to be evacuated and turned into refugees. This is what everyone is now openly talking about, as if they didn’t matter,” she said. “They don’t want to move. They would rather die in Gaza than move.”         CNN’s Claudia Otto and Aqeel Najim contributed to this report.

Israel’s war on Hamas followed the militant group’s surprise attack on Israel on October 7, when terrorists brutally killed 1,400 people in Israel, including civilians and military personnel, and abducted over 200 others, according to the Israel Defense Forces.                  What’s happening in the Middle East has had a ripple effect on major cities like New York: Advocates and community leaders say there have been a slew of hate-inspired incidents targeting Jews, Palestinians, Muslims and other groups in the wake of the initial attacks. In one case, a victim was allegedly targeted just because they were perceived to be a member of one of these groups.      Opinion: Being a Muslim American right now is like living on borrowed time             New York City is home to the largest Jewish population outside of Israel and has one of the country’s largest Muslim populations. In 2001, following the 9/11 terror attacks, anti-Muslim motivated crimes became the second highest reported among religious-bias incidents, according to FBI data. Anti-Jewish religion incidents were the highest.      'Anxiety and fear are high:' US Palestinians, Muslims fear a return to post-9/11 Islamophobia A recent joint bulletin from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center noted “the FBI has seen an increase in reports of threats against faith communities, particularly Jewish and Muslim communities.”                  The Anti-Defamation League recorded more than 1,200 antisemitic incidents in the US through May 2023 – after reaching a record high in 2022 – and said it’s already seeing an uptick in antisemitic images and rhetoric in the wake of Hamas’ attack in Israel.                   Nationally, the ADL has seen a 54% increase over the same time last year, according to Scott Richman, the ADL’s regional director for New York and New Jersey. From October 7 to October 19, there have been 168 antisemitic incidents across the country, he said.                  On October 11 in Brooklyn’s Bay Ridge neighborhood, which is home to a large Palestinian community, a group of men – some of whom were waving an Israeli flag – attacked three men on the street after asking them if they were Palestinian, yelling, “F**k Palestine, F**k Islam,” according to a criminal complaint.                  One of the victims required medical attention after the attack, the complaint said. Two of the attackers have been charged with assault and menacing as a hate crime; four others remain at large, according to the complaint.                  That same day, a 19-year-old attacked a 24-year-old Columbia University student who was putting up posters with information about Israeli casualties, according to the criminal complaint and local news reporting. The 19-year-old ripped down the posters and shouted profanities at the victim before she struck them with a broomstick. She was charged with assault as a hate crime, and other charges, the complaint states.                  On October 14, a 29-year-old woman was punched in the face in the Grand Central subway station in Midtown Manhattan. The victim asked her attacker why he hit her, and he responded, because “you (are) Jewish,” according to police. A 28-year-old man was arrested this week and charged with a hate crime and aggravated assault.      FBI sees increase in reported threats in wake of attacks in Israel             Outside of New York, near Chicago, a 6-year-old boy was stabbed to death and his mother brutally injured in Plainfield Township, Illinois, after being “targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,” the sheriff’s office said. The 71-year-old suspect, who was their landlord, has been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other charges.                  But while the numbers of reported incidents tick up, advocates say there are scores of others that never reach law enforcement.                  “Who are you going to tell when somebody comes up to you and screams, ‘Free Palestine,’ at you?” said Richman, of the ADL. “Or there’s a swastika that’s been painted at your school? All kinds of incidents have been reported to us.”                  Richman said his office is struggling to keep up with the “huge” uptick.                   And he says he believes the number of incidents, both locally and nationally, will increase if Israeli ground troops enter Gaza.      Debate over the Israel-Gaza war has raised tensions -- and the stakes -- on college campuses             “We know from experience that when there is a flare up in the Israel-Palestine, Israel-Hamas conflict, we see Jews are targeted in this country, in other countries, essentially being blamed for the actions of the Israeli government or the Israeli military,” Richman said. “Nobody knows where anybody stands but people make assumptions because they are Jewish and then want to take out their anger on the Jewish community.”                  Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Chicago office, said his office typically sees four to six complaints a week from people who say they’ve been victimized or bullied. Since the start of the war just over two weeks ago, they have received 86 complaints.                  “My phone has been ringing off the hook,” said Rehab, who added he believes the current situation is much worse now than it was after 9/11. Not only are people scared, Rehab says, but now, no one seems to want to hear from Muslim Americans.      Gazans forced to drink dirty, salty water as the fuel needed to run water systems runs out             “Palestinians are essentially dehumanized and there has been a conclusion that they deserve what’s coming to them because of what’s happened in Israel,” said Rehab. “There isn’t much appetite for the nuance that’s needed to have the discussion of the value of human life and of a civilian life.”                  Rehab – who worked at a large accounting firm in Chicago when 9/11 happened and remembers his family and friends becoming victims of hate crimes in the aftermath of the attacks – said bias incident victims often don’t report the crime because of a combination of reasons, including a sense of futility.                  “There’s a lot of ‘toughen up,’ especially in our culture,” Rehab said. “There’s also a sense of, ‘I don’t want to appear weak’ or a sense of hopelessness that nothing will be done or can be done about it. Or there’s a sense of bureaucracy. ‘We’ve done this before,’ and it just fizzles into bureaucracy.”                  The rising tensions of recent weeks have reminded other groups, too, of the atmosphere that followed 9/11.                  Last week, a 19-year-old Sikh man who was wearing a mask attached to his turban was riding a bus when an assailant shouted, “We don’t wear that in this country and take that mask off,” according to New York police. The assailant then punched the teen several times and even tried to remove his turban, police said.                  “He just feels very unsafe. He’s constantly looking behind his back,” said Japneet Singh, a community activist who spoke with the victim. The teen had arrived in the US 10 months ago in search of what he called the American dream, Singh said. Now, he’s “just, overall, disappointed.”                  Sikh men grow long beards and wear turbans as a commitment to their faith, and many Americans mistake them for Muslims. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the Sikh Coalition advocacy group documented more than 300 cases of violence and discrimination.                  Singh has had his own experiences with discrimination. A week ago, he was leaving Gracie Mansion after a meeting with Mayor Eric Adams when a group of teens saw him wearing his turban and shouted, “Hamas.”                  “My biggest concern was the hate part of it and how it was going to impact us here at home. Literally within a week – less than a week – we started seeing all the chaos,” Singh said. “It’s been a repeat of post 9/11, the sentiments of Islamophobia and rhetoric.”                  There have been 51 hate crime incidents in New York since October 9, NYPD officials said at a Tuesday news conference. Most occurred during chance encounters, according to Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny, who added that hate crime numbers for the year had been down 22%, but after the war, are only down 13%.                  “Hate crime is still down but since the incident in Gaza, there has been an uptick,” Kenny said.      When asked Monday about concerns about a potential rise in antisemitism due to the current conflict, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN, “We have not seen any credible threats.”                  “But, look, Muslim and those perceived to be Muslim have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks,” Jean-Pierre continued. “And certainly, President Biden understands that many of our Muslim, Arab Americans and Palestinian American loved ones and neighbors are worried about the hate being directed at their communities.”        CNN’s Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Beydoun on the Arab and Muslim communities in the US.","Oct 22, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,CNN,International,"Editor’s Note: Khaled A. Beydoun is a law professor at the Arizona State University Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law. He is the author of many books, including “American Islamophobia: Understanding the Roots and Rise of Fear.” You can follow him at his socials at @khaledbeydoun. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.              “This is worse than after the Muslim Ban, than after 9/11,” uttered Abed Ayoub, a lawyer and childhood friend, four blocks away from the White House and two decades apart from the day that changed everything.                 In between the prevailing custom of doom-scrolling and delivering bad news, Abed looked up with a stare that said everything. I knew that look well.                 Like him, I’m an Arab, Muslim and American — an amalgam of identities that conjures up “pariah” in the world we live in. But now, it means something different. At this moment, when the horror of mass death unfolds in Gaza and on screens we hold in our palms, our identity spells absurdity.                 We see ourselves in the people of Gaza. The accosted people there share our names, our faith, our culture and our customs. We have friends in that 140-square-mile open-air prison turned into hell on earth, including journalists who were sheltering at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital at the time of the deadly blast on Wednesday.                 But what we continue to see on our screens is still half a world away. On the other side of our terrestrial reality and this virtual insanity.                 Until this past week.                 “A Palestinian boy was killed in Illinois,” shared Abed. This sequence of foreign-to-domestic murder was a familiar one. Being American, like 6-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume was, does not protect us from the stigma of being Palestinian or Arab, Muslim and from the “Middle East.” Rather, these latter identities keep the security blanket of Americanness away from us, rendering us foreign and, during times of crisis, “terrorists.”     Palestinian-American boy fatally stabbed near Chicago had celebrated his 6th birthday just 8 days earlier             Wadea was stabbed 26 times last Saturday with a military-style knife by his family’s landlord, a 71-year-old man who’s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes. The attacker also stabbed Wadea’s mother more than a dozen times. She lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?                 What does it mean for a mother who escaped war for the safety of an American suburb? What does it mean for Abed and I: an executive director of a civil rights organization and a law professor, standing at the crosshairs of American power and an Arab identity conflated with terrorism? What does “living” mean for millions of Arabs and Muslimswho call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?                 It feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.                 Calling it “Islamophobia” would be a severe understatement. This existential ballad of being Arab or Muslim in America is far more onerous, far more absurd. It feels like an existence that has no exit. A play where our daily routine is waking up to the news of war, the stark images and videos of slain children, rolling timelines of shattered villages and the roaring demands “to condemn Hamas.” While this plot sounds a lot like novels from Jean Paul Sartre or Albert Camus, this is not fiction.                 This is our absurd reality.                 An absurd reality where we, in America, can only post on virtual timelines where the footsteps of suspicion stomp out our voices and censor our speech.                 Our names and nationalities, faces and faith brand us with the stain of collective guilt for crimes that we did not commit. Moments like this — like the aftermath of 9/11 or the reckoning after former President Donald Trump’s Muslim Ban in 2017 — moved many to conceal their ethnicity or cover their faith, particularly women who removed their hijabs or young children who hid behind aliases. Hate crimes statistics skyrocketed after 9/11, and reached near proportions in the wake of the Muslim Ban. Wadea’s death foreshadows that these figures may spike again, and descend on the heads of Arab and Muslim Americans shadowed by suspicion.     Opinion: Many Palestinians in Gaza hate Hamas. My father certainly did             But we cannot shed our bodies. These are the corporal vehicles that connect us to the victims cast as villains in Gaza. And the symbols that tie us to distant places where “wars on terror” were wrought yesterday and are certain to wreck more lives tomorrow.                 “Muslims are only newsworthy when villains, never victims.” I wrote those words, for the first time, as a law student weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks. I was much younger then, unprepared for what the world would come to be.                 But I knew then that it would never be the same.                 I typed those very eight words 20 years later in my book, “The New Crusades: Islamophobia and the Global War on Muslims.” In between the wide-eyed optimism of a young law student and the sobered worldview of an aging law professor, 9/11 and today’s war serve as bookends for morbid middle passages for Muslims in America and around the globe – as evidenced by the genocidal campaigns in China, persecution in India, hijab and abaya bans in France, and far more. The law and language of Islamophobia have been exported transnationally by an American “war on terror” that was first enforced on the home front, upon the heads of Arabs and Muslims like me whose citizenship was cast aside.                 Being American was no protection. Not then and definitely not now.                 The barrage of cold stares and commands to condemn terrorism, assignment of collective guilt and characterization of our dead children as “collateral damage,” not only strips us from the substance of citizenship, it renders us inhuman. “People don’t have ideas,” wrote Carl Jung, “Ideas have people.”                 And the idea that conflates our skin with terrorism not only grips the imagination of people, but sinks into the very marrow of American gates of power. We must exist, whatever that even means anymore, within the very lines that divide our identities and sever us from normalcy.                 While I am in Washington and not Chicago, I can feel every one of those 26 stabs that plunged into little Wadea’s body.

Their description of the situation is grim. He said they’ve told him they have no food, electricity, water or fuel.                   “When I spoke to them … they were basically saying, ‘We think this is it, we will not survive this one,’” he said. “You can only imagine what that feels like for Palestinian Americans who are getting these stories from their families right now.”                  Herzallah said his concerns for his family thousands of miles away have also been compounded by a growing fear for the safety of his wife and children here in the US, as reports of attacks against people perceived to be Muslim or Palestinian surface across the country.                  On Monday, family and faith leaders held a funeral for Wadea Al Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy who was stabbed to death in his Chicago-area apartment Saturday in what the police say is an Islamophobic hate crime. Outside of Al Fayoume’s funeral at the Mosque Foundation in Bridgeview, Illinois, grief was tinged with anger.      Palestinian-American boy fatally stabbed near Chicago had celebrated his 6th birthday just 8 days earlier             Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations Chicago chapter, said he views the attack against Al Fayoume and his mother, who is still hospitalized in serious condition, as an attack on all Muslims.                   “It is our worst nightmare come true. It is something we tried to warn against, creating an atmosphere of dehumanization that puts our community at risk, creates sitting ducks,” he said.                  “When this individual said, ‘You Muslims must die,’ this was a message not to the boy and the mother. This was to all of us. We were all stabbed that day.”                 Leaders from Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian American groups told CNN in the days since Hamas’ surprise attack they’ve seen an increase in attacks reported against their communities, including vandalism, bullying at school and in the workplace, and threatening phone calls.                   Linda Sarsour, a civil rights activist who is Palestinian-American, told CNN she has family in the West Bank, but she is even more worried about her community’s safety in the US.                 “One of the things that’s always the saddest for me is when people start giving each other advice about not going out alone,” Sarsour said, adding people in her community are telling each other to be on alert and aware of their surroundings.                   “People are mourning, people are scared … We are experiencing a lot of anguish, a lot of fear, and a lack of safety.”      Diplomatic aid efforts ramp up for 'strangled' Gaza as regional conflict fears grow             In New York City, police have asked for the public’s assistance in locating a suspect who punched a 19-year-old bus passenger who was wearing a turban and a mask. The NYPD said it is investigating the assault as a possible hate crime after witnesses said the man attempted to remove the passenger’s turban.                   And in Dearborn, Michigan – a city whose population is estimated to be about 42% Arab, according to the US Census Bureau –  police arrested a man after he made online threats of violence against Palestinian American residents.                   “Palestinian Americans and Muslim Americans feel like they are experiencing the level of hate and Islamophobia that existed after 9/11 and during the Iraq war – some say it’s even worse,” Aber Kawas, a member of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, told CNN.                 Abed Ayoub, director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said the perspectives of Palestinian and Muslim communities in places like the United States have been largely absent from the coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict and that has allowed a growing atmosphere of bigotry and Islamophobia to go unchecked.                   “There is no recognition of our existence. That’s what is allowing this to bubble,” he said. “And that’s what allowed a 6-year-old Palestinian boy to get stabbed to death in his own home.”                  Ayoub said Arab and Palestinian communities are diverse and nuanced. But, he said, giving platforms to narratives that insinuate anyone who supports Palestine also supports Hamas and the violent attacks on Israel is problematic.                    “Labeling everyone as Hamas just to justify the attacks is dangerous and we’re seeing that play out,” he said of the bombings in Gaza.                   Last weekend, as Israel continued to bombard Gaza in response to the October 7 Hamas attack, activists staged pro-Palestine rallies in New York City’s Times Square and in cities across the country.                   Many Muslim or Arab leaders say they feel compelled to speak out against the climate of Islamophobia to stem further violence.                 “The CAIR NJ office has not received this many calls for help since the Muslim ban in 2017,”  Selaedin Maksut, executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations of New Jersey, said at a news conference Monday. “Anxiety and fear are high.”                   Sarsour said a unified message from US officials would help address Islamophobia at home.                  “You need leadership from both parties to get up and say it is not acceptable for us here in the United States to be engaging or allowing for any type of anti-Muslim, anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab sentiment,” Sarsour. “We stand united.”        CNN’s Celina Tebor, Chris Boyette, Keith Allen, Holmes Lybrand, Whitney Wild, Bill Kirkos & Carmaine Means contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/15/opinions/cruelty-killing-hamas-gaza-israel-opinion-column-galant/index.html,Opinion: What the war is revealing,"The war sparked by the Hamas attack on Israel plays out on everyone’s screens, forcing people to confront cruelty and killing and to fear what comes next","Oct 15, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Richard Galant,International,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.             “We live in the first period in history in which there is such full awareness of cruelty and killing as they happen,” wrote British philosopher Jonathan Glover in 1999, at the end of a decade that saw genocidal killing in Rwanda and Bosnia and of a century that saw at least 187 million people die in war.                 How we respond to barbarity is crucial, he wrote in his book, “Humanity: A Moral History of the Twentieth Century.”                 “We can start to establish a tradition that, with our knowledge of the atrocities, we find them intolerable and will do what we can to eradicate them. Or we can help to continue a tradition which accepts them fatalistically.”                 Such questions came into sharp relief again after the brutality of the Hamas attack on Israel last weekend was revealed. The war plays out on everyone’s screens, forcing people to confront cruelty and killing and to fear what comes next.                 As Frida Ghitis wrote, Hamas “launched thousands of rockets as its operatives infiltrated Israeli territory using motorcycles, trucks, paragliders, and speedboats.”                 “Inside Israel, they went after soldiers and civilians, even posting videos on social media, as the world saw evidence of how they targeted, hunted down, and brutalized Israelis of all ages. Many were kidnapped and taken to Gaza and dragged through the streets.”                 Ghitis added, “There’s much that Israel has done wrong. But nothing justifies what Hamas has just perpetrated. As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, what Hamas has done is clearly an act of terrorism, no matter what your definition.”     Amy Klein, a writer based in New York whose husband has family in Israel and served in its army, began receiving messages asking, “Is your family okay?”                 “They were safe, but they were not all right…”                 “With over 1,000 Israelis dead and counting, thousands injured and as many as 150 Israelis feared kidnapped – graphic videos showing scores of twentysomethings being shot point blank at a desert rave, women stripped and bloodied, the elderly, children and babies snatched and tormented, people screaming for their lives on terrorists’ motorcycles, piles of bodies found at kibbutzim – no one in Israel is all right.”     “And most Jews in America are not all right either.”             “We were dancing,” recalled Gal Katz, “the sun was just coming up.” The 22-year-old was at a music festival when he saw signs of Israel’s Iron Dome system intercepting missiles from Gaza. “At first I was like, ‘Oh, it’s missiles.’ In Israel, this is nothing special. I figured if it was something serious, [music festival security] would end the party and tell us what to do.” Then a friend posted a video on WhatsApp showing a white pickup truck carrying at least six gunmen dressed in black. “It’s a truck full of terrorists in Israel, in the middle of a city nearby.”                 “I understood that what we’re dealing with is something that’s never been here before. I took a look at that video and it was like ‘Call of Duty.’”                 Katz and a friend ran to a nearby orange grove, where they hid quietly for about six hours out of sight of the attackers until they were rescued by soldiers. Other friends sought safety in shelters but were discovered by Hamas.                 “We came together to the party. And they didn’t make it. They didn’t return home.”                 “They took 1,200 lives and maybe 200 kidnapped, and people are still missing and wounded.     “It’s the most Jews that have been killed since the Holocaust. How can you accept that?”             The attack came a day after residents of the Be’eri kibbutz celebrated the 77th anniversary of its founding. Yulie Ben Ami, 27, grew up in the kibbutz, in southern Israel, with her parents and two siblings.                 “At 9:30, my mom sent me a message that the terrorists were trying to get into the house and they tried to break the door — that they were shooting into the safe place,” Ben Ami told CNN Opinion’s Stephanie Griffith. “She wrote that she’s scared and doesn’t know what to do. And I think like 10 or 15 minutes later, my mother and my father sent us a message that they [the attackers] are in the house and are breaking everything. At 10:06, my father sent us a message: ‘They are in the safe room. They caught us.’”                 “A half hour later, we saw a picture on Telegram of my father with two men who were taking him someplace — we don’t know where.”                 “We don’t know what happened to my mom, she wasn’t in that picture.”                 “I think the world needs to understand what the gunmen did to children and mothers and grandmothers and grandfathers…” More than 120 people were killed by the terrorists at the kibbutz.                 Israelis were stunned by the scale and ferocity of last weekend’s assaults. “This attack is being compared to the 1973 Yom Kippur War when Arab armies surprised Israel almost 50 years ago to the day,” wrote Janine Zacharia, a journalist who covered Israel for two decades. “But this is more traumatic. Not only because of the sheer number of murdered young civilians — in addition to young soldiers. But because of the way the horror is unfolding live on television, radio and social media and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government — that millions of Israelis have been protesting for months over right-wing attempts to weaken the judiciary — seems completely absent and incompetent.”     S. Ilan Troen is named “for a grandmother who was murdered in her village, Derazhne, near Rovno (now Rivne) in what was once Poland and is now Ukraine. Her death in the spring of 1919 came during a stretch of time when 150,000 Jews were murdered. Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura’s banditim, or criminal bandits, intoxicated with nationalist-religious fervor, attacked a small, peaceful, agricultural village, where they murdered and violated Jews.”                 It was a pogrom, wrote Troen, who is an emeritus professor of history at Ben-Gurion University in Israel and of Israel studies at Brandeis University in the US. Last week, his own family once again came face to face with the reality of that kind of murder.                 The word pogrom, taken from the Russian language, Troen noted, “is an official act by a government or similar polity, not the mere sick initiative of a single antisemite engaged in a limited one-off event. The historical progression of pogroms is clear: Eastern European antisemitism to Nazi racism that extended across most Europe to the current Hamas brutality against Jewish civilians wherever they find them.”                 “My mother witnessed her mother’s brutal end but somehow survived. The scar remained throughout her life, though, and affected how she so determinedly cared for and protected her own children.”                 “It is now my daughter, Deborah Mathias, who was so brutally murdered, together with her husband, Shlomi Mathias, in a kibbutz on the Gaza border, where they were committed to mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence. They were shot in the presence of their son, whose life was saved by my daughter using her body to shield him as she fell. He is recovering from a bullet that passed through her into his abdomen. He is mending, but that experience will remain and will be passed on.”                 “’Never again!’ It was never supposed to have happened. But it has, and is. We are witnessing in real time a pogrom. We thought that the most extensive pogrom — the Holocaust — would mark the end of the terrible record of violence against Jews, just because they are Jews. Not so.”                 Israel struck back with air attacks against targets in the Gaza Strip, home to more than 2 million people and ruled by Hamas. “In Gaza, we have all been glued to the news for the last five days, watching in disbelief as strikes and counterstrikes have been exchanged and the death counts on both sides of the border mount,” wrote Omar Ghraieb. “While every round of violence starts differently, they all end the same way here: with Palestinians paying a heavy price. We live in perpetual anticipation of a tragic ending.”                 “Our electricity falters, our water is scarce, and the air outside my home fills with thick smoke and acrid gunpowder. My throat and eyes burn. It’s too dangerous to venture out for bread, yet my thoughts drift to the guilty pleasure of an iced salted caramel macchiato that might bring inner peace, or at least some temporary distraction. What more can one expect from a Gaza millennial living in the impoverished coastal enclave that some call the world’s largest open-air prison, under a suffocating blockade for more than 15 years?”                 The threat Hamas posed to Israel was well known, wrote Carrie Cordero. “Hamas’ mission is, by definition, to end Israel, not to seek to establish a self-governed Palestinian state that peacefully coexists alongside the Jewish state. Like Americans before 9/11, Israelis should have been better protected by their government. Their confidence in their elected leaders, intelligence and security services has likely been deeply shaken.”                 Cordero called for Congress to elect a new speaker immediately and to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which would allow continued intelligence collection on national security threats, including the actions of terrorist groups.                 It’s too soon to tell if the Hamas attack will end discussions between Saudi Arabia, Israel and the US on a deal to normalize relations. “An Israeli normalization deal with Saudi Arabia — the location of the two holiest sites in Islam — would be hugely symbolic and have real security benefits for Israel,” wrote Peter Bergen. “After all, almost exactly half a century ago, during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, two Arab states, Egypt and Syria, attacked Israel. Also, both Israel and Saudi Arabia have a strong common interest today, both seeing Iran as their most dangerous enemy.”     Jason Greenblatt, who served as Middle East envoy in the Trump administration, said last weekend’s events made clear one obstacle to a two-state solution. “Israel cannot achieve peace with Palestinians when a segment of the Palestinian population still intends to destroy it. Israel cannot make peace when the leaders of the Palestinians include Hamas. Or when a member of Fatah, Hamas’ political opponent and the party that runs the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, expresses not sorrow over the loss of innocent life, but celebrates a ‘morning of victory, joy, and pride’ and urges all Palestinians to participate in the terror against Israel.”                 The echoes of the Hamas assault could be heard on some of America’s college campuses, where pro-Palestinian student groups rallied. At Harvard University, wrote Rachel Fish, “a group of 30 student associations issued a public statement over the weekend to say they ‘hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,’” a statement some student groups later backed away from.                 “When the administration finally weighed in, the first take was a milquetoast, word-salad statement signed by 18 administrators,” observed Fish, who is special advisor to the president for the Antisemitism Initiative at Brandeis University in Higher Education and K-12 Leadership. As controversy grew, Harvard’s president issued a statement Tuesday condemning “the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas.’”                 Fish argued, “This is a time for presidents, trustees, deans, provosts and donors to articulate that there are no mental hurdles that should ever be jumped to rationalize the destruction and inhumanity perpetrated by Hamas.”                 For more:     Kara Alaimo: Schools are right to warn parents about what their kids are seeing now Peter Bergen: The 9/11 attack wasn’t an intelligence failure. The Hamas attack may be             After ousting House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republicans have yet to round up enough votes to elect a replacement. In the meantime, the House cannot carry out its legislative duties, including responding to the Middle East crisis. Although House Republicans privately voted to pick Rep. Steve Scalise as their leader, he dropped out Thursday after he was not able to line up the 217 GOP votes needed to win that post in a full House vote. Rep. Jim Jordan won an intra-party vote Friday, but he too may struggle to line up the required number of votes on the House floor, Julian Zelizer noted.                 “The election of Jordan, who former Speaker John Boehner called a ‘legislative terrorist,’ would put one of the most radical members of the party in charge, someone who would have little problem sending the government into a shutdown,” observed Zelizer.                 Animating McCarthy’s foes was a belief that he wasn’t serious enough about cutting spending, wrote W. James Antle III.                 “Republicans have campaigned for decades on the idea that the country’s current fiscal trajectory is unsustainable, most recently making the argument that elevated federal spending levels had proved inflationary.”                 “Where the eight Republicans who seized McCarthy’s gavel get into trouble is that it is impossible to alter that fiscal trajectory while controlling by the narrowest of margins one half of the legislative branch. They simply don’t have the votes to pass the kind of sweeping spending cuts they would like, and their attempts to govern as a minority within a small majority make it difficult to govern at all.”                 For more:     John Avlon: The solution to the House speaker crisis             As the Federal Reserve has steadily raised interest rates over the past two years, the rise in the average mortgage rate (to more than 7%) and its impact on homebuyers has gotten lots of attention. Less talked about is an even more devastating increase that hits the many Americans who have credit card debt.                 “The average credit card interest rate in America is a shocking, all-time record of 24.45%,” noted Sallie Krawcheck and Victoria Sado. “By comparison, in 2018, the average credit card interest rate was 14.22%. Pair that with data that shows those hikes overlapped with consumers’ increases in spending outpacing their increases in income … and ouch.”                 “The gender debt gap means women especially feel this. And because of the gender pay gap, women are less likely than men to pay bills on time and in full.” Krawcheck and Sado outlined six ways to help cope with the rising cost of debt.                 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Monday that he’ll drop out of the Democratic presidential primary and run for the White House as an independent. His third-party bid could take votes from both President Joe Biden and his Republican challenger, wrote Peter Bergen.                 “Kennedy holds a mix of Republican and Democratic policy views which could make him attractive to the large numbers of American voters who are unhappy about a Biden-Trump rematch,” Bergen observed.                 “On the Ukraine war, pandemic measures, US border policies, and the Second Amendment, RFK Jr. could easily be mistaken for a Republican, while on abortion, affirmative action and climate change, he sounds very much like a Democrat. All of this makes Kennedy a wild card who may scramble the presidential election and damage both Biden and Trump in unexpected ways.”     Jill Filipovic: Why Gavin Newsom’s vetoes are so disappointing Sarah Gundle: Bob Saget’s widow isn’t alone in grappling with what happens when dating and grieving collide Sara Stewart: Why I can’t stop thinking about Julia Ormond’s story Keldy Ortiz: Retailers are closing stores.

Her record defies “common sense: 37 total world and Olympic medals, including five in Antwerp, where she clinched her sixth all-around title 10 years after she won her first. Her road back to the sport she not only dominates, but defines, challenges anyone who fails to understand that athletes must care for their mental, not just physical, health.”             “In Tokyo, just over two years ago,” Bass noted, “Biles shocked the sports world when she announced that she was sitting down, letting her teammates continue the Olympic quest without her because she had the ‘twisties,’ a word used to describe what happens when a gymnast’s mind and body are out of sync … She was not OK, and she was brave enough to say it out loud.”                 By the time the world championship competition ended last weekend in Antwerp, Belgium, Biles had walked away with four golds and a silver. “Her glorious return to the world stage, and the records she owns because of it, demonstrate the beauty of sport when it is not a zero-sum game based solely on winning.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             Sixteen-year-old Ali vividly remembers the last time he saw his mother at home. She made him and his twin sister, Kiana, eggs for breakfast, told them to study hard, said goodbye and sent them to school. When they returned, she was gone. They were eight.                 Their mother is Narges Mohammadi, a woman whose name has become synonymous with the fight for human rights in Iran – a battle that has cost this activist almost everything.                 On Friday, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for “her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced in Oslo.                  Mohammadi has been a prisoner for most of the past two decades. She has been sentenced repeatedly for being the voice of the voiceless, for her unrelenting campaign against the death penalty and solitary confinement – which she has had to endure for weeks at a time.     In letter from prison, Narges Mohammadi outlines her fight for women             She is currently serving a sentence of 10 years and 9 months, accused of actions against national security and propaganda against the state. She was also sentenced to 154 lashes, a punishment rights groups believe has not so far been inflicted, and travel and other bans.                  But not even the darkest cells of the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran have crushed her powerful voice.                  In an audio recording from inside Evin, shared with CNN before the Nobel Peace Prize was announced, Mohammadi is heard leading the chants of “woman, life, freedom”- the slogan of the uprising sparked last year by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Jhina Amini in the custody of the country’s morality police. She was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.      Iranian activists accuse morality police of assault after teenage girl hospitalized             The recording is interrupted by a brief automated message – “This is a phone call from Evin Prison” – as the women are heard singing a Farsi rendition of “Bella Ciao,” the 19th-century Italian folk song that became a resistance anthem against Fascists and has been adopted by Iran’s freedom movement.                    “This period was and still is the era of greatest protest in this prison,” Mohammadi told CNN earlier in written responses to questions submitted through intermediaries.                  Outside the prison walls, a brutal crackdown on protest by Iranian authorities largely quelled the movement sparked by Amini’s death and the morality police resumed their headscarf patrols in July. Iranian activists this week accused them of assaulting a teenage girl for not wearing a headscarf in a Tehran metro station, leading to her hospitalization with serious injuries. Iranian authorities said low blood pressure was the cause.                  Mohammadi, in comments received Thursday by CNN, said the government’s behavior had once again “raised our concerns” and was “indicative of its concerted efforts to prevent the truth from coming to light regarding Armita Geravand.”                 Mohammadi knows all too well the price of speaking publicly. In August she was sentenced to an additional year in jail for her continued activism inside prison after she gave a media interview and a statement about sexual assaults in jail.                 She was already serving time for publishing a book last year about Iran’s brutal prison methods, titled “White Torture: Interviews with Iranian Women Prisoners,” as well as a documentary film telling the stories of prisoners held in solitary confinement – a punishment Mohammadi herself has endured.     Iranian women face 10 years in jail for inappropriate dress after 'hijab bill' approved             But she remains undeterred. Mohammadi recently sent CNN a lengthy letter railing against four decades of the Islamic Republic’s mandatory hijab and calling out what she says is the hypocrisy of a religious state using sexual violence against female detainees.                  When it came to power four decades ago, she writes, the religious regime used the compulsory hijab to “showcase the image of domination, subjugation and control over women” as a means to control society.                  “They couldn’t put an abaya and turban on half of the population, i.e., men in society,” her letter reads. “However, they easily adorned half of Iran’s population with ‘mandatory hijab,’ veil, chador, manteau, and dark-coloured trousers to present the odious face of the despotic religious system to the world.”                  “Imagine Iranian women who, for 44 years, have been forced to wear a head covering, long coats, and dark-colored pants in the summer heat, and in some places, black chadors.                  “Worse than that, they have been under psychological pressure to strictly adhere to compulsory hijab, all to preserve the image of religious Islamic men and ensure the security and purity of women. Now, those same women are experiencing sexual assault and harassment against themselves.”                 In her letter and responses to CNN, Mohammadi details incidents of sexual violence against her and other female detainees at different facilities dating back to 1999.                 Political prisoners and women held on criminal charges were assaulted by security forces, prison authorities and medical personnel, she says.                  According to Mohammadi, sexual violence against women detainees has “significantly increased” since the protests that swept Iran last year, leading her to describe the abuse as now “systematic.”                 “The victims had told their stories in the meetings they had with the officials who came to Qarchak prison for inspection,” Mohammadi writes. “In prison, I have heard the narratives of three protesting women who were sexually assaulted. One of them was a well-known activist of the student movement who, upon entering the prison, filed a complaint with the authorities and announced that after being arrested on the street, her one hand and one leg was cuffed and tied to the two rings on the top of the car door. And in that position, she was sexually assaulted.”                  Mohammadi says she and another prisoner visited the prison’s “quarantine” area under the pretext of taking food to another inmate and that they saw the young woman there with bruises on her stomach, arms, legs and thighs.                 The Iranian government has denied the widespread allegations of sexual assaults against detainees, including in an in-depth CNN investigation last year, calling them “false” and “baseless.” She lost her eye protesting in Iran. She says she has no regrets             For years, Mohammadi has been vocal about sexual violence against prisoners, breaking taboos in her conservative country. In 2021, she hosted a discussion via the Clubhouse social media app where women, including Mohammadi, shared their stories of assaults by government “agents” from the 1980s to 2021. She was penalized for this, according to Mohammadi and rights groups.                 “Women who experience sexual harassment become filled with anger, fear, and insecurity, but when their womanhood is hidden and suppressed by ideological and religious claims, they will not only be angry and terrified, but they will also feel deceived and manipulated by the government, which is even more distressing,” she writes. Such sexual abuse “leaves such deep scars on their souls and minds that it is difficult to recover from, and perhaps they may never fully recover,” she added.                 For refusing to be silenced behind bars, Mohammadi has been banned from speaking directly with her husband and children for the past 18 months.                 “When your wife and the closest person to you is in prison, every single day you wake up worried that you might hear bad news,” her husband, Taghi Rahmani, told CNN in a recent interview in France, where he has lived in exile with their children since shortly after Mohammadi was imprisoned in 2015.                 Rahmani and human rights groups have raised concerns about Mohammadi’s health and access to medical care after she suffered a heart attack and underwent surgery last year.                  He proudly shows off prestigious international awards he has received on her behalf. She has an “endless energy for freedom and human rights,” he said.                  Rahmani, who was himself held as a political prisoner for a total of 14 years, met Mohammadi when she attended his underground contemporary history classes in 1995, he says.                 For the past eight years, he has had to act as father and mother to their now teenage twins.                  “Kiana always used to say when mom is here, dad is not. It’s not good,” he said. “But when someone chooses a path, they must endure all the hardships.”                  Ali, like his father, is resolute, saying his mother must keep going “for Iran, for our future.”                  “I am really proud of my mom,” Ali told CNN. “She was not always with us, but whenever she was, she took good care of us… she was a good mom and still is… I have accepted this kind of life now. Any suffering that I have to endure does not matter.”                  He said he was so eager to find out whether his mother had won that he kept scrolling on his phone in class without his teacher noticing.                 “Precisely at 11 a.m. my heart stops because I see that my mother won,” he said. “I exploded with joy.”                 Kiana, who preferred to not speak with CNN, wants her mother by her side. Her father says Kiana believes that if you bring a child into this world, you must take responsibility and raise that child.                 The pain of separation from her family is one Mohammadi lives with every single day. It is the cost of a sacrifice she has chosen to make, for the dream of a future freedom that has defined her life.                  “The moment I said goodbye to Ali and Kiana was not unlike the time I almost died in the tree-lined yard of Evin,” she writes to CNN, not specifying when that event was. “I picked the dandelions of Evin’s yard. I stood barefoot on the hot asphalt on July 14,” she said, referring to the day – only weeks after that final breakfast – on which she said goodbye to her children in prison before they left for exile in France. “My feet were burning but my heart was on fire. I sent the dandelions to the sky and my children’s hands, feet and childish faces passed my eyes and tears fell like spring rain.                  “If I look at the prison from the window of my heart, I was more of a stranger to my daughter and son than any stranger and I missed out on the best years of my life and what went will never come back. But I am sure that the world without freedom, equality and peace is not worth living or even watching.                  “I have chosen to not see my children or even hear their voices and be the voice of oppressed people, women and children, of my land,” she says.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/06/middleeast/iran-women-narges-mohammadi-letter-intl-cmd/index.html,"In letter from prison, Narges Mohammadi outlines her fight for women","With the help of intermediaries, Iranian women’s rights activist Narges Mohammadi was able to send a letter to CNN from inside Tehran’s Evin Prison.","Oct 6, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Jomana Karadsheh,International,"With the help of intermediaries, Iranian women’s rights activist Narges Mohammadi was able to send a letter to CNN from inside Tehran’s Evin Prison.  Mohammadi and her family believe she will be further penalized for speaking out once again through CNN, but that did not and will not stop her, they say. She was on Friday awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for “her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.” In the letter to CNN, sent before the prize was awarded, Narges railed against the compulsory hijab Iranian women have been forced to wear by the Islamic Republic for more than four decades. She also spoke very openly about sexual abuse inside jails. The Iranian government has denied the widespread allegations of sexual assaults against detainees, including in an in-depth CNN investigation last year, calling them “false” and “baseless.” Here are excerpts of her letter, which has been edited for length:             My letter may be long and disturbing in its subject matter, and some may perceive it as a “challenge” and “feminist protest” with a radical orientation. However, it is an attempt, in accordance with human rights, ethics, and of course, feminism, to protest against the continuation of “violence and sexual harassment of women” by a government that, under the guise of religion, has taken away “femininity” from us as a means to advance its illegitimate power and ambitions. My protest is based on human rights and feminist concerns, but it carries deeper and more profound implications. I cannot simply confine myself to condemning gross violations of human rights and women’s rights. I also intend to address the destructive falsehood and deceit of the government. A government that, with an ideological approach and misuse of spiritual and salvation elements among the people, attempts to control every aspect of individual and social life, under the pretext of family, security, and protection of the “woman,” leaving no aspect of “life” and “feminine identity” outside its oppressive grasp…                  I want to emphasize that this letter is not written by a free feminist in a developed democratic society, benefiting from civil protest methods and human rights, but rather by an imprisoned woman who, like millions of Iranian women, has been living under the “authority” and “oppression” of a military system with ideological, patriarchal, and tyrannical foundations since the age of 6, deprived of life, youth, “femininity,” and “motherhood”…                 During the establishment and acquisition of power by the religious regime, there were no better pawns than “women” in the game of religious authorities to adorn the political chessboard with their masculine domination…. . They couldn’t put an abaya and turban on half of the population, i.e., men in society. However, they easily adorned half of Iran’s population with “mandatory hijab,” veil, chador, manteau, and dark-colored trousers to present the odious face of the despotic religious system to the world. In this way, “mandatory hijab” became the showcase of Islamic society and, from the government’s perspective, one of the distinguishing elements and foundations setting apart Islamic society from Western societies…                 “Mandatory hijab” showcases the image of domination, subjugation, and control over women, which, when extended, makes the control over the entire society smooth and achievable…                 Hijab was not optional; it was imposed by the government, not based on beliefs and convictions, but to “submit” citizens to government dictates; it was imposed by the government, not based on beliefs and convictions, but to “submit” citizens to government dictates. In clearer terms, compliance with mandatory hijab was a way of training submission and surrendering to oppression in society, not through bullets and executions, but through placing a whip on women’s heads and making it normalized…                  The justification for all these violent and inhumane confrontations was summarized as preserving the dignity, chastity, and security of women and the well being of Islamic society. Imagine Iranian women who, for 44 years, have been forced to wear a head covering, long coats, and dark-colored pants in the summer heat, and in some places, black chadors. Worse than that, they have been under psychological pressure to strictly adhere to compulsory hijab, all to preserve the image of religious Islamic men and ensure the security and purity of women. Now, those same women are experiencing “sexual assault and harassment” against themselves…                 Women who experience sexual harassment become filled with anger, fear, and insecurity, but when their womanhood is hidden and suppressed by ideological and religious claims, and at the same time, they are violated in another “situation” (due to protest), they will not only be angry and terrified, but they will also feel deceived and manipulated by the government, which is even more distressing. I have no intention of making any comparisons between women subjected to assault in any “situation” because what women experience in “sexual assault and harassment” leaves such deep scars on their souls and minds that it is difficult to recover from, and perhaps they may never fully recover…                 The fear, anxiety, and sense of insecurity resulting from the attack by security forces, arrest, and transfer to unknown locations and solitary cells can inflict devastating blows to the individual’s soul and psyche. Experiencing “sexual assault and harassment” in such a “situation” in detention centers, during interrogations, threats, uncertainty, or inside detention vehicles, under the blows and kicks of officers, can be destructive and come with irreparable harm. The governmental male assailants assaulting detained protesting women in detention centers convey the message that nothing, not even what we claimed to be religion, humanity, and spirituality over the past 44 years, can stop us from suppressing and confronting you. Anyone who has experienced confinement in solitary cells and detention centers can comprehend the harsh message of “assault”: that is, we recognize no boundaries in suppressing and dealing with you, and even God does not exist…                 The “compulsory hijab” was a deceitful scheme against women and a tool of pressure to strengthen the power of the religious government. The “assault” on protesting women by government agents reveals the deceitful, deceptive, and manipulative nature of the government to the people of Iran and the world. Therefore, as a woman prisoner, I confidently declare that we have the power in our protest against the “assault” of government agents on protesting women. We draw this power from the “position” of Iranian women during 44 years of tyranny and coercion by the government in all aspects of our lives and from our struggle and resistance for freedom and rights…                 This text is not intended as an elegy for Iranian women. It is a testament to the fact that the tyranny and oppression of the government have inflicted incurable wounds on our lives, spirits, and minds. Women were the first, greatest, and most oppressed victims of religious despotism, but they were also the most steadfast, indomitable, and influential social force, and in recent protest and revolutionary movements, they have been at the forefront as the most advanced and radical forces.                  Iranian women do not derive their credibility and legitimacy of struggle from the intensity of the oppression and discrimination they have endured, but rather from their continuous and courageous resistance and struggle for democracy, life, freedom, equality, human rights, and peace. Their position will be established in the future of our country, and they will determine their rights.                  We, women, believe that fear, terror, and storms can never shake and tremble the mountains.     Narges Mohammadi, Evin Prison, July 2023 © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/04/middleeast/iran-activists-morality-police-girl-hospitalized-intl/index.html,Iranian activists accuse morality police of assault after teenage girl hospitalized,"Activists have accused Iran’s morality police of assaulting a teenage girl for not wearing a headscarf in a Tehran metro station, leading to her hospitalization with serious injuries.","Oct 5, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Mostafa Salem,International,"Activists have accused Iran’s morality police of assaulting a teenage girl for not wearing a headscarf in a Tehran metro station, leading to her hospitalization with serious injuries.                  A Norway-based group focused on Kurdish rights, the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, said Wednesday that 16-year-old Armita Geravand was “assaulted” by morality police and has been in a coma since Sunday. Another opposition network, IranWire, said it had obtained information that Geravand was admitted to the hospital with “head trauma.”                  “Prior to her arrival at the Shohada metro station, female morality police officers approached her and requested that she adjust her hijab. This request resulted in an altercation with the morality police officers physically assaulting Geravand. She was pushed, leading to her collapse,” Hengaw staffer Awyer Shekhi told CNN.                  “Following this confrontation, she managed to enter the metro, but collapsed later on,” Shekhi added.                  CNN could not verify the information published by Hengaw and Iranwire, who have in the past covered Iranian protests extensively.                  Iranian authorities have denied the allegations, saying she was hospitalized due an injury caused by low blood pressure. Geravand’s friends and family echoed those denials in interviews with state media.                  The allegations come just weeks after the one-year death anniversary of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old woman who died in the custody of the morality police after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly. That event sparked some of the biggest protests the country has witnessed in decades, prompting the regime to double down on policing activism and further tighten hijab laws.      Iranian women face 10 years in jail for inappropriate dress after 'hijab bill' approved             In security camera footage posted on the website of state-run IRNA news agency, a group of girls are seen entering the train. CNN cannot identify which girl in the video was Geravand.                  Some of the girls appeared to not be wearing headscarves.                   Moments later, the video goes on to show a group of girls carrying the teenager out of the train, placing her on the platform as the train leaves the station.                  No altercation can be seen on the edited video posted on state media. CNN has been unable to confirm its authenticity.                  The chief of Tehran Metro said there was no physical or verbal interaction between Geravand and members of his staff.                   “According to our investigation, after reviewing the CCTV footage from the moment she entered the station and got on the train, there was no verbal or physical altercation between the passengers with them or our staff. There was nothing recorded on the videos,” Tehran Metro Managing Director Masoud Dorosti told state media.                  The teenager is currently being treated at a hospital in Tehran, Fars News Agency reported. IranWire reported that she is being treated at Fajr Air Force Hospital, in a separate statement it published on Wednesday.                  A journalist from Iranian pro-reform outlet Shargh Daily had gone to Fajr Air Force Hospital to report on Geravand’s condition when she was arrested on Tuesday, according to a post Shargh Daily on X. The reporter, Maryam Lotfi, has since been released, the outlet reported.                  Geravand’s mother and father told state media in an interview that their daughter seemed to hit her head after fainting from low blood pressure while she was on her way to school. The parents said there were no signs from the videos they saw that Geravand was assaulted.                  “I think they said she had low blood pressure… drop in blood pressure or fallen on the floor… her head hit the edge of the metro and then (her friends) took her off (the train),” her mother Shahin Ahmadi said.                  “We checked the cameras. She went there… I am not sure… one of the girls was in front and one was behind her. She got on the train and fell down… I don’t know… what happened… whether she was unconscious… she fainted…. they pulled her out and called the emergency care. She was then taken to the hospital,” said her father, Ahmad Garavand.      One year since Mahsa Amini's death, a protester shot in the eye during Iran's crackdown continues her struggle from exile             It is unclear if Geravand’s family and friends were coerced into speaking to state media. In the past, UN human rights officials and rights groups have accused Iranian authorities of pressuring families of protesters killed to make statements supportive of the government narrative.                  The Hengaw rights group said Ahmadi, Geravand’s mother, was arrested on Wednesday and “transferred to an unknown location” – a claim denied by Iranian security sources to the state-affiliated Tasnim news agency on Thursday.                  Geravand’s friends also dismissed the allegations in an interview aired Wednesday on state-run IRNA.                      Fatemah, one friend who claimed to be present on the day of the incident, said in an on-camera interview that the teenager “suddenly fell backwards and her head hit the ground.”                   Mahla, another friend who said she was present, told the news outlet in an on-camera interview that everything happened very quickly once they entered the train.                   “The claims that we have been warned about hijab and that someone has pushed Armita is a lie and absolutely untrue,” Mahla said.                    CNN has been unable to reach the friends for comment and was not able to verify the last names of the two friends.                    Some have however alleged that Geravand’s friends and family are under pressure to push forward the state’s narrative on the events.                  The Coordinating Council of the Iranian Teachers Associations said in a statement on Telegram that Geravand’s friends “are under intense pressure to avoid sharing information about her condition on the day of the incident.”                    “They were also to speak to the state-run new agencies, in front of cameras, and deny any incidents to Armita Garavand,” the Council said citing “reliable sources.”                    It added that a security unit from the Ministry of Education warned teachers and students at the teenager’s school against speaking about the incident.                     CNN’s calls to the Iranian government have not been returned.                       The United States’ Special Envoy to Iran, Abram Paley, posted on X on Wednesday that he was “shocked and concerned about reports that Iran’s so-called morality police have assaulted 16-year-old Armita Geravand. We are following news of her condition. We continue to stand with the brave people of Iran and work with the world to hold the regime accountable for its abuses.”                    German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called Geravand’s situation “unbearable.”                  More than 300 people were killed in months-long protests after Mahsa Amini’s death last year, including more than 40 children, the UN said in November. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) in January placed the number of dead at more than 500, including 70 children. Thousands were arrested across the country, the UN said in a report in June, citing research released last year by their Human Rights Committee.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Lina Lutfiawati, known as Lina Mukherjee on social media, was tried on Tuesday in the Palembang district court on Sumatra island.                 The 33-year-old was found guilty of “spreading information aimed at inciting hatred against religious individuals and specific groups,” court documents read.                  In addition to her two-year prison sentence, the court fined her $16,245 (250,000,000 Indonesian rupiah), a small fortune in a country where the annual per capita wage is around $4,300. Her jail term could be extended by three months if she does not pay the fine, the court added.                  Speaking to reporters outside court on Tuesday after the trial, Mukherjee expressed shock at the sentence.                  “I know I was wrong but I really did not expect this punishment,” she said, in comments carried by CNN affiliate, CNN Indonesia. It is possible that she will file an appeal, CNN Indonesia added.                  Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim nation, where 231 million people, at least 93% of its adult population, identify as Muslim.                  Religious conservatism has been on the rise in the country in recent years and rights groups have warned that blasphemy laws are being “increasingly weaponized” against religious minorities and those deemed to have insulted Islam.     Cleric arrested for blasphemy after allowing women to preach in world's largest Muslim-majority country             Pork is forbidden in Islam and eating it remains taboo among most Indonesian Muslims. But the meat is commonly consumed by millions of non-Muslims, including the country’s ethnic Chinese population as well those living on the Hindu-majority island of Bali.                 Mukherjee, who identifies as Muslim, commands a combined social media following of more than 2 million.                 Known for her lifestyle and food videos showing her sampling various dishes, she received backlash over a video she shared on TikTok in March, which showed her sitting at a dining table and reciting the Islamic phrase “Bismillah” (In the name of Allah) before consuming crispy pork skin.                  Bismillah is one of the most important and common holy phrases in Islam. It is the first phrase in the Quran and is often uttered by Muslims before eating. It is also frequently used as a generic declaration.                  The video, which Mukherjee said had been filmed when she was traveling in Bali, featured her trying babi guling, a popular street food of rice and chunks of spit-roasted pork and crackling served with vegetables.                  She speaks into the camera and grimaces as she tries a piece of pork crackling.                  The video drew millions of views but was condemned by religious groups, including the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country’s top Muslim clerical body, which issued a ruling calling it “blasphemous.”                 It also prompted a public complaint which sparked police investigations, which led to Mukherjee being prosecuted.      Sex outside marriage ban tests Indonesia's relationship with democracy Photos and videos taken of Mukherjee throughout the trial and carried by CNN Indonesia often showed her in tears and accompanied by a heavy security presence.                   “She’s done nothing wrong but it says a lot about (the state of) Indonesia… how a self-proclaimed moderate Muslim country is becoming a radicalized Muslim nation,” Human Rights Watch’s Indonesia researcher Andreas Harsono told CNN.                  “The blasphemy chapter in the criminal code has been increased from one to six articles – a serious setback to protecting freedom of religion and belief in Indonesia,” he added. “It bucks a global trend to either not enforce blasphemy laws or to scrap them altogether.”                  One of Indonesia’s most high-profile blasphemy cases was that of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Indonesian politician widely known as Ahok who served as Jakarta’s first non-Muslim governor in 50 years.                 He went on trial for blasphemy in 2017 after angering hard-line Muslims by referencing a verse from the Quran while campaigning for re-election in 2016 and was jailed for two years despite making a public apology.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/12/opinions/iran-women-mahsa-amini-anniversary-afkhami/index.html,Opinion: Iranian women know which battles to fight. They’ve been doing it for decades,"The courageous women who were on the streets after the September 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in Iranian morality police custody have made a lasting difference, writes Mahnaz Afkhami.","Sep 12, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Mahnaz Afkhami,International,"Editor’s note: Mahnaz Afkhami was the minister of women’s affairs in Iran’s government before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. She is founder and president of Women’s Learning Partnership and executive director of the Foundation for Iranian Studies. Her most recent book is “The Other Side of Silence: A Memoir of Exile, Iran, and the Global Women’s Movement,” published by the University of North Carolina Press. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.             On September 16, 2022, Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish Iranian woman, died while she was in the custody of Iran’s morality police for the “crime” of inadequate veiling. This event spearheaded an uprising that soon captured global attention and gained support, from grassroots activists to world leaders.                 As we have come to expect, the Iranian regime reacted to the uprising with horrific brutality. But in the end, the courageous women who were on the streets shouting one of the most profound yet easily accepted slogans — “Woman, Life, Freedom” — have made a lasting difference. These three words were repeated in demonstrations by women and men around the world and appeared in different languages on buildings, billboards and flags across the globe.                 People ask whether this will be just another event suppressed by the violent response of the Islamic Republic. I do not believe it will be. A few days ago, I spoke with a woman activist in Tehran who pointed out, “The women have won. The city looks different. Women walk around as they wish — without veils — and sit in conversation with their male friends and family in coffee shops.”                 While the government is still intent on cracking down on women for improperly following the dress code, the social norms in Iran are shifting.                 On the anniversary of Amini’s death, it would be helpful to look at the evolution of the role of women in the Islamic Republic and to follow the ongoing process of their courageous struggle for their autonomy and rights.                 Iranian women were drawn into the Islamic Revolution of 1979 by the false promises of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who said, “In Islamic society women will be free to choose their own destiny and own activity.” He also claimed that he would go to his home in Qom, the city of clerics, and would have nothing to do with government. That turned out to be a lie — and shortly after he returned to Iran that February, he declared compulsory veiling, even before a government was established or there was a constitution.                 On March 8, 1979, International Women’s Day, tens of thousands of women demonstrated against his decree and were attacked by pro-revolution forces.                 Since then, Iranian women have used every opportunity to pressure the Islamic government for their rights. But they have lost the battle where the law is concerned, and Iran has gone from being at the forefront of women’s rights in the Middle East in 1978 to being ranked one of the worst countries in the world when it comes to gender equality.     Opinion: Iran's most powerful weapon isn't working             But women’s activists learned important lessons from decades of consciousness-raising and mobilization, drawing on each uprising and movement since the 1979 revolution.                 One of the most successful movements was in 2006, with the One Million Signatures Campaign for Reform of Discriminatory Family Laws. In that campaign, women organized in communities and went door to door in neighborhoods, talking to men and women, explaining the changes they were seeking, and asking for signatures. They worked with conservative religious women in areas where they were in agreement, such as equal rights and education and jobs. Around 30% of the signatures they gathered were from men.               For a time during Mohammad Khatami’s presidency from 1997 to 2005, some women activists argued that it might be possible to reform the system, given Khatami’s promises of a more tolerant society and comments about how women should not be regarded as “second-class citizens.” But his presidency did not lead to substantial legal changes, and by the time Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in office, the notion of reform lost credibility.     Opinion: The relentless bravery of Iranian protesters is a moral test for the Western world             As a response to what was widely considered a fraudulent election in 2009, the Green Movement was born two years before the Arab Spring. Protesters who were a part of the Green Movement eventually built on the alleged election fraud to make greater demands for the democratic rights originally sought in the 1979 revolution. Both men and women demonstrated in the hundreds of thousands and shouted, “Where is my vote?”                 Since that time, the expansion of technology and the presence of a connected, well-educated diaspora with women leaders in science, technology, the arts and politics have been important factors in encouraging and supporting those who remain inside.                 Iranian women have been deprived of the rights that they know and for which they have worked. But they have fought a medieval government and won a great deal. The Woman, Life, Freedom movement has succeeded in transporting and amplifying their voices and their activism across the world. This may be the first women-led counterrevolution in history — and it’s one in which men and women have participated together. It also offers an example of how women can work with each other and with men to engage in dialogue, provide support and respect differences of opinion.                 In every area of endeavor that does not need government engagement, the women of Iran have succeeded. They own businesses, teach, connect with each other and with their supporters outside the country, and are unafraid. They have forced the government to back down.                 They want a government that is worthy of their courage and wisdom. But they are realistic enough to know that while governments around the world continue to engage with the Islamic Republic and do not oppose it, unarmed civilians will not be the force that unseats the government. They have won the battles they chose and could win. The battle for the government they wish will require other means.                 They are mobilizing men and women, learning the basics of democratic governance, and preparing civil society for democracy — and when they finally receive serious, consistent support, they will be ready.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The video of the incident, which took place in the Muzaffarnagar district in northern Uttar Pradesh state, shows the boy fearfully standing in front of his classmates as the teacher calls on students to hit him.                  The boy cries as his classmates take turns to slap him, while the teacher is heard telling the students to do it “properly.” A man can be heard laughing as the boy wails while the slapping continues.                  Muzaffarnagar’s superintendent of police, Satyanarayan Prajapat, on Friday said the teacher told students to hit the boy “for not remembering his times tables.”                  The teacher also referenced the boy’s religion, according to Prajapat.                  “The female teacher declared: ‘When the mothers of Mohammedan (one who follows Islam) students don’t pay attention to their children’s studies, their performance is ruined,” he said.                 Police in the district have registered a case against the teacher and an investigation is underway. The teacher has not been formally charged. District officials have also ordered the school to shut, according to CNN affiliate CNN News-18.                  CNN has reached out to Uttar Pradesh police officials for more details.                  The boy’s father told CNN that his son felt “restless and scared” after the incident on Thursday. He said that, while the boy is doing much better now, he “was unable to sleep earlier and was left in shock” afterward.                   He told CNN that his son has since been admitted to another school and attended his first day on Monday, after Neha Public School – where the incident took place – was ordered to shut down.                  The incident has caused widespread anger and upset in India, the world’s largest democracy of 1.4 billion, where the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Hindu nationalist policies have deepened the country’s communal tensions and created what rights groups and government critics say is an atmosphere of fear and alienation among minority groups.                  Prominent opposition politician Rahul Gandhi accused the teacher of “sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children.” Writing on Twitter, now known as X, he said: “Turning a holy place like school into a market place of hatred – there is nothing worse than this that a teacher can do for the country.”                  Gandhi also blamed the BJP for stoking religious intolerance.                 “This is the same kerosene spread by the BJP which has set every corner of India on fire,” Gandhi wrote. “Children are the future of India - do not hate them, we all have to teach love together.”                 While the BJP has not responded to Gandhi’s comments, it has long maintained it does not discriminate against minorities and “treats all its citizens with equality.” During a trip to the United States in June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told reporters there was “absolutely no space” for discrimination in India.                 Indian law does not have a statutory definition of corporal punishment targeting children, however physical punishment and mental harassment are prohibited under the country’s Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act.                  According to CNN News-18, the teacher claimed the 7-year-old’s father had asked her to punish the child, adding that she was unable to do so because she is disabled and had therefore told the other students to discipline him.                  “His father brought the child in and said to straighten him out. Now because I can’t get up, I thought I’d get one or two children to hit him,” she said.                 The incident comes at a time of heightened communal tensions in the country as the BJP’s popular but divisive policies gain momentum in India.                  A study by economist Deepankar Basu noted a 786% increase in hate crimes against all minorities between 2014 and 2018, following the BJP’s election victory.                 Uttar Pradesh, where the incident took place, is India’s largest state of about 200 million. It boasts a religiously diverse population, where about 20% of its residents are Muslim.                  However, it remains among one of the most polarized of states in India.                  Its chief minister, the Hindu-monk-turned BJP politician Yogi Adityanath, has been criticized for his anti-Muslim rhetoric and Hindu-first policies, and the state has passed legislation critics say is rooted in “Hindutva” – the ideological bedrock of Hindu nationalism.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             Iran is moving to head off a possible repeat of unrest ahead of the first anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini, arresting women’s rights activists and family members of people killed during last year’s nationwide protests, local and international human rights groups said Wednesday.                   Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman, died last September after being detained by the regime’s infamous morality police and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.                  Protests sparked by Amini’s death, the largest Iran has witnessed in years, were met with a brutal crackdown by Iran’s security forces.                   More than 300 people were killed in the protests, including more than 40 children, the UN said in November last year. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) in January placed the number at more than 500, including 70 children.        Iran proposes long jail terms, AI surveillance and crackdown on influencers in harsh new hijab law              Thousands were arrested during months of protests across the country, the UN said in a report in June, citing research released last year by their Human Rights Committee.                  Iran executed seven protesters for their involvement in the unrest, according to the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.                   A group of volunteer lawyers who defend rights activists alleged in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that Iran arrested the father of one of the executed protesters and the family’s legal counsel on Tuesday.                  CNN has reached out to the Iranian Foreign Ministry for comment.                   In a separate case, Shermin Habibi, the wife of Fereydoon Mahmoodi, a protester killed by security forces during the demonstrations, was arrested and transported to an undisclosed location on Tuesday, according to a report from HRANA.                   Across 10 provinces, families of 33 people killed during the protests have been subjected to “human rights violations” in recent months, and the families of two people executed in connection with the protests were harassed and intimidated, Amnesty International said in a report this week.                  Meanwhile, Bidarzani, an independent women’s rights group, alleges in social media posts that 11 women’s rights activists and one man were arrested in Gilan province over the last week.                   State-affiliated media said 12 people were arrested for “preparing unrest and insecurity” in the province, which is northwest of Tehran on the Caspian Sea. Prosecutors in Gilan refused to provide details on which security entity was behind the arrests, according to Bidarzani.                  “Iranian authorities are using their go-to playbook of putting maximum pressure on peaceful dissidents ahead of the anniversary of Mahsa Amini’s death,” a senior Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch, Tara Sepehri Far said in a press release.      Iran's morality police resume headscarf patrols, state media says              “The arbitrary arrests of a dozen activists are aimed at suppressing popular discontent with ongoing impunity and rights violations.”                 It is unclear if more protests are planned to coincide with the anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested by Iran’s morality police for not wearing her hijab correctly.                  Ten months after her death, Iran’s morality police resumed headscarf patrols and now Iranian authorities are considering a draconian new bill on hijab-wearing that experts say would enshrine unprecedentedly harsh punitive measures into law.                  The 70-article draft law sets out a range of proposals, including much longer prison terms for women who refuse to wear the veil, stiff new penalties for celebrities and businesses who flout the rules, and the use of artificial intelligence to identify women in breach of the dress code.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The National Commission for Human Rights said the number of churches burnt “has risen to eight,” in an update on Wednesday, calling the situation “sad and shameful.”                 According to a police report obtained by CNN, two Christian men were charged by local police in the town of Jaranwala on the grounds of “desecrating the holy Quran and abusing the Prophet Mohammed.” The report stated that the men had been booked under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.                 Pakistani Christian communities are regularly targeted with the country’s strict blasphemy laws, which activists say have historically been manipulated to persecute minorities and isolate them from public life.                  Yasir Talib, who works for the Centre for Social Justice and who was in the town at the time of the incident, said a crowd vandalized and set on fire the home of one Christian man accused of making blasphemous comments against Islam.                 Multiple churches including the town’s Catholic Church, the Salvation Army Church and the Pentecostal Church, as well as the local Christian colony, were also vandalized and set on fire, Talib told CNN.                 In a statement Wednesday, the assistant commissioner for Faisalabad, where the town is located, called for the deployment of armed forces to support enforcing law and order, describing the situation as “sensitive and vulnerable.”                 Pakistan’s caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar condemned the violence, writing in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “stern action would be taken against those who violate law and target minorities.”                 President Bishop for the Church of Pakistan Azad Marshall said the country’s “Bishops, Priests and lay people are deeply pained and distressed” by the incident.                 “Bibles have been desecrated and Christians have been tortured and harassed having been falsely accused,” Marshall said on X, calling for “justice and action” by law enforcement and the legal system.                 The National Commission for Human Rights, a government body in Pakistan, called the violence “sad and shameful.”                   Riina Kionka, the EU ambassador to Pakistan, said the reports were “disturbing.”                 “The degree to which a society’s minorities feel safe, in Pakistan, in the European Union, around the world, is a measure of respect for the rule of law, for tolerance of diversity, a core EU value,” she posted on X on Wednesday.                 Pakistan is among the countries where blasphemy is a crime punishable by the death sentence.                 In 2013, more than 100 homes of Christians were set ablaze by outraged Muslims in Lahore’s Badami Bagh community, after police arrested a 20-year-old man accused of speaking against the Prophet Mohammed.                  Three years earlier, a mother of five from Punjab was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to hang, after she was accused of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed.                  Asia Bibi was freed from death row in 2018, after she won her appeal against the conviction and death sentence.

Panji Gumilang, 77, who runs the Al-Zaytun boarding school in the district of Indramayu in West Java, was arrested on Tuesday, Indonesian National Police official Djuhandhani Rahardjo told reporters outside its Criminal Investigation Agency in Jakarta.                 In the past, the school, home to roughly 5,000 students, has faced public backlash over its unorthodox practices like allowing men and women to pray alongside each other and women to become imams. Unlike other Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia, its prayer sessions do not follow gender segregation, angering some religious groups.                  “Investigators took legal action,” Djuhandhani said on Tuesday. “(Panji will be) detained in the Criminal Investigation Agency’s detention facility for 20 days,” he added.                 Police did not specify what Panji had said or done that constituted blasphemy but said they were acting on public complaints.                 In June, Indonesia’s Islamic Clerical Council said it was investigating Al-Zaytun for “misguided religious practices,” according to CNN affiliate CNN Indonesia. If found guilty of blasphemy and hate speech, Panji faces a maximum 10 years in prison.                 Panji’s lawyer Hendra Effendy called for calm from his supporters.                  “He is after all, a public figure with millions of supporters… With all this happening, we don’t know what could happen,” he told CNN Indonesia.                  One of Panji’s supporters, who did not wish to be named for fear of reprisals, told CNN his arrest was “unjust” and reflective of the country’s turn towards the religious right.                  “So he went against (the curve) – does he deserve to be punished for his compassion,” the supporter asked.                  Most mainstream schools of Islam around the world segregate men and women during prayers and do not permit women to lead mixed gendered prayers or deliver sermons.                  Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, with 231 million Muslims.                  Although it has an overwhelming Muslim majority, it is constitutionally secular and officially recognizes six religions – Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism.                  Historically the country has practiced a tolerant and pluralist form of Islam. However, it has seen a rise in religious conservatism in recent years.                 Strict Islamic laws are also enforced in some parts of the country, including the semi-autonomous Aceh province, where alcohol and gambling are banned and public floggings take place for a range of offenses including homosexuality and adultery.                 Panji was “supportive” of Muslim women becoming imams and leading others in prayer, something which “isn’t normal in Indonesian society,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.                  “He has been promoting gender equality within Islam and this has angered the conservatives. There is nothing wrong with him (a Muslim cleric) promoting women’s rights – something is terribly wrong with blasphemy laws,” he added.      Sex outside marriage ban tests Indonesia's relationship with democracy             Rights groups say that religious freedom and tolerance are “under threat” in Indonesia and blasphemy laws were being “increasingly weaponized” against religious minorities and people deemed to have criticized Islam.                 One of the highest profile blasphemy cases was that of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Indonesian widely known as Ahok and Jakarta’s first non-Muslim governor in 50 years.                 He went on trial for blasphemy in 2017 after angering hard-line Muslims by referencing a verse from the Quran while campaigning for re-election in 2016.                  Despite making a public apology, he was jailed for two years – a verdict met with scrutiny and condemnation by many Indonesians and observers in the international community. The case was widely seen as a test of religious tolerance and free speech in Indonesia.                  “Blasphemy cases have been increasing drastically over the years,” Andreas of Human Rights Watch said. “Officials in Indonesia are using these laws more frequently against religious minorities in the name of ‘religious harmony’ and it’s (grown) more and more toxic.”                  “It is becoming an increasingly Islamized state and there will be many more consequences… for people whose views are considered to be against the Islamic establishment,” he said, referencing controversial amendments to its criminal code set to be passed by 2025.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             Just weeks ahead of the one-year anniversary of the mass protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, Iranian authorities are considering a draconian new bill on hijab-wearing that experts say would enshrine unprecedentedly harsh punitive measures into law.                   The 70-article draft law sets out a range of proposals, including much longer prison terms for women who refuse to wear the veil, stiff new penalties for celebrities and businesses who flout the rules, and the use of artificial intelligence to identify women in breach of the dress code.                    Experts said the bill, which has not yet been passed, was a warning to Iranians that the regime would not back down from its stance on the hijab despite the mass demonstrations that rocked the country last year.                   The bill was submitted by the judiciary to the government for consideration earlier this year, then forwarded to the parliament and subsequently approved by the Legal and Judicial Commission. It is set to be submitted to the Board of Governors this Sunday before it is introduced on the floor of parliament, state-aligned news agency Mehr reported Tuesday.    Iran bans film festival over poster of actress without hijab             Iran’s parliament would work on finalizing the text and voting on the bill “in the next two months,” Mehr said. It is “a clear response to the protests from September of last fall,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think-tank in London, told CNN, adding that the establishment was attempting to “reassert authority over veiling and the requirements expected of women.”                  Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman, died last September after being detained by the regime’s infamous morality police and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.                   While not officially disbanded, the morality police had largely pulled back following last year’s protests, which have gradually waned. But earlier this month, police spokesman General Saeed Montazerolmahdi said the morality police would resume notifying and then detaining women who are caught without the Islamic headscarf in public.                  The hijab has long been a point of contention in Iran. It was barred in 1936 during leader Reza Shah’s emancipation of women, until his successor lifted the ban in 1941. In 1983 the hijab became mandatory after the last shah was overthrown in the Islamic Revolution of 1979.                   Iran has traditionally considered Article 368 of its Islamic penal code as the hijab law, which states that those in breach of the dress code face between 10 days to two months in prison, or a fine between 50,000 to 500,000 Iranian rials, what is today between $1.18 to $11.82.                  The new bill would reclassify failure to wear the hijab as a more severe offense, punishable by a five-to-ten-year prison sentence as well as a higher fine of up to 360 million Iranian rials ($8,508).                   That fine is far beyond what the average Iranian could pay, as millions are below the poverty line, Hossein Raeesi, an Iranian human rights lawyer and adjunct professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, told CNN.                  Another section states that in order to enforce the new law, Iranian police must “create and strengthen AI systems to identify perpetrators of illegal behavior using tools such as fixed and mobile cameras.” Earlier this year, state media reported that cameras would be installed in public places to identify women who violate the country’s hijab law.      Iran's morality police resume headscarf patrols, state media says              Under the new law, business owners who do not enforce the hijab requirement will face steeper fines, potentially amounting to three months’ of their business profit, and face bans on leaving the country or participating in public or cyberactivity for up to two years.                     The bill also targets celebrities, who may face a fine of up to a tenth of their wealth, exclusion from employment or professional activities for a specified period of time, as well as a ban on international travel and social media activities.                  The draft law would also mandate broader gender segregation in universities – common hotbeds of civilian protests – and other public spaces.                   Article 49 of the bill defines the lack of hijab for women as “clothes that show a part of the body below the neck or above the ankles or above the forearms.” Clothes that are “revealing or tight” also violate the law.                   Some of the measures in the draft law have already been “unlawfully” exercised by the Iranian security forces, Raeesi said, including the recent closure of an insurance company in Tehran after some photos of female employees without the hijab circulated on social media. With this bill, the government would “legalize illegal behavior” by those forces, Raeesi said.      Iran installs cameras to identify women breaking dress code             Experts believe the legislation, or parts of it, is likely to pass in some form – most members of parliament are regime-aligned and unlikely to block it – though Raeesi said it was possible that the government could pull the bill if it is able to control any potential unrest around the Mahsa Amini anniversary. If the bill is passed by parliament, it must also be approved by the regime’s Guardian Council, Raeesi told CNN.                  A 12-member council with considerable power in Iran, the Guardian Council is charged with making sure that legislation passed falls in line with the values of Islam and the Iranian constitution. Any bill passed by the parliament must be reviewed and approved by the council to become law.                  In the meantime, experts said the bill sent a clear message to Iranians.                  “The system is trying to make clear that leniency won’t be tolerated, and that there is a clear, graduated system of punishment for individuals that are going to flout the dress law in the country,” Vakil said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/02/europe/quran-burning-protest-denmark-sweden-intl/index.html,Sweden and Denmark consider ban on Quran-burning protests as security fears rise,"A spate of Quran-burning protests in Sweden and Denmark has caused angry demonstrations in Muslim-majority countries, heightened security fears at home and left both Scandinavian nations questioning whether they need to review ...","Aug 2, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Christian Edwards,International,"A spate of Quran-burning protests in Sweden and Denmark has caused angry demonstrations in Muslim-majority countries, heightened security fears at home and left both Scandinavian nations questioning whether they need to review their liberal laws on freedom of speech.                 Sweden sparked an international spat after allowing a protester to burn a copy of the Quran outside a mosque in Stockholm in June, which coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, one of the most significant events in the Islamic calendar – an incident that angered Turkey and jeopardized Sweden’s bid to join NATO.                 Several Qurans have also been burned outside foreign embassies in the Danish capital Copenhagen over recent weeks.                 While some of the protests have been staged by individuals, a number have been carried out by far-right groups that are growing in influence in the two countries.                 The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which comprises 57 Muslim states, held an emergency meeting on Monday, where it “condemned” Sweden and Denmark for allowing the protests to continue “under the garb of freedom of expression.”                 The right to freedom of expression has been enshrined in the Swedish and Danish constitutions for centuries. But both countries signaled Sunday that they are exploring legal ways to prevent such protests, amid security and geopolitical concerns.                 Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said he was in “close dialogue” with his Danish counterpart over the weekend and that the two nations “share the same analysis: The situation is dangerous and measures are needed to strengthen our resilience.”                 As a result of the protests, the Danish government said that Denmark “is being viewed as a country that facilitates insult and denigration of the cultures, religions, and traditions of other countries.” In recent weeks, 15 governments have issued condemnations of Denmark.                 Sweden was also condemned after allowing Salwan Momika, an Iraqi Christian immigrant, to burn a copy of the Quran in Stockholm. Momika has staged several such protests in recent months.                 The day after that protest, demonstrators broke into the Swedish embassy in Baghdad, demanding the expulsion of the Swedish ambassador to Iraq. Demonstrators had previously clashed with security forces outside the embassy in January for a separate incident of Quran burning in Stockholm.                 Sweden and Denmark are among the most liberal, secular countries in the world. Freedom of speech is enshrined in their constitutions and neither nation has blasphemy laws, meaning it is not illegal to insult religion or desecrate religious texts like the Quran.                  “Sweden’s protection, under the Swedish constitution, for freedom of expression, is the strongest protection in the world – even more so than the first amendment in the United States,” Marten Schutlz, a law professor at Stockholm University, told CNN. “Freedom of speech is almost always the first priority in all conflicts of interests or values.”                 In order for a protest to go ahead, Swedes must apply for a permit from the police under the Public Order Act. The police can only refuse a permit on safety grounds.                 When the Swedish police authority attempted to prevent Momika from staging his protest by denying him a permit in February, its decision was overturned by Sweden’s Court of Appeal.                 “The police are by law only allowed to say no in case of them not being able to guarantee safety at the demonstration itself. They can’t take into account the wider political perspective,” Sofie Blomback, a political scientist at Mid Sweden University, told CNN.                 While freedom of speech has long been a constitutional right in Sweden and Denmark, the scrapping of blasphemy laws was a more recent development. Sweden abolished them in the 1970s, while Denmark ditched such laws in 2017, after they had been on the statute books since the 17th century.                 “Religion should not dictate what is allowed and what is forbidden to say publicly. It gives religion a totally unfair priority in society,” said Bruno Jerup, a member of Denmark’s Parliament, at the time.                  Under existing laws, neither government is able to legally ban the protests. Instead, both are simply trying to discourage them. Blomback described the Swedish government’s stance on the issue as “it’s legal, but we don’t like it.”                 In a statement, the Danish government said it “has clearly distanced itself from and condemned the burnings of the holy Quran. The burnings are deeply offensive and reckless acts committed by few individuals. These few individuals do not represent the values the Danish society is built on.”                 But, over the weekend, both countries signaled that they are exploring legal mechanisms to limit the demonstrations.                 “We will find a legal tool that allows us to prevent the Koran burnings in front of foreign embassies,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said.                 Sweden’s Kristersson also announced that his government has “already started analyzing the legal situation – including the Public Order Act – with the purpose of exploring the scope for measures that would strengthen our national security.”                 Both countries have faced crises surrounding freedom of speech before. In 2005, the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten published caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed wearing a turban made out of a bomb, sparking a wave of violence. Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was also the object of an attempted attack after publishing similar cartoons of Mohammed in 2007.                 But neither country tightened their free speech laws in response to these attacks.                 The diplomatic row comes at a precarious moment – for Sweden especially.                 “We are currently in the most serious security situation since the Second World War, and as for Sweden, we are aware that states and state-like actors are actively exploiting the situation,” Kristersson said in a statement posted Sunday.                 Sweden formally applied for NATO membership last year, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, its accession to the bloc was for months obstructed by Turkey, which objected to, among other things, what it alleged to be Sweden’s complicity in Quran-burning protests.                 Turkey finally gave the green-light to Sweden’s bid on the eve of NATO’s summit in Vilnius in June, although Stockholm cannot formally join the alliance before its membership is ratified by a vote in the Turkish parliament due to be held this fall.     Turkey has agreed to back Sweden's NATO bid, alliance chief says             Carl-Oskar Bohlin, Sweden’s Civil Defense Minister, claimed in a statement last week that Russian-affiliated actors were attempting to capitalize on the situation.                 “Sweden is right now the target of influence campaigns, supported by states and state-like actors, whose purpose is to harm Sweden and Swedish interests,” said Bohlin. “These events are then retold in an inaccurate way, sometimes with direct calls to hurt our country.”                 Bohlin also claimed that “Russia-backed actors are amplifying incorrect statements such as that the Swedish state is behind the desecration of holy scriptures.”                 “It’s a very sensitive time for Sweden because we are trying to become members of NATO, so this has really had an effect on these negotiations,” Schulz told CNN.

The comments, made by prime time host Greg Gutfeld, came during a discussion Monday on “The Five” about Florida’s new Black history standards that requires instruction for students include “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.”                 Jessica Tarlov, a liberal-leaning co-host on “The Five,” expressed disapproval of the new history standards and questioned whether arguments used to defend them would ever be made in regard to the Holocaust.                   “I’m not Black, but I’m Jewish,” Tarlov said. “Would someone say about the Holocaust, for instance, that there were some benefits for Jews? That while they were hanging out in concentration camps, they learned a strong work ethic? That maybe you learned a new skill.”                 Gutfeld replied, asking if Tarlov had read the “Man’s Search for Meaning,” a bestselling book written by psychiatrist Viktor Frankl who was imprisoned during the Holocaust and described the atrocities committed in concentration camps. In his book, Frankl detailed how people can cope with suffering and find meaning in the most horrific of circumstances.                 “Frankl talks about how you had to survive in a concentration camp by having skills. You had to be useful,” Gutfeld told Tarlov. “Utility! Utility kept you alive!”                 Gutfeld’s assertion immediately ignited criticism, including from the Auschwitz Memorial, which said in a statement, “Being skilled or useful did not spare [Jewish people] from the horrors of the gas chambers.”     While it is true that some Jews may have used their skills or usefulness to increase their chances of survival during the Holocaust, it is essential to contextualize this statement properly and understand that it does not represent the complex history of the genocide perpetrated… https://t.co/F8VfwRuFEI             On Tuesday, the White House weighed in, blasting the right-wing channel over its silence on Gutfeld’s comments.                 “What Fox News allowed to be said on their air yesterday — and has so far failed to condemn — is an obscenity,” Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement to CNN.                  “In defending a horrid, dangerous, extreme lie that insults the memory of the millions of Americans who suffered from the evil of enslavement, a Fox News host told another horrid, dangerous and extreme lie that insults the memory of the millions of people who suffered from the evils of the Holocaust,” Bates continued.                  “Let’s get something straight that the American people understand full well and that is not complicated: there was nothing good about slavery; there was nothing good about the Holocaust. Full stop,” Bates added. “Americans deserve to be brought together, not torn apart with poison. And they deserve the truth and the freedom to learn, not book bans and lies.”                 A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.                 Fox News has faced criticism in recent years for giving air to extreme rhetoric. The Anti-Defamation League has repeatedly — and sharply — criticized the network for mainstreaming “fringe” rhetoric. During the presidency of Donald Trump, the network trafficked in right-wing propaganda and conspiracy theories — including giving air to dangerous lies about the legitimacy of the 2020 election.                 Fox News debuted its revamped prime time lineup just last week, after inexplicably firing Tucker Carlson earlier this year. The new lineup, featuring a bloc of pro-Trump hosts, features Gutfeld helming the 10 p.m. ET hour.     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Videos posted on social media showed a large number of protesters inside the Swedish embassy’s perimeter as well as black smoke and fire coming from the building.                 Security forces armed with electric batons chased protestors and used water cannons to disperse them and put out the fire, a security source told CNN.                 Eyewitnesses told CNN that the protesters withdrew from the perimeter of the Swedish Embassy after setting part of it on fire “after delivering their message of protest against the act of burning the Holy Book of God.”                 Several journalists covering the protests were detained by security forces, and at least one was beaten, according to multiple organizations.                 “Journalists should be free to report the news without fear of harassment or harm, wherever they are,” Reuters Iraq Bureau Chief Timour Azhari tweeted Thursday. Two detained Reuters journalists were released after several hours, the agency said.                 Ziyad Al-Ajili, the head of the Iraq-based Journalistic Freedoms Observatory (JFO) told CNN that three photojournalists working with international news agencies were arrested and another was beaten by security forces and his camera destroyed.                 CNN has reached out to the Iraqi government for comment.                 The planned protest in Sweden took place later on Thursday outside the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm. It was organized by Salwan Momika, an Iraqi national in Sweden who burned a copy of the Quran outside a mosque in Stockholm last month during the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, in a solo that sparked outrage in Iraq and around the world.                  Ultimately no Qurans were burned during Thursday’s protest, according to videos seen by CNN, but footage showed two protesters kicking and partially destroying a Quran, and Momika stepping on a Quran and polishing his shoes with a picture of the Iraqi flag.                  A Stockholm police spokesperson said there were two people in attendance with a permit for the protest and estimated that another 150 people were present, most of them reporters.                  The Swedish police have stressed that they only grant permits for people to hold public gatherings and not for the activities conducted during them, AFP reported.                 Swedish and Iraqi authorities exchanged heated words over the protests, as Baghdad threatened to sever diplomatic ties with Stockholm over Quran-burning demonstrations sanctioned by the state.                 “Granting permission under the pretext of freedom of expression is viewed as provocative and contrary to international covenants and norms, which emphasize respect for religions and beliefs,” the Iraqi prime minister’s office said.                 Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia also publicly condemned the holy book’s desecration in Sweden, with authorities in Tehran and Riyadh summoning Swedish diplomats to express their anger.                  Prominent Iraqi Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr, whose supporters were behind the protests at the Swedish embassy, said that “Sweden’s hostility towards Islam and the holy books by giving permission to burn the Iraqi flag means Sweden doesn’t believe in Iraq.                 “It’s on the government to not just express condemnation and denunciation as that shows weakness and complacency,” Sadr said.     Protesters break into Swedish embassy in Baghdad after Stockholm Quran burning             However, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry also condemned the attack on the Swedish embassy, calling it part of a concerning pattern of assaults on diplomatic missions.                 The Iraqi government held an emergency meeting on Thursday to turn in the arrested individuals arrested in Baghdad to the judiciary, adding that “negligent security officials will be investigated and face appropriate legal measures.”                 Swedish authorities too condemned the demonstrations in Baghdad, calling the actions of protesters “completely unacceptable.” Iraq’s charge d’affaires in Stockholm has been summoned, Sweden’s Foreign Minister Tobias Billström said on Thursday.                 Sweden’s embassy staff in Baghdad are all safe amid protests outside of the building, the foreign ministry’s press office told CNN via email.                 “We condemn all attacks on diplomats and staff from international organizations. Attacks on embassies and diplomats constitute a serious violation of the Vienna Convention. Iraqi authorities have the responsibility to protect diplomatic missions and diplomatic staff,” it said.                 Iraq later recalled its chargé d’affaires from the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm, and asked the Swedish ambassador in Baghdad to leave the country, an Iraqi government spokesperson said Thursday.                 Iraq also suspended Swedish telecom giant Ericsson’s license in the country in response to the demonstration in Stockholm.                 Ericsson told CNN in a statement on Thursday that the incidents in Stockholm “involving the burning of the Holy Quran is deeply offensive to the religious beliefs and values cherished by Muslims around the world.                  “This act does not reflect Ericsson’s core value of respect.”                 The European Union echoed Sweden’s condemnation of the attack in Iraq overnight, saying it hoped for a “swift return to normality” in the relations between both countries.                 The diplomatic fallout saw the United States “strongly” condemn the attack on Thursday. The US emphasized that freedom of peaceful assembly is vital to democracy, but this violent act was unlawful and unacceptable, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement.                  “Foreign missions should not be targets of violence. We call on the Government of Iraq to honor its international obligations to protect all diplomatic missions in Iraq against any intrusion or damage, as required by international law,” Miller said.                 Miguel Moratinos, the high representative of the United Nation’s Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), said the the desecration of sacred religious books is not freedom of expression but rather an expression of contempt and religious hatred.                  “The High Representative also condemns the acts of violence and the storming of the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad today,” the statement read.                  “He re-iterates that the desecration of sacred religious books and religious sites is a disrespectful and provocative act. Such acts often lead to agitation and incitement to violence. At the same time, he stresses that violence is never an appropriate response to provocation,” the statement added.

Saeid Montazeralmahdi, spokesman for Iran’s enforcement body, Faraja, said police will restart vehicle and foot patrols across the country from Sunday, the state-run Fars news agency reported.                   Officers will first warn women who are not complying, while those who “insist on breaking the norms,” may face legal action, he said.                 The morality police were cast into the international spotlight in September last year, when 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died three days after being arrested by the force for wearing her hijab, or headscarf, incorrectly and taken to a “re-education” center.                  Her death sparked nationwide protests that rocked the country, posing one of the biggest domestic threats to Iran’s ruling clerical regime in more than a decade.                  Authorities responded violently to suppress the months-long movement, during which witnesses said the morality police had virtually disappeared from the streets of Tehran.                 Iran executed at least 582 people last year, a 75% increase on 2021, according to human rights groups who say the rise reflects an effort by Tehran to instill fear among anti-regime protesters.                  The morality police have access to power, arms and detention centers and control over “re-education centers,” Human Rights Watch told CNN last year. The group is sanctioned by the United States and the European Union.                 The centers act like detention facilities, where women – and sometimes men – are taken into custody for failing to comply with the state’s rules on modesty.                  Inside the facilities, detainees are given classes about Islam and the importance of the hijab, and are forced to sign a pledge to abide by the state’s clothing regulations before they are released.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN opinion here.             In January 2020, I led a delegation of more than 60 prominent Arab Muslims, including 25 religious leaders, on what our Jewish hosts called a “groundbreaking” visit to the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camps.                 Ours was the most senior Islamic delegation to visit the site during its sorrowful history.                 Passing through the infamous gates was a visceral, emotionally-arresting experience that managed to both transport me back in time and sharpen my mind on the future. For it was here that 1.1 million people, the vast majority of them Jews, were murdered during the Holocaust. And it was here that I reaffirmed my commitment to fight intolerance and hate in all its forms.                 This visit was our moral obligation and an overdue sign of solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters, with whom we must tackle the many injustices and enmities there are in the world.                 Indeed, all the world’s major faiths — Christian, Judaic, Hindu, Buddhist and Hindu — have at their core a commitment to peace and justice that starts with recognition of the struggles of our fellow travelers.                 Now, on the cusp of the 78-year anniversary of the liberation of Majdanek (22-23 July, 1944), which was the first of the Nazi camps to be freed by the Allies, we must ask ourselves: does the truth of the Holocaust continue to set hearts and minds, once blinded by ignorance, fear and prejudice, free?                 The honest answer is that while Muslim understanding of the Holocaust is important to bringing lasting peace to the Holy Lands, Holocaust ignorance and denial remains a worrisome trend that only worsens with the passage of time.     A pig farm that stood on the site of a Nazi-era ‘Roma camp’ is finally demolished             Trivializing the Holocaust, we know too well, opens pathways to denial and to antisemitism, which still persists in the world, for sure. But it is a cross-cultural, cross-ethnic, cross-national, cross-religion phenomena.     One poll, conducted earlier this year by the American Jewish Committee, found that only 53% of Americans over the age of 18 answered correctly that approximately six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, while 20% explicitly said they were not sure. In the poll, 2% said that less than one million were killed, 13% chose approximately three million, and 11% said more than 12 million.                 The truth can set us free. And the truth of the Holocaust must continue to open our eyes to the horrors humankind is capable of inflicting — and help guide us to the truth of our common humanity and our shared destiny.                 But we must live, practice, and teach this truth every day, to keep the shadow of lies and ignorance from again overtaking our world.                 We can do this primarily through education and interfaith dialogue. There are ever more interfaith clubs and organizations sprouting across communities and college campuses, including the new Interfaith Research Lab at Columbia University, which I helped inaugurate with Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Rabbi Arthur Schneier.                 We can also work to build bridges of peace between the diverse peoples of the world, and be a force for a new, faith-driven diplomacy that compliments the traditional efforts of governments to achieve peace.                 This idea is already bearing fruit. Last year, The Muslim World League, together with Christian, Jewish, Shinto and other partners, took part in the G20 Summit of Nations in Bali, Indonesia as the “R20” (the Religion 20), an engagement group aiming to leverage the power of world religions to tackle pressing global challenges.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             And just last month, we hosted a high-level interfaith summit of religious leaders and diplomats at United Nations Headquarters in New York, aimed at soothing over growing tensions between east and west.                 These are not naïve exercises. Two historical facts are worth remembering. First, it was the Soviet Red Army – which was then allied with America and the West – that liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, as well as Majdanek, in the 1940s.                 Second, while the overwhelming number of victims of Nazi barbarity were Jews, among the murdered at Auschwitz were dozens of Muslims. The lessons here are clear. The clash of peoples is not inevitable. Good can defeat evil. And hate is an all-consuming pyre.                 We all rise or fall together. And as we remember the liberation of Majdanek, that is the truth that shall set us free.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The protests in the Iraqi capital were ordered by the powerful Iraqi Shia cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr, who also called for the expulsion of the Swedish ambassador in Baghdad.                 Videos circulating on social media showed some protesters climbing over a barricaded wall outside the  embassy. It is unclear how far into the building they got, before withdrawing.                 Sweden said its staff were safe. “We are well informed about the situation. Our Embassy staff are in safety and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is in regular contact with them,” the Swedish foreign ministry’s press office told CNN in an email.                  An Iraqi security source confirmed to CNN that the incident was over. The AFP news agency reported that the protestors were inside the compound for about 15 minutes.                 The protests in Baghdad came after an incident in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, on Wednesday, when a man burned a copy of Islam’s holy book outside a mosque. Images of the event showed he was the only person apart from his translator at the demonstration, which coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, one of the most significant in the Islamic calendar.                 Al Sadr demanded authorities withdraw the Iraqi nationality of Salwan Momika – the organizer of the one-man Quran protest in Stockholm – who immigrated to left Iraq for Sweden five years ago.                 “If freedom of speech is guaranteed to Iraq and the world, then the believers have to express their views on the burning of the holy books… through massive angry protests against the Swedish embassy in Iraq,” Al Sadr said.                 Muslim countries and Islamic organizations had condemned the burning of the Quran in Stockholm. Iran called the act “provocative” and Kuwait said it’s a “dangerous provocatory step”.                 The Organization of Islamic Cooperation [OIC], the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council all separately expressed strong condemnation to the event.                 On Wednesday, Morocco recalled its ambassador to Sweden and both Iraq and Saudi Arabia strongly condemned the act. On Thursday, the United Arab Emirates summoned Sweden’s ambassador to Abu Dhabi to protest the Quran burning incident, the UAE’s state news agency WAM said.                  In January early this year Iraqi protesters clashed with security forces outside the Swedish embassy for a separate incident of Quran burning in Stockholm.

A single person took part in the planned Quran burning in the Swedish capital and images of the event show he was the only person apart from his translator at the demonstration, which coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, one of the most significant in the Islamic calendar.                 The decision to permit the protest was made in accordance with the right of freedom of speech, Swedish police said, adding that the demonstration does not pose an immediate security risk.                 But allowing such an inflammatory protest stirred a backlash in Turkey, a NATO member state that has obstructed Sweden’s accession bid. Sweden and neighboring Finland both formally applied to join the bloc after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.”                 Turkey’s foreign minister condemned the protest on Wednesday, calling it a “heinous act.”                 “It is unacceptable to allow these anti-Islamic actions under the pretext of freedom of expression. To turn a blind eye to such heinous acts is to be complicit in them,” Hakan Fidan said in a statement.                  The Turkish government’s Director of Communicaitons Fahrettin Altun added in a tweet: “We are sick and tired of enabling of Islamophobia and continued instances of hatred for our religion on the part of European authorities especially in Sweden.”                 “Those who seek to become our allies in NATO, cannot tolerate or enable destructive behaviors of Islamophobic and xenophobic terrorists,” he said.                 NATO officials are hoping to avoid the embarrassment of seeing the alliance miss its own stated aim of admitting Sweden to the alliance by July 11 – the date of its next official summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Officials fear that missing this deadline will send a humiliating and potentially dangerous message to the alliance’s adversaries.                 Turkey – a strategically important NATO member due to its geographical location in both the Middle East and Europe, and the alliance’s second-largest military power – has proven the greatest obstacle to Sweden’s NATO accession bid.                 Earlier this year, Turkish-Swedish relations suffered a major blow following a rally outside Stockholm’s Turkish Embassy during which an anti-immigration politician set a copy of the Quran alight.                 The incident sparked anger in the Turkish capital, Ankara, where protesters took to the streets and burned the Swedish flag outside the Swedish embassy in response.                 At the time, the then Turkish foreign minister reportedly blamed the Swedish government, saying it had “taken part in this crime by allowing this vile act” to go ahead, according to state news agency Anadolu.                 An Eastern European diplomat told CNN that as well as “emboldening the enemies” of NATO, any delay to Sweden’s accession risks “giving the sense of Erdogan’s power over the alliance.” The diplomat added that “Erdogan will use the moment to squeeze every drop from this situation and will throw the ball to Sweden – making them hostage of their (own) anti-terrorist laws.”                 Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said that Sweden has fulfilled the necessary requirements set out by Turkey in order to join NATO, including introducing a new terrorism law.                 “New legislation has recently entered into force in Sweden that makes it illegal to participate in a terrorist organization in any way that promotes, strengthens or supports it. We are thereby delivering on the last parts of our agreement,” Billstrom said.                 But the decision to permit a Quran-burning protest may further damage Sweden’s relations with Turkey and dent the country’s hopes to join NATO.                 Speaking to CNN on the phone earlier on Wednesday, the protester Salwan Momika said he came to Sweden five years ago from Iraq and has Swedish citizenship. He told CNN he identifies as an atheist.                 He said he was doing this demonstration after three months of legal battles in court.                 “This book should be banned in the world because of the danger it causes to democracy, ethics, human values, human rights, and women’s rights. It just doesn’t work in this time and age,” he said.                 A police permit obtained by CNN states that the “security risks and consequences connected to a Quran burning are not of such a nature that, according to current law, they can be the basis for a decision to reject an application for a general meeting.”                 The permit for the demonstration says that Quran burnings “mean an increased risk of a terrorist attack” and “can also have foreign policy consequences.”                   However, it added that for “security problems to be the basis for a decision to refuse a general assembly, these must have a clear connection to the planned gathering or its immediate surroundings.”                   Authorities granted permission for the gathering according to certain conditions, including a fire ban in place in Stockholm since June 12, which “applies until further notice.”                 Speaking to CNN on the phone, Stockholm police spokesperson Helena Bostrom Thomas said that police had informed the applicant to find out about those restrictions but added that “freedom of speech weighs heavier than if he acts against the restrictions of the fire ban.”       CNN’s Luke McGee, Alex Hardie, Duarte Mendonca and Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou contributed reporting. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Two hours drive from Kenya’s coastal tourist town of Malindi, forensic teams turn off the tarred road into a thicket of thorn bush, entering a crime scene that came to light in mid-March.                  CNN has traveled here as investigators uncover what could become one of the worst mass suicides in recent memory.                    Detectives say that the cult community was split into eight separate settlements with biblical names such as Galilee and Bethlehem. In site after site, shallow graves disturb the dirt. Many of the graves were unmarked.                 Already, more than 300 sets of bodies have been recovered. But Kenyan interior ministry officials say that scores of mass graves remain.                 The cult was preparing for the end of the world under the instruction of their its powerful pastor, say investigators.                 Followers believed that starvation was their ticket to their salvation                 The revelation of mass graves has dominated headlines and shaken the collective psyche in a country where faith and religion are central.                  Many find it difficult to comprehend the dark path that Pastor Paul Nthenge Mackenzie allegedly took his followers along.                 But the trajectory it is all too familiar for cult specialists and psychologists. They contend that the “Shakahola Massacre,” as it has been dubbed, bears all the hallmarks of destructive cults past and present.                 “The pastor called me. He called me and said, ‘my daughter, you are being left behind. When the ark is closed, you will be too late,’” says Agnes, as her children play on a reed mat in her yard in Malindi.                  Like many former cult members, she was unwilling to share her full name.                  Agnes, now 26, joined Mackenzie’s church when she was still in high school along with other members of her family.                 In Kenya, there is an old joke that if you lose your job, start a church or a charity. And sometime in the early 2000s, Mackenzie abandoned his job as a taxi driver and launched the Good News International Ministry.                  Mackenzie became known for his fiery sermons. He drew a significant following, says an assistant pastor who worked with him for years until they had a falling out.                  He did not wish to be named as he said he is a witness in the investigation.                  “In the beginning, the church was good, there were no issues. The sermons were normal, but from 2010 his ‘end time’ messages began. It happened step by step,” he says.                 The assistant pastor says Mackenzie told his followers to pull their children out of school, discard their national IDs, avoid hospitals, and start preparing for the end of the world. Investigators say they have corroborated those details.                  He drew in flight attendants and social workers; paramilitary police and professionals from all across Kenya.                  At a recent hearing Mackenzie denied all knowledge of the horrors that witnesses, inspectors, and survivors believe happened in the Shakahola forest.                  “I can tell nothing about that. Because I have been in custody for two months. So, I don’t know what is going outside there. Have you been there?” he asked CNN.                  When asked about the accusations that followers of his group had starved their children following his instructions, Mackenzie said he had “never seen anybody starving.”                 The pastor and his closest followers have been in custody since the mass graves were discovered, although they are yet to be charged as prosecutors continue to ask the court to extend the custody period to allow further investigation.                 To understand the Shakahola cult, the focus must be on Mackenzie, says Rick Ross, a leading American cult expert who has studied destructive cults for decades.                  “It’s not the group; it’s the leader. The more power they have, the more it becomes intoxicating,” he says.                  Ross says that from Charles Manson and David Koresh to Ugandan cult leader Joseph Kibwetere, the desire is to control.                 “My feeling is Mackenzie was the same. He was a man that no matter how much control and power he had over his followers, it was never enough,” says Ross.     'Is my mum dead or not?': Son fears mother may be among Kenya starvation cult victims             Mackenzie exerted that control using his pulpit – and his charismatic oratory both in his church in Malindi and online.                 “Look what will befall all nations of this world. Anger, frustration, and many things, and many disasters will make human beings cry without help. That is what will cover the world,” he prophesied to his followers in early 2020 in a nearly three-hours harangue.                 Mackenzie’s prophecies had an impact. He persuaded Agnes and many like her to leave school.                  Agnes says she shaved her head and entered a church-arranged marriage.              “Some of his preaching turned into reality. He said that diseases would come and then the Coronavirus came,” she says.                  Last year, she moved her whole family to the forest.                  While cult leaders are central to their cults, they still need to amass a following.                  Dr. Geoffrey Wango, a professor of psychology at Nairobi University, says that, paradoxically, destructive cults give people hope.                  “The psychology of it is simple. The cult leader offers hope and promise and seeks easy targets,” he says.                  In the case of Mackenzie, he says, the hope is one of salvation and to turn your back on the stresses of daily survival.                  While the draw of cults is universal, Wango believes that you can’t separate the central position of religion in Kenya.                 Religion permeates right through the highest echelons of government. Kenya’s President Ruto became the country’s first evangelical president last year and built a place of worship in the presidential compound.     Religious leader linked to Kenya starvation cult says court hearing is a 'matter of intimidation'             Ruto condemned the grim discovery at Shakahola in the strongest terms, saying “we must as a nation continue to be on the lookout for those who abuse even the religious sector,” adding that Mackenzie belongs in jail.                 Poverty is also a significant factor in driving people to more extreme preachers, Wango said.                  “People are looking for a way out of their poverty, a way out of their desperation. And here is a religion that offers them a way out,” he says.                  Of course, there are extensive examples of the wealthy joining cults. The recent Nxivm cult in the US drew in the rich and powerful.                 But Ross, who helped expose Nxivm, says cults exploit individual vulnerabilities.                 “It could be anyone, but if someone is going through a difficult time in their life, or you lose your job, or do badly in school, or struggling financially, you are feeling unfulfilled, then a group like this comes along and it can be very alluring,” he says.                  Once inside a cult, both agree that isolation – physical and mental – is a critical factor that helps drive the horrors of doomsday cults.                 By 2018, Kenyan authorities started cracking down on Mackenzie. They arrested and detained him for his anti-government stance – but never prosecuted him.                  “That is when he said that God had told him to close his church and that he was no longer a pastor,” says his former assistant pastor.                 Mackenzie would soon start his forest scheme. Agnes says he charged them around $80 for a patch of land.                   “There were more than a thousand people living in the forest,” she says.                  The assistant pastor believes it was around 300 families.                 Many people had no idea where their loved ones had disappeared to.                   When Francis Wanje got wind earlier this year that his daughter and her family were inside the Shakahola forest with other cult members, his first reaction was that it had to be wrong.                 “I could not even believe it. I was told something bad was happening in the forest. But I couldn’t understand how she could be there,” he says.                 Wanje’s daughter and son-in-law both had decent jobs.                  He knew that they were attending Mackenzie’s church. But when they moved to the forest, they told him they were relocating to a different part of Kenya.                 “The social isolation is critical and has striking similarities with other destructive cults,” says Ross.                  It’s in the forest that investigators say Mackenzie’s cult took on its final form.                  In a court affidavit obtained by CNN, inspectors wrote that Mackenzie told his followers sometime early this year that the end of the world was imminent and that they should start fasting.                 “He stated that fasting would start with the children until the last child died then followed by the youth, then women and lastly men and that he would be the last to die and ascend to heaven,” the affidavit reads.                 Kenya’s state pathologist says many of the remains found show signs of extreme starvation, some were smothered, and a few showed blunt force trauma. There were scores of children amongst the dead.                 After Wanje received his disturbing call he organized a private rescue mission to the forest where he says they found his oldest grandchild.                 He was deeply malnourished – his two siblings were already dead.                  Wanje says they were suffocated by their parents.                 “It’s so painful, I could not even explain it because it’s something that I didn’t even think of in my life,” he says.                 “And I wonder how my child, my daughter, could change to be such an animal to kill her own children just because she wanted to go see Jesus.”                 Village elders in a nearby forest say they notified the authorities that starving children were escaping the forest from as early as late last year.                  The president and other senior leaders have apologized to Kenyans for the slow response and made promises to regulate religious sects.                 “Without a doubt, I can say definitively, had the police responded sooner, then lives would have been saved. I feel as a country we have failed these Kenyans,” says Khalid Hussein, the director of Haki Africa, a group that helped expose the cult.                 Agnes says that as time went on, the life in the cult became more extreme.                 “Each month there were meetings where he told us what Jesus had said. It was heartbreaking,” she says.                   Agnes says she escaped the forest in September last year when she was told she couldn’t get help from another woman to deliver her third child. Mackenzie’s spell was broken.                 But the aftershocks of the Shakahola massacre could be long-lasting. Police pulled scores of followers from the forest – many of whom didn’t want to be rescued.                 Even those who were dying.                   “When they got to the hospital some gave false names and others refused to be treated, they didn’t want to be helped, they didn’t want to miss out,” says Dr. David Man’ong’o, medical superintendent of the Malindi subcounty hospital.      Psychiatrists to assess starvation cult survivors as they continue to refuse food             Eventually, they had to hand them back to police.                 The rescued followers, many of them either witnesses or still under suspicion, are being kept in a nearby rescue center where therapists are trying to break their emotional and psychological ties to Mackenzie.                 Last week, the Director of Public Prosecutions said that 65 people rescued from the forest were charged with attempted suicide for refusing to eat.                 Rick Ross says it could be a months-long process to “deprogram” cult members.                   For loved ones of those who survived, it will also be a painful road. Wanje says he will get his grandson back in a few weeks.                 “He went through hell. He went through hell. When he was rescued, he told them that if you had come maybe a bit later, he would have already gone to see Jesus because his grave was already there,” he says.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Half of people globally still believe men make better political leaders than women; more than 40% believe men make better business executives than women; and 25% believe it is justified for a man to beat his wife, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report released Monday found, reflecting the latest data from the World Values Survey.                 Biased gender social norms are a major barrier to achieving gender equality, the report’s authors warn, adding that the undervaluation of women’s capabilities and rights in society constrains women’s choices and opportunities.     Why have women been so disproportionately affected by Covid-19? Experts explain              These biases were shown across regions, income, level of development and cultures, the report’s authors added, noting that UNDP’s composite measure of gender inequality in empowerment, known as the global Gender Inequality Index (GII), has remained stagnant since 2019.                 This means that the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030, the report, which reflects views from 80 countries and territories and covers 85% of the global population, notes.                  These biases manifest in numerous ways, such as in an underrepresentation of women in leadership. In the labor market, women occupy less than a third of managerial positions, while the picture remains grim at the highest level of leadership: The share of women as heads of state or heads of government has remained around 10% since 1995, the report finds.                   This gap does not reflect education levels. In the 59 countries where women are now more highly educated than men, the average gender income gap remains 39% in favor of men.                 A global backlash against women’s rights and the far-reaching consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic have worsened the issue, the report notes.                 “Social norms that impair women’s rights are also detrimental to society more broadly, dampening the expansion of human development. In fact, lack of progress on gender social norms is unfolding against a human development crisis: the global Human Development Index (HDI) declined in 2020 for the first time on record—and again the following year,” Pedro Conceição, head of UNDP’s Human Development Report Office, said in a statement.                  “Everyone stands to gain from ensuring freedom and agency for women,” he added.     Gender equality will take 300 years to achieve, UN chief warns             However, change is possible. The report’s authors give examples of parental leave policies altering perceptions around caring responsibilities, and labor market reforms leading to a change in beliefs around women in the workplace.                  Governments have a crucial role in shifting gender social norms, the authors note.                  “An important place to start is recognizing the economic value of unpaid care work. This can be a very effective way of challenging gender norms around how care work is viewed,” said Raquel Lagunas, director of UNDP’s Gender Team.                  “In countries with the highest levels of gender biases against women, it is estimated that women spend over six times as much time as men on unpaid care work,” Lagunas added.                 Progress toward gender equality is “vanishing before our eyes,” United Nations Secretary General António Guterres warned in March, adding that gender equality is “300 years away,” according to the latest estimates from UN Women, the UN organization dedicated to gender equality and women’s empowerment.                 Guterres cited high rates of maternal mortality, girls being forced into early marriage, and girls being kidnapped and assaulted for attending school as evidence that hope of achieving gender equality “is growing more distant.”                 “Women’s rights are being abused, threatened, and violated around the world,” Guterres said, naming a few countries in particular, including Afghanistan, where he said “women and girls have been erased from public life.”                 Guterres also said that “in many places, women’s sexual and reproductive rights are being rolled back,” though he didn’t specify where.                 Last June, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving the right to abortion up to individual states. The year before, a ban on abortions due to fetal defects took effect in Poland – effectively ending almost all abortions in the country.                 To achieve gender equality, Guterres called for “collective” and “urgent” action, from increasing education, income and employment for women and girls, especially in developing nations in the Global South, to promoting the participation of women and girls in science and technology.                 “Centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and harmful stereotypes have created a huge gender gap in science and technology,” Guterres said. “Let’s be clear: global frameworks are not working for the world’s women and girls. They need to change.”       CNN’s Tara Subramaniam contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The apparent alteration of a mosque belonging to the Hui ethnic group in Najiaying village, Yunnan province comes amid a sweeping campaign unleashed by China’s leader Xi Jinping to “sinicize” religion.                  The policy aims to purge religious faiths of foreign influence and align them more closely with traditional Chinese culture – and the authoritarian rule of the officially atheist Communist Party.                 In recent years, authorities have removed overtly Islamic architecture – destroying domes and tearing down minarets – from more than a thousand Hui mosques across the country, Hui activists say, with the Najiaying mosque being one of the last holdouts.                 Now, the “sinicization” campaign appears to be finally coming for Najiaying – a historic home to the Hui and an important hub for Islamic culture in Yunnan, an ethnically diverse province on China’s borders with Southeast Asia.                  But the push has faced a fierce backlash from local residents.     Videos posted on social media and geolocated by CNN show residents clashing with lines of police officers in riot gear, who blocked off the entrance to the mosque and pushed back the crowd with shields and batons.                 Residents shouted back in anger, with some hurling water bottles and bricks at the police, the videos show.                  “This is our last bit of dignity,” a local witness told CNN. “It’s like coming to our house to demolish our home. We can’t allow that to happen.”                 The source, who declined to be named over fears for personal safety, said thousands of Hui residents – including men and women, elderly and children – had gathered around the mosque on Saturday, under the close watch of more than 1,000 police officers deployed nearby.                 “After arriving at the mosque, we realized that they had driven the cranes into the compound and were ready for the forced demolition,” the source said, adding that scaffolding had already been erected around the mosque.                   Tensions escalated around 1 p.m., with worshipers demanding to enter the mosque for noon prayers, the source said. They said they saw police officers hitting the crowd with batons, which prompted some residents to clash with police.                 Dozens of protesters were arrested by police at the scene, the source said. Ma Ju, a prominent Hui activist who now lives in the United States and has kept close contact with Najiaying residents, said about 30 people were arrested.                 CNN cannot independently verify the claims and has reached out to the local police and government for comment. CNN has also reached out to the Yunnan provincial government and its bureau for religious affairs for comment.                 The hours-long standoff on Saturday yielded a temporary win for the protesters, who streamed into the mosque as the police retreated, according to the witness and online videos.                 Throughout Saturday night and Sunday, residents took turns to guard the mosque, fearing that authorities would return to demolish its large centerpiece green dome and four minarets, the source said.                  But repercussions quickly followed, according to those CNN spoke with.                 By Sunday afternoon, word started to spread that authorities were arresting more people, according to the source.                 On Sunday evening, law enforcement authorities in Nagu township, where Najiaying is located, issued a stern but vague statement. Without mentioning the protest or the mosque, it said police were investigating an incident that took place on Saturday, which “seriously disrupted social order” and caused “vile social impact.”                 The authorities also called on the “organizers and participants” of the incident to turn themselves in before June 6 to receive leniency, and encouraged the public to report on each other.                 By Monday, Najiaying was shrouded in a blanket of fear, the source said.                 The internet has been cut off in many neighborhoods. Drones buzzed overhead and surveilled the village. Public loudspeakers blasted the authorities’ message on repeat, urging protesters to turn themselves in, according to the source and Ma, the US-based activist.                 “It feels like our nightmare is only starting now,” the source told CNN. “Everyone is in fear…We don’t know what’s going to happen next.”                 Other local residents appeared fearful to speak out.                  One shop owner reached by CNN on the phone said: “You journalists should come here to report on what’s happening to us.” When asked by CNN to explain what happened, he replied he “didn’t know” and hung up.                 This is not the first time that Hui Muslims have engaged in a tense standoff with authorities to protect a mosque.                 In 2018, thousands of Hui residents in Ningxia, in the country’s northwest, staged a sit-in protest for three days to prevent authorities from demolishing a newly constructed mosque.                 The local government held off on the demolition, but later replaced the mosque’s domes and minarets with traditional Chinese-style pagodas.                 The architectural overhaul of mosques has come with allegations of shrinking religious freedoms for the Hui, a 11 million-strong ethnic minority that live in scattered pockets throughout China from the northwest to the coastal cities in the east, including an officially designated “autonomous region,” Ningxia.                 Believed to be distant descendants of Arab and Persian traders, the Hui have been well assimilated into broader Chinese society dominated by the ethnic Han majority.                  Most speak Mandarin, live alongside the Han, and in recent decades had been given more space to practice their faith than other ethnic groups.                 But Hui activists say their ethnic group has become the latest target in the Communist Party’s crackdown on Islam, which began in the western region of Xinjiang.                 Since at least 2017, the Chinese government has been accused of detaining more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in internment camps in Xinjiang and conducting forceful assimilation to suppress their cultural and religious identity.                  A United Nations report last year accused the Chinese government of serious human rights violations against Uyghurs that may amount to “crime against humanity.”                 China has repeatedly denied these accusations and insisted that the massive camps are voluntary “vocational training centers.”                 Hui activists and rights groups claim authorities have stepped up efforts in recent years to restrict religious practices of Hui Muslims across China, including the shuttering of Islamic schools, Arabic classes and barring children from learning and practicing Islam.                 The implementation of the “sinicization” campaign has “had the effect of expunging communities of their connections to Hui culture, religion, and each other so thoroughly that some leaders view the erasure of a meaningful Hui identity within another generation as being a likely possibility,” according to a report submitted to a UN treaty body in January by the Chinese Human Rights Defenders and the Hope Umbrella International Foundation.                 Ma, the US-based Hui activist who founded the Hope Umbrella International Foundation, said Hui in China are now living in a constant state of fear.                 Over two hundred mosques in Yunnan have already lost their domes and minarets, according to Ma, adding to the more than a thousand mosques in the country’s northwest.                 CNN is unable to independently verify the number of mosques affected, and has reached out to the Chinese government for comment on the accusations made by Hui activists.                 “At first, people thought it was only a question of architectural style…but it soon became apparent that (the government) is not only removing the domes from the mosques, but also removing their religious and social functionality,” Ma said.                 Under a raft of restrictions imposed by the government, many Hui are now afraid to go to the mosque, which has long been a center of religious and social life for their communities, Ma said.                 The end goal of the party is to implement a policy of “cultural and religious genocide,” just as it did in Xinjiang, he said. The Chinese government has denied accusations of genocide.                 For the resident in Najiaying, the government’s plan to change the design of the mosque is only the harbinger of a harsher crackdown to come.                  “This is only the first step. What we worry about is after that, (the authorities) will ban our children from going to (religious) classes, bar minors from entering mosques and forbid us from studying the Quran,” they said, referring to the alleged restrictions that have been imposed on Hui communities across China.                 “After they trampled on your dignity, they will suppress you step by step, and assimilate the Hui ethnic group completely into the Han, generation by generation. Because we know, this is what they did to Xinjiang,” they said.                 Despite the permeating culture of fear, they have vowed to “fight till the end” for the freedom of belief and the dignity of the Hui ethnicity.                 “We commoners don’t ask for much. We just want to have our own religious freedom. We just want to live in peace,” they said.                 “I want the world to know what we’re going through right now, and what we’re fearing next.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

And I’m not alone.”                 This is the original teaser for Indian filmmaker Sudipto Sen’s controversial new movie, “The Kerala Story,” the latest box office hit in India despite fears it is deepening religious tensions between majority Hindus and Muslims in the nation of 1.4 billion.                  The low-budget, scripted film has taken $24 million since its release just over two weeks ago, according to Box Office India, a worrying sign according to Debasish Roy Chowdhury, co-author of “To Kill A Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism.”                 Movies like these are “custom-made to spread hate, trigger Islamophobia and justify violence against Muslims,” he said.                 Filmmakers had initially attempted to present the movie as based on a true story of three women in the southern state of Kerala who were allegedly lured into converting to Islam and trafficked into joining ISIS. According to the filmmakers, these women were pawns in a “dangerous conspiracy” hatched against India that has seen tens of thousands of Indian women follow the same path.                  But critics were quick to point out that simply wasn’t true – and there was no evidence to support such a claim. Last week, India’s Supreme Court ordered the filmmakers to add a disclaimer that says the film is a fictionalized version of events, and that there is no data to back its claims of broader conspiracy to radicalize Indian women.                  According to a 2020 report from the US state department’s Country Reports on Terrorism 2020, there were “66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS” as of November that year. In 2021, India’s National Investigation Agency said it had arrested 168 people connected to 37 cases “of terror attacks, conspiracy, and funding” inspired by ISIS. Neither report provided a gender breakdown.                 Kerala’s chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has called the story “fake,” and others say the film perpetuates negative stereotypes of Muslims at a time of increasing religious polarization.                 But many prominent politicians from the country’s ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have praised the film, with some BJP-ruled states even waiving tax on tickets.                 The main character, Unnikrishnan, portrayed by Indian actress Adah Sharma, is depicted as an innocent, fun-loving Hindu girl, studying at a college in Kerala. She befriends her three roommates, including a young Muslim woman.              In the film’s trailer, the Muslim roommate is seen conspiring with older Muslim men at an “Islamic Study Center,” where they instruct a group of boys to “isolate” Unnikrishnan and her roommates from their families. “Develop physical relations… If required, make them pregnant,” an elderly, bearded man, wearing traditional Islamic clothes, says.                  The Muslim roommate makes derogatory comments toward Hindu gods and claims that women who wear hijabs are never raped.                 Unnikrishnan and the two other women appear to become brainwashed to marry Muslim men, convert to Islam, and join ISIS. The trailer also depicts scenes of brutal violence against women, over chants of “Allah is great.”                   Speaking to reporters in Mumbai last week, filmmaker Sen said they “have done a service to the nation” by making the film.                   The film’s producer, Vipul Amrutlal Shah, said they knew the film would be labeled as propaganda. “We knew every criticism that would come our way. But that should not deter us,” he added. “Our country needs to be woken up.”      India's latest box office smash 'The Kashmir Files' exposes deepening religious divides             However, some movie critics have slammed the film for its factual inaccuracy and failure to provide nuance.                  Independent news outlet The Wire called it “a propaganda film that thrives on shock value.”                 Critic Sowmya Rajendran wrote “all the creative liberties … are presented as the absolute truth, with no serious attempt to understand why such radicalisation takes place and what feeds it.”                  Shubhra Gupta from the Indian Express called it “a poorly-made, poorly-acted rant which is not interested in interrogating the social complexities of Kerala, an India state proud of its multi-religious, multi-ethnic identity.”                  She criticized the filmmakers for stereotypes, writing: “All the Muslim figures in the film are dark and intimidating.”                  Several BJP politicians have praised the film for drawing the nation’s attention to “love jihad” – a term used by radical Hindu groups who accuse Muslim men of attempting to convert women of other faiths to Islam.                 Some BJP-run states have introduced anti-conversion laws targeting “love jihad,” making it increasingly difficult for inter-faith couples to marry or for people to convert religions – a move lambasted by rights group for being unconstitutional and Islamophobic.             India’s northern Uttar Pradesh state, which is governed by Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu monk-turned-politician, was one of the first states to pass the law.                  “The Kerala Story draws the attention of the entire nation to the conspiracy of love jihad,” Adityanath told reporters after a special screening of the film. “The entire society must be made aware of this distortion.”                  Critics say religious polarization has increased since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP swept to power in 2014, prompting tensions between Hindus, who make up more than 80% of the country’s population, and Muslims, to simmer.                  Modi, who was campaigning for the BJP during local elections earlier this month, said “The Kerala Story” was “trying to expose the consequences of terrorism in society,” while accusing opposition parties of trying to ban the film.                  According to Chowdhury, the film “follows the familiar pattern of the Modi government’s unalloyed backing of hateful and divisive cinema.”                 He said the film’s success “should be taken as a sign of radicalization” of society.                 “There is no room for cinema like this in the civilized world, because my freedom of expression ends when it begins to threaten your freedom to exist,” he said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/19/asia/isis-k-attacks-afghanistan-taliban-cmd-intl/index.html,‘No one feels safe’: The Taliban promised to provide security to Afghans. New data shows threat from ISIS is growing,"Amid warnings from the United States that Afghanistan is becoming a staging ground for attacks on the West, new open-source data reveals the growing threat ISIS poses to civilians inside the country.","May 19, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Eliza Mackintosh,International,"Qasim received a call in late March that his brother, an employee with Afghanistan’s Taliban government, had been seriously injured in a suicide bombing near the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kabul.                  The 32-year-old rushed to the hospital with his family, but when they got there he was told by the doctors his brother was already dead.                 The explosion hit a security checkpoint as government employees were leaving work for the day. It struck at the heart of what was, until the collapse of the former Afghan government in August 2021, the capital’s heavily fortified diplomatic enclave, known as the “Green Zone.” The attack was later claimed by Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K — the group’s second strike on the ministry this year, as it focuses its firepower on high-profile targets, attempting to undermine the Taliban’s rule and erode public confidence in its assurances of security.                  “The Taliban are saying that they protect us, but really they cannot. Still we face threats from different groups in Afghanistan. I don’t know who is really behind these incidents, ISIS or others,” Qasim, who asked that his last name not be used due to security concerns, told CNN.                 “Currently we don’t have security in Afghanistan at all, whenever we go out we don’t know if we will come home alive or not,” he added.                 In the nearly two years since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan, ISIS-K has scaled up the volume and complexity of attacks across the country, putting pressure on the new government and raising concerns in the West about the possible regeneration of a group that could once again pose a serious threat internationally.                 ISIS-K and the Taliban, both Sunni Islamist extremist groups, are enemies with differing ideologies, fighting each other for control over parts of the country — and recruits.                 ISIS-K’s recent attacks have largely been aimed at the Taliban and other symbolic targets, as well as at Afghanistan’s Shia Muslim minorities, in particular the ethnic Hazaras. Bombings have increased in urban areas, leaving hundreds injured and dead. Between late 2022 and early 2023, ISIS-K attacked the Pakistani and Russian embassies, hit a hotel where Chinese business representatives were staying and carried out an explosion at an air force compound.                  The group has frequently published its claims in its weekly newsletter, Al Naba, alleging that it has struck on 283 occasions in Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover, killing at least 670 people and injuring 1,200 — a significant uptick in casualties per attack.                 With media restrictions severely affecting journalists’ ability to report independently in the country, and an absence of Western intelligence, it’s difficult to verify these figures. In an address to the Security Council in March, the head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), Roza Otunbayeva, said that ISIS-K posed “a growing threat,” and raised concerns over the Taliban’s capacity to cope with that challenge. But the Taliban have insisted that it has full control.                 In light of patchy information on the ground, analysts are increasingly turning to open sources to assess the state of play in Afghanistan.     Afghan Witness, a project run by the UK-based Centre for Information Resilience, which monitors human rights in the country, this week released a new dataset of verified abuses and violent incidents since the Taliban’s takeover. The data, which is available in a live map, includes 367 pieces of open-source evidence — largely videos and images shared on social media — about 70 ISIS-K attacks since August 2021. Taken together, they reveal a gradual shift in the group’s activities in Afghanistan — from a few small-scale attacks targeting Taliban patrols and checkpoints in rural areas, such as the eastern Nangarhar province, where ISIS has maintained a presence since 2015, to a concentration of attacks in urban areas, including in the capital, Kabul, Herat in the west, and Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz in the north.                 Before the Taliban’s return to power, ISIS-K had not claimed any attacks in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan’s third most populous city, but since then the group has claimed nine, including a blast in March that killed the Taliban governor of Balkh province in his office. In the first year under the Taliban’s new government, ISIS-K claimed eight attacks in Kunduz city.                 Afghan Witness’ data on verified attacks and ISIS-K claims reflect the group’s continued targeting of civilians, notably the Hazara community in Kabul, Herat and other cities, though attacks have slowed over the past few months as the group has focused on higher-profile Taliban targets.                 “It is clear from the data and propaganda that they are pursuing elements of strategies used elsewhere, such as the targeting of minorities to promote sectarianism, and they have become increasingly bold in targeting high-profile and symbolic targets within Afghanistan,” said David Osborn, team leader of Afghan Witness.                  “Recently, the Taliban appear to have conducted a series of raids against the Islamic State, coinciding with a reduced number of attacks by the group. This is the picture we get from open source but in the long term it is unclear how far the Taliban’s actions will blunt Islamic State-Khorasan’s capability inside Afghanistan,” he added.                 Despite the Taliban’s promises of a more moderate form of rule than when they were last in power two decades ago, they have reintroduced harsh measures in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, including public executions, flogging and banning women from education and the workplace.                  As the Taliban try to minimize the threat ISIS-K poses, attacks on civilians continue.                  “We’ve seen Islamic State-Khorasan target Shia Hazara as they attend schools, mosques and festivities. What is most striking is the helplessness of those caught up in the violence and the constant state of instability and fear that is created by the attacks,” Osborn said of Afghan Witness’ research. These communities feel the de facto authorities won’t defend them, after years having been persecuted by the Taliban themselves, he added.                  Nearly half of the attacks verified by Afghan Witness hit crowds as they gathered in public spaces, including markets, schools, hospitals, funerals, weddings and religious services.                 In October 2021, two months after the US withdrawal, ISIS-K fighters bypassed Taliban security to access Imam Bargah Mosque, the largest Shia mosque in Kandahar, a city in the south of the country, during Friday prayers. They shot the temple guards, then detonated their explosive vests among the crowds, claiming to have killed and wounded more than 100 people. At the time, CNN was able to confirm more than 30 deaths.                 A year later, in September 2022, a suicide bombing struck Kaaj Educational Center in Kabul’s Dasht-e-Barchi district — a predominantly Hazara and Shia neighborhood that had suffered several devastating ISIS-K attacks before the Taliban took over — killing at least 25 people. The students, many of them girls, were taking a practice university entrance exam. The attack, videos of which were verified by Afghan Witness, was not claimed by ISIS-K, but, according to analysts, bore the hallmarks of the group.                 Earlier that month, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that Taliban authorities “had an obligation to protect at-risk communities” from repeated ISIS-K attacks, but that those authorities were failing to provide them with security, based on interviews with 21 survivors and their family members. Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, has also called for investigations into attacks on Hazara, Shia and Sufi communities, which he described as bearing the hallmarks of “crimes against humanity.”                 Fatima Amiri, 18, was among the students sitting the exam when gunfire erupted. She lost an ear and an eye in the attack that also shattered her jaw, and is still receiving medical treatment for her injuries. She recalls students screaming as a gunman opened fire on them at their desks, followed by the sound of an explosion, and her peers lying bloody around her on the floor.                 “I saw many of my classmates were dying. I tried to escape. All the ways were closed. I climbed on a wall and jumped, I was in a bad condition full of blood,” she said. “I am now a half-normal human being with one eye and one ear.”                  “We know that the Taliban cannot protect us. No one feels safe currently in Afghanistan.”                 ISIS-K’s attacks have stoked anxiety among US officials about the group’s capabilities, with some warning that it could soon develop the ability to strike Western targets.                 Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla, head of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), told lawmakers in March that ISIS-K had become more emboldened, aiming to grow its ranks and inspire or direct attacks in the region and beyond. He estimated that the group would be able to conduct “an external operation against US or Western interests abroad in under six months, with little to no warning.” Pressed about where terrorist attacks originating in Afghanistan might be directed, Kurilla said Europe or Asia were more likely targets than the United States.                 Kurilla’s statement highlights one of the chief concerns among Western intelligence — that now, in the wake of the US withdrawal, it is difficult if not impossible to assess the Taliban’s effectiveness in curtailing ISIS-K. With no military or diplomatic presence on the ground, and drones now having to fly many hours from distant bases to get to Afghanistan for reconnaissance, intelligence access is incredibly limited, according to US officials and analysts.                  For that reason, some have disparaged the Biden administration’s “over-the-horizon” strategy — aimed at striking terrorists without American boots on the ground — as “over the rainbow.” They point to the botched US drone strike in Kabul that killed 10 civilians, including an aid worker and seven children, as an example of the pitfalls for intelligence agencies even before the complete withdrawal, and the killing of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri as one of the sole successes to date.                 In a 2023 threat assessment report by US intelligence agencies, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that ISIS-K “almost certainly retains the intent to conduct operations in the West and will continue efforts to attack outside Afghanistan.”                  The US has not recognized the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. US officials are not cooperating with the Taliban to counter ISIS-K, nor does the US share any intelligence information with them, CENTCOM spokesperson Maj. John Moore told CNN. Instead, the Taliban are fighting the group — which the US estimates now numbers between 2,000 and 2,500 fighters in Afghanistan — on its own.                   The uptick in violence has put the Taliban in a difficult spot. After two decades fighting their own insurgency, they are grappling with delivering security and sticking to their signature pledge under the US-Taliban Doha Agreement in 2020, to prevent any group from using Afghanistan to threaten the safety of the US and its allies.                  Taliban security forces have been waging ongoing operations and night raids against ISIS-K. The raids often target civilians accused of harboring or helping ISIS-K members, with the Taliban assaulting and detaining people without due process, according to research by Human Rights Watch (HRW). In some cases, Taliban authorities have forcibly disappeared or killed detainees, dumping or displaying bodies in public areas.                  “The Taliban have been going after them in ways that are actually counterproductive because they have tackled them in the same way that everyone who’s been in power in Afghanistan has tackled insurgencies, which is as brutally as possible, which means you stir up a lot of resentment in local communities, and that stirs up more recruits,” Patricia Gossman, associate director for HRW’s Asia division, said. “We documented a number of raids by the Taliban in Kunar and Nangarhar, which ended up with a lot of people being killed who may or may not have had anything to do with ISIS-K.”                 The US National Security Council claimed in April that the Taliban had killed the ISIS-K leader who plotted the deadly 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul international airport’s Abbey Gate, which was carried out amid chaotic evacuation efforts, killing 13 US service members and more than 170 Afghans who were trying to flee the country. In the days prior to the attack, the suicide bomber was among thousands of prisoners who were freed by the Taliban from Parwan detention facility at Bagram air base and Pul-e-Charkhi prison.                 “In 2021, ISIS-K was reduced to a couple of cells in the country and a very tiny, small stronghold in Kunar Province, and that was it. However, in the less than stellar handover procedure, in that chaos, the Taliban opened the prisons, including Bagram, which was a big mistake … they underestimated that there were also a couple of thousand ISIS-K members, who, once freed, just walked off,” said Hans-Jakob Schindler, senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, who served as a member and then as coordinator of the UN Security Council’s ISIL, al Qaeda and Taliban Monitoring Team.                  “The organization was very diligently able to reestablish itself.”                 UN Secretary-General António Guterres reported in January 2022 that the number of ISIS-K recruits had doubled in less than a year, from approximately 2,200 to nearly 4,000 fighters, with up to half of them foreign terrorist fighters, according to one assessment. Their ranks were buoyed by the prison breaks, and their diverse membership has meant the Taliban risk defections by countering them, Schindler said, adding that could spur anti-Taliban factionalism. Since the group was established in 2015, ISIS-K has included a number of former Taliban, as well as Pakistani fighters, including from the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States in 2010.                  The group, operating in compartmented cells, is capitalizing on loose tactical partnerships and a large number of unaffiliated fighters, or freelance jihadists, who now have greater access than ever before to a large number of capabilities following the United States’ hurried departure, according to Javid Ahmad, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center who is tracking ISIS-K’s activities.       'I screamed so loud, I blacked out': Afghans tell of the Taliban's return to their old torture playbook             “They now have unfettered access to the black market, for purchasing not just light weapons, but fertilizers for explosives, smaller commercial drones, which they can customize. They have access to sophisticated communication equipment. They are buying laser-guided sniper weapons. They have access to night vision goggles. And oftentimes when they do targeted assassinations, that’s how they do it,” said Ahmad, formerly Afghanistan’s ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, who has worked with the US defense community.                 Ahmad and Schindler both say that the ISIS-K bombing at the entrance of the foreign ministry, past at least three checkpoints, reflects the group’s growing access to intelligence and its capacity to execute complex operations. And though it has not yet demonstrated its ability to carry out attacks outside of Afghanistan, it has ambitions to do so, they agree.                  “We are about to repeat the same mistake that we did in the 1990s, believing that Afghanistan … has very little if anything to do with us,” Schindler said. “We took the eye off the ball and we are about to do the same thing again.”                 Leaked classified documents from the Pentagon, obtained by The Washington Post in April, portray Afghanistan as a staging ground for ISIS-K, and suggest the group is a growing threat to the US, Europe and Asia. The US intelligence assessment, which was disseminated on the Discord messaging platform, revealed the group’s efforts to coordinate several external operations, targeting embassies, churches, business centers and the 2023 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament, the Post reported.                 Responding to a question about the leaks, Vedant Patel, the US State Department’s deputy spokesperson, said: “The degradation of ISIS in the region continues to be a top priority for this administration and it’s something that we continue to work collectively on with our allies and partners.”                 The Taliban rejected the report, with its spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, saying in a statement on Twitter that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan “has full control over the country and does not allow anyone to use Afghanistan against the security of any other country,” adding that terrorist groups like ISIS-K had been “severely affected and are in the process of being destroyed.”     CNN’s Oren Liebermann contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.             As Saudi Arabia continues its drive to attract tourists, authorities in the country appear to be reaching out to a particularly lucrative section of the market: LGBTQ travelers.                 The website of the Saudi Tourism Authority (STA) seems to have had its Q&A section updated to state that gay visitors are welcome in the kingdom.                 “Everyone is welcome to visit Saudi Arabia and visitors are not asked to disclose such personal details,” is the website’s response to the question on its FAQ page: “Are LGBT visitors welcome to visit Saudi Arabia?”                 It is not known exactly when the website was updated. A spokesperson for the STA said the policy had previously been in place, but an archived version of the website on March 14, 2023 and before did not have the question and answer on the page.                 Same-sex sexual activity is an offense in Saudi Arabia, according to Human Rights Watch.                  According to the Human Dignity Trust, which campaigns for the rights of LGBT people around the world, trans people can also face prosecution in Saudi, with “substantial evidence of the law being enforced” and “consistent reports of discrimination and violence” against LGBTQ people.                  LGBTQ+ travelers are a lucrative market, according to Darren Burn, CEO of Out Of Office, a luxury travel planning service for the community, and of Travel Gay, the world’s largest LGBTQ+ travel platform.                  “Research shows they spend more money in a destination than heterosexual couples, and tend to travel more times a year,” he told CNN.                  “It’s a very interesting and lucrative demographic, and countries are plowing major revenue into [attracting] it.”                 Whether LGBTQ travelers will feel comfortable traveling to Saudi, however, is another matter. Burn said that destinations such as the Maldives and Dubai, where homosexuality is a criminal offense, are popular, but without more assurances from the authorities, Saudi Arabia could be a tougher sell.                 “It’s pretty vague, and doesn’t offer the assurances that would make me feel able to send our clients safely to the destination, but anything on the website about LGBT travelers is a good starting point,” he said.                  “I can’t think of another Middle Eastern tourist board that has even mentioned them, except Qatar in the run-up to the World Cup, and even that was vague, saying that everyone was welcome.                 “But my concern is what the reality is like in the destination. Are they saying that a same-sex couple can check into a hotel and get a double bed without any issues? My hunch would be that that’s not the reality.”                 One gay traveler who visited Saudi Arabia on a work trip in October 2022 – before the website was updated – told CNN that he felt “in the closet” during his stay.                 The UK traveler – who did not want to be named – spent time in AlUla, one of Saudi’s tourism-focused destinations.                  “It was OK for a week or so but after that I suddenly realized it gone back to living a life in the closet and not being my true self. More out of fear of what might happen – the unknown – rather than anything specific that happened,” he said.                  “I was sent an email [by the company I was working for] with what I should do. They basically told me to delete anything even remotely LGBTQI related from my phone – all photos, apps, newspapers and magazines. My Egyptian friend suggested I just get a new clean phone.                 “I told close colleagues, but I wasn’t [generally] talking about being gay, or my past experience. I kept it to myself, and suddenly realized that I wasn’t able to talk about what I would normally talk about, and that’s not how I want to live. In practice everyone was very relaxed, but the law’s the law.”     What it's like to visit Saudi Arabia now             However, he added that one “revelation” from his trip was “how friendly and welcoming the Saudi people were.                 “They’re really open to changing attitudes, but they haven’t really [been in contact] with the Western world in their lifetimes. Unless you meet people [from other cultures] and talk about differences there’s no way of learning from them.                 “I found that what the law and the authorities say is very different to how the locals interact with you.                 “If you were to go there and be overtly gay I’d be quite concerned – I wouldn’t feel comfortable going there with a partner – but it’s a country that’s changing very quickly.”                 Saudi Arabia is focusing on expanding its tourism sector, appealing to archaeology fans at the likes of AlUla, where ruins have been left untouched for almost 2,000 years, and creating entire new cities to appeal to visitors.                  CNN’s Richard Quest, who visited in September 2022, wrote that: “I have seen countries change before, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like the change taking place in Saudi Arabia. Saudi’s change is deliberate, deep-reaching and dramatic.” He also flagged its “contradictions,” however – after his visit, 81 people were executed in a single day.                  Human rights researcher Nora Noralla told CNN that the kingdom is following Qatar and Dubai in its bid to attract LGBTQ+ travelers. But she warned that it might not be on the travelers’ terms.                  “In Dubai there are a lot of gay influencers, and as long as you understand the context of the area you’re in and respect the traditional culture and not show your queerness in any way, you’re OK,” she said.                  “That requires you to be cis-passing. If you show up and you’re non-binary, or male with makeup on, or obviously trans, and come to the region you’ll be denied entrance. I wouldn’t say LGBT people are welcome – they say same-sex couples are welcome, and that’s entirely different.”                 She also warned that what goes for “rich tourists” doesn’t fly for others. “Queer residents know what lines they can cross, and it’s all down to your economic and social background,” she said. “They realize the risks with this kind of activity and know how to do it in a discreet way. This [the new move] is basically for Western tourists.                  “They’re trying to copy the Dubai model so they can get some of their money. There’s a lot of competition [for money]. If you’re a cis, gay Westerner you’re welcome. If you’re trans and cis-passing, you’re welcome. But anything that remotely shows your queerness, you’re not. And I think if anyone crosses a line, they will definitely act swiftly.”      What it's like to visit Saudi Arabia now             Despite his skepticism, Darren Burn thinks Saudi could potentially be a gay-friendly destination.                 “We’d welcome a conversation with the tourist board and government to work out a way that LGBTQ+ travelers can genuinely travel in a safe way, to see them put money behind promoting to LGBT communities, and making changes to LGBT rights locally to make Saudi Arabia an authentic destination that appeals.                  “We all know the reason destinations are welcoming tourists now is because they think that’s their future income stream, but that’s good, because it might drive changes in equality law if it’s good for business.”                 He added that travel can broaden minds on both sides.                  “Without travel and tourists coming to the destinations, mindsets would never change – as long as they can do so safely, LGBTQ+ travelers can break down barriers,” he said.                 “Destinations do change – but I don’t think we’d be sending customers any time soon until we can receive assurances that they’d be safe, welcome and able to check in.”                 An STA spokesperson said in a statement: “Everyone is welcome to visit Saudi, provided that they follow and respect our culture, traditions and laws, as you would when you visit any other country in the world.                  “Like other governments, we do not ask visitors personal questions and we respect the right to privacy.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             On the grounds of the Al-Aqsa complex, one of the most revered places in Islam and Judaism, a delicate balance that governs this holy site is under strain.                     Only Muslims are allowed to pray on the sacred grounds known to them as Al Haram Al Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as Temple Mount under a status quo arrangement originally reached more than a century ago. Non-Muslim visitors are allowed visits at certain times and only to certain areas of the complex.                      But many in the Muslim world fear the right to be the sole worshipers at the holy site is slowly being eroded by a growing far-right Jewish movement.                    The complex lies in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state and which most of the international community considers to be occupied territory. Israel captured it from Jordan in a 1967 war and considers both East and West Jerusalem as its united, “eternal capital.”                    It is the complex where Israeli police conducted violent raids twice in less than 24-hours last week. Videos shared on social media showed Israeli police beating screaming Muslim worshipers with batons. Police said they stormed the mosque itself after “hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators barricaded themselves” inside, throwing fireworks and stones at them.                    The violence prompted rocket fire from southern Lebanon and Gaza that Israel blamed on Palestinian militants. Israel retaliated with airstrikes.                   Two Muslim-born CNN journalists were given permission to report from the compound by the Jordanian custodians of the site.                   The compound was relatively calm when CNN visited Tuesday. At the gates of Al-Aqsa mosque, the main mosque in the compound, a group of women recited the Quran ahead of afternoon prayers. It has been a tumultuous Ramadan and Tuesday brought more tensions.                    “I feel pain. True pain deep inside,” Um Kamal Al-Kurdi, a Palestinian resident of the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem told CNN on Tuesday morning. “This is a house of God. It is for worship. Not for occupation or provocation. Even as we pray, we are provoked and monitored by the Israelis.”                     As al-Kurdi spoke, a group of mostly Jewish visitors walked past, escorted by heavily armed Israeli police. One officer filmed the group of women as they began reciting the Quran louder and louder. A raised voice in recitation was their only form of protest in this brief but tense moment.                      By Tuesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced it would prohibit non-Muslims from entering the holy site for the rest of Ramadan. The decision isn’t unprecedented, but his far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said in a statement that it was “a serious mistake that will not bring peace, but may only escalate the situation.”                     The compound consists of large open courtyards as well as the Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock.                  The mosque and dome are built on top of the site where Jews believe their first and second temples stood, and is known as Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism. The Western Wall is believed to be part of the second temple complex, and sits below the courtyard. It is the site that Jew face in prayer.                     Most leading Rabbis say Jews should not step foot on the site. But a growing movement of Jewish extremists has been campaigning to be allowed to perform prayers on the grounds, a call that could upend the status quo arrangement that governs the management of the site. CNN witnessed at least two Jewish worshippers praying without being stopped or removed by police.                      Ben Gvir is a vocal advocate of Jewish prayer at the site. Once considered the fringe of Israeli politics, having been previously convicted of supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, his visit to the compound earlier this year drew international condemnation.        The situation in Jerusalem is boiling over. Here's how it all happened             Jordan’s Hashemite monarchy is the custodian of the complex, based on an agreement that dates back to 1924, and it manages the site under an Islamic trust called the Waqf. But Jordan’s role is becoming increasingly symbolic, experts say, because it is Israel that controls the security checks at entry points and therefore access to the sacred grounds. Tourists can enter during visiting hours on their own, but religious Jews are often escorted by heavily armed guards.                      Sheikh Azzam Khatib, the director general of the Waqf, sees these increasing visits of Jewish groups under Israeli police escort as a provocation to Palestinians and the wider Muslim word.                      “I see these visits as a raid on our holy site,” he said. “Israel should keep its hands off the mosque and the compound because this is a violation (of the sanctity of the site) … and can lead to events that cannot be contained.”                     The status quo itself is an unwieldly subject, fraught with debate. It is not a traditional treaty signed by the various parties during some ceremony, instead built on historical precedents dating back to the Ottoman Empire, amended and agreed upon by various bodies from the British, to the United Nations and beyond. That status quo is slowly being chipped away, says Sheikh Rani Abusibr, an Imam of nearly twenty-years at Al-Aqsa.                      “History is always written by the powerful,” Abusibr said. “Of course, it is expected that if there is no force to stand-up against this encroachment then our rights can easily be lost.”                     Some Jewish extremist calls go beyond the demand for prayer. Far-right fringe movements want to see a third Jewish temple built at the site. On the day of CNN’s visit, small groups of Jewish radicals taunted Muslims by singing “The Temple will be built” at the gates of the compound.                      Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that he is committed to maintaining the status quo, but under his government, the most far-right in Israeli history, extremist voices are growing louder and stronger.                      For the wider Arab world, al-Aqsa is seen as the last enclave of Muslim control in the heart of East Jerusalem. CNN spoke to Muslim worshippers at the site who only gave their first names citing security concerns.                   “Al-Aqsa is ours. No matter what anyone says. Al-Aqsa is ours even it was raided by a million people,” Mohammed, a worshipper at the site, told CNN. “It is an ideology that we carry in our minds.”                      Some Palestinian worshippers must go to great lengths to reach the mosques at the complex, particularly visitors from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who generally need to obtain travel documents from Israeli authorities and can undergo lengthy waits at checkpoints and multiple security checks.                      Without the status quo arrangement being enforced, there are fears that an already tumultuous region could spiral out of control. Any perceived shift in the norms can – and has – set-off cycles of deadly violence. But these periodic flare-ups have always fallen back on the simple understanding that has maintained some semblance of order in one of the most contentious corners of the world.                      “Of course, I don’t feel safe. Everything can change in an instant, so I am always scared,” said Noor, a worshipper inside the Dome of the Rock, the golden-domed shrine that is seen in the holy city’s skyline. “But I am here because I have faith in God.”          © 2024 Cable News Network.

Should the Israeli police, “assault worshipers again, in an attempt to empty [the mosque] of worshipers, in preparation for major incursions into the mosque,” it would, “push the situation towards more tension and violence, for which everyone will pay the price,” the Jordanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ambassador Sinan al-Majali, said in a statement late on Saturday local time.                 “The Israeli government bears responsibility for the escalation in Jerusalem and in all the occupied Palestinian territories and for the deterioration that will worsen if it does not stop its incursions into the holy al-Aqsa mosque… and its terrorization of worshipers in these blessed days,” al-Majali said.                 The warning from Jordan was followed by a statement from the Israeli Foreign Ministry early on Sunday, saying that people who, “barricade themselves inside [the al-Aqsa mosque] are a dangerous mob, radicalized and incited by Hamas and other terror organizations.”      Attacks in West Bank, Tel Aviv as tensions remain high following Israeli strikes             The Israeli Foreign Ministry called on Jordan’s Waqf guards, “to immediately remove from the al-Aqsa Mosque these extremists who are planning to riot (on Sunday) during Muslim prayers on the Temple Mount and the Priestly Blessing at the Western Wall.”                 The Waqf is the Jordan-appointed body that manages the al-Aqsa mosque compound, known as the Temple Mount by Jews.                 Israeli police raided Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque twice on Wednesday last week, claiming that “hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators (had) barricaded themselves” inside.                 On Saturday night, the Israeli police again alleged that, “many youngsters [had] entered the mosque and closed the doors, for no reason.”                 Israeli police raids of al-Aqsa mosque are considered by Muslims as a major provocation.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

But as Frida Ghitis writes, the executions have only ...","Jan 10, 2023",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Frida Ghitis,International,"Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             “Dad, my sentence is death,” Mohammad Mehdi Karami informed his father in a phone call from prison last month. Then, last Saturday, the 21-year-old karate champion was executed by the Iranian regime. Karami, an Iranian Kurd, was hanged on the same day as Seyed Mohammad Hosseini, a volunteer children’s coach who was just 20. Both were accused of killing a member of the Basij paramilitary force. In the phone call, the younger Karami reportedly told his father he was tortured into making a false confession. All 16 accused in that case have denied the charges.             Their deaths add to the growing number of young protesters killed since Iranians took to the streets almost four months ago in women-led demonstrations sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. Amini, also an Iranian Kurd, died in police custody after she was detained by the morality policy for improperly wearing the hijab, the Muslim veil that Iran’s clerical rulers obligate every woman to wear.             The death count, and the relentless heartbreak, are all but certain to continue. That’s because the regime’s most powerful domestic weapon – its ability to kill protesters in order to frighten and intimidate them – is not producing its intended results. Despite mounting deaths, Iranians fed up with repression are not giving up.                 Iran’s young protesters are showing a level of courage that is nearly unfathomable. It is up to them whether or not to continue their struggle, demanding “azadi, azadi!” – “freedom!” in Farsi.                  Those watching in awe from outside Iran have other decisions to make – how will they respond as the regime kills its young? The reaction so far has been utterly inadequate.                  The Norway-based Iran Human Rights organization warns of a “serious risk of mass execution of protesters.” Already it estimates security forces have killed 481 people, including 64 children – and it believes 109 protesters face the risk of execution at this moment.     Iran executes karate champion and volunteer children's coach amid crackdown on protests             The executions occur after protesters are charged and allegedly tortured into confessing to crimes they didn’t commit, as Karami told his father on the phone that day. Human rights groups say that the proceedings have been shams, show trials, without any semblance of due process.              Hours after their executions, two other young protesters sentenced to death – Mohammed Broghani, just 19-years-old, and Mohammed Ghobadlu, 22 – were moved out of their cells into solitary confinement, raising concerns that their execution might be imminent. Their supporters spent the night rallying around the prison, hoping to stop the possible executions. As of this writing, they remain alive.                      The first known person to be executed in connection with the protests was 23-year-old Mohsen Shekari, in early December. A viral video purportedly showing his mother getting the news of his death is excruciating.                  A few days later, Iran hanged 23-year-old Majidreza Rahnavard from a construction crane in a public square in the city of Mashhad. He had been convicted of “enmity against God,” in another show trial that found him guilty of stabbing two Basijis. A little over three weeks after his arrest, he was executed before a crowd, his lifeless body suspended from a cable visible in photographs posted by the regime. His court-assigned lawyer had offered no defense.                  Almost no one expected the demonstrations to continue this long. The risks seemed to outweigh the probability of success. “Let’s be honest,” I wrote in October, the protests have been inspiring, “but also terrifying to watch.” We knew the regime would respond with brutality, and so it has.                 The beatings, the shootings, the executions, have not put an end to the protests. On the contrary, the latest executions have reignited protests at universities. Young people seem determined to risk it all for a chance at a different life. In many ways, the calls for an end to the theocracy seem unstoppable.     Opinion: Their brilliance was a mirage. How 2022 exposed the world's tyrants             For the rest of the world, there’s even more moral clarity over the issue of supporting protesters now that Iran has started providing Russia with the weaponry it is using to destroy Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure.                  As Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky told the US Congress, with Iran, “Russia found an ally in [its] genocidal policy… one terrorist has found the other.” Iran claims it only sold Russia drones before the war.                  Stern condemnation of Iran’s executions from western powers poured in almost immediately, and protesters took to the streets in some world capitals. That solidarity is important, but it’s hardly enough. The world can do more.                  Germany, one of Tehran’s top trading partners, recently announced it is suspending export credits and investment guarantees for Iran trade. It had already declared that the situation did not permit “business as usual with Iran.” The world’s responsible governments should curtail trade and quietly persuade other top trading partners, such as the United Arab Emirates India and Turkey, to review their commercial relations.                 It’s also very clear that efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – should be declared over. Biden has already admitted the deal “is dead,” even as he refuses to make the acknowledgment official. The JCPOA won’t be resuscitated, and even if that were possible, it would bring massive funding to a regime that is not just killing its own people and sowing unrest in its region but is also aiding in the destruction of another country in its partnership with Russia.             The European Union should waste no time acting on a Dutch proposal to label the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, a terrorist organization, as the US has already done. Tehran rejects the label, but evidence of the IRGC’s activities is ample, with its intervention in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.                   On the diplomatic front, western nations, led by the United States, should raise the profile of Iran’s misdeeds. Take the case to top diplomatic forums. Force a vote of condemnation at the UN Security Council, where Russia will undoubtedly veto it, and perhaps China will as well. Let us see the despots stand side by side.                 And, if Iran doesn’t relent, target visas of Iranians enjoying their travels in the West. If Iran continues killing its young students, then perhaps the children of Iranian officials and regime allies should know that their ability to study in American and European universities could soon end.                 This is the Iranian people’s fight, as it should be. It’s their country. Their lives. But the rest of the world must do more than issue statements and express disapproval. As long as the Iranian people are risking it all to fight for their freedom against a regime that has inflicted so much harm in so many places, they deserve more support than they have received.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             An Iranian official’s comment signaling that the country’s notorious morality police had been shut down has raised more questions than answers.                   Hasty clarifications by state media that sought to rebut the official’s comment quickly followed, along with pushback on social media by activists denying the so-called victory and even denouncing it as a “PR stunt” by the Iranian regime to silence protesters.                    Experts warned about embracing pledges of either the abolition of the morality police or of the hijab law it seeks to enforce, noting that often regimes will make empty promises to citizens in desperate bids to quell unrest.                    During a religious conference on Saturday in the city of Qom, Attorney General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri said that the Iranian morality police was being “abolished,” a comment that was quickly picked up by international media outlets, some of which hailed the “announcement” as a victory for Iranians who have been protesting against the government for months.                   Montazeri’s comment came in response to a reporter who asked if the country’s morality police – or “guidance patrol” – were being disbanded. The attorney general was quoted by an Iranian state media outlet as saying: “Morality police have nothing to do with the judiciary. It was abolished from the same place it was launched.”                   It is possible the comment was misinterpreted, and the tone from state media quickly changed.                   On Sunday, state media was keen to downplay Montazeri’s comments, saying that the morality police does not fall under the authority of the judiciary.        Iran says hijab law is under review, as state media dismisses claims morality police has been abolished             Arab-language Al-Alam state television claimed foreign media were depicting Montazeri’s comments as “a retreat on the part of the Islamic Republic from its stance on hijab and religious morality as a result of the protests”, but that all that could be understood from his comments was that the morality police were not directly related to the judiciary.                   “No official of the Islamic Republic of Iran has said that the Guidance Patrol has been shut,” Al-Alam said Sunday afternoon.                   The decision to dismantle the morality police technically lies with the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution, a body established in the early 1980s by Iran’s first Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini, and which is today headed by President Ebrahim Raisi.                   CNN has reached out to Iran’s Interior Ministry and the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution for comment.                 Montazeri’s comments about the morality police came just two days after the pro-reform outlet Entekhab reported him saying that Iran’s parliament and judiciary were reviewing the country’s mandatory hijab law, which has been in place since 1983.                   A law enforcement body with access to power, arms and detention centers, the morality police are a major point of grievance for Iranians. Notorious for terrorizing citizens as they enforce the country’s conservative rules, the morality police have been the main coercive tool implementing Iran’s hijab law.                   The morality police were cast into the international spotlight in September, when 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died three days after being arrested by the force and taken to a “re-education” center. The group is sanctioned by the United States and the European Union.                   Since protesters took to the streets, however, witnesses say that the morality police had virtually disappeared from the streets of Tehran, greatly diminishing the state’s ability to regulate women’s dress codes.                    “We see a lot of images, photos, videos of women in public places walking around without the hijab much more than what we had seen before September of this year,” Iranian-American journalist and political analyst Negar Mortazavi told CNN on Monday.                    As Iranian security forces scramble to shut down protests, enforcing hijab may have no longer been a priority, says Sadjadpour.                    “That’s not because their ideology has changed,” he told CNN, “but because their repressive bandwidth is limited.”                   The morality police’s absence from the streets also raised questions about their relevance. While their abolition would indeed count as a win for protesters, experts say, there are other, deeper grievances driving protesters to the streets.                    “When dictatorships know they’re in trouble they begin promising their citizens they will change who they are,” wrote Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington DC.                   “These empty promises tend to embolden, rather than quell, popular demands for fundamental change,” he wrote on Twitter. “The Iranian regime appears to be entering this stage of its life cycle.”       Iran's morality police have terrorized women for decades. Who are they?              Omid Memarian, a US-based Iran analyst, said the morality police had “already become irrelevant” in the wake of the ongoing protests. “When people chant across the country, ‘the Islamic Republic should go,’ such moves seem desperate. The regime is incapable of addressing the real grievances,” he wrote on Twitter.                   Others worry that the Iranian regime may simply “rebrand” the morality police, in an effort to distance itself from its ominous name whilst maintaining tight control over mandatory hijab.                     “In a way it has been interpreted as a play on words because essentially he is saying that there is no morality police, or guidance patrol,” said Mortazavi. “It has in some way been replaced or rebranded as the police of public safety.”                   Mortazavi continued to say that the morality police have become “so notorious” that no official is “willing to take responsibility for it” and it is unclear “how sustainable it is going to be long term.”                   “It goes back to how this enforcement of this law that is still on paper going to be stopped or changed,” she said. “Or is it going to come back after a different brand or a different name or different methods.”        Zahid Mahmood contributed to this report.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

How did he come to be there? Why did the police shoot at his vehicle? And did his outspoken reporting – often critical of the military establishment that wields considerable power in Pakistan – have anything to do with his death?                  One month since Arshad Sharif was killed, Kenyan and Pakistani authorities have not concluded their reports nor have there been any arrests in the case.                   Conflicting accounts offered by the Kenyan police and Pakistani authorities have not provided further clarity. First, police said it was a case of mistaken identity. Later, they said shots were fired from the journalist’s car. Pakistan’s interior minister has cast doubt on the police reports, claiming earlier this month that it was a “targeted killing,” adding that more evidence was needed to “to confirm all this.”                 Pakistani media have aired various lurid theories about the night Sharif died. Some reports suggested the journalist was tortured for hours before he was shot dead, alleging broken fingers, broken ribs, missing fingernails, and other torture marks.                  However, post-mortem reports from separate autopsies carried out in Kenya and Pakistan, obtained by CNN, both concluded that Sharif died from multiple injuries after gunshots to the head and chest. Neither of the reports documented evidence of torture.                 Pakistani media have alleged his fingernails were removed by torture, but it’s standard in Kenya to extract fingernails in an autopsy for DNA, Dr. Ahmed Kalebi, an independent pathologist in Nairobi who has reviewed both reports told CNN.       Killing of Pakistani journalist in Kenya was 'targeted' attack, minister says             The conflicting stories have sown doubt and frustration for Sharif’s family, who are skeptical they will get answers to the mystery of his death.                    “I have no faith in the Pakistani government,” his mother, Riffat Ara Alvi told CNN in a video interview.                    She said she wrote a letter to Pakistan’s Chief Justice this month imploring the Supreme Court to set up a judicial commission “to determine the real motive and identify criminals behind this heinous crime.”                   “It’s not possible to get justice in Pakistan and in Kenya. I know that. But I request all the international journalistic organizations and United Nations to investigate this killing,” his widow, Javeria Siddique told CNN.                  CNN has contacted Pakistan’s high commission in Nairobi for comment on the case.                    In his home country, Sharif was a critic of the Pakistani military and an ally of former prime minister Imran Khan, who was ousted in April after a no confidence vote in parliament. Sharif’s vocal opposition to the current administration earned him many enemies and his family and friends say left the journalist so terrified for his life, he fled the country.                  He also faced sedition charges for allegedly criticizing state institutions and “abetting mutiny” within the military. Former Prime Minister Khan described Sharif, 49, as “one of the best investigative journalists in Pakistan,” and told CNN on November 7 that Sharif had exposed a plot against him, without giving further details.                  “This guy was exposing this whole plot against me. He was hounded out of Pakistan,” Khan claimed.                   Khan was himself shot at a political rally earlier this month and his party called the attack an assassination attempt by establishment figures – which has been vehemently denied by the government and security officials.                  Sharif left Pakistan a month after writing to Pakistan’s Supreme Court and to the president, according to letters obtained by CNN, notifying them of threats against his and other journalists’ lives. “Journalists in Pakistan are subjected to charges of sedition and terrorism to stifle dissent and criticism against the powerful elements of state. It appears that a reign of terror has been unleashed against the media persons who have independent opinions,” he wrote.                 He had initially gone to Dubai but was forced to flee again due to “harassment by Pakistani officials,” the associate said.                  Pakistani investigators traveled to Dubai the week of November 14 to probe Sharif’s stay there, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The team questioned Sharif’s contacts and hosts there, as well as the owner of ARY television, the station Sharif worked for and their investigation is ongoing, the sources said.                  With limited country options for obtaining a visa after he was expelled from Dubai, Sharif traveled to Kenya, one of the few countries he was able to get a quick e-visa with his Pakistani passport, according to his close associate.                  Sharif landed in Kenya around August 20, according to his wife and a close associate, where he quietly lived his life mostly in hiding, for two months – always in fear of being attacked, his friends and family said.                  “He had never disclosed his location to all of us- his family, his mother, to me. He was saying that I’m hiding somewhere because I’m not feeling safe and they are going to assassinate me, so I’m not going to tell you where I am right now,” his wife Siddique recounted.                 Siddique, 35, told CNN he sent her a text message to let her know he was in “far, far away jungles.” However, it wasn’t until news of his killing emerged that Sharif’s mother and wife came to learn he had been in Kenya.                     “He was so kind-hearted, and generous, and he was a brilliant photographer. We did photography together,” Siddique said.                   When Sharif was in Nairobi, he would rarely leave the apartment he was staying in, out of fear of being recognized, his close associate told CNN.                  However, during his two-month stay, he traveled to the outskirts of Nairobi to a shooting range and lodge called Ammodump more than once, according to people with knowledge of the matter.                 On the day he died, Sharif had spent time at a bonfire and barbeque happening near the camp, according to a staff member who did not want to be named.                  After dinner, Sharif and the brother of the owner of Ammodump left together, the staff member said.                   Sharif and Khurram Ahmed  left  Ammodump around 8:30 p.m. local time, a detective involved in the case told CNN.                  Police arrived at the crime scene, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) away from the site of the shooting where Ahmad finally stopped, after 10 p.m. local time, said the detective who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.                  That same evening, police were on the lookout for a reported stolen vehicle, a Mercedes-Benz delivery van, according to an initial police report. Sharif and Ahmad allegedly drove past a makeshift roadblock in a Toyota Land Cruiser which the police mistook for the missing vehicle and opened fire, killing the journalist, the police alleged.                   Four police officers were manning the roadblock, including officers from Kenya’s elite police unit, the detective said. All were standing on the driver’s side of the car when the shooting took place. The driver was not injured in the gunfire, he added.                  In a follow-up report, police said the first shots came from the car – hitting a police officer in the hand in the process – and police returned fire, shooting the car at least nine times.                   Kenya’s Independent Policing Oversight Authority, IPOA, has been tasked with investigating police conduct.                    “We are not investigating the prior events of this incident, or the prior movements and patterns of movements of this Pakistani journalist,” Elema Halake, CEO of IPOA, said. “Our mandate specifies that we only investigate the circumstances of the shooting.”                    Sharif’s death remains a hot-button issue and continues to spark outrage online. Tens of thousands of mourners flooded the streets of Islamabad to attend Sharif’s funeral in the city’s largest mosque in late October, chanting “Arshad, from your blood, revolution will come.”                 Several theories about his death have been circulated ​on social media, including by opponents of the Pakistani government and the Pakistani military who accuse them of plotting his death.      Arshad Sharif, prominent journalist who fled Pakistan, killed in shooting in Kenya             Separate investigations by Kenyan and Pakistani authorities are ongoing and in an unprecedented move, Pakistan’s intelligence chief addressed the media about Sharif’s killing last month, on the day of his funeral.                    “I have come for my agency whose officers are working day and night around the globe, I cannot remain silent when they are targeted,” Chief Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum said in a press conference.                   He called Sharif a “martyr” who had “no threat to his life in Pakistan.”                    Pakistan’s Supreme Court acknowledged the receipt of Sharif’s letter to CNN by a text message and said it was “being dealt with by following a due legal process.”                  While Pakistani President Arif Alvi said he had written a letter to the prime minister in July regarding the letter he received from Sharif, “for necessary action as per law,” in a media briefing on November 16, according to a press release from his office.                  As the investigation gathers pace on different continents, his widow Siddique is left to pick up the pieces and come to terms with his devastating loss.                     “I miss his smile, his voice, his presence,” she told CNN. “He was a great man, he was not only a great journalist, but he was a very loving person,” she remembers. “I lost a gem.”         © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/opinions/world-cup-usa-iran-activism-bishara/index.html,Opinion: This US victory is also a tale of unrealistic expectations,"In the run up to the World Cup, “Iran’s players had been placed in the no-win situation of trying to placate the Islamic leadership that runs the country and show solidarity with protesters suffering back home,” writes Motez Bishara on its loss ...","Nov 30, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Motez Bishara,International,"Editor’s Note: Motez Bishara is a freelance journalist, author and PhD researcher in sports sociology at the University of Leicester. His latest book is “Athletes Who Rock: Stories of Sacrifice, Setbacks and Success in Sports, Music and Life.” The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.              The United States’ decisive World Cup match against Iran on Tuesday provided more than just the obvious clash of cultures between the longstanding political rivals.                 The infectious trend of athlete activism that began stateside and crossed continents in recent years arrived awkwardly at the feet of the Iranian players in Qatar and was handled mostly like a soccer ball set on fire.                   The US’s 1-0 victory on a Christian Pulisic first-half goal advanced them into the knockout stage of the tournament, while Iran’s exasperated players will return home after an emotional fortnight to see what sort of reception awaits them.                   Playing in its sixth World Cup, Iran again failed to get past the group stage. But their challenges in Qatar were at least as daunting off the pitch.                  In the run up to this tournament, Iran’s players had been placed in the no-win situation of trying to placate the Islamic leadership that runs the country and show solidarity with protesters suffering back home.                  Since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini under police custody in mid-September, security forces in Iran have killed hundreds of demonstrators, according to the Iran Human Rights NGO, while injuring and imprisoning thousands more.     Opinion: Dr. Nasser 'Nas' Mohamed sought asylum in the US after coming out as gay. Here's what he wants people to know about Qatar             Gifted striker Mehdi Taremi squirmed when asked about the protesters at a press conference. While Iran’s Portuguese manager, Carlos Queiroz, was questioned by a British journalist if he was comfortable working for a country that represses the rights of women.                 Much has changed since Iran defeated the US in the 1998 World Cup. Back then, crowds of jubilant fans of Team Melli – its nickname denoting it as the people’s team – poured onto the streets, with women removing their headscarves alongside cheerful Revolutionary Guards.                 This time around, sentiment among Iranians was intensely divided over whether to cheer for or root against the national team, seen by many as willing pawns of the government in its campaign against the civil unrest. The view was reinforced by the team’s photo opportunity with President Ebrahim Raisi days before its opening match against England, a listless 6-2 loss.                 Much of that resentment stemmed from newfound expectations placed on athletes around the world to show solidarity with marginalized groups, a movement built upon the actions of American athletes over the past century that first peaked during the civil rights era of the 1960s.                 That stage of athlete activism created hard lines among those who did and did not speak out against the US government. It’s easy to forget that Jackie Robinson, the icon who broke baseball’s color barrier, called Muhammad Ali unappreciative to his country for his refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War.             This time around, sentiment among Iranians was intensely divided on whether to cheer for or root against the national team, seen by many as willing pawns of the government in its campaign against the civil unrest.              Motez Bishara                  As Arthur Ashe once said about his decision to focus on his game early in his tennis career, rather than address racial segregation in the sport: “In those days, if you were a moderate it was the same thing as being an Uncle Tom.”                 Since the police killing of George Floyd in May 2020, athlete activism has been reawakened to those same heights on an unprecedented scale globally. Witness the scene before Friday’s showcase match between England and the US, when the entire England squad took a knee – an anti-racist gesture made famous by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 – as American players stood and watched.                 Rarely has an international sporting event experienced so much controversy, with footballers speaking up for the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers who built stadiums in Qatar under much-scrutinized conditions.                 Yet words – or in the case of the German national team, gestures of silence – have not been enough for some, as similar with-us-or-against-us lines have been drawn from the days of Ali and Ashe.      Seven European team captains, including Harry Kane of England, were criticized for dropping plans to wear LGBTQ rainbow armbands despite facing yellow cards that would have put them at risk of a match ban in the tournament.                 No team, however, faced greater risk for playing the role of activists than Iran, with US Soccer raising the tension this week by removing the emblem of the Islamic Republic from Iran’s flag on a now-deleted social media graphic in support of human rights for Iranian women. Iran’s soccer federation responded by petitioning FIFA to ban the Americans from the tournament.                   US head coach Gregg Berhalter said he had no prior knowledge of the post and apologized, but one wonders whether US Soccer, who confirmed to CNN the gesture was deliberate but always intended to be temporary, were playing mischief to get into the heads of their opponents. (In the same press conference as Berhalter’s apology, clearly ruffled Iranian journalists asked him pointedly about US immigration policy and challenged US team captain Tyler Adams, who is Black, to address discrimination against Black people in America.)     Opinion: A look at one of the two athletes Obama said inspired him most             But despite reports of dissension in their camp, Iran’s footballers began the tournament weighing in on their domestic strife when they refused to sing their national anthem before facing England, while Europe-based players Ehsan Hajsafi and Sardar Azmoun verbally backed the protesters.                 Days later, Iranian-Kurdish player Voria Ghafouri became the latest of several current and former footballers arrested for “incitement against the regime” – a menacing harbinger for Team Melli.                 What punishment could the players or their families face if they continued to provoke the Islamic Republic? One far worse than a yellow card, no doubt.                 Instead, the Iranians came out mouthing their national anthem to jeers from the crowd before their second group match against Wales on Friday, as if to say, “We’re done being activists, let’s let our play do our talking for us.” And that it did. The lifting of that moral burden was reflected in Team Melli’s spirited play, resulting in a thrilling 2-0 victory, with both goals scored in 11 minutes of extra time.                 Iranian players exulted on the field to an ecstatic crowd, but so nuanced are feelings towards Team Melli that even their celebrations were deemed as too excessive by some in light of those who were persecuted back home.                 Iran’s plight in this World Cup should serve as a reminder that social protest does not necessarily align with the conditions of all athletes and should not always be expected of them.                  The old adage in sports is that winning cures all. On Tuesday, however, the Iranians looked spent, and despite needing only a draw against the US to advance, struggled to pose a threat until the dying minutes of the match.                 Perhaps they will have better luck in four years’ time when the World Cup is hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Should Iran qualify, tough questions will no doubt be placed on their players once again.       © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Sign up here.             Electronic music, strobe lights, glittered faces and hundreds of thousands of people in mixed-gender gyrations are all part of a new kind of ritual in Saudi Arabia that didn’t exist just three years ago.                   The kingdom’s Soundstorm music festival, which began in 2019, is back again for its fourth year and will start on Thursday.                   In just five years since Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on musical events, the kingdom’s concert scene has arguably outshined even that of Dubai, long seen as the Gulf region’s premier entertainment hub.                   The country that has been better known as the birthplace of Islam than  a  rave capital has gone through a tremendous makeover since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS) took control of the everyday running of the kingdom in 2017. Soundstorm is an eye-catching  symbol of that change.                  For three days every winter, hundreds of thousands of people from across Saudi Arabia and the region descend on a desert site outside the capital Riyadh to listen to some of the top Western and Arab acts .                  The rave is a manifestation of the ethos behind Saudi Arabia’s socioeconomic transformation, according to Anna Jacobs, a senior analyst at the Crisis Group think tank. “(It)  is a particularly powerful example because it seeks to bring together young people and women from across Saudi Arabia and the world,” she said.                  David Guetta, Post Malone and Bruno Mars are just a few of the stars performing at  this year’s event, which prides itself as being “the loudest festival in the region,” aiming to “amplify the unseen” as it supports local and international music in the Middle East. Tickets  cost between 149 riyals  (around $40) for a single day and 6,699 riyals  (around $1,800 ) for a three-day VIP treatment.                  The festival reportedly welcomed 730,000 partygoers last year. By contrast, Las Vegas’ Electric Daisy Carnival, considered North America’s biggest dance music festival, had an attendance of over 400,000 this year.                  An event like Soundstorm was inconceivable in the country just six years ago, when the notorious religious police would roam the streets and censure Saudis for mixing with the opposite sex or flouting social norms. But it is now part of a liberalization initiative spearheaded by MBS, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. It accompanies a series of steps to relax social rules, including lifting the ban on women’s driving and reining in the religious police.                  In 2016, Saudi Arabia established the General Entertainment Authority in tandem with Vision 2030 – the crown prince’s plan to diversify its economy beyond oil, which accounts for more than half of the government’s revenue. Among its goals was to almost double household spending on cultural and entertainment activities within the kingdom. Riyadh is now seeing more than $64 billion in entertainment investment, reported Arab News, with a significant proportion of that going to the live music industry.                  Vision 2030 prides itself on offering “world-class entertainment” and says that it has organized up to 3,800 entertainment events in the country, attended by more than 80 million people.                  “The whole principle about allowing festivals is to provide youth with domestic entertainment and local tourism opportunities so they don’t need to travel abroad in search of fun,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst.                  Some conservatives may find the festival unacceptable, Shihabi said, but given that youth make up the majority of the country’s population, they remain the primary beneficiaries.                   Around two-thirds of Saudi Arabia’s population is 34 years old or younger, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. Analysts say it’s the youth that MBS needs to placate, not the conservatives.                  Alcohol continues to be banned in the kingdom, as are sexual relations between men, and unmarried couples.                   The festival is not, however, without international criticism and accusations of whitewashing the kingdom’s human rights record. Last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that performers should either “speak up” about Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations or not attend the festival at all.                  “Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars hosting massive entertainment and cultural events in a deliberate (attempt) to whitewash the country’s abysmal human rights record and the Soundstorm music festival is no different,” Joey Shea, a researcher at HRW told CNN. “The creation of the country’s local entertainment industry was accompanied by waves of arbitrary arrests of dissidents, activists, human rights defenders and ordinary Saudi citizens.”                  Shihabi rejects the argument that the festival whitewashes the country’s rights record, saying that it “has little to do with any global image and is purely focused on servicing local needs.”                  Mdlbeast, the organizers of Soundstorm, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.                   Some however argue that opening up countries to international norms and values can allow for better discussion on human rights shortcomings.                   “I think there is a way for these major international events – whether that be the World Cup in Qatar or music festivals in Saudi Arabia – to help open public discourse to critical debate,” said Jacobs.                   “They can help cultivate healthy criticism and discussion around human rights issues in the region,” she added, “and as the Gulf continues to solidify its position as the region’s center of gravity, I think this is what we will see.”                  The families of Iran’s World Cup football team had been threatened with imprisonment and torture if the players failed to “behave” ahead of the match against the United States on Tuesday, a source involved in the security of the games said.                  Following the refusal of Iranian players to sing the nation’s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21, the source said that the players were called to a meeting with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.                  The source said that they were told that their families would face “violence and torture” if they did not sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against the Tehran regime.                  Here’s the latest:      Qatar to send 2 million tons of LNG to Germany in new energy deal              QatarEnergy signed a deal on Tuesday that will allow Germany to receive flows of Qatari liquefied natural gas (LNG) over a period of at least 15 years, Qatar’s state news agency QNA said. The deal is the first of its kind to Europe from the expansion project of Qatar’s North Field, the world’s biggest gas field, and is meant to make up for some of the shortage triggered by Russian supply cuts.      US State Department approves potential anti-drone system sale to Qatar for $1 billion              The US State Department has approved the potential sale of an anti-drone system to Qatar in a deal valued at $1 billion, Reuters cited the Pentagon as saying on Tuesday. The principal contractors will be Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman Corp, the Pentagon said.       US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces fear Turkish ground invasion could start in a week             The head of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on Tuesday said a Turkish ground invasion could take place in a matter of days if Turkey does not see forceful opposition to a military incursion from countries such as the  US and Russia.                  Qatar’s World Cup chief Hassan Al-Thawadi said that between 400 and 500 migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament – a greater figure than Qatari officials have cited previously.                  In an interview with Piers Morgan which aired on TalkTV on Monday, Al-Thawadi was asked about the number of migrant workers fatalities due to construction for the World Cup and said: “The estimate is around 400, between 400 and 500.                  “I don’t have the exact number, that’s something that’s been discussed. One death is too many, it’s as simple as that.”                  In November 2022, a government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on World Cup stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths.

Beginning construction in 2017, the solar-powered rover has been developed by Dubai’s Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) and is named after the emirate’s late ruler Sheikh Rashid Al Saeed.                   The rover will take a low-energy route and is expected to land on the lunar surface in March 2023. The vehicle will be delivered by the Japanese HAKUTO-R lander and will touch down on the Atlas crater.                    It will spend one lunar day (equivalent to 14.75 days Earth time) where it will analyze the plasma of the moon’s surface and conduct experiments on lunar dust. It will then spend another lunar day in which it will attempt to survive the moon’s harsh environment, before decommissioning.                   The launch aims to be the first step in the UAE’s greater space prospects. By 2117, the country aims to have a colony built on Mars’s surface. “We are starting small,” Hamad Al Marzooqi, project manager of the Emirates Lunar Mission at the MBRSC, told CNN. “But we hope that this small step will be eventually the starting point to reach our targets.”                  The UAE launched a mission to Mars in February last year.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/middleeast/why-arabs-are-furious-world-cup-mime-intl/index.html,Why some Arabs and Muslims feel stung by coverage of the Qatar World Cup,This year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.,"Nov 24, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Nadeen Ebrahim,International,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.             “Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker,” FIFA chief Gianni Infantino said in a fiery tirade on Saturday, comparing his own plight as a redhead son of migrants to that of marginalized communities.                   His ostensible empathy with Qatar was due to the barrage of criticism the nation has faced in Western media for hosting the tournament.                    But it’s hypocritical of the West to be giving lessons in morality to others, he said.                   Those statements on the eve of the World Cup went viral, inviting much anger and ridicule. But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.                   Omar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized “from a Western point of view” what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.                    In the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation’s treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain’s public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.                    This year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.                    The Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into “nations and tribes” so they can get to know each other.                   According to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.        World Cup makes history with direct flights from Israel to Qatar             Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.                    But in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup.                  “Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”                  The visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn’t escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.                   Western news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.                     The Times of London on Monday said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country’s population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.                    “I think that the Western media is biased because they don’t want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],” Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.                   But some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar’s Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows “the depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.”       The Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar’s right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was “laced with hypocrisy.”        'Our dreams never came true.' These men helped build Qatar's World Cup, now they are struggling to survive             “I always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,” said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.                   “Scrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,” Al Hussein told CNN.                   “Especially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.”                   James Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been “fair and proportionate.”                   “It’s absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,” he said.                   Workers in the country continue to “face harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,” he said, adding that Qatar’s women and LGBTQ people “face serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.”                   Critics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn’t receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.                   “At the risk of engaging in whataboutism… Qatar’s human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,” said Al Hussein. “Qatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.”                   Maryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.                   “This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” she said. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”                  She noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country’s human rights shortcomings.                    “Many of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,” she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn’t help the cause of Qatar’s migrant workers.                    “The plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN. “It shouldn’t be about whataboutism.”        With additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha              Social media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.                   With media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq’s border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who’d left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.                   The covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.                   US Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is “a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.”                  Read the article here.                   Here’s the latest on the protests in Iran:                  Saudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.                  Many had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.

The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.      Russia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says              Iran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.      Saudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market              Oil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China’s rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghanistan’s Supreme Leader Alaiqadar Amirul Momineen made the “obligatory” command after meeting with judges to “investigate the cases of thieves, kidnappers, and seditionists.”                  “Those cases that have met all the Shariah conditions of limitation and retribution, you are obliged to issue the limitation and retribution, because this is the order of the Sharia… and it is obligatory to act,” Mujahid tweeted Sunday.                  Kaheld Abou El Fadl, a professor of Islamic Law at UCLA and one of the world’s leading authorities on Sharia law, told CNN there’s a rich history of debate on the laws of Sharia and various interpretations of their meaning.                 “Every point of law you’ll find 10 different opinions … Sharia is very open-ended,” he said.                 Sharia law within Islamic jurisprudence means the “search for the divine will,” El Fadl told CNN. “Although, both in Western and native discourses, it is common to use Sharia interchangeably with Islamic law, Sharia is a much broader and all encompassing concept, according to a statement from El Fadl’s website.     Women stopped from entering amusement parks in Kabul             The Taliban’s hardline implementation of the doctrine when the group was last in power from 1996 to 2001 included violent punishments, such as public executions, stoning, floggings and amputations.                 El Fadl said that within the 1400-year tradition of Sharia, those punishments were rarely implemented because the majority of Islamic jurists throughout history didn’t interpret the law the way the Taliban currently does. “The Taliban have a particular approach to Sharia that one cannot ignore,” El Fadl said. “Anyone who doesn’t fit their definition can be possibly put to death.”                    After seizing power last August, the Taliban attempted to project a more moderate image to gain international support, but in the months since, the group has clamped down on rights and freedoms.                 Women in Afghanistan can no longer work in most sectors and require a male guardian for long-distance travel, while girls have been barred from returning to secondary school.                 Last week, women were stopped from entering amusement parks in the capital Kabul after the Taliban’s morality ministry said women’s access to public parks would be restricted. Taliban supreme leader warns foreigners not to interfere in Afghanistan             During the group’s first stint in power, the Taliban banned most forms of music as un-Islamic, and this August, in echoes of the policy,  Afghan folk singer Fawad Andarabi was dragged from his home and killed.                 Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General, told CNN the Taliban’s recent announcement regarding Sharia law was “worrying.”                  “Since they took over as de facto authority, we expect them to abide by their promise to uphold existing human rights commitments made in Afghanistan,” Haq said. “They have not been living up to the commitments. We will continue to press them on this. We are opposed to death penalty in all its forms.”                  The security situation in the country has also deteriorated since the group’s takeover last year, with the nation growing increasingly isolated and impoverished.                  Nearly half of the country faces acute hunger, according to the United Nations. An estimated 43% of Afghanistan’s population is living on less than one meal a day, with 90% of Afghans surveyed reporting food as their primary need, according to a May report by the International Rescue Committee.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The Islamic Republic is facing one of the biggest and unprecedented shows of dissent following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman detained by the morality police allegedly for not wearing her hijab properly.                 In an open letter signed by 227 of Iran’s 290 members of Parliament, Press TV reports the lawmakers calls for protesters to be taught a “good lesson” to deter others who threaten the authority of the Iranian government.                 “We, the representatives of this nation, ask all state officials, including the Judiciary, to treat those, who waged war (against the Islamic establishment) and attacked people’s life and property like the Daesh (terrorists), in a way that would serve as a good lesson in the shortest possible time,” the letter read according to state-run Press TV.                 Lawmakers added that such a punishment – the methods of which were not specified – would “prove to all that life, property, security and honor of our dear people is a red line for this (Islamic) establishment, and that it would show no leniency to anybody in this regard.”     Iran has charged at least 1,000 people in Tehran province for their alleged involvement in the nationwide protests over Amini’s death, the largest such show of dissent in years, state news agency IRNA has reported. Their trials are public and have been underway for more than a week.                  Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) said in a report last Wednesday that dozens of protesters are facing charges including “enmity against God” and “corruption on earth,” which carry the death sentence.                 The letter from the members of Parliament also reiterates prior Iranian government claims that the ongoing protests – that it calls riots – were incited by the United States and other enemies of Iran.  Iran’s government has provided no evidence to back up its claims of foreign involvement in the protest movement.       Young Iranians are rising up against decades of repression -- arguably bolder than ever             Javaid Rehman, the U.N.’s special rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, told the UN Security Council last week that as many as 14,000 people, including journalists, activists, lawyers and educators, had been arrested since protests erupted in Iran in mid-September.                 Rehman said the “unabated violent response of security forces” had caused at least 277 deaths.                 The recent death of Kurdish-Iranian woman Nasrin Qadri sparked a wave of protests in her hometown Marivan on Sunday, with the Kurdish rights group Hengaw Organization for Human Rights and activist outlet IranWire alleging that she had “suffered severe injuries” from baton blows to the head wielded by Iranian security forces.                  Her cause of death has been disputed; the public prosecutor in Shahriyar, a town about half-an-hour outside Tehran where Qadri reportedly lived, said that the initial medical diagnosis for her cause of death was poisoning, adding that according to a family statement, she had a prior illness as well, as reported by the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).                  Her father separately said in an on-camera statement which aired on Iranian state television that Qadri died from the flu and that “rumors” about her death were false – an explanation that Hengaw activist Azhin Shekhi believes was forced.                 “First they forced her family to say publicly that her death was caused by disease,” Shekhi told CNN.                 “Security forces also did not allow her relatives to gather at her parents’ house when her body was returned home, and they also forbade any kind of funeral or burial service,” Sheikh added.                   CNN cannot independently verify arrest figures, death tolls, and many of the accounts of those killed due to the Iranian government’s suppression of the media, the internet and transparency. Nor can media directly access the government for their account on such cases, unless there is reporting on state media, the mouthpiece of the government.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/middleeast/iran-saudi-cartoons-quran-mime-intl/index.html,Cartoons and Quranic verses form the latest Saudi-Iran battleground,"For Iran, attacking Saudi Arabia – or even threatening to do so – is the closest it can come to hitting America without actually hitting America, and risking catastrophic consequences.","Nov 4, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Abbas Al Lawati,International,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.             The animated simulation shows a fleet of drones approaching an oil facility belonging to Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company. Air raid sirens are heard with ominous background music as the drones aim at the facility, apparently ready to strike.                   The one-minute video ends with a telling verse from the Quran about God repelling the invaders of Mecca by having them pelted with stones from the sky. “And He sent upon them birds, in flocks,” it says.                   The aircraft have a strong resemblance to Iran’s Shahid suicide drones, which have been in the headlines lately for wreaking havoc in Ukraine.                    This footage was posted on a Telegram channel sympathetic to Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Wednesday, shortly after US and Saudi officials sounded alarms about an imminent Iranian attack on energy infrastructure in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia.                    Iran’s foreign ministry hit back, calling the reports baseless attempts by “Western and Zionist circles” aimed at “creating a negative atmosphere against the Islamic Republic.”         US and Saudi Arabia concerned that Iran may be planning attack on energy infrastructure in Middle East             But just last month, IRGC chief Hossein Salami warned Saudi Arabia of “consequences” twice in one week for its alleged support for Israel and the nationwide protests that have gripped Iran. Tehran’s Yemeni proxy, the Houthi group, also threatened to strike Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a truce in Yemen expired in October. US Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking traveled to the UAE and Saudi Arabia this week to try to “renew and expand” that truce, the State Department said Thursday.                   For Iran, attacking Saudi Arabia – or even threatening to do so – is the closest it can come to hitting America without actually hitting America, and risking catastrophic consequences. This was demonstrated in 2019, when an audacious predawn attack on Saudi oil facilities that the United States blamed on Iran was met with a largely muffled response by the Trump White House, arguably the most pro-Saudi US administration ever. Tehran’s calculations likely take that into account. Iran denied involvement then, and the attack was claimed by the Houthis.                    Iran is also proving to be a thorn in the US’s side by providing missiles and drones to foster Russia’s Ukraine invasion.                    If Iran does indeed want to cause damage to both Saudi Arabia and the Biden administration, it likely considers the time to be ripe now, given the deep fissure in Saudi-American relations.                    But its window to do so is probably small. When Aramco was hit in 2019, half of Saudi Arabia’s oil supply was knocked off the market, sending global crude prices soaring by 19.5%, the biggest jump on record. A similar scenario ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections would likely have a detrimental impact on the Democratic Party’s prospects in the vote as President Joe Biden struggles to battle inflation at home.                    The bellicose battle of cartoons and Quranic verses between Saudi Arabia and Iran isn’t new. In late 2017, an animation surfaced on YouTube from a channel called Saudi Strike Force showing the kingdom’s forces invading Iran and capturing a quivering man, eerily similar to Qasem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC’s Qods Force who was killed by the US in a January 2020 drone strike. In the footage, Iranians in Tehran are shown celebrating Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS) as their liberator.       London-based TV channel sparks Iranian leaders' ire amid protests               That video started with a quote by MBS saying Saudi Arabia will “bring the fight to Iran” and it also ended with a Quranic verse – this one about a plea from Abraham to God: “O, my Lord! Make this city (Mecca) one of peace and security and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.”                    But that was a different era. Now, the Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen and regionally has calmed, and Riyadh has actually been talking to Tehran, perhaps in an effort to prevent the heated rhetoric that culminated in the 2019 attack. The two countries held their sixth round of talks in April and both parties have cited progress.                    The messages from Iran have been mixed. Last month, while the IRGC was threatening Riyadh, the Iranian Supreme Leader’s adviser called for Saudi Arabia and Iran to reopen their embassies in each other’s capitals. “We are neighbors of Saudi Arabia and we must coexist,” said Ali Akbar Velayati.                    An Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia would serve as a convenient distraction from public civil rights protests at home due to the damage it could cause to its regional nemesis and to the global economy. This time, however, given Iran’s very public threats to Saudi Arabia, Tehran may not have the option of plausible deniability as it did in 2019.                    But the saber-rattling may also just be intended to keep the Saudis and Americans on their toes, the oil markets jittery, and prices high enough to hurt wallets and politics.                      Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi hit back at his US counterpart  Biden for voicing his support for the protest movement in the country and promising to “free Iran.”                    “A few hours ago, I was informed that the President of America absentmindedly [said] ‘We will soon free Iran.’ We were freed 43-years-ago, and Iran will never be your milking cow,” Raisi said during a televised address on Friday.                  Speaking at a campaign event in  California Thursday ahead of the midterm elections, Biden seemed to imply his administration would support Iran’s nationwide uprising, telling the crowd, “don’t worry, we’re going to free Iran, they’re going to free themselves pretty soon.”                   Here’s the latest:       Pope Francis speaks out against death penalty in Bahrain              The pontiff spoke against the death penalty on Thursday at the start of a trip to Bahrain where the opposition has accused the government of overseeing human rights abuses and families of death row inmates had sought help from the pontiff, Reuters reported.      China-GCC Free Trade Agreement nears               Talks for a free trade agreement (FTA) between China and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have entered their final stage, according to the UAE’s state news agency WAM, citing a Chinese diplomat.       Erdogan rival is first target of Turkish media law, opposition party says              Turkey’s main opposition party has said its leader is the first target of a media “disinformation” law after police asked prosecutors to open an investigation into comments he made blaming authorities for a drug “epidemic,” Reuters reported. On Monday, Republican People’s Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said on Twitter that Ankara had not questioned the origin of money brought into the country and this “dirty money” from drug smuggling had been used to finance Turkey’s current account deficit. The police and interior ministry declined to comment.                  CNN’s Hadas Gold speaks to Becky Anderson about Israel’s election, the country’s surge to the right and Netanyahu’s comeback.

Radiocarbon dating suggests the monastery belonged to a community that flourished in the emirate between the late sixth to mid-eighth centuries, into the Islamic era.                  Zaki Nusseibeh, a cultural adviser to the UAE president, described it as one of the most important archaeological discoveries in the region, according to WAM.

They also added to the moral imperative for the rest of the world to do more, writes Frida Ghitis.","Oct 30, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Frida Ghitis,International,"Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             On the 40th day after Mahsa Amini died while in the custody of the Iranian regime’s intrusive morality police, protests sparked by her death grew even more widespread, more defiant, more determined.                   They also added to the moral imperative for the rest of the world to do more.                 In Amini’s birthplace of Saqqez, where the 22-year-old also known as Zhina is now buried, thousands of people defied the police and turned out to mark an important day in the mourning process, even as security forces fired live bullets and tear gas to stop them.                 Demonstrations also took place in numerous other cities: In Isfahan, women waved black scarves in the air, chanting “Azadi, Azadi!” (“Freedom, freedom!”) in Farsi. In Shiraz, young women walked confidently on city sidewalks without veils, their hair flowing in the air in violation of Iranian law. In Amol, where authorities have already shot and killed protesters, unarmed men and women marched directly toward armed security forces, kneeled, put their hands up, and declared themselves ready to die for their cause.                  While Amini’s death has become the trigger for this uprising, it is the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, that’s become its symbol, because her run-in with the morality police was so familiar to so many women. She was visiting Tehran from her hometown in Iran’s Kurdish region last month when she was detained for, allegedly, not properly wearing her hijab – a degrading experience familiar to Iranian women who are routinely harassed for minor clothing infractions. Authorities later claimed Amini died of an illness while at a “re-education center.” Her family says she was perfectly healthy.     Iranians are risking it all to protest. Their families say some of them aren't coming home             In the weeks since, the regime has killed hundreds of peaceful protesters, among them many children and idealistic young women.                 One of the teenagers whose bravery and death has become a rallying cry is Nika Shahkarami, a 16-year-old who disappeared last month after waving her hijab in the air at a protest in Tehran, and then setting fire to another headscarf in front of a small crowd.                 Nika later turned up dead. Though Iran’s government and state media have claimed her death had nothing to do with the uprising, a CNN investigation found video and witness testimony showing she was hunted down by plain clothes Basiji militias – security forces utilized by the regime to crack down on demonstrators – following her protest. Eyewitnesses told CNN they saw Nika among groups of protesters being detained later that night. That was the last time she was seen, days before her battered body was returned to her grieving family. Now her mother, too, is rallying protesters.                  The courage of Iranians, young and old, risking it all for a chance at freedom, is defying the predictions of jaded foreign observers. Recalling previous failed protests, many have argued that the strength of this one, with its shouts “Women, life, freedom,” was little more than a doomed social media mirage.                  But the protests are persisting. Seven weeks in, they have lasted longer than any uprising since the 1979 revolution toppled the Pahlavi regime and brought to power today’s theocracy. And these protests are different from their predecessors. In 2009, the Green Movement supported a reformist candidate. In 2019, demonstrators called out harsh economic conditions.     Stalked, tortured, disappeared: Iranian authorities have a playbook for silencing dissent, and they're using it again             This time, women, and the men who have joined them, are crying out, “Death to the dictator.” This is not about reform. This is about fundamental change.                 Let’s be honest. From the first day of protests, this has been inspiring, but also terrifying to watch. We have seen what the Islamic Republic is capable of. We fear for the safety of these brave people, and it can seem irresponsible to encourage them. The odds, after all, are stacked against them. And yet, they have made the choice to continue the fight. They deserve our solidarity.                 As a group of 12 female foreign ministers declared in an October 26 statement, “we have a moral obligation” to support this women-led movement. But the people demanding their freedom in Iran need more than symbolic backing – even if symbols matter.                  The United States and other Western powers have always worried about backing Iranian protesters, because the regime already dismisses those who oppose them as tools of the West. The Obama administration allowed such concerns to muzzle its response during the 2009 protests. The Biden administration is trying to avoid making the same mistake. Already, Washington has spoken out repeatedly in support of the protest movement. On Wednesday, the State Department announced new sanctions against Iranians involved in repressing demonstrations.                 That’s a good start. Anyone – regime officials, the Basiji militias, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps – involved in crushing the protests should be banned from entering the US. Other countries should follow suit.     CNN Exclusive: After Ukraine, Biden administration turns to Musk's satellite internet for Iran              But much more can be done.                  Germany this week announced that, given the situation, there can be no “business as usual,” with Iran, launching a wide-ranging diplomatic response that includes a review of bilateral trade and financial relations, support for nongovernmental organizations monitoring crimes against protestors and expanded protections for “particularly vulnerable Iranians,” among other efforts.                   The US, its other allies, democracies across the world and any country that rejects the regime’s actions should join in isolating Iran diplomatically. Diplomatic relations should continue, but as long as Iran is killing protesters, relations should be downgraded. And Iran must be expelled from the UN Commission on the Status of Women. Its presence there is a travesty.                 Then there’s the matter of the abandoned 2015 nuclear deal – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA – which the Biden administration has been working to reinstate. Currently, negotiations to revive the deal, designed to delay Iran’s ability to build a nuclear weapon, are stuck because Iran keeps raising the stakes. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has said he foresees no return to the JCPOA in the “near term.” Such phrasing likely means the goal of reviving it has not died entirely.                 The US and its allies want to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon, an unimpeachable objective. But restarting the deal could bring hundreds of billions of dollars to the regime that is currently killing peaceful protesters, arming Russia with killer drones used to slaughter innocent Ukrainians and continuing to support terrorist groups across the Middle East. At the very least, the wisdom of reviving the nuclear deal must be reevaluated.                 The relentless bravery of the Iranian women, of the Iranian people, is a timely moral test for the rest of the world. They deserve more than they have received.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Two children were among the victims, according to state-run Press TV.                 Iranian security forces have arrested two of the suspected attackers, and a manhunt is underway to capture a third, state news said.                 The terror group ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, releasing a statement through its affiliated Amaq news agency that said one of its members had “targeted groups of Sunni refusal infidels inside the shrine with his machine gun, causing the death of tens of them.”                 Nour News Agency, which is affiliated with Iran’s top security body, said the suspects were foreign nationals.                 Wednesday evening is one of the busiest times for the shrine, reported the state-run IRNA, and eyewitnesses said an attacker was in a car before targeting worshippers at its entrance.                  The governor of Fars province said that “the terrorist first targeted the servant and guard of the shrine, and intended to attack the congregational evening prayers, but one of the servants shut the door on him,” state news said quoting the governor.                 “Loud screams were heard in the women’s section of the shrine at the time of adhan [the call for prayer] and suddenly an armed man was spotted with a Kalashnikov firing indiscriminately in the compound of the shrine,” an eyewitness told state media.                 “After the initial burst of fire, the attacker went near the shrine and fired many rounds at those present at the scene,” the eyewitness added.                 The attack took place on the same day that clashes broke out throughout Iran as thousands of people came to the burial site of Mahsa Amini in Saqqez, a city in the Kurdistan province, to mark 40 days since her death, semi-official Iranian state news agency ISNA said. It’s unclear if the attack was related to the protests.                  Protests have swept through the Islamic Republic following the death of the 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, who died on September 16 after being detained by “morality police” and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             A top Iranian military official issued a warning to Saudi Arabia last week as his government continued to face off against protesters at home. “You are involved in this matter and know that you are vulnerable, it is better to be careful,” he said at the sidelines of a military drill.                   Major General Hossein Salami, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was referring to what state news outlets called a “media war” that they say is being waged against “the Iranian youth and nation” by foreign conspirators seeking to create unrest in the country by supporting protesters there.                  Then, on Thursday Iran again warned Saudi Arabia, as well as the United States and the United Kingdom, to “stop interfering in the country’s internal affairs.”         Iran last week said it sanctioned a number of media outlets in the UK for “supporting terrorism” and “inciting violence”, reported Tasnim news agency The sanctioned entities include, among others, Volant Media, Global Media, and DMA Media, as well as the “anti-Iranian TV channels” that the companies support, such as Iran International, reported Tasnim agency.                  Now in their sixth week, protests have swept through the Islamic Republic following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died on September 16 after being detained by “morality police” and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.        Iran says it will sue US, alleging 'direct involvement' in protests              As the protests rage, Iran is turning up the heat on its adversaries, mainly the United States and Israel. But last week, Saudi Arabia found itself in the line of fire, which risks further complicating attempts by the two regional rivals to mend ties.                    Riyadh hasn’t publicly commented on the protests. The kingdom’s foreign minister refused to give his view when asked to during an interview with Al Arabiya news channel on October 12.                     “Saudi Arabia has a fixed policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of states,” he said. “Surely, we are following [the situation] and we wish Iran and its people the best.”                  Iran and Saudi Arabia severed ties in 2016 and both parties have backed opposite sides in proxy conflicts across the Middle East. Last year, they began direct talks in an attempt to improve relations. Baghdad has hosted five rounds of talks so far, the last of which was held in April.                    At the heart of Iran’s most recent accusations against Saudi Arabia may be Iran International, a Persian-language news channel that broadcasts from London. The channel has become one of the go-to sources for many Persian speakers looking for news on the protests. It has been at the forefront of covering the demonstrations, getting breaking news and exclusive footage of the events on the ground. Its Twitter account has over a million followers.                   Founded in 2017, Iran International has previously come under scrutiny by the Iranian government. Some say it is due to their coverage of the protests at home, which in recent weeks have rocked the Islamic Republic.                   Salami didn’t name the channel in his warning, but government-backed Iranian media last week accused Saudi Arabia of funding it. Saudi Arabia has not addressed the allegations. Karim Sa djadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment  for International Peace think tank in Washington DC, said on Twitter that Iran has demanded the shuttering of the channel in talks with Saudi Arabia, citing a senior Gulf official.                  In 2018, Iran International released a statement denying connections to any government, including Saudi Arabia or Iran after The Guardian reported that it was funded by a firm  whose director has ties to Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.                   Saudi Arabia did not comment on the Guardian report. The Saudi government did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.                   “We have heard these accusations before most often promoted by those in whose interests it is to deny a free press,” a spokesperson for Volant Media told CNN.                    “Iran International and its sister channel, Afghanistan International, are editorially independent television channels owned by Volant Media, a company based in London owned by a Saudi Arabian/British citizen; it has no state backing or affiliation,” added the spokesperson.      Azadeh Moaveni, associate professor of journalism at New York University, described the channel as “one of the most pernicious and damaging forces to enter the Iranian media sphere,” calling it an arm of Saudi foreign policy. “I would not describe Iran International as pro-reform, or organically Iranian in any manner,” she told CNN.        Mohammad Marandi, a professor at the University of Tehran who was also an adviser to the Iranian nuclear talks negotiating team, said there’s “no doubt” that Iran International is funded by Saudi Arabia. A prominent figure on state-funded Iranian outlets, Marandi added that Iran International spreads rumors, ethnic and sectarian strife “and it tries to use misinformation to create fear, chaos and promote violence.”                   Saudi Research and Marketing Group, a media conglomerate with ties to the Saudi ruling family, has run the Persian language website of the UK’s Independent newspaper since 2018. Its account on Instagram, where many Iranians get their news, has over 600,000 followers.                   CNN’s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which has a partnership with Saudi Research and Media Group, a Saudi joint stock company.                  Saudi Arabia has for years accused Iran of doing the same with its own Arabic-language news channels: targeting Arab audiences with propaganda. State-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting runs Al Alam TV, an Arabic news channel that has interviewed Saudi opposition figures and has been blocked by Arab states. Iran-backed Hezbollah’s Al Manar channel has also been blocked.                  “It’s about time Iran gets a taste of its own medicine,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst. “Iran has spent decades inciting and funding instability in the Arab world so having them pay the price of such behavior themselves is certainly a source of satisfaction to a lot of people,” he told CNN.       Iran faces dilemma as children join protests in 'unprecedented' phenomenon              The channel “is making an impact on public behavior in Iran and they are nervous about their domestic situation,” added Shihabi.                   Analysts say that Iran’s tight grip on domestic media outlets and its lack of freedom of expression have created “fertile ground” for anti-establishment platforms such as Iran International to flourish.                    “It is not so much the broadcasters themselves, but the situation in Iran has provided the possibility for broadcasters outside of Iran to gather a certain degree of popularity in the Iranian context,” said Gholam Khiabany, a reader in media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London.       Harun Najafizada, a former journalist at Iran International who is now a director at the sister Afghanistan International news channel, said the parent company Volant Media is privately funded but “I don’t care as long as they do not influence my editorial take,” adding that shareholders never interfere in decision making.                   Iran International stood out from other Western-backed Persian language news outlets “by taking the side of the disenchanted, oppressed, voiceless people,” while competitor Persian channels in the West were focused on bringing balance by giving the Iranian government a voice, he told CNN.                   “They have a vision, of course – they don’t do it for God,” said Najafizada, referring to the shareholders. “That vision is democracy.”                   Just two days after Salami’s first warning, however, Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, was quoted saying that the two countries should reopen their embassies to facilitate a rapprochement, according to the semi-official Iranian news agency ISNA.                    “We are neighbors of Saudi Arabia and we must coexist,” he was cited as saying by ISNA. “The embassies of the two countries should reopen in order to solve our problems in a better way.”                    Business owners and factory workers in Iran’s Kurdish region went on strike over the weekend as anti-government protests continued.                   Video shared with CNN by pro-reform activist outlet IranWire shows Sanandaj, the capital of the Kurdish region, quiet at the beginning of the work week as stores remain shut.                  The Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw said shopkeepers were on strike in Bukan, Sanandaj and Saqez, as well as Marivan. Strikes and protests have become common in cities and towns across Iran as people unite against the regime.                  The nationwide protests are now in their fifth week, triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died three days after being arrested by the country’s morality police and taken to a re-education center.                  Here’s the latest on this developing story:       Israel and Lebanon could sign maritime border agreement on Thursday, Biden energy adviser says               Senior US adviser for global energy security Amos Hochstein said on Sunday that Israel and Lebanon could sign their historic maritime borders agreement as early as Thursday.

United Arab Emirates: #Diwali               Also known as Deepavali, the holiday is widely trending across social platforms in the United Arab Emirates, with many flooding Twitter with colorful photos of candles and wishing joy and prosperity to the world.                  Some are also posting photos of themselves in traditional celebratory garments. Diwali is one of the most important festivals in Hinduism, the largest religion in India. This year, it falls on October 24.                   India and the UAE share a strong political and economic relationship, one that has grown closer in recent years.                   The Indian expatriate community in the UAE is around 3.5 million, according to the Indian embassy in the UAE, adding that it is reportedly the largest ethnic community in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf state. Approximately 15% of the diaspora are in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, added the Indian embassy, while the rest are in six northern Emirates, including business hub Dubai.                  The UAE also accounts for 33% of foreign remittances to India, at more than $20 billion a year.                   Diwali is also significant for Sikhs and Jains. It is celebrated in India, Nepal, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries with South Asian diasporas.       © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

This rhetoric arrives just before the four-year anniversary of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting – the deadliest assault on Jewish people in the US – and makes clear the persistence of antisemitism.                 “It’s hard for me to say that we, as a country, have learned anything,” Emily Tamkin, a senior editor at The New Statesman, told CNN. “I actually don’t think that the lessons that should’ve been learned from the attack were learned by Americans generally and certainly not by American politicians on the right.”                 Tamkin explores some of the fallout from the Tree of Life shooting in her new book, “Bad Jews: A History of American Jewish Politics and Identities,” a combination of historical analysis and memoir. But she doesn’t focus purely on tragedy. Rather, she gives dimension to American Jewish lives at a time when antisemitism is on the rise.     A survivor of the Holocaust and the Tree of Life massacre has died. He never lost hope in humanity             “It’d be impossible to write a book about American Jewish history and not include antisemitism. But this isn’t a book about antisemitism,” she explained. “This is a book about American Jews. American Jewish history is the history of American Jews, not the people who hate us.”                 Tamkin and I spoke at greater length about this history and the ways it ought to inform our present day. The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.     What has the social climate even just over the past several months – Whoopi Goldberg’s claim about the Holocaust in February, Ye’s antisemitic remarks – revealed about the way so many in US society view Jewish people and Jewish experiences?              I grew up in a town without many Jewish people and experienced antisemitism in my day-to-day life. So, it’s not that I’m surprised that antisemitism exists. As an adult, I’ve been a little bit surprised by the extent to which it’s been embraced by some of our politicians.                  I think that what Ye said was horrible. Personally, I’m more concerned about the fact that he was on a TV show run by a person who regularly has guests on who espouse antisemitic tropes and stereotypes.                 The fact that many people know better than to say “Jews” or “Jewish” doesn’t mean that what they’re saying isn’t antisemitic. The same week Ye tweeted about Jews, we had Tulsi Gabbard say that she was leaving the Democratic Party because it’s run by an “elitist cabal.” And Doug Mastriano, who’s running to be the governor of Pennsylvania, has slammed his Democratic opponent, Josh Shapiro, who’s Jewish, for sending his children to a Jewish day school.                  It’s important that we don’t just point to one celebrity and say, “Oh, my goodness, how could he say that?” Instead, we should look at this within the context of the current political moment.     What tension are you seeking to capture with the notion of “bad Jews”?             “Bad Jews” is a term American Jews throw at one another and ourselves. It’s a concept that many of us have deeply internalized, that we’re somehow doing this wrong. It’s a label people try to force others to wear, to claim that they’re somehow less authentic, that they haven’t inherited the tradition correctly. And this book attempts to push back.                  Right now in US politics, and specifically American Jewish politics, it sometimes feels like we’re just throwing the label of “bad Jew” back and forth at one other. Part of what I wanted to do is put this political moment in context. I started writing this book during the Trump years, when you had a president who said that American Jews who vote for Democrats, which is most American Jews, are disloyal.                  I think that when you look at American Jewish history, what you find is that there’s never been consensus on what it means to be a good American Jew, or even just an American Jew. And as much as things are changing today and as much as people might feel like we’re in crisis today and as much as things are polarized and politicized today, what I wanted to do was put the present moment in this larger context.      In one of your chapters, you tell a more complex history of Jewish people’s participation in the civil rights movement. Tell me more about why it’s important to complicate this history.              I’ve joked to some people that another title for the book could’ve been “Stories We Tell Ourselves and Why They’re Incomplete.” The common narrative is that American Jews were very supportive of the civil rights movement. Broadly speaking, this is true – there were many American Jews who supported the civil rights movement. At the same time, there were American Jews who didn’t. There were American Jews who said that rather than fighting for civil rights for Black Americans, we should be focusing on our “own” issues. There’s the broader context that for most of US history, most American Jews have gone through life as White people and been treated as White under the laws of the US.                 And it’s important to understand all of this. Just last week, we saw some American Jews invoke the civil rights movement and ask why more Black Americans weren’t speaking out against Ye’s remarks about Jewish people. First of all, to demand that Black Americans answer for one rapper is wrong. But also, this idea that all American Jews showed up during the civil rights movement, it’s just not true. It’s ahistorical. If we’re going to cite our history, we should at least understand that history.                  I think that there’s also a tendency, in some quarters of some American Jewish communities, to point to the civil rights movement as though our work in the US toward building a more just and equitable country is done. For this book, I interviewed Susannah Heschel, a scholar and the daughter of Rabbi Heschel, who famously marched with Martin Luther King Jr. She pointed out two things. She said that many people who said that they were supportive of the movement at the time weren’t supportive in tangible ways – in material ways – and still lived in largely White neighborhoods and perhaps resisted affirmative action. And that was for their own historic reasons, because of how quotas had been used against American Jews. But nevertheless.                  And she’s gone on the record many times saying that this isn’t how she wants her father’s memory to be used. It’s not meant as an excuse to check out of calls for justice today or to act as though racism and racial inequality have nothing to do with you.                  It’s important that we recognize that there are Jews of color, that there are Black Jews, that the face of American Jewish life, such as it is, is changing, and that when we talk about Black and Jewish relations, we do so in a way that doesn’t erase the existence of Black Jews.     What do you think gets overlooked in our conversations about antisemitism?              One thing that should be noted is that when we talk about antisemitism, people use it in really different ways. They understand it differently.                  That said, I think that one important element of understanding antisemitism is that, within the antisemite’s conception, Jews are always foreign. They can never really be a part of the nation. When you look at conspiracy theories wherein Jews are trying to corrupt or corrode the nation – well, why would they do that? It’s because they can never really belong. You see this again and again throughout Jewish history. And part of what’s so upsetting about that to me is that that’s what I hear. You’re telling me that you don’t really think that I’m both American and Jewish.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The UAE foreign ministry said the remarks were “inappropriate and discriminatory” and “contribute to a worsening climate of intolerance and discrimination worldwide” UAE state news agency (WAM) reported.                 In his remarks at the new European Diplomatic Academy in Bruges, Belgium, which have been widely circulated online since he made them last week, Borrell called Europe “a garden” and most of the world a “jungle” that “could invade the garden.”                 “The gardeners should take care of the garden, but they will not protect the garden by building walls. A nice small garden surrounded by high walls in order to prevent the jungle coming in is not going to be a solution. Because the jungle has a strong growth capacity, and the wall will never be high enough,” said Borrell, a Spanish politician.                 “The gardeners have to go to the jungle. Europeans have to be much more engaged with the rest of the world. Otherwise, the rest of the world will invade us,” he said.                 At a press conference on Monday, Borrell denied that his message was racist or colonialist, news agency EFE reported. The comments were intended to reject the idea of “fortress Europe” and to encourage students to engage with the world, he said.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Here are three of their stories,"As the protest cries of exasperated Iranians continue to ring through the streets of the country, reflected in videos posted on social media, here are a few of the key stories that have shaped the movement on the one-month anniversary of Mahsa ...","Oct 13, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Artemis Moshtaghian,International,"As the protest cries of exasperated Iranians continue to ring through the streets of the country, reflected in videos posted on social media, here are a few of the key stories that have shaped the movement on the one-month anniversary of Mahsa Amini’s arrest.                 To date, more than 1,000 people have been arrested across Iran, according to state news agency IRNA. At least 40 journalists are among those arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and a handful of athletes have been either arrested or detained for questioning.                  Below is a closer look at the faces and stories behind just three of those arrested, and in some cases released, in connection with the protests.                 Shervin Hajipour’s emotional song “Baraye,” which in English translates to “For…,” has been watched by millions across the globe.                 The poignant two-and-a-half-minute ballad is based on tweets composed by Iranians expressing their anger and frustration with the government. Hajipour despondently sings about grievances that range from “for dancing in the street”, “for yearning for a normal life ” to “for the children who pick through the trash in search of their dreams.”                 Instagram post not found.                   Post has been removed or is no longer public.                     The young up-and-coming singer could not have expected just how much of an impact his song would have.                  Hajipour posted the video of himself singing “Baraye” on Instagram on Tuesday September 27 and was arrested two days later. The song was viewed over 40 million times on his Instagram page before he took it down on the day of his arrest.                   The 25-year-old singer was summoned to a police station over questioning for “encouragement to protest,” according to Iranian news agency Entekhab.                  In the days following his detention, Hajipour deleted his Instagram page altogether, but his song had already gone viral and Iranians called upon each other to keep sharing the song to amplify his voice and, as a result, their grievances.                   “Baraye” soon became an anthem for the worldwide protests and rallies held on a day of solidarity dubbed “Freedom Rally for Iran.” On October 1, crowds of Iranians around the world in over 200 cities, including Melbourne, Tokyo, Brussels, Paris, London, Los Angeles and Toronto, marched through the streets with some people singing along to the lyrics of the song.                   People started calling for Hajipour’s song to be nominated for a Grammy in the “Best Song for Social Change” category. The newly created award “recognizes a song that has had profound social influence and impact,” and “that responds to the social issues of our time and has the potential for positive global impact,” according to the Recording Academy.                  On Monday, “Baraye” received 95,000 of the 115,000 submissions for the new Grammy Award, according to a statement from the Recording Academy.                  “The Academy is deeply moved by the overwhelming volume of submissions for Shervin Hajipour’s ‘Baraye’ for our new Special Merit Award, Best Song for Social Change,” Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said in a statement.                  “The Academy steadfastly supports freedom of expression and art that’s created to empower communities in need. Because music serves the world, and the Recording Academy exists to serve music.”                 The singer was released on bail on October 4, according to state-aligned news agency Tasnim, and now faces charges of spreading propaganda against the regime and encouraging and inciting people to acts of violence, according to his attorney, Majid Kaveh. Hajipour’s sister posted on social media that her brother is at home spending time with his family.                   “I’m infinitely grateful for all your kindness towards me during this time,” the singer wrote the day he was released in a social media post on his newly re-activated Instagram. “I came to say that I am doing well.” Hajipour wrote about how he was disappointed that his song has become politicized.                 “I won’t be a puppet to the people who don’t care about me, you, and this country,” he wrote.                 A week later, Hajipour addressed fans in a video message on an Instagram post pleading Iranians to treat each other like family during these trying times. “After all, we are all from the same soil and blood … and I would like it if the authorities, particularly during these conditions, approach people, who are in similar situation like me, like parents do with their children,” he said.                  The video message raised concerns among skeptical Iranians that Hajipour’s statement was forced by Iranian authorities because of an unidentified man sitting in the backseat of the car where he had recorded his video.                  Iran’s Deputy Interior Minister for security and police Seyed Majid Mirahmadi rebuked these claims saying that ever since the singer’s release from detention, any videos and claims he’s made have been on his own accord, adding that “he was not forced to publish any videos of himself,” according to the country’s semi-official ISNA news agency.                 The Iranian journalist who broke the news of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death is still under arrest and awaiting clarification on the charges made against her, according to her husband Mohammad Hossein Ajorloo.                 Niloofar Hamedi, a journalist at Shargh Daily newspaper in Tehran, was assigned to cover Amini’s story, Shargh Daily Community Editor Shahrzad Hemmati said in an op-ed.                 Covering the municipal beat, Hamedi went to Tehran’s Kasra hospital where Amini was being treated and where her family were gathered. She then tweeted a photo on her since-suspended Twitter account of Mahsa’s father and grandmother crying and embracing each other in the halls of the facility. Amini died that same day, September 16.                  A few days later, after protests broke out in outrage over Amini’s death, agents of Iran’s Ministry of Information raided Hamedi’s home and arrested her, saying they had a warrant for her arrest without providing further details, her husband Ajorloo explained on social media.                   “Although they showed us some papers, they did not allow us to read them,” Ajorloo said.                  The agents searched the couple’s home and seized all their electronic devices, including mobile phones and laptops. “Contrary to the law, they did not hand over the second copy of the house inspection report to us,” Ajorloo explained.                 Niloofar was then taken to Evin Prison, where her husband said her case was being investigated. Tehran’s Evin Prison is a notoriously brutal facility where the regime incarcerates political dissidents and is exclusively designated for prisoners managed by Iran’s Intelligence Ministry.                  On October 2, Ajorloo said his wife called him from prison to say that she was out of solitary confinement where she passed the time practicing yoga, but was not allowed to elaborate on her condition any further.                    On her 13th day of incarceration, she told her husband that she was doing well, sharing a cell with eight other female detainees, he shared on social media.                  Ajorloo says that he still has no information about his wife’s case and has no idea if or when she will be released.                   “The frequent calls from Shargh Daily newspaper readers to our editorial office inquiring about Niloofar’s well-being, how they get choked up on the phone line, is a sign that she was the voice of the people,” Shargh editor Hemmati said in her op-ed. Seemingly addressing a court judge she writes, “we are journalists Mr. Judge, allow us to fearlessly and without the fear of being labeled as political, with these laughable yet sad salaries, to be happy that we are relaying the people’s voice.”                   Hemmati ends her piece by saying that journalists are waiting for the day when they can truly believe that they will not be threatened to tell the truth.                  In recent days, Hamedi’s husband has started sharing intimate photos of the couple on his social media, speaking of his longing and concern for his wife.                  “Niloofar always says that we should take pictures of hardships so that we can remember how difficult it was to achieve happiness,” Ajorloo wrote in a tweet sharing a photo of what appears to be the pair camping. “This photo is one of those moments; The night before the climb up Sabalan [mountain], when Niloofar suffered altitude-sickness and I didn’t know what would happen tomorrow,” Ajorloo writes. “These days, however bitter and difficult, will pass, and the day of the great celebration of freedom is coming.      نیلوفر همیشه میگه باید از سختی‌ها هم عکس بگیریم تا یادمون بمونه خوشی‌ها با چه مشقتی به دست اومده.این عکس یکی از همون لحظاته؛ شب قبل از صعود سبلان که نیلوفر ارتفاع‌زده بود و نمی‌دونستم فردا چی میشه.این روزها هم هرچند تلخ و سخت، می‌گذره و روز جشن بزرگ آزادی می‌رسه.#نیلوفر_حامدی pic.twitter.com/bo96fw7cYC             Hamedi has been imprisoned in Evin prison for over 20 days, waiting alongside several other jailed journalists, activists and human rights lawyers who were arrested during the most recent protests.                  Iranian security forces arrested a woman after a photo of her and another woman eating at a Tehran restaurant without their head scarves was widely circulated online, one of the women’s family members said in a statement.                  The photo, which first emerged on social media on September 29, shows two women having breakfast at a type of cafe that, like most coffeehouses in Iran, is traditionally patronized by men.                   One of the women in the photo, Donya Rad, was arrested shortly after the photo was published online. CNN spoke with her sister who said security agencies contacted Donya, summoning her to explain her actions.                    “After visiting the designated place she was arrested, after a few hours of no news, Donya told me in a short call that she was transferred to Ward 209 of Evin Prison,” her sister said in a post on social media.                  Donya’s sister tweeted that her sister was released from prison last Sunday, over a week after she was initially detained. “I am grateful to the friends who understood us and supported us,” she wrote.                  In recent weeks, actions like this – in which women defy religious and cultural norms in Iran – are no longer isolated incidents. Women young and old are seen walking through the streets without their headscarves and in some instances, dancing with their headscarves in their hands.

In an interview with an independent reformist Iranian newspaper, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed that some school students have indeed been detained and referred to what he called “psychological institutions.”                 The establishments holding the students, he said, are meant to reform and reeducate the students to prevent “anti-social” behavior.                 “It is possible these students have become ‘anti-social characters’ and we want to reform them,” he told the Shargh newspaper, adding that the students “can return to class after they’ve been reformed.”     Mother of Nika Shahkarami, teenage protester found dead in Tehran, denies daughter fell from building             Nearly a month ago, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died after being taken to a “reeducation center” by state “morality police” for not abiding by the state’s conservative dress code. Amini’s death has sparked weeks of anti-government protests that have spread across the country.                  The education minister could not put an exact figure on the number of detained students, saying “the number is not a lot and there are not many.”     Girls and women across Iran have played a vital role in the demonstrations, and in recent weeks have protested at schools, university campuses and out on the streets.                  Footage circulated across social media has showed Iranian women and girls chanting “death to the dictator” as they take off their headscarves; on one occasion, CNN witnessed girls from a vocational high school in Tehran protesting on a street near their school and chanting, “woman, life, freedom.”                 The demonstrations have, at times, turned dangerous. Police fired tear gas on protesters in Tehran on Wednesday, and book shops and offices near Tehran University shut their doors as anti-riot police chased and fired rubber bullets on demonstrators, an eyewitness said. In Kaj Square, members of Iran’s Basij paramilitary organization ordered people to move along and stopped others from standing on the streets, according to the eyewitness.                 Videos obtained by the pro-reform activist outlet IranWire posted on social media on Wednesday showed demonstrations across Tehran and other Iranian cities.                 Police and Basij members fired tear gas at the gathering of Iranian lawyers in Tehran, while uniformed and plainclothes police were seen firing weapons in the air in West Tehran, dispersing people from the scene. In one of the busiest shopping streets in the city, riot police were seen gathering. In another, protesters chanted “Mullahs, get lost.”                 Footage from Rasht, northwest of Tehran, showed police wearing riot gear beating people with batons and pulling them from the sidewalk                 On Tuesday, the United Nations’ children’s agency UNICEF called for the protection of children and adolescents amid public unrest in Iran, which is now in its third week.                  “We are extremely concerned by continuing reports of children and adolescents being killed, injured and detained amid the ongoing public unrest in Iran,” read the UNICEF statement.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/opinions/kanye-west-antisemitism-responses-filipovic/index.html,Opinion: These responses to Kanye West are truly frightening,"The impulse among conservatives to use Kanye West’s recent comments as a way of endorsing bigotry and conspiracy theories to their base should concern us much, much more than the question about what to do about West himself, ...","Oct 12, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,: Jill Filipovic,International,"Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.             The appropriate response to Kanye West’s latest intentional bigoted provocations – his antisemitic tweet, his “White Lives Matter” t-shirt – is fairly simple: Condemn the message, and encourage West, who reportedly struggles with mental health issues, to get help and get out of the public eye.                  Instead, the latest West affair has turned into a bizarre way for people across the political spectrum to put on a performance, either as a highly moralistic progressive who paints the world in black and white and good people versus bad, or as a West sympathizer, sending a message (sometimes tacit, in other cases overt) to their followers that they perhaps share West’s hateful sentiments.                  The first group is simplistic and annoying. The second response, though – the conservatives who are using this moment to amplify themselves because they realize that West’s bigotry may well resonate with their followers – is indecent and dangerous.                  West has a long history of misogyny, bigotry and intentional provocation. Just a few days ago, he wore a White Lives Matter shirt at the Yeezy show at Paris Fashion Week, and had several models – plus right-wing commentator Candace Owens – do the same. For that public gesture to White supremacy, he was invited on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show and roundly applauded by a number of Republicans, even after the interview predictably went off the rails.                  During his interview with Carlson, West wore an ultrasound pendant to signal his anti-abortion views. He pointed to abortion and the singer Lizzo’s weight and blamed both for “the genocide of the Black race.” Republicans and conservative talking heads cheered West for “spitting facts” and declared him “a cultural icon.” Opinion: The breathtaking cluelessness of Elon Musk             Just days later, West wrote on both Twitter and Instagram to say, “I’m a bit sleepy but when I wake up I’m going death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE. The funny thing is I actually can’t be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda.”                 That got him restricted on both platforms, and that particular message was deleted. And while most Republicans and conservatives suddenly clammed up after their West lovefest, a few continued to signal their support – including via the GOP House Judiciary’s Twitter account, which had tweeted “Kanye. Elon. Trump” after West’s Fox News interview, and has still refused to delete the tweet despite many calls to do so.      Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who catapulted to right-wing fame after he opened a criminal inquiry into a doctor who helped a pregnant 10-year-old rape victim who needed an abortion, tweeted that “The constant hypocrisy from the media is at an all-time high. They have now gone after Kanye for his new fashion line, his independent thinking, & for having opposing thoughts from the norm of Hollywood.” That was after West’s threat to go “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE.”                  Rokita later claimed that “My post was specifically and clearly aimed at the hypocrisy of the media and Hollywood elites, not anything to do with other comments. I have an obvious, clear and substantial Congressional and public record of being 100% supportive of the Jewish community and Israel.” But at the time he sent out his first tweet defending West on Sunday evening, West’s antisemitic tweet was the primary topic of conversation.      Kanye West on shirt decision: 'Idea of me wearing it was funny'             Candace Owens of the White Lives Matter T-shirt also joined in, saying, “If you are an honest person, you did not think this tweet was antisemitic. If you are an honest person you read this tweet you had no idea what the hell he was talking about.” I’m not sure what kind of “honest person” reads “death con 3 on Jewish people” and doesn’t understand that to be baldly, repulsively anti-Semitic, but Owens also lamented that “It’s like you cannot even say the word ‘Jewish’ without people getting upset.”                  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz couldn’t be bothered to condemn West’s remarks, but did take the opportunity to attack New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because she condemned West’s remarks.                  The left-wing line on West, which amounts to “mental illness does not make you a bigot, only bigots are bigots” is too simplistic and dismissive. Mental illnesses are not all alike, and painting them with a broad brush is silly. No, your anxiety does not make you spout antisemitic conspiracy theories.                  But a small number of serious mental illnesses can indeed make a person delusional, prone to conspiracy theories and extremely vulnerable to latching onto bigoted beliefs as a way of making sense of a world that, because of their mental state, has become unintelligible. Culture can impact those delusions and hallucinations, and it is entirely possible that a person who is not racist or misogynist or antisemitic while in their right mind might latch onto these noxious ideas when they aren’t.                  It’s also possible that a person can be both a bigot and mentally ill.      Opinion: Kim Kardashian gives us a glimpse of how hard it was to be Marilyn Monroe, the star             West didn’t invent antisemitic conspiracy theories, nor the racist claim that Black women who end pregnancies are genocidaires, nor White supremacy. But West’s psychology is honestly the least important part of this story. His words are indefensible, and at this point, so is giving him a platform, money or the attention he craves. Those who know West personally and love him and have his best interests at heart should push him to hit pause, seek help and refrain from public provocations – and perhaps seek out a quiet life away from celebrity and out of the public eye.                  For the rest of us, though, this is more than just a choice between ignoring or condemning. More interesting and important than West himself is how West’s reactionary bigotry has been embraced on the right – and how West has in turn also embraced the same kind of racism and conspiracy-mongering that is increasingly a fixture of today’s profoundly deranged Republican Party.                  Why is it that key figures in the GOP world and their conservative supporters have embraced this grotesquely attention-seeking person spouting dangerous conspiracy theories? That is a question that could be asked in a column about West – but also one about former President Donald Trump, or Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene or Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, or frankly any smattering of Republican politicians, conservative commentators and right-wing celebrities. That is a much more serious and pervasive problem than how to respond to West’s tweets.                  Some in the GOP may well be reticent to disown West, since GOP operatives sought to use him in 2020 to siphon voters away from Biden. But this ongoing right-wing embrace of West is a way to signal to Republican supporters that the now-dominant Trump wing of the GOP believes the outrageous claims that (or is willing to leave silently uncontested) West professes: That women’s bodies should be policed by men; that in response to White police officers killing unarmed Black men and women the appropriate thing to do is to disregard and devalue Black lives and emphasize the greater importance of White ones; and that there is indeed a secretive cabal of shady Jews (or perhaps in more coded terms, a “cosmopolitan elite” or “globalists”) controlling the world and ruining your life – and certainly rigging elections.                  All of that is indefensible – and much more dangerous than a few tweets from a single musician. And the impulse among conservatives to use West’s comments as a way of hinting at their own bigotries should concern us much, much more than the question about what to do about West himself.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

Wolf,International,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.              The Islamic regime in Iran has ruled for decades with fear and intimidation.                  Outrage at the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22 year-old who died after being detained by Iran’s morality policy, allegedly for improperly wearing her hijab, ignited nationwide protests across the country that have gone on for weeks.                  That Iranians are risking their lives and freedom to stand up to their government has sparked hope among many that change is coming. Read CNN’s latest report.                 I talked on the phone to Masih Alinejad, an Iranian in exile in the US who works as a journalist and activist.                 Key points:                 Our conversation, edited for clarity and length, is below. I’ve also added some context and links in parentheses where appropriate.     WHAT MATTERS: This newsletter is not usually focused on Iran. Can you first just explain what’s happening? ALINEJAD: Mahsa Amini was only 22 years old. … She came from Saqqez to Tehran for a vacation. Then she got arrested by the so-called morality police – because I call them the hijab police.                  And for your audience, if they don’t know what morality police means, they’re a bunch of police walking in the streets, telling people whether their way of wearing hijab is proper or not.                  Mahsa was arrested for wearing inappropriate hijab. So she was not unveiled.      (Here is a CNN report in which the Iranian police deny the allegation she was beaten.) ALINEJAD: That created huge anger among Iranians. And that is why women across Iran first started to cut their hair. Then they took to the street and they started to burn their headscarves. And now, with men, shoulder to shoulder, across Iran they’re not only saying no to compulsory hijab, they are actually chanting against the dictator and they are saying we want an end to the Islamic Republic.                  This is a revolution.                  To me, this is a women’s revolution against a gender apartheid regime.     WHAT MATTERS: The Iranian government has tried to crack down on this. We see video that gets out of Iran of these protests. How have things changed in the weeks since Mahsa’s death?  ALINEJAD: From the beginning, the level of crackdown was so brutal. They opened fire, they really opened fire on teenagers, school leaders, university students, they opened fire on unarmed people.                  Now some reports say more than 130 people have been killed. But it’s strongly believed the number is much more than this. Only in Zahedan on only one day, they opened fire on those who were praying. Who were praying. They killed more than 80 people in Zahedan.      (CNN has not verified all of these claims. Related CNN report: Iranian security forces beat, shot and detained students of elite Tehran university, witnesses say. Amnesty International has reported on the killing of 66 in Zahedan along with other deaths recorded in other places.  Regarding death tolls: CNN cannot independently verify the death toll –  a precise figure is impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm – and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists.) ALINEJAD: The Iranian regime cut off the internet in some cities to prevent the rest of the world from getting to know about the crackdown, to get to learn about the number of people killed.                  But again. That didn’t stop people. Actually, it changed the tone of the protesters. They became more angry. They were holding the names and photos of those who got killed and the major slogan was this: ‘We are ready to die, but we won’t live under humiliation.’                  One of the young women whose name was Hadis Najafi, she was only 20 years old. She made a video of herself walking in the street and saying I’m joining the protests. In the future, if I see that Iran has changed, that change came, then I was proudly part of this demonstration. She got killed. There are many of them.      (CNN has reported that Najafi’s family said she was shot six times and never made it home from a protest. She was 23. There are reports of multiple young women killed. Here’s a CNN video report on Nika Shahkarami, whose family found her body at a morgue after not being able to find her for 10 days following an Instagram story of her burning her headscarf.)             Students filmed themselves burning their headscarves, but they got killed. But murdering and killing didn’t stop the protests. Instead they became more angry. Now schoolgirls came out, university professors came out, teachers came out and ask for a strike.     (Here’s a CNN report that explains the special significance of strikes in Iran.) WHAT MATTERS: The flashpoint is one woman’s death that set off all of these protests. But it’s a movement that’s been building for months – ALINEJAD: Don’t say for months. I don’t accept that. It has been building for years. Years of women pushing back the boundaries the anti-woman laws, especially compulsory hijab laws.                  For years and years, these women that you see in the streets, they have been fighting back compulsory hijabs alone. Like lonely soldiers. I myself have published videos of women being beaten by morality police under the hashtag #mycameraismyweapon. I really want you to go and check this hashtag. Brave women filming themselves while being harassed by morality police and looking to the morality police and saying that you cannot tell me what to wear.                 Slavery used to be legal. I’m not going to respect bad law in Iran.                 This is being built up by women within the society practicing their civil disobedience in bravely saying no to forced hijab and the gender apartheid regime for years and years. That’s my opinion. Mahsa’s name became a symbol of resistance for women to take to the streets in large numbers. That’s the new thing.     WHAT MATTERS: How will this be transformed into permanent change? How will it evolve from here?  ALINEJAD: Look, this is not going to happen overnight. This is the beginning of an end. It takes time. It reminds me of the revolution 40 years ago. People were taking to the streets for like one month and were going back home and then coming back again. The national strike helped a lot. For me and millions of people, this is just the beginning to an end.                 The compulsory hijab is not just a small piece of cloth for Iranians. It’s like the Berlin Wall. I keep saying that. If women can successfully tear this wall down, the Islamic Republic won’t exist.                  Maybe in the West, people ignore me and they never take this seriously. But the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, he knows what I’m talking about. That’s why, just two days ago, he referred to my statement comparing the hijab to the Berlin Wall, saying that ‘she is an American agent and we have taken action against her.’      (Alinejad shared this video of Khamenei on Twitter, in which he refers to US political elements making the comparison to the Berlin Wall.) ALINEJAD: But it’s not me. It’s millions of people who believe that compulsory hijab is like the main pillar of the religious dictatorship. It’s like the main pillar of the Islamic Republic.                  That’s why I believe that now people are being fearless and clear that we want to break this weakest pillar of the Islamic Republic… I strongly believe that the biggest threat to the Islamic Republic are the women who are leading the revolution, who are facing guns and bullets and saying that we want an end for this gender apartheid regime.      WHAT MATTERS: In Iran, and we’ve seen this in Russia as well, social media is helping spread the word and is essential to organizing protests. Here in the US, it is often viewed as a threat to our democracy because that’s where misinformation is spread. I wonder if you had any thoughts on that dichotomy. ALINEJAD: Let me be very clear with you. Right now, the tech companies are actually helping the Islamic Republic. First of all, Iranians are banned from using social media – Instagram, Facebook and Twitter are filtered. The leaders like Khamenei and other officials who ban 80 million people from using social media, they all have verified accounts. They have multiple accounts on social media. Basically, the Iranian regime cut off the Internet for its own people, but they’re being more than welcomed on social media to spread fake information, misinformation, disinformation.     (Accounts that appear to be associated with Khamenei are on Twitter and Instagram and have large followings. They are not verified by Instagram or Twitter. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Meta said this in an email: “Iranians use apps like Instagram to stay close to their loved ones, find information and shed light on important events - and we hope the Iranian authorities restore their access soon. In the meantime, our teams are following the situation closely, and are focused on only removing content that breaks our rules, while addressing any enforcement mistakes as quickly as possible.”) WHAT MATTERS: The US government has tried to increase Iranian’s access to the internet. Is that working? ALINEJAD: Oh, of course, this is phenomenal. But we need more. We need more.                 The thing is, at the same time, the US government, we’re pleased that they’re providing internet access for Iranians. This is good. We appreciate that.                  But at the same time, the US government is focused on getting a deal from this regime, the same regime.                  They condemn the brutality, they condemn the Iranian government for killings, but at the same time, they try to give money, billions of dollars, to the same murderers. And I don’t understand this contradiction.      (The US government could give Iran’s government ​access to billions of dollars of frozen Iranian funds if it re-joins an agreement whereby Iran can sell oil in exchange for abandoning nuclear weapons capability. Recent talks, however, have not gone well. Read more.) ALINEJAD: Many people in the streets are now risking their lives and want an end for the same regime. They aren’t asking for US government to go there and save them at all. They’re brave enough to do it themselves. But they’re really clearly asking the US government not to save the Iranian regime. …                 People believe that the money goes to the benefit of the people. It doesn’t go to the people. The money goes to Syria, Lebanon, to Hamas, Hezbollah, to terrorist organizations.                  For millions of Iranians now, this is the moment they want the US government to ask its allies, the European countries, to recall their ambassadors and to cut their ties with the murders until the day that they are sure that the Iranian regime is stopped killing its own people.     (CNN isn’t able to confirm that all the money goes to terrorist organizations or that none of it goes to Iranian people. Iran does fund terror groups outside its borders, according to the US government, and its own Islamic Revolutionary Guard is a terror group, according to the US government.) Swedish politician cuts hair in solidarity with Iranian women WHAT MATTERS: I want to talk about another dichotomy you’ve pointed out. You wrote in The Washington Post that feminists all over the world need to pay attention and take to the streets.  ALINEJAD: You cannot call yourself a feminist in the West, in America, and not take action on one of the most important feminist revolutions, in Iran.                  By saying that, I don’t mean that I want the feminists to just appear on TV and cut their hair to show their solidarity.                  I want, especially the female politicians, to cut their ties … and instead take to the streets to show their solidarity with the women of Iran. When the Women’s March happened here in America, like every single feminist around the world showed solidarity. I was part of the Women’s March in New York. The main slogan was ‘my body my choice.’                  But at the same time I’m witnessing that when it comes to Iran and Afghanistan, it seems that my body my choice is not as important as it is in the West.                  (Here Alinejad said women representing Western governments who meet with Iranian and Afghan officials should refrain from wearing headscarves.)     WHAT MATTERS: You took part this week in an Oslo Freedom Forum event in New York with other dissidents from Russia and Venezuela. Those are two places that are repressive, and they’re also funded largely by oil. The US wants more oil on the market. I just wondered if you had any larger comments to make on this question?  ALINEJAD: This is what’s missing here. The dictators are more united than our freedom fighters.                 Let me give you an example. Just two months ago, (Vladimir) Putin went to Iran. (Nicolás) Maduro from Venezuela went to Iran … from China to Russia to Venezuela to Nicaragua, everywhere. The leaders from autocracies and dictatorships are united. They’re helping each other. They’re supporting each other to oppress protests taking place in each country. But we the freedom fighters, we the opposition to these dictators must be united as well, because when we fight against autocracy or dictatorship on our own, we’re not going to be successful.                 (Alinejad said she has talked to dissidents from Russia and Venezuela about calling a World Liberty Congress for opposition and activist leaders.)     ALINEJAD: If we don’t get united to end dictatorship, then the dictators will get united to end democracy. We’re not fighting just for ourselves. I’m not fighting just for Iran. Garry Kasparov is not fighting for just Russia. Leopoldo Lopez is not fighting just for Venezuela. We are fighting for democracy. We’re trying to protect the rest of the world from these dictators.     (Our conversation continued from here and Alinejad argued the “United Nations is useless.” It’s true the United Nations prioritizes inclusion of most countries over action. And it is awkward at best that Iran sits on the UN’s Commission on Women’s Rights and Russia sits on the Security Council.) ALINEJAD: We need to have our own alternative United Nations, where all the good people get united, not the bad guys. Now the bad guys are winning because they’re helping each other. So this is the time that all the good people who care for freedom and democracy get united and have their own society.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Her death has sparked violent ...,"Oct 7, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Oliver Darcy,International,"Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index              Latest Market News              Hot Stocks              Nationwide protests have gripped Iran for weeks following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after she was taken into custody by the government’s morality police for apparently not wearing her hijab properly. Her death has sparked violent clashes between demonstrators and authorities, reportedly leaving scores dead.                 The uprising has received considerable attention in the Western press, especially as the fundamentalist Islamic regime has cracked down on the demonstrations with brute force.                 But as protesters surge through the streets of Iran, Western news organizations largely aren’t filing stories from the authoritarian-led country that has curtailed the free press, jailed journalists, and shut down the Internet. NBC News does have a correspondent in Tehran (kudos to them), but because of logistical issues and security concerns, the vast majority of Western outlets do not maintain a presence in the country. Most datelines on stories are from the nearby region, outside Iran. The Associated Press and Reuters, for example, are filing stories about the unrest from Dubai.     A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.             Western news organizations are largely relying on networks of contacts, groups like Amnesty International, a student-run news agency, as well as social media reports for information. CNN’s stories notably state that the network has “not been able to independently verify the number of the dead and injured.”                 Pouria Mahrouyan, a senior editor at BBC News Persian who oversees the social media and interactive team, said that because the news organization has no reporters in Iran, they are “largely relying on social media and user-generated-content” each day.                  But doing so doesn’t come without risk. Of particular concern, Mahrouyan said, some videos posted to social media sites are part of a government disinformation campaign. “They have a cyber army and they massively produce social media videos, even fake interviews,” Mahrouyan said of the Iranian regime. The government, he said, has also attempted to set traps to manipulate Western media into reporting falsehoods: “They can then say foreign media is reporting fake news.”                 While the Iranian government is seeking to manipulate the conversation outside its borders, it is simultaneously using its state-controlled television and radio apparatus to control the narrative inside the country.                 Trita Parsi, a prominent Iran expert, said the outlets have worked to “downplay the protests, ignore the protests, or cast them as a conspiracy.” Amir Hossein Mahdavi, another Iran expert, said state-controlled media is “depicting these events” in the same way the country’s supreme leader has: “Initiated by the outside, by the CIA and Mossad.”                  Recent stories from Fars News Agency and Press TV, which both publish and broadcast in English, have breathlessly echoed the deceptions pushed by the country’s government.                 But the regime’s attempts to control the narrative has faced setbacks. “There is a massive amount of people who have access to satellite dishes and getting their news from the outside,” Parsi explained. “It’s not like they are only relying only on Iranian news outlets, which they take with a grain of salt.”                 In fact, BBC Persian is one of the most influential sources of information for those inside Iran. Mahrouyan noted the outlet’s Instagram account has one of the largest followings within Persian media, boasting 18.6 million followers.                 “The ability of the state,” Parsi said, “to be able to push their narrative has been significantly weakened.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/golf/muslim-golf-association-amir-malik-spc-intl/index.html,Amir Malik is on a drive to make golf more inclusive for Muslims,The UK’s Muslim Golf Association is proving a hit with both men and women.,"Oct 6, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Jack Bantock,International,"Amir Malik is a man in love with golf. Yet golf has not always loved him back.                 A devoted sports fan since his childhood in Kingston upon Thames, London, he was fascinated with golf long before he took his first swing. But knowing nobody else who played, Malik settled for a sideline view.                 That all changed in 2012, when his former boss invited him to try his hand at a driving range.                 “From the first ball I thought, ‘This is it. This game is incredible,’” Malik, now aged 38, told CNN.                 “I’ve played a lot of sports, but there aren’t too many when you go to bed thinking about it and you can’t wait to get up to go back and play again.”                 Eventually, Malik was ready to take his game to the next level. Joining a municipal club in 2017, he began competing in Sunday morning tournaments.                 It was at these events that the “ugly side” of the game was swiftly revealed to Malik, who felt isolated by the jarring clash of club culture and his Muslim faith.                  The discomfort would begin before a ball was struck, as Malik says he drew questioning looks at his refusal to partake in wagers over in-house competitions, as gambling is forbidden in Islam. Out on the course, stepping aside to observe salat – ritual Islamic prayers performed five times a day – further heightened his anxieties.                 “You would feel scared, intimidated. How are people going to react?” he recalled.                 “We always made sure we were out of the way, but you were made to feel very, very uncomfortable.”                  His unease was exacerbated by the commonplace tradition of clubhouse drinking after competitions. As Malik doesn’t drink alcohol, he was left to hand in his scorecard and make an early exit.                  As he improved and played more prestigious courses, discomfort often escalated into outright hostility. Malik, who is of Pakistani descent, said he has experienced racism on the golf course.                  “You turn up and immediately you can feel the vibe and the atmosphere, the way you’re spoken to, the way you’re treated,” he said.                 “And you’re just like ‘Wow, just because I’ve got a beard, I’m brown, and I don’t look like you, you probably think I can’t play or you don’t think I know the etiquette.                 “It used to really frustrate me because you sense it, you feel it, you grow up in it, you know what it feels like. And it’s not until you hit one straight down the middle of the fairway – when you’ve smoked a drive – that people then think, ‘Oh, he can play,’ and it’s too late by then.”                 Malik’s passion for golf was not soured by his experiences. On the contrary, they spurred him to scout out other British Muslims who shared his love of the game.                 Encouraged by “pockets” of interest he had seen on his travels, in December 2019 Malik put a name to his new venture – the Muslim Golf Association (MGA) – and sent out invitations to a charity golf day at The Grove, a prestigious venue just outside London.                  The MGA’s maiden event would be open to all religions; prayer facilities would be provided and there would be no alcohol or gambling. Malik was stunned by the response. Within 24 hours, all 72 places had been booked, with over 100 people on the waiting list by the week’s end.                  The event, held in August 2020, raised £18,000 for charity, and the sight of over 60 players praying together in the Grove’s courtyard marked a watershed moment for Malik.                 “That for me was just amazing,” he said. “That we could get guys together, feeling safe and comfortable and just be on our own platform.”                 Since then, the MGA has partnered with the Marriott hotel chain to stage a tri-series tournament beginning in 2021, with the winners of this year’s edition securing an all-expenses paid trip to the Turkish golfing paradise of Belek.                 “I looked at golf and thought, it’s a sport played by White, old, rich men, period,” Malik said. “We’ve now got an opportunity to actually show the world that non-Whites can play this game and we’re pretty damn good at it.”                 The overwhelming response to MGA events among Muslim women has been equally exciting for Malik. After launching a trio of pilot sessions in Birmingham last year, 1,000 players have already signed up to the string of women-only taster events scheduled across the country over the next two months.                   Malik believes Muslim women in the UK are being held back from participating in more sports because of a lack of all-female facilities and sessions.                 The MGA has no dress code, which means women can play in a niqab (face veil) and an abaya (long robe) if they wish, and it hires sections of courses for its exclusive use for taster events, to ensure a comfortable experience for new players.                  “The response has been absolutely incredible, mindblowing,” Malik said. “I say to women, ‘I don’t care what you wear, what you look like, just come with a smile and with a pair of trainers and we’ll take care of everything else.’ We’ve not done anything revolutionary, we’ve just made it accessible, and the demand is incredible.”                 To date, MGA events have attracted over 1,300 participants. Looking forward, the organization aims to take its efforts global to reach as many new players as possible.                 Growing up, Malik had to look to other sports for Muslim role models, such as England cricketer Moeen Ali. From Muhammad Ali, to Kareem Abdul-Jabaar, to Mohamed Salah, countless Muslim athletes have carved out glittering careers across a range of sports, yet professional golf offers a comparative scarcity of examples.                 According to a survey cited by England Golf, the country’s governing body for amateur golf, just 5% of golfers in England are from ethnically diverse groups.                 By establishing relationships with groups such as the MGA, England Golf’s chief operating officer Richard Flint believes the barriers that have contributed to a lack of diversity in the game can be understood and broken down.                 “No-one should feel uncomfortable walking through the doors of a golf club or facility simply because of their age, race, ethnicity or gender,” Flint told CNN.                 “As a modern, forward-thinking organization, we want golf to be open to everyone and change negative perceptions around the game that belong in the past.”                 While Malik hopes to soon see Muslim players competing on professional tours, he says he did not form the MGA to produce a Muslim Tiger Woods.     Meet 'Snappy Gilmore,' the viral TikTok sensation reinventing the golf swing              “If that happens as a byproduct, then great,” he said. “But if we can get the golf industry to take a long, hard look at itself and make itself accessible, make itself open and diverse, then that’s a huge achievement.                 “The golf course doesn’t discriminate. The ball doesn’t ask what color, race or gender you are … yet it’s been a very closed club that’s been open to very few people.                 Malik believes it’s time for change. “Golf has a lot of exceptional values and traditions, which I still think it needs to keep firm, but it has to evolve … if it were to open itself up and let other cultures and traditions bring all that great stuff to this game, it could be absolutely wonderful.”       This story has been updated to clarify England Golf’s relationship with the MGA. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.             As anti-government protests enter their third week in Iran, the Islamic Republic has imposed a near total blackout of independent information coming out of the country.                  A fierce battle to control the narrative is now being fought online, where supporters and opponents of the government alike are taking to social media to tell their version of the truth and, in some cases, go beyond the truth.                   With access to Twitter blocked in Iran, that battle is primarily being fought outside the country.                  “It is normal for people to rush to social media when protests break out… It has happened in Iran and the Arab world,” said Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor at Qatar’s Hamad Bin Khalifa University who specializes in digital disinformation. “But the scale here seems quite substantial.”                  Protests aren’t new to Iran, and neither are internet blackouts. What’s changing, say experts, is the sophistication of those trying to get their message across.                   The protests started following the death of 22- year-old Mahsa Amini after she was detained by the Islamic Republic’s “morality police,” sparking outrage among Iranians who took to the streets to demand more freedoms.                  A hashtag with her name has garnered 52 million tweets, said Jones, who has analyzed pro- and anti-regime activity on Twitter. Some of those tweets, he said, suggest there may be coordinated manipulation campaigns at play, possibly including bots.                   Bots are social media accounts controlled by software, not real people, that are designed to promote certain topics.                  He told CNN that an analysis of those tweeting the hashtags associated with the protests showed “a striking number of new accounts created” since the protests started.                  Of the 108,000 accounts in a sample using #OpIran, another hashtag associated with the protests, he found that around 13,000 were created in September, while the average number of accounts created per month in the sample was only 500.  Most of the September accounts were created in around 10 days following Amini’s death, he said.                  “It’s quite rare to see this amount of new online mobilization of accounts that then subsequent and continuously engage in tweet activity,” he said, adding that while this indicates manipulation, it isn’t conclusive evidence of it.      I want to share some of the iconic imagery and music from the protests in Iran and around the world. Singer Shervin Hajipour's song ""Baraye"" brings up grievances such as the economy and a lack of women's rights in his country. It has now been removed from Hajipour's account. pic.twitter.com/WZOmh7CPUR             Asked to comment on the matter, Twitter referred CNN to its policy of “taking robust and proactive action against violating content” where evidence of coordinated inauthentic activity is detected.                  The creation of new accounts “is a repeated hallmark of dis- and misinformation actors… [who] participate in the conversation to push a narrative,” said Steph Shample, a non-resident scholar with the Middle East Institute’s Cyber Program. Content from such accounts is not trustworthy, she said.                  Maziar Bahari, editor of IranWire, a pro-reform activist outlet, says there are many ways to verify content on social media, “but in a chaotic, angry situation it’s impossible to expect every member of the public to try and fact check, especially if those exaggerated reports have roots in the reality.”                  Bahari said there have been several cases of fake news successfully being portrayed as reality from both sides. “After every protest, the government shows confiscated firearms from archives or taken from common criminals and attributes it to their critics,” he told CNN. There are also cases of social media users exaggerating reports of killings and sexual violence by the security forces, he said.                  The harm comes “more when important public figures, such as politicians or educators, retweet the false narratives of controlling countries and their politicians,” said Shample.                  Any account on any social media platform that is successfully posting pro-Iranian government material while most of the country is cut off from those services is suspect, she said. “It is very, very dangerous to take things at face value anymore.”                  So, who’s behind all the Twitter activity around #MahsaAmini?                   Since Twitter is blocked in Iran, Jones suggests that the large Iranian diaspora may be mobilizing to keep her story alive, but other interests may also be at play.                   “We also know there are a number of people with stakes in trying to see regime change in Iran, from right-wing hawks in US and Israel, to the MeK,” he said, referring to Mujahideen-e-Khalq, an Albania-based Iranian dissident group. “The MeK certainly have been active in social media manipulation prior to the [death of] Mahsa Amini.”                  Shample suggests that the government itself could be behind some of the anti-regime tweets in an effort to track those who support the movement.       The US says it's helping Iranians navigate a massive internet blackout. Activists say it's too little, too late             The war of narratives between opposing parties on social media isn’t new. Twitter regularly removes accounts it says are tied to the Iranian government that engage in coordinated manipulation. Last year, Facebook removed hundreds of fake accounts linked to a troll farm in Albania that it said were linked to the MeK. The group was removed from the US terror list in 2012.                   Facebook describes troll farms as a “physical location where a collective of operators share computers and phones to jointly manage a pool of fake accounts as part of an influence operation.”                  Neither the MeK, which also goes by the name People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, or the Iranian foreign ministry respondedto CNN’s requests for comment.                   The Iranian government has time and again blamed foreign conspiracies aimed at spreading false news about the situation in Iran. But Bahari says the disinformation and foreign exploitation of the protests don’t discredit a movement that has genuine demands for change.                  “Disinformation has existed as long as movements have existed,” he said. “But the advent of social media means that [it] can spread more quickly… when movements are popular and have roots in people’s aspirations for change, disinformation is just a nuisance.”       OPEC+ agrees on a 2 million bpd cut in oil output, defying US pressure              OPEC+ on Wednesday agreed on a 2 million barrel per day output cut, defying a pressure campaign by the US for the cartel not to make such a drastic reduction. The cut was the biggest since the Covid-19 pandemic and was twice as much as analysts had expected.

Ahmed said in a TV interview that the video was filmed spontaneously early in the morning by his friend.                   Ahmed’s lyrics are barely comprehensible to English or Arabic speakers.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/middleeast/iran-protests-regime-intl/index.html,A barrier of fear has been broken in Iran. The regime may be at a point of no return,"Iran’s latest protests transcend Iran’s many social and ethnic divisions, breaking a decades-old barrier of fear and posing an unprecedented threat to the regime.","Oct 5, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Jomana Karadsheh,International,"A woman dressed in black raises a framed portrait of her son, Siavash Mahmoudi, in the air as she paces the sidewalk in Iran’s capital, Tehran. “I am not scared of anyone. They told me to be silent. I will not be,” the woman seen in a viral social media video yells, her voice fraught with emotion.                   “I will carry my son’s picture everywhere. They killed him.”                 Mahmoudi’s mother is among many Iranians who claim the regime tried to silence them as they mourned loved ones slain in ongoing nationwide demonstrations.              But Iran’s protesters, and their supporters, are defiant. For weeks, a nationwide protest movement has relentlessly gathered momentum and appears to have blunted the government’s decades-old intimidation tactics. Slogans against the clerical leadership echo throughout the city. Videos of schoolgirls waving their headscarves in the air as they sing protest songs in classrooms have gone viral, as have images of protesters fighting back against members of the formidable paramilitary group Basij.        The US says it's helping Iranians navigate a massive internet blackout. Activists say it's too little, too late             These are scenes previously believed to be unthinkable in Iran, where the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei rules with an iron fist. But experts say that these protests transcend Iran’s many social and ethnic divisions, breaking a decades-old barrier of fear and posing an unprecedented threat to the regime.                 Across Iran, protesters seem intent on exposing the weaknesses of a clerical establishment which is widely accused of corruption and has stamped out dissent with arbitrary detentions and even mass executions.                 Tehran has been convulsing with demonstrations since the death in mid-September of Mahsa (also known as Zhina) Amini, the 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman who died after being detained by the country’s morality police for how she was dressed.                 Protests crop up sporadically in various parts of the capital throughout each day. At night, a chant that has become a staple of the protests — “death to the dictator” — sounds from the rooftops of buildings. It’s a reference to Khamenei, who was once considered beyond reproach because of his elevated clerical status.                  Anti-regime demonstrations have also penetrated the Islamic Republic’s power bases, including the Shia holy cities of Mashhad and Qom. Ethnic minorities — notably Kurds in the country’s north and northwest, and Baloch people in the southeast — have also staged protests, enduring what appear to be some of the most brutal crackdowns, with scores reportedly killed.                  Secondary schools and universities around the country are flashpoints, and women and girls have been taking off their mandatory headscarves, known as hijabs.                   “These terrorists think that our generation is the previous generation. We are not. Let me assure you,” a protester from Tehran’s prestigious Sharif University of Technology told CNN, referring to Iranian police who had violently cracked down on demonstrators on campus, and detained scores of young people.       'It was a warzone.' Iranian security forces beat, shot and detained students of elite Tehran university, witnesses say, as crackdown escalates             Social media video showed cars filling the streets shortly after news spread Sunday of the crackdown on students, horns blaring in solidarity with protesters as the showdown unfolded at the university, known for educating Iran’s best and brightest students.                  “If the dust settles and we stop protesting, they are going to kill even more of us. They are going to detain even more people and they are going to turn us to North Korea,” the impassioned protester said. “This is not the end. I promise you that.”                   CNN has not been able to independently verify the number of the dead and injured, but state media says 40 people have died since the start of demonstrations in mid-September. Rights group Amnesty International says at least 52 have been killed. Over 1,000 people are believed to have been detained, including journalists and artists.                  Last week, Amnesty International said it had obtained a leaked document which appeared to instruct commanders of armed forces in all provinces to “mercilessly confront” protesters, deploying riot police as well as some members of the military’s elite Revolutionary guards, the Basij paramilitary force and plainclothes security agents.                   CNN has not seen the leaked documents obtained by Amnesty International and cannot verify the reporting. CNN has reached out to Amnesty International on how it received the leaked documents but hasn’t received a reply.                  CNN has also reached out to Iranian government officials for a comment on Amnesty International’s reporting but hasn’t received a reply.                    In addition, Amnesty International said it had seen evidence of sexual assault against female protesters – CNN has not been able to verify this. Social media video has also shown Iranian security forces dragging unveiled women through the streets by their hair.                   The threat posed by these protests, analysts say, is existential to the regime, and is one of the biggest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced in years.                  “These are primarily very, very young people, a younger generation who have apparently completely lost faith that this Islamic Republic can be reformed,” said Trita Parsi, executive vice-president at the Washington, DC-based Quincy Institute.                  “They’re breaking from their previous generation who was seeking to reform the system from within,” Parsi added. “This new generation seems to not have any faith in that at all.”                 The 83-year-old Khamenei, who commented on the protests for the first time on Monday, blamed – without evidence – the United States and Israel for fueling the protests. He also made clear that the regime would block the protesters’ desire for change.                     “I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by the US and the occupying, false Zionist regime (Israel), as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad,” said Khamenei in his address.                   The current protests may eventually be quashed or simply lose momentum, but analysts say Iran can expect another cycle of nationwide demonstrations in months to come. The latest demonstrations follow similar, but less widespread, protests against the government in 2019, 2017 and 2009.                    “The protests transcend social sectarian boundaries, bringing together a much broader strata of Iranian society than we have seen in years,” said Ali Vaez, director of the International Crisis Group’s Iran Project. “But they suffer from the same shortcomings that the previous movements in Iran also suffered from. Primarily, the lack of leadership.                  “It’s very difficult to be able to maintain and sustain a movement that over the long run will bring the regime to its knees without coordination and leadership,” Vaez said.                  Still, the protesters appear bolder than ever, sensing a window of opportunity that could quickly close as Iran appears to near development of a nuclear weapon, which would both entrench the regime’s grip on power and deepen its isolation.                  This is the scenario that anti-regime Iranians are trying desperately to avoid, said Vaez.                  “The only thing worse than a regime that kills and represses its own people is a regime with a nuclear weapon and that kills and represses its own people,” he said.

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             On Sunday, almost by accident, two groups of demonstrators came together in London. One was waving Ukrainian flags; the other Iranian flags. When they met, they cheered each other, and chanted, “All together we will win.”                  The uprising in Iran and the war in Ukraine are, on the surface, very different conflicts. At their core, however, they are being fought by individuals who have decided to risk their lives, to do what it takes to defend their right to live as they choose; to push back against violent, entrenched dictatorships.                  For decades autocrats have been gaining ground while democracies looked almost spent, in retreat. Now suddenly, when we least expected, a ferocious pushback against two of the most brazen tyrannies has burst into view. In Ukraine and in Iran, the people have decided to defy the odds for the sake of their dignity, freedom and self-determination.                 These David v. Goliath battles show bravery that is almost unimaginable to the rest of us – and is inspiring equally courageous support in places like Afghanistan.                  The consequences could prove far reaching.                 In Iran, the spark was the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini last month. Known as “Zhina,” she died in the custody of morality police who detained her for breaking the relentlessly, violently enforced rules requiring women to dress modestly.                  In scenes of exhilarated defiance, Iranian women have danced around fires in the night, shedding the hijab – the headcover mandated by the regime – and tossing it into the flames.                 Their peaceful uprising is not really about the hijab; it’s about cutting the shackles of oppression, which is why men have joined them in large numbers, even as the regime kills more and more protesters.                  It’s why women are climbing on cars, waving their hijab in the air, like a flag of freedom, and gathering crowds of supporters in city streets, and in universities, where security forces are opening fire to try and silence them.                 It’s why even elderly women have joined in; why regime brutality has so far proven incapable of snuffing out this rebellion.                 If the prospects for success in Iran’s “Women, life, freedom!” uprising look dim, consider what the prognosis was for Ukraine when what was supposed to be one of the world’s mightiest military forces set out to seize their country.                  After all, it was less than a decade ago that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military entered Syria’s long civil war, helping to save the dictator Bashar al-Assad (as Iran had).                  Putin had built up his forces and thought he could conquer democratic, neighboring Ukraine in a few days. Even US intelligence predicted Russia would capture the capital, Kyiv, in a matter of days, if not hours. That’s why the US reportedly offered to evacuate Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to safety just after Russian forces moved in. But Zelensky refused.                  As Washington warned that Zelensky was a “prime target for Russian aggression,” the Ukrainian president sent a message to his country and to the rest of the world, vowing to stay.                 “We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend all of this.” He concluded, “That is it. That’s all I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”                 A little over seven months later, Russia’s trajectory looks like a trail of war crimes, with hundreds of bombed hospitals, schools, civilian convoys, and mass graves filled with Ukrainians.                  And still Ukraine is pushing ahead, is doing very well in fact, and very possibly winning this war.                  Western support and weaponry have proven key, but the indispensable element in Ukrainians’ success to date is the spirit of their fight. Like the women in Iran, they occupy the moral high ground. They are fighting for their lives, for their freedom. The other side is fighting for power and control over others.                 Because they hold the moral high ground, the struggles of the Ukrainian and the Iranian people have inspired support around the globe among backers of democracy and human rights. In this era of social media, their anthems against fascism have gone viral, as has the brutality of their foes.                  The repressive regimes in Moscow and Tehran are now isolated, pariahs among much of the world, openly supported for the most part by a smattering of autocrats.                 Is it any wonder that Putin’s first trip outside the former Soviet Union since the start of his Ukraine war was to Iran? Is it any wonder Iran has trained Russian forces and is now believed to have provided Russia with advanced drones to kill Ukrainians?                 These are two regimes that, while very different in their ideologies, have much in common in their tactics of repression and their willingness to project power abroad.             These are two regimes that, while very different in their ideologies, have much in common in their tactics of repression and their willingness to project power abroad.             Frida Ghitis                  They both pretend to be democracies. But there’s no genuine choice about who holds power and who makes the rules.                 Iran’s prisons are filled with regime critics and courageous journalists – including Niloofar Hamedi, first to report what happened to Mahsa Amini. In Russia as well, journalism is a deadly profession. So is criticizing Putin. After trying and failing to kill opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Putin’s people manufactured charges to keep him in a penal colony indefinitely.                 Multiple Putin critics have suffered mysterious deaths. Many have fallen out of windows. And both Iran and Russia have become leading practitioners of transnational repression, killing critics on foreign soil, according to Freedom House and other democracy research and advocacy groups.                    Moscow and Tehran have sought to foment their ideologies beyond their borders. That’s why the struggles of the Ukrainian and Iranian people will have repercussions beyond their countries.                  For people in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, there’s more than passing interest in the admittedly low probability that the Iranian regime could fall. It would be transformative for their countries and their lives, heavily influenced by Tehran. After all, Iran’s constitution calls for spreading its Islamist revolution.                   For people living in autocracies supported by Putin, the Ukrainian war could change everything at home.                 For the rest of the world, it’s a time of uncertainty and expectation. Seven months ago, some viewed Putin as something of a genius. That myth has turned to dust. The man who helped suppress uprisings, entered wars, and tried to manipulate elections across the planet now looks cornered.                  Nobody knows what happens next. No one knows how all this ends. As the people in Ukraine and Iran fight for their freedom, for self-determination, the world stands at an inflection point.

Meanwhile, the IRGC, the elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country’s revolution in 1979, has asked all people to identify protesters, the country’s semi-official news agency Fars News said.                 Thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets in protest since the death last week of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was apprehended in Tehran and taken to a “re-education center,” apparently for not wearing her hijab properly.                   Since Friday, demonstrations have taken place in at least 40 cities nationwide, including the capital Tehran, with protesters demanding an end to violence and discrimination against women as well as an end to compulsory wearing of the hijab.                 At least 1,200 have been arrested in connection to the protests, Iranian state-backed news agency Tasmin reported Saturday, citing a security official.                 Dozens of protesters have reportedly been killed in the resulting clashes with security forces.                  CNN cannot independently verify the death toll –  a precise figure is impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm – and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists. Amnesty International said Friday that at least 30 people, including four children, had died; according to state media the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, 35 people have died.                 The demonstrations have also seen journalists targeted by authorities, with at least 17 arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit that monitors press freedom.                 Meanwhile, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has asked all people to identify protesters, the country’s semi-official news agency Fars News said.                 The IRCG is the elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country’s revolution in 1979.                 Authorities hope that by restricting the internet they can control the protests – the latest in a wave that has swept Iran in recent years. They started with the Green movement in 2009 over contested election results and more recently the 2019 protests sparked by a rise in fuel prices. Hundreds were believed to have been killed in the violent crackdown three years ago and thousands injured, according to estimates released by the UN and rights groups.                  But this year’s protests are different – in their scope, scale and unprecedented feminist nature. There is also mobilization across the socio-economic divide. A young generation of Iranians are rising up on the streets against decades of repression – arguably bolder than ever.                  The demonstrations have spread to dozens of Iranian cities, from the Kurdish region in the northwest, to the capital Tehran and even more traditionally conservative cities like Mashhad.                  While they were ignited by the death of Amini, the initial calls for accountability have turned into demands for more rights and freedoms, especially for women who for decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have faced discrimination and severe restrictions on their rights.                  But calls for regime change are growing too. People across the country are chanting for “death to the dictator,” in a reference to the Supreme Leader, tearing down portraits of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Remarkable images emerged on Friday night from Khamenei’s birthplace in the city of Mashhad, where protesters set fire to the statue of a man considered one of the symbols of the Islamic Revolution. Such scenes were unthinkable in the past.                  This is all happening at a time when Iran’s hardline leadership is under growing pressure with talks to revive the stalled 2015 nuclear agreement and the state of the economy under US sanctions; ordinary Iranians are struggling to cope with soaring levels of inflation.                 While these protests are the biggest challenge for the government for years, analysts believe the government will likely move to contain them by resorting to the heavy-handed tactics it has used in the past. There are signs a brutal crackdown is coming, along with the internet restrictions on a level not seen since 2019. Other measures include the government mobilizing its supporters in mass rallies following Friday prayers; officials dismissing the demonstrators as rioters and foreign agents, and ominous warnings the army and powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will be deployed to deal with the protests.                  Speaking with state broadcaster IRIB on Friday, Iran’s Minister of Communications Ahmad Vahidi said, “Until the riots end, the internet will have limitations. To prevent riot organization through social media, we are obliged to create internet limitations.”                 Vahidi’s comments came after videos on social media showed scenes of public defiance, with women removing and burning their headscarves and demonstrators chanting such slogans as, “women, life, freedom.”                 The move to further restrict the internet also followed a call by the United Nations for an independent investigation into Amini’s death and for Iran’s security forces to refrain from using  “disproportionate force” on the protesters.                 Outrage over Amini’s death comes from public skepticism over the account given by state officials, who claim she died after suffering a “heart attack” and fell into a coma. But Amini’s family have said she had no pre-existing heart condition.     Iranians are risking it all to protest. Their families say some of them aren't coming home             Amini’s death has now become a symbol of the violent oppression women have faced in Iran for decades, and her name has spread around the globe, with world leaders invoking her even at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City this week.                 The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday said UN experts strongly condemned the use of physical violence against women in Iran by state authorities.                 “Iranian authorities said (Amini) died of a heart attack, and claimed her death was from natural causes. However, some reports suggested that Amini’s death was a result of alleged torture and ill-treatment,” it said in a statement.                 “We call on the Iranian authorities to hold an independent, impartial, and prompt investigation into Ms Amini’s death, make the findings of the investigation public and hold all perpetrators accountable,” it added.                 The internet monitoring agency Netblocks said Friday Iranians are facing a third wave of “nation-scale” loss of mobile internet connectivity as the protests continue.                  The watchdog group said earlier in the week that Iran was experiencing the most severe internet restrictions since 2019, with mobile networks largely shutdown and social networks Instagram and WhatsApp restricted in the country since protests began.                 To circumvent internet blocks, Iranians both inside the country and in the diaspora are turning to popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers such as Tor Project and Hula VPN – the top downloaded apps available in Iran via Google Play Store, a marketplace for Android smartphone users to download apps, according to monitoring service AppBrain.                 However, Netblocks has warned that the kind of internet disruption seen currently in the country “cannot generally be worked around with the use of circumvention software or VPNs.”                  Similar internet restrictions took place in Iran in November 2019, taking Iranians almost entirely offline as authorities tried to curb the spread of nationwide protests over fuel prices.                  Oracle’s Internet Intelligence called it at the time the “largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran.”                 Meanwhile, Internet activist hacker group Anonymous has also targeted the Iranian government online over the past week, announcing several breaches of government websites on Thursday.                  Using the hashtag #OpIran, short for Operation Iran, which started gaining traction on social media following the death of Amini, Anonymous also tweeted Thursday that the organization was successful in hacking more than 1,000 CCTV Iranian cameras – a claim CNN has not been able to independently confirm.                  UN Secretary General António Guterres said Friday he was “concerned about reports of peaceful protests being met with excessive use of force leading to dozens of deaths and injuries.”                  “We call on the security forces to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force and appeal to all to exercise restraint to avoid further escalation,” Dujarric said at the daily briefing on UNTV.                  The UN said it’s closely following the protests in Iran and called on authorities to “respect the right to freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association.”                 “We also call on the authorities to respect women’s rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and implement effective measures to protect them from other human rights violations, in accordance with international standards.”                  Guterres reiterated a call from the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights for a prompt investigation into the death of Amini by an “independent competent authority.”                  Iran’s Interior Minister denied Mahsa Amini was beaten up, citing investigations into the incident, the country’s state news agency, IRNA, reported Saturday.                 “The results of observations, talking with those who were on the scene, receiving reports from relevant bodies and other investigations showed that late Ms. Amini was not beaten, Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi told (Iran’s state broadcaster) IRIB,” IRNA reported.                 Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called Amini’s family saying he had ordered the incident to be investigated carefully so that no rights would be violated, according to IRNA. He said during his trip to the UNGA in New York last week that early coroner’s findings found no signs of beating.                 After returning to Iran follow his trip to the UNGA in New York, Raisi also called the family of a Basij member, a volunteer paramilitary group connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed during protests in Mashhad, according to his official website.                 In the statement released by his office, Raisi expressed his condolences to the family of Rasool Doust Mohammadi, the Basij member, and said there is a “need to distinguish between protest and disruption of public order and security,” while also describing the protests “as rioting and evil.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The sea of people, many of them men, roar as she chops off her ponytail and raises her fist in the air.                 It was a powerful act of defiance Tuesday night in the Iranian city of Kerman, where women are required to wear hijabs (or headscarves) in public, as outrage over the death of a woman in police custody fuels protests across the country.                 Iranian authorities said Wednesday that three people, including a member of the security forces, have been killed in the unrest, which has stretched into a fifth day.                 Human rights groups have reported that at least seven people have been killed.                 The death last week of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested in Tehran by morality police – a dedicated unit that enforces strict dress codes for women, such as wearing the compulsory headscarf – has sparked an outpouring anger over issues ranging from freedoms in the Islamic Republic to the crippling economic impacts of sanctions.     Iran's morality police have terrorized women for decades. Who are they?              The protests are striking for their scale, ferocity and rare feminist nature; the last demonstrations of this size were three years ago, after the government hiked gas prices in 2019.                  After starting Saturday at Amini’s funeral in Iran’s Kurdistan province, the demonstrations have swept much of the country, leading to clashes with security forces trying to quell them.                  Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made no mention of the protests during a speech on Wednesday to veterans and military commanders commemorating the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988.                 The prosecutor in the western city of Kermanshah said two people were killed during “riots” on Tuesday, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The official IRNA state news agency said a police “assistant” was killed and four others injured during protests in Shiraz, the capital city of Fars province in southwestern Iran.                  A 23-year-old in Urmia and a 16-year-old in Piranshahar were shot dead during protests on Tuesday, bringing the total number of demonstrators killed to seven, according to two Kurdish human rights groups monitoring violations in Iran – Kurdistan Human Rights Network and Hengaw, a Norwegian-registered organization.                   Iranian authorities did not confirm the deaths.                 Thousands took to the streets Tuesday night, with videos of protests emerging from dozens of towns and cities – ranging from the capital Tehran to more traditionally conservative strongholds like Mashad.                 Footage shows some protesters chanting, “Women, life, freedom.” Others can be seen setting up bonfires, scuffling with police, or removing and burning their headscarves – as well as destroying posters of the country’s Supreme Leader and shouting, “Death to the dictator.”                 In one video in Tehran, young protesters march around a bonfire on the street at night, chanting: “We are the children of war. Come on and fight, and we’ll fight back.”     Five people killed in Iran in protests over death of woman in police custody, human rights group says             Almost all the provincial towns in Iran’s Kurdish region, including Kermanshah and Hamedan, have seen demonstrations as well.                 Witnesses tell CNN that the Tuesday night demonstrations appeared to be “flash protests” – meaning groups form and disperse quickly, to avoid run-ins with Iran’s security forces after the escalating violence of the last week.                  A source said there was at least one instance of a heavy-handed police response on Tuesday, near Iran’s Enghelab (“Revolution”) Square on the western side of Tehran University – historically a rallying point for protests.                  “Two young men were hit and beaten up by plainclothes police and anti-riot police, then dragged to the van in front of (the) subway entrance gate,” an eyewitness told CNN. “A wounded girl lying on the sidewalk was taken by ambulance to the hospital, and five others arrested on the north side of Enghelab Square.”     Hengaw said 450 people have been injured in the protests.                 Amini was stopped and detained by Iran’s morality police last Tuesday. Iranian officials said that she died last Friday after suffering a “heart attack” and falling into a coma following her arrest.                 However, her family said she had no pre-existing heart condition, according to Emtedad news, an Iranian pro-reform media outlet which claimed to have spoken to Amini’s father.                 Edited security camera footage released by Iran’s state media appeared to show Amini collapsing at a “re-education” center where she was taken to receive “guidance” on her attire.                 Iran’s morality police are part of the country’s law enforcement and are tasked with enforcing the strict social rules of the Islamic Republic, including its dress code that mandates women wear a headscarf, or hijab, in public.                 An aide to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei promised a “thorough investigation” into Amini’s death during a meeting with her family in their home on Monday, according to Iran’s semi-official Nour News agency.     Iranian police say death of Mahsa Amini 'unfortunate' as protestors take to the streets             Abdolreza Pourzahabi, Khamenei’s representative in Iran’s Kurdish province, said the Supreme Leader “is sad” and that the family’s sorrow “is his sorrow too,” according to Nour.                  He added that he hopes the family shows “good will to help bring back calm in society.”                 During a news conference, also on Monday, Greater Tehran Police Commander Hossein Rahimi denied “false accusations” against the Iranian police, saying they had “done everything” to keep Amini alive.                  He added that Amini had not been harmed physically during or after she was taken into custody, and called her death “unfortunate.”                 In the wake of Amini’s death, internet monitoring website Netblocks has documented internet outages since Friday – a tactic Iran has previously used to prevent the spread of protests.                  On Monday, the watchdog said that “real-time network data show a near-total disruption to internet connectivity in Sanandaj, the capital of Kurdistan province.”                 Iran’s minister of communications, Issa Zarepour, said that internet services could be disrupted for “security purposes and discussions related to recent events,” by security forces, the country’s semi-official ISNA news agency reported.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/middleeast/iran-morality-police-mime-intl/index.html,Iran’s morality police have terrorized women for decades. Who are they?,The death of Mahsa Amini has galvanized thousands of Iranian women who have for decades faced the wrath of the Islamic Republic’s morality enforcers firsthand.,"Sep 21, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Nadeen Ebrahim,International,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.             A young Iranian woman was pulled off the streets of Tehran by the country’s notorious morality police and taken to a “re-education center” for lessons in modesty last week. Three days later, she was dead.                   The government has strongly rejected responsibility for 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death, but the news has nonetheless galvanized thousands of Iranian women who have for decades faced the wrath of the Islamic Republic’s morality enforcers firsthand.                  Amini’s story has pulled Iran’s  apparatus of discipline back into the limelight, raising the question of accountability and impunity enjoyed by the country’s clerical elite.                  “It would be hard to find an average Iranian woman or an average family who does not have a story of interaction with [the morality police and re-education centers],” said Tara Sepehri Far, a senior researcher in the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch. “That is how present they are.”                  The morality police are a law enforcement force with access to power, arms and detention centers, she said. They also have control over the recently introduced “re-education centers.”                   The centers act like detention facilities, where women – and sometimes men – are taken into custody for failing to comply with the state’s rules on modesty. Inside the facilities, detainees are given classes about Islam and the importance of the hijab (or headscarf), and then  forced to sign a pledge to abide by the state’s clothing regulations before they are released.                      The first of these establishments opened in 2019, said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, adding that “since their creation, which has no basis in any law, agents of these centers have arbitrarily detained countless women under the pretense of not complying with the state’s forced hijab.”                  “The women are then treated like criminal[s], booked for their offense, photographed and forced to take a class about how to wear a proper hijab and Islamic morality,” he added.      Iran's Supreme Leader shown at event amid reports of deteriorating health             Iran had been dictating to women how they should dress long before the establishment of the current Islamic Republic. In 1936, the pro-Western ruler Reza Shah banned the wearing of allveils and headscarves in an effort to modernize the country. Many women resisted. Then, the Islamic regime that overthrew the Shah’s Pahlavi dynasty made the hjiab compulsory in 1979, but the rule was only written into law in 1983.                  A task force with all the powers of a law enforcement agency, the morality police are  tasked with ensuring that the rules are followed.                   A number of anti-hijab movements emerge every few years in Iran, often leading to waves of arrests and persecution. These include the “Girls of Revolution Street” in 2017 , as well as this year’s brief social media protests on the country’s National Hijab and Chastity Day, which is observed annually on July 12 to promote veiling.                  But disagreements have emerged on the issue of the compulsory hijab, both among citizens and within the leadership.                  A survey by a parliament-linked research center in 2018 showed that there has been a decrease in the number of people who believe that the government should enforce the headscarf. And a 2014 report by the Iranian Students’ News Agency showed a 15% rise in those believing that hijab should not be compulsory.                   There has also been a rhetorical shift among the country’s leadership, calling for “education” and “correction” as opposed to forceful implementation of Islamic values, says the researcher, Sepehri Far.                  Some say that Iran is slowly nearing a tipping point as the government faces mounting discontent over a crippled economy and skyrocketing inflation caused by US sanctions.                   Amini’s death seems to be uniting Iranians of different mindsets, says Sepehri Far, adding that criticism over the incident is coming not just from regime opponents, but also from citizens with no previous history of dissidence, as well as those who are close to power.       Thousands across Iran took to the streets Tuesday night, according to witnesses and social media footage.       Videos on social media showed a woman cutting her hair in protest, as the crowd chants “death to the dictator” in Kerman province in southeast Iran. In other parts of the country, demonstrators chanted “We are the children of war, come on and fight, we’ll fight back,” and “death to Khamenei.”                  “This time protesters aren’t only calling for justice for Mahsa Amini,” said Ghaemi. “They’re also calling for women’s rights, for their civil and human rights, for a life without a religious dictatorship.”                   While there is a sense that the regime may feel vulnerable, some question whether the current movement will expand or simply weaken in the face of a state crackdown.                   “Not only are these protests brutally cracked down [on] and contained each time, but there is no leadership,” said Tara Kangarlou, author of “The Heartbeat of Iran,” who grew up under the gaze of the morality police.                   “Growing up as a teenager, we would make sure we avoid[ed] streets that we knew the morality police vans would be parked [on] during the weekend,” said Kangarlou.                   She says young Iranians have evolved within the “oppressive system” in order to live their lives, but the “average Iranian is fed up.”      Tunisia’s anti-terrorism police  arrest former leader              Tunisia’s anti-terrorism police detained for one day Ali Laarayedh, a former prime minister and senior official in the opposition Ennahda party, after an investigation into allegations jihadists were sent to Syria, Reuters cited lawyers as saying on Tuesday.

My thoughts are with the Royal Family on this historic and emotional day. pic.twitter.com/CdBq1cU2rT Egypt: #Salah               Egyptian football star Mo Salah’s tribute to Queen Elizabeth has caused a heated debate among his compatriots on social media.                    The Liverpool player tweeted a picture of the monarch on Monday with a message to mark her passing: “My thoughts are with the Royal Family on this historic and emotional day.” Some of his Egyptian fans weren’t as enthusiastic, criticizing his condolences to the monarch of a country with a controversial colonial past.                    Several users replied with photos from the 1956 Suez crisis, which took place four years after the Queen took the throne and saw a joint Israeli-British-French invade Egypt to retake the Suez Canal after it was nationalized. Another user called on Salah to read up on the Queen’s history in the Arab world. “Brother do u know what this woman’s empire did to our country or shall I inform u,” tweeted another.                   Other users, however, jumped to Salah’s defense, saying the blowback was not justified. Egyptian sports journalist Omar Elbanouby tweeted: “Hands off Mohammed Salah… he is a professional footballer.. not a political activist.”                   Sudanese writer Mohammed Abo Zaco called out some of Salah’s critics for hypocrisy, pointing out that it was seemingly  OK for Arabs to support British football clubs and drive British cars, but not to pay respects to the Queen, who was laid to rest on Monday.                   European football clubs are immensely popular in the Arab world, with some being owned by regional governments, including Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/11/tv-shows/muslim-representation-television-study-trnd/index.html,"Muslims are 25% of the world population. But in 200 shows researchers studied, they were just 1% of speaking characters","Despite making up one quarter of the world’s population, Muslims are severely underrepresented on television – and when they are represented, they’re depicted as shallow stereotypes, according to a new study.","Sep 11, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Zoe Sottile,International,"Despite making up one quarter of the world’s population, Muslims are severely underrepresented on television – and when they are represented, they’re depicted as shallow stereotypes, according to a new study.                 Researchers from the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism analyzed over 200 TV series that aired between 2018 and 2019, hoping to understand how Muslims were portrayed on popular shows.                 They found that only 1% of speaking characters were Muslim – whereas 25% of the world’s population is Muslim.             And across the 200 TV series, only 12 series regulars were Muslim, the study found. Seven of those Muslim series regulars were perpetrators or targets of physical violence – part of the pervasive stereotyping of Muslim characters, according to the researchers.     On 'Ramy' he plays a sidekick. Now he's starring in his own show             The research focused on scripted, episodic series from the US, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. A total of 87% of the shows studied didn’t include even one Muslim speaking character, says the study.                 The Muslims that were portrayed tended to follow stereotypes – and they lacked the diversity that characterizes the real Muslim population, according to the study. Over half of Muslim speaking characters were men, and they were mostly Middle Eastern. Very few Muslims were identified with the LGBTQ community and none were shown with a disability, the researchers found.                 The researchers identified several tropes that dominated the depiction of Muslim characters on TV. Muslims tended to be depicted as “foreign,” speaking accented English or not speaking English at all. Almost a third of Muslim speaking characters were violent against other characters – and 40% were the targets of violence.                 Muslim women tended to be depicted as “fearful and endangered,” according to the study. They were shown mostly as the victims of threats and violence.                 These portrayals have real-life impact on the ways that viewers think about Muslims, argued the researchers. The Pew Research Center has consistently found that Americans have the most negative views of Muslims as compared to other religious groups.                 “Attitudes toward Muslims may be formed by a variety of factors,” they wrote. “However, one in particular, the mass media, is a component within the control of storytellers and content creators.”                 The researchers pointed to some recent series that have countered these stereotypes, like Hulu’s “Ramy,” a comedy series about a young Egyptian American man living in New Jersey.                 And they called for greater and more complex portrayals of Muslim characters on TV, particularly those created by Muslim filmmakers.                  “Centering stories on Muslim characters will require changes both on screen as well as behind the camera,” wrote the research team.                  “Across the sample in this study, it was clear that few if any writers were Muslim. Working with Muslim creatives to develop and bring stories about Muslims to the screen is essential to increasing authentic portrayals.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Syed, 51, is being held on murder charges for the July 26 killing of 41-year-old Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of 27-year-old Muhammad Afzaal Hussain. He has not been charged but police say he is the primary suspect in two other homicides: that of 62-year-old Mohammad Zaher Ahmadi, killed November 7, and of 25-year-old Naeem Hussain, killed August 5.                  Syed denied involvement in the killings during an interview with police, according to an arrest affidavit.                  Authorities are still exploring what could have been the motive behind the killings, Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the city police department’s criminal investigation division, said at a news conference Tuesday.     Related articleSuspect in the killings of Muslim men in Albuquerque makes his first court appearance             One of the victims’ relatives spoke to CNN about his experience with Syed. Sharief Hadi – whose brother, Ahmadi, was killed in November – said it’s agonizing waiting for answers.                  When police announced Syed’s name as a primary suspect in the killing, Hadi said he remembered him as a disgruntled customer at the halal market he owned with his slain brother. Hadi recalled a time several years ago, during which Syed purchased rice using food stamps and then tried to return the rice to get cash back. Hadi said he told Syed he couldn’t receive cash and said Syed grew angry and returned several times trying to get money back for the rice. He alleges Syed also called and harassed Hadi and his brother.                  Ahmadi was found with a gunshot wound near the back door of their market, where Hadi said he’d been taking a break after a long day of work. Authorities said the victim was ambushed and fired upon.                 “I feel miserable every day,” Hadi said through tears. “I lost my lovely brother.”                 Albuquerque police this week also shared eight incident reports with CNN involving Syed dating back to 2017. Those included allegations of domestic violence, battery, assault, battery domestic violence, aggravated assault, food stamp fraud and shoplifting, though not all resulted in an arrest. Police also listed an allegation of child abuse in 2019, but they could not release any details on that incident.                  The disposition of all charges against Syed could not be immediately determined. However, all three domestic violence charges against Syed were dismissed, Hartsock said in a Tuesday news conference. A spokeswoman for the Bernalillo County district attorney’s office told the New York Times that the victims in the cases did not want to pursue charges.                 As for other allegations against Syed, Hartsock characterized them as “minor, misdemeanor arrests.”                 Syed’s daughter, who spoke to CNN reporters earlier this week, said the family arrived from Afghanistan roughly six years ago. The daughter, who CNN is not naming out of concerns for her safety, said Syed is “not a person who can kill somebody,” and had always talked about peace.                   Among the reports that were shared with CNN was an instance in July 2017 when Syed’s then 20-year-old daughter “reported ongoing verbal and physical disputes” but said she did not want to have her father arrested because it would make the “family dynamic worse,” according to a police report.                 In another instance, in February 2018, a man who identified himself as Syed’s former son-in-law told police the two had gotten into a verbal argument about him dating Syed’s daughter and Syed verbally threatened to kill him, according to an incident report from the police department. Syed reported he wanted the man to stop calling him and had not threatened him, according to the report. The man declined to press charges, according to the report, and no charges were filed due to lack of evidence.      Related articleHundreds of tips helped police identify and charge 'primary suspect' in killings of Muslim men, police say. Now they're searching for motive             In May 2018, Syed was arrested after an alleged altercation with his wife at the New Mexico Human Services Department. He told police that they were arguing over his wife’s driving and she slapped him. His wife told authorities she was driving the two of them to the department and her husband, who was yelling that she was not a good driver, allegedly “pulled her by the hair and kicked her out of the vehicle,” and made her walk the roughly two-hour journey to the building, according to a police report. When she arrived, he allegedly grabbed his wife by the hair and threw her on the ground, where an employee found her crying and saw a “large piece of hair” on the floor, according to the report. Syed was arrested on charges of domestic violence and battery. He pleaded not guilty and the charges were dismissed, court records show.                 Syed was arrested again in December 2018 after his then 17-year-old son called police and alleged his father hit him in the back of his head “with a large metal slotted spoon causing a laceration,” according to a police report. The son told police his father regularly “beat him and his mother” and showed an officer the blood on the back of his head, according to that report, but Syed denied the violence. Syed was arrested on charges of domestic violence and aggravated battery. He again pleaded not guilty, and his case was dismissed after he complied with prosecution conditions that court records didn’t specify.                 Mazin Kadhim,  the case manager assigned to provide refugee services to the family, described his relationship with Syed as a turbulent one and said he had grown worried over the relationship with his family.                  “With him – one time he’s happy with me, nine times he’s angry with me. For no reason,” Kadhim told CNN. “The way he was talking to me as a case worker was sometimes scary.”                 Kadhim said he believed Syed’s family was “afraid of him” and that he had reported his concerns about Syed to the refugee assistance program he worked for at the time, as well as to authorities.

On Tuesday, police announced they had arrested 51-year-old Muhammad Syed, saying they would be charging him with two of the homicides: the July 26 killing of Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain.                 As for the two other killings, police said there is evidence that Syed as the “most likely person of interest or suspect” in those as well, Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the city police department’s criminal investigations division said.                 According to the criminal complaint, Syed denied any involvement in the killings during an interview with police on Tuesday.                 Here’s what we know about the lives lost. CNN will continue to update this story with more details as we learn them:                  Mohammad Ahmadi was shot and killed outside of a business he and his brother ran together in November 2021, according to CNN affiliate KOAT.                 Ahmadi was from Afghanistan, police said.                  Muhammad Imtiaz Hussain had been living with his brother, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, in the same apartment complex for almost five years and had never had any problems.                 The brothers came to the US on student visas, studying at the University of New Mexico, and they would often take early morning or late night walks to the university library without any fear for their safety – until now.                 On August 1, police got a call about a drive-by shooting near the intersection of Cornell Drive and Garfield Avenue. They found Muhammad Afzaal Hussain with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a criminal complaint obtained from CNN affiliate KOAT.                 His face was distorted from gunshot wounds, his brother Imtiaz Hussain said.                 “This is not a random killing,” Hussain said. “This is extremely motivated and extreme hatred.”                 Afzaal Hussain was loved by everyone and a student leader excited for a future in politics once he gained US citizenship.                  “We are in extreme fear,” Imtiaz Hussain said. “Living in this place is very painful.”                 Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española. He had studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan before receiving both master’s and bachelor’s degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico, according to a news release from Española Mayor John Ramon Vigil.                  “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.”                 Naeem Hussain, 25, had been a US citizen for less than a month when he was found by Albuquerque police officers just before midnight Friday.                 His brother-in-law Ehsan Shahalami identified Hussian to CNN on Sunday and said he had migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim.                 “He had a lot of dreams and he accomplished some of them,” Shahalami said. “His others were cut short by this heinous act.”                 Hours before his own death, Hussain attended a funeral for two of the recent victims and expressed concern about the shootings, said Tahir Gauba, spokesperson for the Islamic Center of New Mexico.                 Hussain worked as a truck driver for several years from Albuquerque, a job he took immense pride in, according to Shahalami.                 “He was not even a citizen at the time but he would say, ‘This is our country, these people need us more than any other time,’ so he drove extra shifts to keep things rolling,” Shahalami said.                  After becoming a US citizen, Hussain opened his own trucking business, had plans to bring over his wife from Pakistan and was interested in buying property in Virginia, according to Shahalami.                 “He was the most generous, kind, giving, patient, and down-to-earth person that I could ever meet,” he said. “He was very hard working.”                  Hussain wasn’t just working to support himself – he would share his earnings with family back home, Shahalami said.                 After the funerals Friday, Gauba said, Hussain attended a lunch at the mosque and approached him asking if he had more information on the shootings.                 “We (The Islamic Center of New Mexico) thought after burial of these two young men (on Friday), we would have closure and move on and let law enforcement investigate,” Gauba said. “Waking up Saturday morning to his (Naeem Hussain) death, the whole community just feels helpless. There’s a lot of fear.”                   About 700 to 800 Muslims on Fridays attend the Islamic Center of New Mexico, the largest mosque in Albuquerque founded in the mid-1970s, according to Gauba.                 Aftab Hussein was found with multiple gunshot wounds, lying next to a car on Rhode Island Street on July 26.                 Detectives learned that a gunman had waited behind a bush near the driveway where the victim usually parks his vehicle and then fired through the bush multiple times when Hussein got out of his vehicle, according to the complaint.                 He was a Muslim man from Pakistan, police said.        CNN’s Nouran Salahieh contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Here's what we know about them             Albuquerque police announced Tuesday they had arrested 51-year-old Muhammad Syed, who they described as the “primary suspect” and the driver of a dark silver sedan-style vehicle authorities previously described as a “vehicle of interest.”                  The suspect is being charged with two of the homicides: the July 26 killing of Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain.                 The FBI is assisting with the investigation, and an online portal was set up for residents to upload videos and images which might help authorities investigating the killings. The local Crime Stoppers Board has also voted to increase a reward for information leading to an arrest to $20,000.                 “While we are still sifting through all the evidence to look for more connections, it is deeply troubling that these three men were Muslim and of similar descent,” deputy commander of Albuquerque Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division, Kyle Hartsock, previously said.                 Here’s what we know about the killings and the investigation so far:                 The most recent of the killings was reported Friday, when Naeem Hussain was found dead by Albuquerque police officers who responded to reports of a shooting just before midnight in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue.                 After the discovery, Albuquerque police said the homicide “may be connected” to three previous killings of Muslim men from South Asia.                 Those three men – Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, Aftab Hussein and Mohammad Ahmadi – were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” Hartsock previously said.     Related articleOne of four Muslim men slain in potentially linked Albuquerque killings remembered as 'brilliant public servant'              Two of them, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain and Aftab Hussein, were both Pakistani men and were killed in Southeast Albuquerque near Central Avenue. Police said they “determined there is a connection” between those two deaths.                 On August 1, police got a call about a drive-by shooting near the intersection of Cornell Drive and Garfield Avenue. They found Muhammad Afzaal Hussain with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a criminal complaint obtained from CNN affiliate KOAT.                 On July 26, police responded to Rhode Island Street where they found Aftab Hussein with multiple gunshot wounds, lying next to a car. Detectives learned that the gunman had waited behind a bush near the driveway where the victim usually parks his vehicle and then fired through the bush multiple times when Hussein got out of his vehicle,  the complaint states.                 Police found that casings from both the August 1 and July 26 shootings were likely fired from the same firearm, according to Hartsock.                 As investigators probed those two recent killings, they turned their attention to the November 7, 2021, homicide of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan who was killed outside a business he ran with his brother on San Mateo Boulevard.                 Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had just become a US citizen last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami.                 He opened his own trucking business this year and was described as being a kind, generous and hardworking person.                 The day he was killed, he had attended a funeral for the two recent victims and expressed fear about the shootings, according to a spokesman with a mosque in Albuquerque.                 Muhammad Afzaal Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española. He had studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan before receiving both master’s and bachelor degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico, according to a news release from the mayor.                 “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Mayor John Ramon Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.”                 Few details have been released about the two other victims. Police said Mohammad Ahmadi was a Muslim man from Afghanistan and Aftab Hussein was a Muslim man from Pakistan.                 Prior to the news Tuesday that a suspect had been detained, police had only released a flyer showing a “vehicle of interest” in all four killings. But it remained unclear who the car belongs to, or how they are potentially connected to the attacks.                 Police said the vehicle “is suspected as being used as a conveyance in recent homicides of 4 Muslim men.”                 “We have a very, very strong lead. We have a vehicle of interest … we have got to find this vehicle,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller previously said. “We don’t know at this point what it is associated with, or who owns it.”                 While police have not definitively said all four attacks are connected, they have said they are looking into whether it is the case.                 “There is one strong commonality in all the victims; the race and religion,” Hartsock said in a Thursday briefing.                 Authorities are asking the public to come forward with any information which might help in the investigation. Tips may be submitted to the Albuquerque Metro CrimeStoppers website.                 Authorities are still searching for a motive behind the killings and working to confirm whether they’re all related.  Syed is now being charged with two of the homicides – of Aftab Hussein and Muhammad Afzaal Hussain – and police said there is evidence “strong enough that” authorities are continuing to view Syed as the “most likely person of interest or suspect” in the other two killings as well, Hartsock said.                 After Friday’s killing, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Saturday she would send additional state police to Albuquerque.                 “I am angered and saddened that this is happening in New Mexico, a place that prides itself on diversity of culture and thought. This is not who we are,” Grisham said in a statement. “We will not stop in our pursuit of justice for the victims and their families and are bringing every resource to bear to apprehend the killer or killers – and we WILL find them.”                 The attacks have drew condemnation from President Joe Biden, who said he was “angered and saddened” by the attacks.     Related articleOpinion: In the world's largest democracy, 'looking Muslim' could cost your life             Meanwhile, local and national Muslim groups had warned residents to be cautious.                 “We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” Islamic Center of New Mexico posted on Facebook. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.”                 The center said while there was no evidence its mosque is being targeted, it was still taking steps to provide additional security measures.                 “The lives of Albuquerque Muslims are in danger.

Now he’s haunted by the spot where his brother was ambushed and killed.                  “I see from the window, this is the place where my brother died,” said Hussain, who lived in the same Albuquerque apartment complex as his brother Muhammad Afzaal Hussain.                  “I’m scared to go outside of my apartment,” the grieving brother said. “I’m scared to sit on my balcony.”                 For Muslims in New Mexico, everyday life is now permeated by fear after four Muslim men — including Muhammad Afzaal Hussain – were gunned down in Albuquerque.     Related articleMuhammad Afzaal Hussain was a 'brilliant public servant,' a New Mexico mayor says             Three of the victims – Hussain, 27; Aftab Hussein, 41, and Mohammad Ahmadi, 62 – were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” said Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of Albuquerque Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division.                 The fourth victim – 25-year-old Naeem Hussain – was found dead Friday night by Albuquerque police. He became the third Muslim man killed in the city within two weeks and the fourth since November.                 Hours before his death, Naeem Hussain – who just became a US citizen – attended a funeral for two of the other shooting victims. The young man expressed concern about the recent shootings, said Tahir Gauba, spokesperson for the Islamic Center of New Mexico.                 While no suspect information has been released, Albuquerque police say the killings of the four men from South Asia “may be connected.”                 Hussain said whoever killed his brother didn’t just steal the life of a beloved family member; they also ripped away his family’s sense of freedom.                 “My kids do not allow me even to step out of my apartment. They say, ‘Dad, it’s scary,’” Hussain said just steps from where his brother was gunned down.                 “We planted some flowers in our yard, and we haven’t even watered them. They said, ‘No, somebody might be hiding over there.’”                 Hussain had the grim task of identifying his brother’s remains at the medical examiner’s office. He said his brother’s body was mutilated so badly, it was clear the killing was deliberate.                  “More than half of his head is gone. … At the time that I saw the body, he didn’t even have half of the face,” Hussain said.                  “This is not a random killing. This is extremely motivated and extreme hatred.”                 The grief and terror have spread to Muslims across New Mexico, said Ahmad Assed, president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico.                 “Incredibly terrified. Panicked. Some people want to move from the state until this thing is over. Some people have moved from the state,” Assed said.                  “Businesses are closing … early. Students won’t leave their homes,” he said. “It’s affecting people from coming over to the mosque to conduct their services, their prayers.”                 Police are seeking “a vehicle of interest” that might be connected to the four killings. They tweeted a photo of the car, a dark gray or silver Volkswagen with four doors and tinted windows. Police said it might be a Volkswagen Jetta.

But he said he’s speaking out to try to stop the violence.                 “I am raising voice for my brother because I do not want any other’s brother to become victim of those shooters, any sister to become victim of those shooters, any mom or dad to become victim of shooter,” Hussain said.                  He said he hopes “other people do not become victim of those shooters and suffer like I’m suffering.”                 While police have not called the four killings hate crimes, “in my opinion, clearly it is hate-driven,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said Monday.                 “They are obviously targeting Muslim men, and they are happening right here in our own refugee community,” Keller told CNN.                 “We know that folks in our community, in the Muslim community especially, they are afraid to even leave their house, especially at night. They are afraid to pray. They are afraid to go to school,” the mayor said.      Related article49 states and territories have hate crime laws -- but they vary             Albuquerque is not just “in a place of grieving right now, but also at a place of outrage,” Keller said. But the community is determined to help.                  “We have marshaled every resource to have now police presence at all our mosques during prayer time,” the mayor said. “We are even doing meal deliveries for families that are afraid to leave their house to get food.”                 Assed, the mosque president, said he’s now among the many Muslims in New Mexico grappling with fear every day.                 “I get in the car, and I’m watching every which way possible. I’m watching my side mirror. I’m looking in the back. I’m looking out for any sign of anything out of the ordinary,” he said.                 “At the end of the day, we don’t have an alternative.”                  Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had become a US citizen just last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami.                 “He was the most generous, kind, giving, patient and down-to-earth person that I could ever meet,” said Shahalami. “He was very hardworking. He shared whatever he made with his family back home.”                 The young man, who opened his own trucking business this year, had plans to bring his wife over from Pakistan and buy some property in Virginia, Shahalami said.                 “He had a lot of dreams, and he accomplished some of them,” Shahalami said. “His others were cut short by this heinous act.”                 The day he was killed, Hussain attended a funeral for two other Muslim men who were recently killed in the city, said Tahir Gauba, director of public affairs with the Islamic Center of New Mexico.                 Hussain went to a lunch at the mosque after the funerals and approached Gauba to ask if he had more information on the shootings, Gauba told CNN.                 “He stopped by to say ‘Hey, what’s going on?’ He was worried. I told him to be careful,” Gauba said.                 “We thought after burial of these two young men (on Friday), we would have closure and move on and let law enforcement investigate,” Gauba said. “Waking up Saturday morning to his death, the whole community just feels helpless. There’s a lot of fear. … It’s driving everybody crazy.”                 Two other Muslim men killed – Muhammed Afzaal Hussain and Aftab Hussein – were members of the same mosque. Both were from Pakistan and were killed in southeast Albuquerque just days apart, police said.                 After their killings, police began investigating whether the November 7 slaying of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan, was connected.                 The Islamic Center of New Mexico is painfully familiar with violence against Muslims in the community.                  An arsonist started a fire on the center’s property in November, the city of Albuquerque’s website said. A month later, police arrested someone on suspicion of arson and negligent arson.                 Fortunately, no one was in the mosque at the time of the fire, Assed said.                 But now the center, where about 700 to 800 Muslims gather on Fridays, is warning residents to be cautious.     Related articleThe recent killings of 4 Muslim men in Albuquerque have shaken the city. Here's what we know             “We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” the center posted on Facebook. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.”                 After Hussain’s killing Friday, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced she will send additional state police to Albuquerque.                 The city is also increasing police presence at mosques, Muslim-affiliated schools and the University of New Mexico, officials announced.                 “We have heard from the community that the fear is so strong, there is a concern about even things like groceries and getting meals for certain folks in certain areas of town,” Keller said in a weekend briefing, adding the city is helping with providing meals for those affected by the killings.                 Albuquerque has always felt like a welcoming community for Muslims, even after 9/11, Gauba said. “This is the first time we are feeling this kind of atmosphere,” he said. “We are in fear.”       CNN’s Raja Razek contributed to this report.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

According to a complaint filed last week in federal district court, the plaintiffs, Abobakkr Dirar and Mohamed Elamin, allege they boarded a flight from Seattle to San Francisco on February 17, 2020, and after being seated in their first-class seats, they started speaking and texting in Arabic. Another passenger, who did not speak Arabic the complaint says, saw some of Dirar’s text messages and told the crew who removed Dirar and Elamin from the flight due to what they claimed to be a “ticket issue.”                    Once Dirar and Elamin were off the flight, the men spoke with an Alaska Airlines manager who translated their text messages and the messages were deemed not to be a threat, but the men were subsequently surrounded by law enforcement, according to the complaint.                 Dirar and Elamin, the complaint says, felt humiliated for being taken off the plane and being surrounded by law enforcement while allowing other passengers to observe “humiliating Plaintiffs before their fellow passengers by unnecessarily deplaning said passengers and allowing them to observe Plaintiffs surrounded by uniformed law enforcement personnel.”                   According to the complaint, they are seeking damages against the airline.                  The pair was booked on subsequent flights separately to San Francisco, but Elamin had to sit in a downgraded seat and both passengers arrived at their destinations hours later than originally intended.                  Dirar and Elamin’s attorney, Luis Segura, told CNN in a statement that Alaska Airlines could have handled the situation better after finding that the complaining passenger’s claims were baseless.                   The airline “…could have acted responsibly by calming tensions, apologizing to our clients for their mistreatment, and allowing our clients to remain in their rightful seats, he said. “Instead, Alaska Airlines chose to pile onto the bigotry by using these two Black, Muslim American passengers as props in an admittedly unjustified, unnecessary, and self-serving display of security theater. By bringing this lawsuit, our clients not only seek justice for themselves, but also for an entire community tired of being scapegoated to justify discrimination in air travel.”                   When asked why it took more than two years to file a lawsuit, Segura told CNN that in December of 2020, Alaska Airline’s counsel stated that they would be conducting an internal investigation into the matter but never reached back out to his clients.                 In a statement to CNN, Alaska Airlines says it takes discrimination complaints very seriously.                 “Our greatest responsibility is to ensure that our flight operations are safe every day, and that includes complying with federal regulations on investigating any passenger safety reports.  Since this case remains pending litigation, we’re unable to share any further comment or details at this time.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.             In “The Wizard of Oz,” a tornado sends Dorothy and her Kansas home spinning into the “Merry Old Land of Oz.” Last week it was what Politico called a “political earthquake” in Kansas that sent the national debate over abortion into a new phase with many unknowns.                 For decades, the anti-abortion movement worked to overturn the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a national right to abortion. But their long-sought goal, finally achieved in June, may turn out to be a case of “be careful what you wish for.” By a vote of 59% to 41%, the people of Kansas rejected an amendment to the state constitution that would have eliminated the right to an abortion.                 “It’s a huge victory for abortion rights,” wrote Jill Filipovic. “The result in Kansas confirms that Americans simply do not want an extreme anti-abortion movement regulating women’s bodies. Kansans have said what most Americans believe: abortion is an issue best left to women and their doctors.”                 But she added that this was a vote which should never have happened. “Fundamental rights – and it doesn’t get more fundamental than sovereignty over one’s own body – should not be up for a vote, even if the righteous side is likely to win,” Filipovic argued.                 Writing for Politico, John F. Harris suggested that the vote in Kansas, along with others that may follow, could scramble the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority opinion overturning Roe. He may go down in history as the “the justice who facilitated a national consensus on behalf of abortion rights. Quite unintentionally, today’s hero of the ‘pro-life’ movement could end up being a giant of the ‘pro-choice’ movement.”                 Tuesday’s vote in Kansas, which “mirrors polling showing solid majorities of people supported leaving Roe v. Wade intact, suggests that opponents of legal abortion do better when the prospect of an abortion ban is hypothetical, while abortion-rights supporters do better when the issue is tangibly real,” wrote Harris.                 A moderate Republican, former Rep. Charlie Dent, noted that “the overturning of Roe v. Wade has energized a previously demoralized Democratic base and could galvanize college educated suburban women in particular … If the GOP can’t win an abortion fight in Kansas, imagine the difficulty it will face in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.”                 “Coupled with Trump’s stolen election obsession, mass shootings and a growing number of extreme GOP candidates in competitive races, the unpopularity of the Roe decision may mitigate Democratic losses in November, despite vulnerabilities on a number of other fronts (namely, the economy).”                 Dent also faulted Democrats for running ads that backed extreme, election-denying candidates in the GOP primaries in the hope that Democratic candidates could more easily defeat them in the general election. In Michigan, “the courageous freshman Congressman Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Trump just days after being sworn into Congress, fell to an election-denying candidate, John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who was backed by the former President,” Dent wrote.                  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent more than $300,000 on ads touting Gibbs’ “conservatism and fidelity to Trump,” wrote Dent. “I’m sure plenty of Democratic operatives are cackling over their success meddling in the GOP primary, but any smugness may turn into deep regret if Gibbs ends up prevailing in November. Those who play with fire often get burned.”                 For more:     Mary Ziegler and Elizabeth Sepper: The coming state-federal showdown over abortion Aziza Ahmed and Ji Seon Song: Protecting patients’ privacy is paramount in time of uncertain abortion access             China fired off missiles, flew jets into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and called off talks with the US on issues such as climate change and military relations. The reason: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, which China sees as part of its territory.                 While Pelosi’s visit sparked apocalyptic warnings and fevered headlines, Taiwanese-American journalist Clarissa Wei wrote that the people of Taiwan are mostly unfazed. “What’s most frustrating about the reaction to Pelosi’s visit is not the prophetic declaration of imminent doom, but the expectation of fear and the surprise that follows when people realize that we aren’t all panicking in Taiwan – as if the calm we exude in light of unprecedented threats is a symptom of our ignorance of the facts before us.”                 “Threats from China are nothing new. They have been a part of my life, my parents’ lives and their parents’ lives for as long as almost anyone in my family can remember. In fact, Taiwan has been under threat by the People’s Republic of China for nearly 70 years. The three Taiwan Strait crises are proof of that.”                 A Texas jury ordered incendiary radio host Alex Jones to pay a combined $49.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages to the parents of a child killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting 10 years ago. Jones’ legal troubles aren’t over by any means: he faces two more such trials.                     One of the parents, Scarlett Lewis, even had to testify that her son “Jesse was real. I’m a real mom.”                 “It’s an unthinkable statement for a grief-stricken parent to have to make,” wrote Nicole Hemmer, “testifying that her 6-year-old son, murdered while he sat in school, had actually lived, and that she was the woman who had given birth to him and raised him for the too-few years he was alive. But that was the testimony Scarlett Lewis gave this week at a hearing to determine damages against Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist and media personality.”                 “After 20 children and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jones began to spin lurid conspiracies that the shootings never happened and that the shattered families were simply actors. The conspiracy triggered years of harassment as conspiracists targeted the mourning parents, who have had to hire security to protect themselves.”                  But as Hemmer noted, Jones is not a lone fringe player in the media world. He is “part of the right-wing power structure, from his interviews with soon-to-be president Donald Trump to his alleged role as an organizer at the January 6 insurrection.”                 “More than that, many in the Republican Party and conservative movement increasingly sound like Jones, with talk of false flags, crisis actors and pedophile rings now a mainstay of right-wing rhetoric. And while the Trump presidency opened the door for the mainstreaming of Jones, it’s important to understand how ripe the GOP was for Alex Jonesification.”                 In Dallas, the Conservative Political Action Conference gave a warm welcome to Hungary’s autocratic Prime Minister Viktor Orban.                  “The audience cheered him on during his blistering attacks on abortion, immigration, LGBTQ rights and more,” Julian Zelizer observed.                 “The illiberal and anti-democratic elements of Republican politics, which flared during the Trump presidency, are alive and well. As Orban’s popularity indicates, the profoundly anti-democratic strains that have been shaping the GOP keep getting stronger, not weaker…”                 “The talk comes on the same week that several election deniers, as well as participants in the January 6 insurrection, won in the primaries. The assault on the 2020 election continues to be a unifying theme in Republican circles. Even if some Republican voters are tiring of Trump, his rallying cry animates much of the electorate.”                 Eleven years after then-President Barack Obama announced the killing of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in a US raid, President Joe Biden described the tracking down and elimination of bin Laden’s former associate, Ayman al-Zawahiri.                  “The airstrike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri over the weekend in Afghanistan is part of the long and justified campaign by the United States to bring all the heads of the terror group to justice,” wrote Peter Bergen.                  Still, some of the claims about al-Zawahiri’s impact were overblown. “While Zawahiri was influential in the very early years of al Qaeda in turning bin Laden against the regimes in the Middle East, he wasn’t involved in bin Laden’s most important strategic decisions – that is, turning him against the US and planning 9/11. And Zawahiri proved to be an incompetent leader of al Qaeda when he took over the group more than a decade ago.”                 Bergen added, “Zawahiri was not a charismatic leader of al Qaeda in the mold of Osama bin Laden. Instead, he had all the charisma of a boring uncle given to long, arcane monologues, someone that you would best avoid sitting next to at Thanksgiving dinner.”                 Guy Reffitt was sentenced to more than seven years in prison, the longest penalty meted out so far to insurrectionists who took part in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. His son Jackson Reffitt had reported his father to the FBI on Christmas Eve 2020.                  “The Reffitts’ story is tragic, but hardly unique,” observed SE Cupp. “Chances are, you probably do know someone who’s been sucked into the cult of Trumpism, as Guy was.                 “Maybe it’s an aunt or uncle posting about rigged elections on Facebook, spreading Trump’s lie that the election was stolen…                 “Maybe it’s a father, or a mother, or a brother, who’s gone down a QAnon rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, and is no longer attached to reality.”                 “The carnage from Trump’s divisive rhetoric, lies, and conspiracy theories is incalculable. Trumpism is a powerful drug, one that can even cause a father to threaten his own child.                 “This was, incidentally, all by design. Trump stoked the fears and grievances of his base, turned Americans against each other, spread lies and conspiracy theories, undermined our faith in democratic institutions – all so that he could keep his supporters rabid, angry, willing to do whatever he asked. And sadly, many of them did.”                 For more:     Peggy Drexler: Loving your family even when they make horrible choices             On and off the field, Bill Russell was a leader. On and off the screen, Nichelle Nichols was an inspirational role model. Both died last weekend.     Peniel Joseph recalled Russell’s contributions as an athlete and a crusader against racism. “Russell was a 6-foot-10 center whose defensive prowess, rebounding skills and all-around leadership propelled the Celtics to 11 titles in 13 years,” Joseph wrote. “As if appearing in a news reel of the most significant events of the civil rights era, he was present, time and again, at key moments for the movement, from the March on Washington in 1963 to his visit to Mississippi that same year following the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers…”                 “Over the years, he never lost his willingness to call out racism, or a perceived indifference to it. In recent years, he chided White Americans for their incredulity – in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder and the racial and political reckoning that followed – about the existence of systemic racism.”                  When “Star Trek” premiered in 1966, one of the cast members “was the cool, sultry, supremely self-possessed Lt. Nyota Uhura, played by Nichelle Nichols, still a relative newcomer to television,” Gene Seymour recalled. In an era when the civil rights movement achieved its biggest successes, Nichols’ role had a symbolic significance. Yet “she was discouraged by her lines being cut from some of the episodes and was ready to move on to the Broadway stage. And she would have left if she hadn’t met a die-hard ‘Trek’ fan at an NAACP fundraiser in Hollywood: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.”                 King “told her that he and his family enjoyed watching ‘Trek’ and rooted for her playing a non-stereotypical Black character. She thanked him but said she was on her way out,” Seymour wrote.                 “‘You cannot and must not!’” Nichols recalled King saying in her autobiography. “’Don’t you realize how important your presence, your character is? Don’t you see? This is not a Black role, and this is not a female role… You have broken ground. For the first time, the world sees us as we should be seen, as equals, as intelligent people – as we should be.’”                 Nichols stayed with the show for its remaining two seasons and later would embrace “her importance as an inspiration and role model for young Black people whose dreams of space science and travel were emboldened by her character’s futuristic adventures.”     Dean Obeidallah: There’s a good reason Jon Stewart is angry at Ted Cruz Kara Alaimo: What petrifies me about sending my kids to school this year David A.

And even more impressive, getting them to make changes in their work.                 Yet Hannah Diviney, a disability activist in Australia, accomplished just that.                  She called out Lizzo and Beyoncé on Twitter for including an offensive term referring to her disability in recent albums. Both artists soon responded and revised their songs’ lyrics.      “Words matter,” Diviney wrote. “They always have and they always will. Language is one of the few tools in the world most people can wield with ease and on social media even more so. That’s why it’s worth paying attention to how we use it. That’s why my mom always taught me the pen was mightier than the sword.

Bergen’s new paperback is “The Rise and fall of Osama bin Laden.” from which this article is, in part, adapted. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.             The airstrike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri over the weekend in Afghanistan is part of the long and justified campaign by the United States to bring all the heads of the terror group to justice.                 Let’s be clear about who Zawahiri really was. In remarks at the White House on Monday, President Joe Biden described Zawahiri as a terrorist mastermind “deeply involved in the planning of 9/11,” as well as the bombings of the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000 and two US embassies in Africa in 1998 that killed more than 200 people.                  But in my two-and-a-half decades of intensive reporting on al Qaeda, and based on discussions with key CIA and FBI officials tracking both Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden, as well as militants who knew both men, I have found little or no evidence for those assertions.                 As for Zawahiri’s role in recent years as al Qaeda leader, he was unable to resuscitate the terrorist group, which hasn’t carried out a major attack in the West since al Qaeda-trained suicide bombers killed 52 commuters in London in 2005.                 Zawahiri was not a charismatic leader of al Qaeda in the mold of Osama bin Laden. Instead, he had all the charisma of a boring uncle given to long, arcane monologues, someone that you would best avoid sitting next to at Thanksgiving dinner.     How Joe Biden and his team decided to kill the world's most wanted terrorist             This is not to undercut the significance of killing bin Laden’s successor. But let’s be realistic about Zawahiri’s importance historically in the hierarchy of al Qaeda and his role in the organization in more recent years.                  While Zawahiri was influential in the very early years of al Qaeda in turning bin Laden against the regimes in the Middle East, he wasn’t involved in bin Laden’s most important strategic decisions – that is, turning him against the US and planning 9/11. And Zawahiri proved to be an incompetent leader of al Qaeda when he took over the group more than a decade ago.                  Looking ahead, might there be a plausible successor to Zawahiri waiting in the wings who could revive the group’s flagging fortunes?                 The strike against Zawahiri indicates that his successor will likely have substantial freedom of movement to operate in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Indeed Zawahiri was living in downtown Kabul, a fact that was well known to some leaders of the Taliban, according to senior US government officials.                  Before 9/11, Zawahiri was a relatively marginal player in al-Qaeda, despite his role as one of the public faces of the organization.                 In 1986, bin Laden first met Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon, at a hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan where bin Laden was giving a lecture. Bin Laden was intrigued by the older, more politically experienced Zawahiri, who had joined a jihadist group at 15 and had served three years in prison in Egypt. The two became close and Zawahiri encouraged bin Laden to imagine the possibilities of overthrowing the regimes in Arab countries such as Egypt.                 As a result, during the late 1980s Zawahiri influenced bin Laden’s thinking about the need to fight the “near-enemy” Arab regimes such as Egypt. But by the time bin Laden had taken up residence in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in 1996 the two men’s relative importance on the “field of jihad” had changed quite dramatically. Zawahiri was a penniless refugee with virtually no followers whereas bin Laden was a well-known jihadist hero the Taliban had appointed to be responsible for all the Arabs living in Afghanistan.      Opinion: The global jihadist movement is down -- but not out             But bin Laden found a way to use Zawahiri for his own purposes – to advance his goals instead of those of this fellow jihadist whose focus was not on the US but on Egypt. Bin Laden released a statement on behalf of the “World Islamic Front,” a joint declaration made by himself, Zawahiri, and other militant leaders from Bangladesh, Egypt and Pakistan on February 22, 1998. The declaration claimed it was now a religious duty for any Muslim to kill American civilians anywhere in the world.                  This declaration of war made no mention of Zawahiri’s lifelong goal of overthrowing the “near-enemy” Egyptian regime and instead was focused on bin Laden’s “far-enemy” goal of attacking America. Bin Laden had co-opted Zawahiri to be part of his holy war against the US, not the other way around, which was the dominant narrative in the years after the 9/11 attacks.                 There is no evidence that bin Laden’s decision to target the US had any input from Zawahiri, despite later claims that Zawahiri was really the “brains” behind bin Laden.                  The troika who founded and ran al-Qaeda was bin Laden at the apex and his two key lieutenants, the Egyptian military commanders, Abu Ubaidah and Abu Hafs al-Masri (whose real name was Mohammed Atef), both of whom had been on bin Laden’s payroll since the beginning of 1987. They were bin Laden’s men, not Zawahiri’s.                  Like other reporters, I had inflated Zawahiri’s importance to bin Laden’s thinking in my 2001 book, “Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden.” After examining all the evidence, I have since concluded that Zawahiri was a marginal figure when it came to influencing bin Laden’s views, and that he played only a small role in the actions of al-Qaeda in the years leading up the 9/11 attacks.                  This view is also shared by Michael Scheuer, who led the bin Laden unit at CIA from 1996 to 1999, by Daniel Coleman, the most knowledgeable FBI agent investigating bin Laden in the years before 9/11 and by Montasser al-Zayyat, who spent years in prison in Egypt with Zawahiri.      Ayman al-Zawahiri Fast Facts             Noman Benotman, a leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, who knew both men, also said it was bin Laden who told Zawahiri, “Forget about the ‘near enemy’ [the Egyptian government]. The main enemy is the Americans because they dominate the whole area and they’re supporting these Arab regimes.”                  According to the 9/11 Commission, it was bin Laden, Abu Hafs al-Masri, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed an operational planner of 9/11, who discussed what American targets to hit. They selected the US Capitol, the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Zawahiri was not involved in deciding to attack these targets, according to the Commission.                  Bin Laden formally merged Zawahiri’s own Egyptian Jihad Group into al-Qaeda in June 2001. Feroz Ali Abbasi, a Ugandan Briton who was then training at an al-Qaeda camp, described the merger as “more like the assimilation” of Zawahiri’s group. At this point, Zawahiri’s group consisted of only ten men, according to Abu Walid al-Misri, who edited the Taliban’s Arabic-language newspaper. Abu Jandal, one of bin Laden’s key bodyguards, put the number of Zawahiri’s followers at seven Egyptians.                  It was only in the summer of 2001 that bin Laden told Zawahiri the details of the upcoming attacks on New York and Washington.                  Months after the 9/11 attacks, Abu Hafs al-Masri was killed in a US airstrike and Zawahiri succeeded him as bin Laden’s deputy. For the next decade bin Laden and Zawahiri both disappeared until bin Laden was tracked down by the CIA to the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where he was killed in a US Navy SEAL operation in early May 2011.                  Even though Zawahiri had been bin Laden’s deputy since 2001, it took more than six weeks for the group to announce Zawahiri’s ascension to the top spot. Saif al-Adel, an Egyptian former Special Forces officer was appointed “caretaker” leader of al Qaeda in the wake of bin Laden’s death, according to CNN. Adel had long played a prominent role in the terrorist group.                  Eventually Zawahiri was appointed to the top job but proved so incompetent in the job that al-Qaeda and its most successful affiliate, ISIS, formally split in 2014.  It was the first time in its history that al-Qaeda had officially rejected one of its affiliates, and this was not a sign of strength since ISIS was now the most lethal terrorist group in the world.                  During Zawahiri’s time as leader of al Qaeda, the terrorist group was never able to launch an attack in the US, nor against American interests around the world. (An al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen was in communication with a Saudi military officer who killed three US sailors at Naval Air Station Pensacola in 2019, but the central al Qaeda organization led by Zawahiri seems to have had no role in that attack.)                  The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has given al Qaeda “increased freedom of action” in Afghanistan according to a report by the United Nations released in May. Zawahiri apparently felt comfortable at his safehouse in Kabul where he produced video messages, according to senior US officials.                  According to the UN, Zawahiri “issued more frequent recorded messages after the Taliban took over Afghanistan last August,” appearing in eight videos. And al Qaeda also renewed its pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Taliban, according to the UN.             The most likely successor to Zawahiri is Saif al Adel – the former al Qaeda caretaker when bin Laden was killed – who lived in Iran for years after 9/11 and could already be back in Afghanistan.      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              Adel fought the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s, which is how he became part of al Qaeda during its earliest days. According to senior Saudi counterterrorism officials, from Iran, Adel authorized al Qaeda’s branch in Saudi Arabia to launch a campaign of terrorist attacks in the Saudi kingdom that began in May 2003, a campaign that killed scores of people.                  If it is Adel who is tapped for the top job in al Qaeda, he will likely do a far better job of resuscitating al Qaeda than Zawahiri did, which, admittedly, is a low bar.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Zubair – co-founder of fact-checking website Alt News, which debunks misinformation in the Indian media – was arrested by Delhi police on June 27 after a Twitter user accused him of insulting Hindus in a 2018 post about the renaming of a hotel after a Hindu god.                 Zubair had already been granted bail for the case in Delhi but had remained in custody after several police complaints were filed against him in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh in June and July over separate social media posts.                 On Wednesday, the Supreme Court said all of the outstanding cases would be combined and investigated by a special unit of the Delhi police, and ordered his release by 6 p.m. local time.      Related articleIndian police arrest Muslim journalist accused of insulting Hindus             Zubair often tweets criticism of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for what he and other critics claim is a crackdown on the rights of the country’s roughly 200 million Muslims.                 Among his recent social media posts are videos he claims show Hindu extremists giving hate speeches against Islam, a minority religion in India where nearly 80% of people are Hindu.                 Zubair’s arrest came amid repeated accusations by critics that the BJP is using colonial-era laws to quash any form of criticism and encourage self-censorship, and was condemned by free speech advocates.                 In early June, Zubair had highlighted derogatory comments made by a BJP spokesperson about Islam’s Prophet Mohammed that sparked a diplomatic row with several Gulf states.                  The spokesperson, Nurpur Sharma, was suspended by the BJP after at least 15 Muslim-majority nations condemned her remarks, several of them summoning India’s ambassadors.                 In a statement after Zubair’s arrest in June, the Editors Guild of India said it was “apparent that Alt News’ alert vigilance was resented by those who use disinformation as a tool to polarise society and rake nationalist sentiments.”                 Early Thursday, Pratik Sinha, Alt News’ co-founder, posted a photo of him with Zubair on Twitter, thanking their supporters.                  “Zubair wants to convey his heartfelt gratitude to everyone who stood by us and supported us in the last few weeks,” Sinha wrote. “He’ll be back real soon.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Bergen’s new paperback is “The Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.             ISIS and al Qaeda have largely receded from the headlines. It’s been three years since ISIS lost the last vestiges of the vast geographical “caliphate” that it had once lorded over in Iraq and Syria, while al Qaeda has found it hard to regroup after the death of its founder Osama bin Laden more than a decade ago.                    Yet ISIS is far from defeated in its heartland. The United Nations points to the continued presence of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, estimating their total strength to be between 6,000 and 10,000 fighters, according to a report published on Tuesday.             That strength was underlined by a dramatic prison break in January at a prison in Hasakah in northeastern Syria, where more than 3,000 ISIS fighters reportedly were held. ISIS fighters and US-allied Kurdish forces fought a 10-day battle at the prison, during which 100 to 300 ISIS fighters escaped, according to the UN report.                 As a result of this resilience, the US continues a campaign of special operations forces ground raids and airstrikes against ISIS leaders. In February, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, the group’s leader, died in a US ground operation, while earlier this month, a US airstrike killed another militant who was part of the group’s leadership, according to US Central Command.                  But these military operations will not achieve much in the long term if the thousands of ISIS fighters and tens of thousands of displaced women and children from multiple countries remain unrepatriated in lightly secured and unsafe prisons and camps in northeastern Syria, creating what could be a whole new generation of ISIS recruits.                  The solution is for the many countries that have their nationals in prisons and camps in northeastern Syria to take back their ISIS fighters for prosecution in cases where it’s merited. As for women and children living in the camps, they should be reintegrated back into their home societies and entered into deradicalization programs if that should prove necessary.                  Senior US government officials, speaking Wednesday at a conference at the Middle East Institute in Washington, stressed that ISIS is far from defeated. Joshua Geltzer, US deputy homeland security adviser, told me in a discussion at the institute that ISIS remains “a threat to countries where it continues to have a presence, which is about 30 countries worldwide. It is still a threat to the region, Iraq, Syria and neighbors. And it is still a threat to the United States and our allies and partners.”     As the West winds down its war on terror, jihadists are filling the vacuum, UN warns             Of particular concern are more than 10,000 ISIS fighters and around 60,000 mostly women and children who are being held by America’s Kurdish allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces, in prisons and camps in northeastern Syria. The United Nations estimates that 30,000 of those held in the camps are under the age of 12 and are “at risk of radicalization” by ISIS ideologues.                 Few countries will take back their nationals who are living in the squalid camps, fearing that they may be importing an ISIS problem. In the past three years, Iraq has taken back more than 600 fighters and nearly 2,500 “displaced Iraqi nationals,” according to Timothy Betts, the acting US special envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. This month, France took back 51 women and children, while 39 Americans have been returned to the United States, according to Betts.                   Yet that number is less than 5% of the mostly 60,000 women and children – the majority from Iraq and Syria – and the more than 10,000 ISIS fighters who are being held in northeastern Syria.                   At the current slow rate of repatriation, the ISIS fighters and tens of thousands of women and children might take decades to return to their home countries. By that time, even the youngest children in the camps could be adults in their 30s and will have spent almost their entire lives living in the filthy, disease-infested camps, which are ripe for ISIS indoctrination.                  A wild card causing considerable consternation among US national security officials is the saber rattling by Turkey in recent weeks that it plans to send its military into neighboring northeastern Syria to annex territory controlled by the US-allied Kurdish groups fighting ISIS and running the facilities where the ISIS fighters and the women and children are being held. Turkey considers those Kurdish groups to be terrorists.     Dana Stroul, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, warned last week, “The United States opposes any Turkish operation in northern Syria. Such an operation puts at risk US forces, the coalition’s campaign against ISIS, and will introduce more violence into Syria. It would effectively end a ceasefire that has been in place for years at a time when violence is at its lowest levels since the onset of the conflict.”     Trump and Biden were both foolish about Afghanistan. Now we're all paying the price             Also concerning is that the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan almost a year ago because of President Joe Biden’s foolhardy decision to pull out all US troops from the country has given both al Qaeda and ISIS greater room to maneuver there, according to Tuesday’s UN report. Biden’s move was bad policy, and the US pullout was terribly executed, allowing the Taliban to maintain their alliance with al Qaeda and to bar women from jobs and teenage girls from education.                  The UN report noted that Ayman al-Zawahiri, who replaced bin Laden as al Qaeda’s leader, is issuing “regular video messages that provided almost current proof of life” and “Zawahiri’s apparent increased comfort and ability to communicate has coincided with the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. …”                 In Afghanistan, both ISIS and al Qaeda have acquired “night vision equipment, thermal imagers, and steel-penetrating bullets,” according to the UN report.                 The United Nations assessed, however, that – for the moment – al Qaeda does not pose an “immediate international threat from its safe haven in Afghanistan … and does not currently wish to cause the Taliban international difficulty or embarrassment.”     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              That’s the good news. But the bad news, according to the UN, is that al Qaeda now has key allies within the Taliban’s de facto government in Afghanistan, which will doubtless give al Qaeda more resources to regroup.  Meanwhile, the local branch of ISIS in Afghanistan is now one of the “most vigorous” of ISIS’ regional networks globally, according to the UN.                 The global jihadist movement, whether in Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria, and whether part of ISIS or al Qaeda, is down but not out. And these groups will continue to take advantage of ungoverned or lightly governed spaces in the Muslim world, where they will remain a threat to the governments and populations of Muslim-majority countries – and to the West – for the foreseeable future.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Minister of Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi resigned on Wednesday, one day before his term was expected to come to an end. The Indian parliament has nearly 800 lawmakers in total.                 “My work in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of parliament) is over, but my political and social work will never be over,” Naqvi told local news channel NDTV Thursday, without providing details over why he will not be seeking reelection.                  Naqvi’s resignation comes at a volatile time for India’s Hindu and Muslim communities. Religious tensions have been flaring in recent weeks, following comments by the now suspended BJP spokesperson, Nupur Sharma, about the Prophet Mohammed widely condemned as Islamophobic.     Violent and deadly clashes have since broken out in parts of the country between Hindus and Muslims – who respectively make up about 80% and 14% of the country’s 1.3 billion population.                 Tensions reached a boiling point last week following the brutal killing of a Hindu tailor, allegedly by two Muslim men.                  With about 200 million Muslims in India, the country is home to the third-largest Muslim population in the world, following Indonesia and Pakistan.     Related articleIndian officials demolish several houses after protests over anti-Islam remarks             Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP swept to power in 2014 promising economic reform and development, but critics feared his rise could signal an ideological shift ​away from the nation’s secular ​political underpinnings to those of a Hindu-nationalist state.                 The BJP has its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu group that counts Modi among its members, and adheres to Hindutva ideology which seeks to define Indian culture in accordance with Hindu values.                 Since then, the ruling party has been repeatedly accused by rights groups, activists and opposition parties of stirring anti-Muslim sentiment.                 Over the last eight years, several BJP-run states have imposed new laws that critics say are rooted in Hindutva ideology. At the same time, reports of violence and hate-speech against Muslims have  made headlines across the country.                 Some of the most controversial new laws are in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, ruled by Hindu monk-turned-politician Yogi Adityanath. The state has introduced laws to protect cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus, from slaughter, and made it increasingly difficult to transport cattle. It has also introduced an anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                 Earlier this year, the BJP-ruled southern state of Karnataka banned Muslim girls from wearing ​religious headscarves in classrooms, prompting several to challenge the decision in the ​state’s top court – a battle they ultimately lost.                 Last month, India scrambled to contain the diplomatic fallout as at least 15 Muslim-majority countries condemned Sharma’s remarks about the Prophet Mohammed. The incident sparked uproar among India’s key Arab trading partners and calls from around the Gulf to boycott Indian goods.

Sign up here.             Oil has added trillions of dollars to Saudi Arabia’s coffers over the decades, but it’s a resource that will someday run out or lose value as the world turns to alternative energy.                   Despite current high oil prices, the kingdom knows this, and it has embarked on an ambitious project to diversify its sources of revenue for a post-oil future. One of those sources is the pilgrimage, an eternal monopoly that has a potential market of almost two billion Muslims.                  Soon after King Salman bin Abdulaziz took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a $21 billion project to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to diversify the Saudi economy by 2030.                  “Unlike [the energy sector], where Saudi Arabia always has to worry about future competitors, in the area of Hajj and Umrah, they are guaranteed to have zero competition in perpetuity,” said Omar Al-Ubaydli, director of research at the Bahrain-based Derasat think tank.                   Muslims from the world over return to Saudi Arabia this week to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage after a two-year hiatus caused by Covid-19 restrictions. It’s an opportunity for Muslims to fulfill a once-in-a-lifetime religious obligation, but also a chance for the economy of Saudi Arabia’s holy cities to get a jump start.                  The pandemic caused the number of Hajj pilgrims to dwindle to 1,000 in 2020, but it rose to about 60,000 in 2021, when the Hajj was opened only to residents of Saudi Arabia. This year, the kingdom authorized one million Muslims to perform the rites.      Middle East oil exporters are cashing in as Ukraine war hits global economy             Experts say that with crude oil prices hovering around $100 a barrel, generating billions of dollars a day, the pilgrimage’s economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term.                   “Religious tourism in Saudi Arabia may not have the current revenue-generating capacity of the oil and gas sector, but the religious significance of Mecca and Medina will never run dry,” said Robert Mogielnicki, a senior scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “It serves as a crucial foundation to build out the broader Saudi tourism sector and market it to local, regional, and international audiences.”                  The potential for expansion is significant, says Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics. Pilgrims could, for example, be incentivized to extend their trips in the country to visit other religious sites or engage in recreation, particularly during the year-round minor pilgrimage, the Umrah, where Hajj-related bottlenecks can be avoided, he said.                  According to Mastercard’s latest Global Destination Cities Index, Mecca attracted $20 billion in tourist dollars in 2018, second only to Dubai.                  Before the pandemic, pilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about $30 billion a year and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis by 2022. That was when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, according to official data cited by Reuters.                    The number of pilgrims has shrunk significantly during the pandemic but the government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030, which some analysts have said is an ambitious figure.                  The pilgrimage has been a drain on the government’s finances due to the cost of infrastructure, maintenance, and security, according to Hertog, but it has made big money for the private sector.                   Mecca’s skyline around the millennia-old pilgrimage site is crowded with swanky skyscrapers housing Western hotel chains overlooking the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure Muslims turn to in prayer five times a day. A night at the iconic Fairmont Makkah Clock Royal Tower, which overlooks the Kaaba, costs up to $4,000 for its most opulent suites for this year’s Hajj season.       5 alternative energy sources to speed our transition away from fossil fuels             But the government has been trying to get a slice of that cake. In two years, the state-owned Public Investment Fund plans to open the Rou’a Al Haram Al Makki project just under a mile from the Kaaba, with 70,000 new hotel rooms and 9,000 residential units. It is expected to contribute 8 billion riyals ($2.1 billion) to the Saudi economy.                   In a blow to private travel agencies abroad that organize pilgrimages for Muslims in the West, the Saudi government this year announced a new booking platform that obliges foreign pilgrims to register and pay for the process directly through the new government-run system called “Motawif.”                   The system is designed to streamline the application process, but it has put travel agencies abroad out of business. In the United Kingdom alone, the sector is worth approximately $240 million, and many Hajj operators there are now facing liquidation, according to the Independent newspaper.                   Saudi authorities did not respond to CNN’s request for a comment.                  The only threat to Saudi Arabia’s ambitions to capitalize on the pilgrimage “is decreasing religiosity across the world,” said Al-Ubaydli. “But as long as Muslims continue to want to visit these sites, they will represent massive economic opportunities to Saudi Arabia.”      CNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report  Iran is adding demands to nuclear talks, US says              Iran added “unrelated” demands to the discussion table during the last round of talks on its nuclear program, US Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley said on Tuesday in an interview with National Public Radio, adding that and it has made “alarming” progress in its uranium enrichment field that would allow it to make a nuclear weapon “in a matter of weeks.”      Ben & Jerry’s sues Unilever to block sale of Israeli business              Ben & Jerry’s is suing its parent company in an attempt to cancel the sale of its business in Israel to a local partner that would continue to distribute its products in the West Bank.

By Ben Morse              Algeria this week marked 60 years since its independence from France following a bloody war of independence whose wounds are yet to heal.                  France began its rule of Algeria in 1830. The city of Algiers was originally taken by the French as a military measure, but as more settlers began arriving with French protection, France’s boundaries continued to advance.                  In 1954, the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) was formed as a guerilla group to liberate the country from its colonizer. It started an uprising that took the next seven years, known as the Algerian War, which led to Tunisia and Morocco being granted independence by France in return for militarizing their borders with Algeria.                  On March 16, 1962, an agreement was signed in France promising Algeria independence pending a national referendum and on July 5, Algeria celebrated its independence from France.                  Following its independence, most of the one million Europeans returned to their countries. More than 100,000 Muslims were killed in the seven-year Algerian war. Algeria says that over 5.6 million were killed over 130 years of colonization. French President Emanuel Macron last year accused Algeria of “rewriting history,” prompting the North African nation to recall its ambassador in Paris. To this day, France has not apologized for its role in Algeria’s colonization. There will be “no repentance nor apologies,” Macron’s office said last year.

It is forbidden to have any kind of help or relationship with them,” the Taliban said in a  resolution on Saturday.                 The resolution follows a three-day conference of religious leaders and elders in Kabul, according to Afghanistan’s state-run news agency, Bakthar.                 ISIS-K (the k stands for Khorasan, the name of a historical region that covered parts of modern Afghanistan and Pakisan) has been operating in Afghanistan for the last few years.                 It is a branch of ISIS – the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria – according to the Wilson Center, a non-partisan policy forum.

The Taliban’s resolution said that Afghanistan follows an Islamic system of rule and that “armed opposition to this system is considered rebellion and corruption.”                 It added that “any kind of opposition to this Islamic ruling system, which is in conflict with Islamic Sharia and national interests, is corruption and illegal action.”                 The connection between ISIS-K and its apparent parent group Islamic State is not entirely clear; the affiliates share an ideology and tactics, but the depth of their relationship with regards to organization and command and control has never been entirely established.     Related articleAfter earthquake that killed 1,000, Afghanistan braces for cholera, disease outbreaks             US intelligence officials previously told CNN that the ISIS-K membership includes “a small number of veteran jihadists from Syria and other foreign terrorist fighters,” saying that the US had identified 10 to 15 of their top operatives in Afghanistan.                 Its earliest members included Pakistani militants who emerged in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province around a decade ago, many of whom had fled Pakistan and defected from other terror groups, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).                 Counter-terrorism analysts last year estimated its strength at around 1,500-2,000, but that number may have grown.                  The Kabul gathering of 3,000 attendees – all male, according to state media – concluded on Saturday with a call on the international community to recognize Afghanistan’s Taliban-led government as legitimate.                  The United States and other counties have been reluctant to recognize the Taliban following its swift takeover of the country in August 2021, just weeks after the withdrawal of US troops began.                  Since then, the Taliban has imposed new restrictions on women, prohibiting them from working in most sectors and requiring them to cover their faces in public and have a male guardian for long-distance travel. Girls have been barred from returning to secondary school.                  UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned on Friday that “women and girls in Afghanistan were experiencing the most significant and rapid roll-back in the enjoyment of their rights across the board in decades.” The World Bank has frozen projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars over the issue.     Related article Top Taliban leader makes more promises on women's rights but quips 'naughty women' should stay home             An 11-point resolution released at the end of the meeting called for the recognition and the unlocking of foreign aid, while pledging to “take valuable steps in the direction of realizing national interests and people’s welfare and preventing poverty and unemployment,” Bakthar reported.                  “We call the United Nations and other international organizations, especially Islamic countries and organizations, to recognize Islamic emirate as a legitimate system, interact positively with it, remove all sanctions from Afghanistan, free the frozen funds of the Afghan nation, and promote the economic development and reconstruction of our nation,” the resolution said, according to Bakhthar.                  In the resolution, the Taliban also pledged allegiance to Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada, the group’s reclusive supreme leader, whom it referred to as the “leader of the people.”                 In a rare speech at the gathering, Akhundzada praised the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan last year as “a source of pride for Afghans but also for Muslims all over the world.”                 “Thank God, we are now an independent country. (Foreigners) should not give us their orders, it is our system, and we have our own decisions,” Akhundzada added.                 Speaking to the clerics, Akhundzada reaffirmed his commitment to the implementation of Sharia law, Islam’s legal system derived from the Quran, while voicing his opposition to the “way of life of non-believers.”                 The Taliban’s harsh interpretation of Sharia law when it was last in power led to scores of violent punishments, including the stoning of alleged adulterers, public executions, and amputations.

Officials in the western city of Udaipur, Rajasthan state, announced a curfew and blocked internet access after videos of the incident went viral on social media, triggering mass outrage across the country.                  In one video, two men can be seen beginning to attack the victim. In another, two Muslim men appear to confess to the crime and claim to have “decapitated” the Hindu man. However, police in the state told CNN Wednesday the victim had deep cuts all over his body, including slashes on his neck, but that he had not been beheaded.                  India’s Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday said it had directed the National Investigation Agency – the country’s main anti-terrorism task force – to investigate the case.                   “The involvement of any organisation and international links will be thoroughly investigated,” it said on Twitter.                  The two suspects allegedly killed the victim, a tailor, after a post appeared on his social media account in favor of the now suspended national spokesperson for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Nupur Sharma, who made derogatory comments about Islam’s Prophet Mohammed, Rajasthan police official Hawa Singh Ghumaria told CNN Wednesday.                  The victim was arrested on June 12 for allegedly “inflaming religious sentiments” and had since been released on bail, Ghumaria said.                 The two suspects have been arrested and an investigation is underway, the state’s Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.                   Authorities in the state have responded by deploying more than 600 policemen to the area.                   “This incident is very shameful,” Ghumaria said during a news conference Tuesday, before urging the public not to watch the videos and appealing for calm.                  “There will be tension. There always is after such an incident, but it is all under control,” he said.     Related articleA Muslim teenager was killed at a protest in India.

Asaduddin Owaisi, a lawmaker and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen political party, condemned the killing and demanded the “strictest possible action” against the suspects.                   “There can be no justification for it,” he wrote on Twitter Tuesday. “Our party’s consistent stand is to oppose such violence. No one can take the law into their own hands.”                 Leader of the opposition Congress party Rahul Gandhi said he was “deeply shocked” by the incident.                  “Brutality in the name of religion cannot be tolerated,” he wrote on Twitter. “We have to come together to defeat hatred. I appeal to everyone to please maintain peace and brotherhood.”                  Hindu-Muslim tensions have remained a constant throughout India’s modern history, occasionally erupting into violence, but analysts and activists say relations have worsened since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP rose to power with a Hindu-nationalist agenda in 2014.                  Since then, the ruling party has been repeatedly accused by rights groups, activists and opposition parties of stirring anti-Muslim sentiment.

His arrest comes amid repeated accusations by critics that the BJP is using colonial-era laws to quash any form of criticism and encourage self-censorship.                 Zubair’s lawyer, Kawalpreet Kaur, said the journalist had been summoned for questioning in relation to a 2020 criminal investigation into his social media posts — from which he had previously been granted protection from arrest by the Delhi High Court. But when he responded to the summons, police arrested him over a separate case, she said.                 Kaur showed CNN a police complaint in which a Twitter user accused Zubair of insulting Hindus on the platform in 2018, in a post about the renaming of a hotel after a Hindu god.                 She accused the authorities of not following proper procedure and of giving Zubair no notice.

Here's what you need to know             Earlier this month, Zubair had criticized the now suspended national spokesperson for the BJP, Nupur Sharma, for making derogatory comments about Islam’s Prophet Mohammed — remarks that had set off a diplomatic row. At least 15 Muslim-majority nations condemned Sharma’s remarks, several of them summoning India’s ambassadors and describing the comments as “Islamophobic.”                  Among Zubair’s recent social media posts are videos he claims show Hindu extremists giving hate-speeches against Islam, a minority religion in India where nearly 80% of people are Hindu.                  Zubair’s arrest has outraged politicians, journalists and news organizations, who have demanded his release.                  The Editors Guild of India in a statement Tuesday said it was “apparent that Alt News’ alert vigilance was resented by those who use disinformation as a tool to polarise society and rake nationalist sentiments.”                  Shashi Tharoor, an MP from India’s opposition Congress party, said the arrest was an “assault on truth.”                  “India’s few fact-checking services, especially Alt News, perform a vital service in our post-truth political environment, rife with disinformation,” Tharoor wrote on Twitter Monday. “They debunk falsehoods whoever perpetrates them. To arrest (Zubair) is an assault on truth. He should be released immediately.”                  The Committee to Protect Journalists on Monday called on Indian authorities to “immediately and unconditionally release” Zubair, and “cease harassing him in retaliation for his work.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.             The Republican Party has a rape problem.                  The conservative moment scored a major victory on Friday when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, overturning Roe v. Wade – ending the era of federal protection for legal abortion in the United States and instituting one of the most significant rollbacks of civil rights in US history. But a number of Republican candidates and elected officials don’t seem content with simply stripping women of our right to control our own reproductive organs. They’re also taking aim at rape victims.                   While rape and incest exceptions were once standard in anti-abortion laws, along with exceptions for a pregnant woman’s health or life, they are increasingly a thing of the past (health exceptions, too, are becoming much narrower and less common). This comes despite recent polling showing that the vast majority of Americans – 85%, according to Monmouth – support exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman. As conservative states scramble to further criminalize abortion in the wake of Roe being overturned, many Republicans seem absolutely giddy with possibility, realizing that their control of a great many state legislatures gives them wide latitude to impose whatever restrictions they like.                  And that means forcing rape and incest victims to carry pregnancies to term.                   The rhetoric from Republicans from multiple states is astonishing in its outright cruelty.                 In Virginia, GOP congressional candidate Yesli Vega, who also cited her time as a police officer, gave credence to an absurd untruth – that a woman who is raped may have a lower chance of getting pregnant. Axios published audio recordings of her comments on Monday.                 According to those published recordings, Vega said, “The left will say, ‘What about in cases of rape or incest?’” and then claimed that, in her years in law enforcement, she only saw one rape case in which a woman became pregnant. (She did not seem to consider that she wouldn’t necessarily know about a pregnancy a rape victim terminated. Particularly given Vega’s open hostility to abortion rights – what victim would confide in her?).      Bash asks GOP governor why he signed bill that would force rape victims to carry babies to term             A woman at the event then asked a question premised on a bizarre and false theory: “I’ve actually heard that it’s harder for a woman to get pregnant if she’s been raped. Have you heard that?” To which Vega responded that she didn’t know, but “it wouldn’t surprise me. Because it’s not something that’s happening organically. You’re forcing it. The individual, the male, is doing it as quickly – it’s not like, you know – and so I can see why there is truth to that. It’s unfortunate.”                 It should surprise her, because the idea is so plainly misogynistic and unscientific that anyone who gives it any airtime at all is by definition unfit to serve in any elected office – or as a law enforcement officer.                  But Vega isn’t the only Republican whose views on rape are positively medieval.                   Last fall, Ohio US Senate candidate JD Vance called pregnancies from rape merely “inconvenient” and emphasized that in matters relating to pregnancy resulting from rape, “The question to me is really about the baby.” (Apparently the woman matters very little, if at all.) Earlier this year, Ohio Republican Rep. Jean Schmidt said that her state’s law criminalizing abortion gave child rape victims the “opportunity” to “help that life be a productive human being.”                 That is, if a child victim makes it that far. Pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading killer of girls aged 15-19 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. And adolescent motherhood means that girls are more likely to be in abusive relationships; that they wind up poorer; that they and their children are less likely to reach their educational potential; and that their children are less healthy and are more likely to die in infancy.      Opinion: The aftershocks of America's abortion earthquake will be felt for decades             We know this: Women who are forced to carry pregnancies to term are more likely to die than women who can get the safe, legal abortions they seek. Laws criminalizing abortion are a death sentence for women – especially in a country with the highest maternal mortality rates in the industrialized world, and where maternal mortality is highest in the states with the strictest anti-abortion laws.                  Republicans know this, too. They seem to have decided it doesn’t matter.                  On Saturday, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said that when it comes to her state’s abortion criminalization law that does not allow exceptions for rape survivors or children impregnated by a family member, “I just have never believed that having a tragedy or tragic situation happened to someone is a reason to have another tragedy occur.” And just this week, in a stunningly callous interview with CNN’s Pamela Brown, Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio applauded his state’s strict anti-abortion law, which outlaws abortion roughly six weeks after the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period with few exceptions and without any exemption for rape or incest.                   “What happens when a twelve-year-old girl falls pregnant after being raped?” Brown asked him. “Are you ok with her being forced to carry that fetus to term?”                 “You don’t know you were raped for two months?” Warren asked, as if women and girls seeking abortions after rape are either liars, idiots or irresponsible. “I think it’s a great law,” he said. “And it is a compromise.” The “compromise,” apparently, is that most rape and incest victims are forced to carry pregnancies to term. That, Warren reiterated, didn’t bother him. “It’s hard to conceive of somebody who doesn’t know they were raped for two months,” he said.      Opinion: Roe's reversal doesn't just hurt women -- it harms us all              It’s not hard for me to conceive of, because I’ve met a girl in the exact position Pamela Brown described. She was 12, raped by a family friend and forced to carry the pregnancy to term because she lives in Honduras, where abortion is illegal in nearly all cases (in the story I wrote about her, I gave her the pseudonym “Sofia”). When I met her, she was heavily pregnant and clutching a stuffed bunny – her primary confidante about a situation she didn’t quite understand. The thing about children is that they trust adults; and young children, like Sofia, don’t always know what sex is, or what rape is, or what pregnancy entails. When Sofia found out she was going to have a baby, she asked if she could have a doll instead.                   Rape is a trauma. Even adult women who, unlike little girls, probably understand what sex and pregnancy even are may not realize they’re pregnant right away because they’re still reeling from their bodies being so intimately violated – they may be dissociating or in denial or simply too overwhelmed to notice the signs of pregnancy. Many trauma survivors go to great lengths to avoid fearful memories that can trigger post-traumatic stress and send them spiraling – and this certainly means that a great many rape survivors, in order to keep surviving, shut down any thoughts at all that have to do with their sexual health or reproductive organs.                  The harm of rape is a physical invasion, but it’s also a crime of power and control – it tells a victim that her body is not hers, that it’s subject to the will of another (usually a man). Laws that criminalize abortion do the same – and while all laws criminalizing abortion are unconscionable, those without exceptions for rape and incest are utterly inhumane. Women and girls who are raped and refused abortions face the magnified trauma of having their most intimate and often most pleasurable body parts violated, followed by being told that they have no right to determine the outcome of that violation – that, for a second time, they have no right to say “no,” and that their bodies can be controlled against their will.      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              Forcing a girl or woman to give birth after she was forced into sex are fundamentally inseparable cruelties. And their increasing prevalence in laws that regulate or ban abortion reflect a Republican Party that has grown ever more radical and comfortable with blatant misogyny in the past decade. Back in 2012, when Missouri senate candidate Todd Akin made comments similar to Yesli Vega’s, it not only sunk his campaign, but was a moment so shocking and definitional that it headlined his obituary in news outlets when he passed away last year.                    But that was then. Now, the Republican Party has lined up behind a man who has bragged about sexual assault and said that “there has to be some form of punishment” women who have abortions. They have coalesced around the idea that a woman is not a full citizen, and that she has fewer rights over her own internal organs than an embryo or a dead person.                   The GOP has become the party of hostile misogyny. And Republicans’ mistreatment of rape victims is just the beginning.       © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Sign up here.             The brutal killing of a young woman in broad daylight on an Egyptian street has shocked the Arab world, bringing the country’s gender-based violence crisis into the spotlight.                  Naira Ashraf, 21, was fatally stabbed on Monday by a man whose advances she rejected, according to Egyptian prosecutors who said the suspect was arrested outside northern Egypt’s Mansoura University, where the incident took place and where Ashraf was studying.                  Video from a nearby CCTV camera showing a man attacking a woman outside the university went viral across the Arab world this week. A lawyer for Ashraf’s family confirmed to CNN that the video shows the incident in which Ashraf was killed.                   The Egyptian prosecution said that the suspect had been referred to the criminal court and will stand trial for premeditated murder. The first court hearing is scheduled for Sunday.  CNN could not reach the suspect or his family for comment, and it was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney.                   Women’s rights experts in Egypt say that the problem of gender-based violence is widespread in the country, and that a number of social and legal shortcomings continue to hamper proper action.                  “Definitely, Naira’s killing was not an isolated incident,” Lobna Darwish, gender and human rights officer at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), told CNN. “[But] we are [now] seeing more coverage of violence against women.”                  Data is lacking since such incidents are not properly documented by the state, Darwish said, but cases of abuse are seen in the news on an almost monthly basis. “We are seeing patterns that are alarming,” she added.                 The Arabic equivalent of the hashtag #Justice_for_Naira_Ashraf has been widely trending across Arab countries since the killing.                  “We need a law that fights violence,” said Azza Suliman, an Egyptian lawyer and chairwoman of the Center for Egyptian Women and Legal Assistance. There also needs to be a discourse around women that is respectful and dignifying in order to create trust between women and the state apparatus, she added.                  The slain woman’s father, Ashraf Abdelkader, told CNN that the suspect had asked to marry her several times but was rejected. The suspect had also allegedly created fake accounts to follow her on social media, he added. Eventually Abdelkader filed for a restraining order in April.                  “She did not want to get married, she wanted to follow her career … and wanted to be a flight attendant,” Abdelkader said.                   Darwish said that the victim and her family exhausted all measures to protect Ashraf, “and yet again, the whole system – whether social or legal, failed.”                  Suliman said that for women to feel comfortable reporting such incidents, there is a need to “rehabilitate the channels for justice, which include the police, judges, and the prosecution.”                  Some responded to the killing by laying the blame on the victim. A controversial former TV host, Mabrouk Atteya, said in a video on social media that women “should cover up” to stop men from killing them.                  “Women and girls should cover up and dress loosely to stop the temptation… if you feel like your life is precious, leave the house completely covered up to stop those wanting you from slaughtering you,” Atteya said in a live stream.                  Atteya’s comments sparked outrage on social media and spurred a social media campaign calling for his arrest.                     Darwish noted that while Egypt is moving forward with tougher sexual harassment laws, enforcement is still lacking among both police and society, which in turn discourages many women from seeking legal assistance.                  Egypt’s State Information Services did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Egypt’s National Council for Women could not be reached.                  Harassment is illegal in Egypt, and in June of last year, the state tightened sexual harassment laws, raising fines and extending prison sentences, according to state media.                  The United Nations Development Program in 2019 ranked Egypt 108 out of 162 countries measured on gender inequalities in health, empowerment and economic activity.                   Last year, nine women were prosecuted on charges of violating family values after they posted videos in which they danced and sang and invited millions of followers to make money on social media platforms, Reuters reported.                  “When the state supports this kind of discourse in any way by criminalizing women for the way they dress or how they present themselves, it gives a green light for these people,” Darwish said, referring to men who put the onus of modesty and morality on women.                   “This happens a lot,” said Darwish, referring to violence against women. “Just not on camera.”      CNN’s Celine Alkhaldi contributed to this report.   Iran-backed parties strengthened after Sadrists exit Iraq parliament              Iraq’s parliament swore in dozens of new lawmakers on Thursday to replace a bloc loyal to the powerful Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, strengthening the power of rival Iran-backed politicians in the assembly.      Top EU official travels to Tehran to discuss Iran nuclear deal              The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell was set to visit Iran on Friday and Saturday to discuss reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, according to a tweet on his official account.

The tags will serve as shortcuts to phone numbers. They consist of a hashtag followed by one to five digits. The country’s main telecom company e& (formerly known as Etisalat) has begun auctioning some of the most sought-after numbers.                  In a country that’s obsessed with distinguished numbers, some tags are fetching bids in the millions of dirhams.                  Some of the tags that are up for grabs include #10, #1234, #11, and #55555.                   While final bids have not been announced, bidding for the #10 tag reached 1.5 million dirhams ($408,000) while #15 hit 800,000 dirhams, according to Khaleej Times, a local paper.                  “#TAG is not only a unique short phone number, but also an innovative marketing and communication tool,” said Omar Matar Al Manna, the Executive Director of Emirates Auction, which is arranging the sale. “Creating a VIP number that is personal to the business sets them apart and draws new customers with ease,” he told state-run WAM news agency.                  The country has seen bids for phone numbers and car plates run into millions of dirhams in the past. In April, the Abu Dhabi license plate number “2” was sold at auction for a whopping $6.3 million, while a traditional phone number last year was sold for over $800,000.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/india/muslim-teenager-shot-islam-protest-police-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,A Muslim teenager was killed at a protest in India. His family wants answers,A 15-year-old student was killed during a violent protest in India. His family wants to know who fired the lethal shot.,"Jun 23, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Hannah Ritchie,International,"“They’re firing bullets, they’re firing bullets!” a voice yells on video over the sound of gunfire during clashes between police and Muslim protesters in the eastern Indian city of Ranchi.                 Footage posted to social media of the June 10 protest shows 15-year-old Mudassir Alam raising his fist in the air as the crowd chants, “Long live Islam.”                 More shots ring out, and Mudassir falls to the ground.                 “He’s dead!” a bystander shouts, as people try to stop blood flowing from a wound to the teenager’s head.                 Mudassir died later in hospital, one of two young men killed in the Ranchi clash – the latest victims of a deepening religious divide between India’s majority Hindu population and the minority Muslim community.                 The June 10 protest was one of several demonstrations that erupted around the country after two former spokespeople for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made derogatory comments about Islam’s Prophet Mohammed.                 Mudassir’s grieving father, Parvez Alam, doesn’t know who killed his teenage son, but in a police complaint he accused officers of “indiscriminately firing using AK-47s and pistols targeting the Muslim mob.”                 He claimed at least three other men were firing bullets at protesters from the rooftop of the Hindu Shree Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near where Mudassir was standing in the street.                 “Due to the firing from the temple roof and by the police, there was a chaotic situation and one bullet hit my son in his head,” Alam said in his complaint.                 Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Chhavi Ranjan confirmed that Mudassir and another man, Sahil Ansari, were later pronounced dead  at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Science from “bullet injuries” sustained during the protest.                  Ansari’s father, Mohammad Afzal, told CNN his 20-year-old son was returning home from his job selling cellphones in the market when “police opened fire.”                 Ranjan said “police opened fire because the mob was violent and initial firing happened from the mob,” but he would not comment on which mob he was referring to, saying the matter was under investigation.                 Amol Homkar, Inspector General of Jharkhand Police, said a two-member committee had been formed to investigate the incident, and a Special Investigation Team from the Ranchi Police are also making inquiries. Homkar said 12 people were injured during the protest, and 30 have been arrested in the days since, though he didn’t specify any charges.                 CNN has examined footage from the protest, which at times shows police firing indiscriminately at the demonstrators, none of whom – including Mudassir – appear to be carrying firearms.                  The boy’s father says he wants answers.                 “I lost my only child to this violence,” Alam said. “He was just 15, not even an adult.”                 Father and son were working at the family’s fruit stall on Mahatma Gandhi Main Road, a main thoroughfare through Ranchi, when protesters gathered after Friday prayers, Alam told CNN.                 “I was removing my fruit kiosk to avoid damage due to protests,” he said. “Mudassir was helping me.”                 Alam described his son as a “very polite boy” who, like many teenagers his age, loved making TikTok videos and taking photos on his cellphone.                 In a report to Ranchi police, filed two days after his son’s death, Alam said he saw a “mob” from the “Muslim community” moving north along the main road, and when they reached Shree Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, Mudassir joined them.                 Alam claimed the men standing on the temple rooftop started throwing rocks at the protesters and fired shots into the crowd.                  Video from inside Shree Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, verified by CNN, shows several people sheltering on the ground floor, including police officers.                 Over the sound of projectiles hitting the building, a woman’s panicked voice says, “Everyone is throwing stones at the temple. The administration is trying to stop it … but they can’t.” Through the temple’s security screens, protesters can be seen throwing rocks.                 Another video shows crowds outside, hurling stones towards the temple before gunfire rings out. It’s not clear who’s firing the shots, but the crowd is seen carrying away an unidentified man whose white clothes appear stained with blood.                 Towards the end of the video, police with guns are seen walking towards the Muslim protesters, who have retreated from their position outside the temple.                 Under India’s Code of Criminal Procedure, police officers can use “force” to disperse what they deem to be an unlawful assembly.                  Irfan Ansari, a Muslim legislator from India’s Congress party, which is part of the ruling coalition in the state, questioned why the police fired bullets at the crowd and said that he would demand the Chief Minister order a judicial inquiry.                 “The Ranchi incident has put the state to shame,” Ansari wrote on Twitter. “It is the job of the police to protect, not to shoot.”                 Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP party came to power in 2014, Muslims say they’ve been unfairly treated by a government committed to policies favoring Hindus.                 India’s Muslim population of 220 million is vastly outnumbered in a country of 1.4 billion people, and while India claims to be a secular country, many Muslims say they’re living in fear.                 The recent comments by former BJP representatives about the Prophet Mohammed did not only anger Muslims in India. At least 15 Muslim-majority nations condemned the remarks, and some demanded a diplomatic response from Indian ambassadors.                 India’s Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar told a town hall held by CNN affiliate News-18 on Saturday that the comments didn’t reflect the BJP’s views.                 “What was said was not the position of the party. The party made it very clear and took action,” Jaishankar said.                 “Some countries had concerns on it. They deal with us, we are their image of India. Countries who had concerns do appreciate that this was not the government’s position,” he added.                 But high-level diplomacy has failed to ease anger on Indian streets, where the comments sparked protests in several major cities. In some places, Muslims say they have been targeted for speaking out.                  Activists in the northern BJP-ruled state of Uttar Pradesh, ruled by the Hindu priest-turned-politician Yogi Adityanath, accused authorities of punishing Muslims allegedly involved in the protests by destroying their houses.                 Authorities defended their actions by saying they were targeting homes built illegally on public land whose owners had ignored repeated demolition notices.                 But victims told CNN only Muslim homes had been destroyed, and that no warning was given before their properties were reduced to rubble.                 In a statement last week, Amnesty accused the Indian government of “selectively and viciously cracking down on Muslims who dare to speak up and peacefully express their dissent against the discrimination faced by them.”     Related articleArundhati Roy: 'The damage to Indian democracy is not reversible'             Aakar Patel, Chair of the Amnesty International India Board, told CNN that authorities were “violating Indian law and Indian obligations to various treaties that the country has signed.”                 “What India is doing is without the justice process running through it, (it) is targeting Muslims, targeting their homes, shooting them even – all on the pretext of trying to make sure that there is no violence on the street,” he said.                 CNN has contacted Adityanath’s office but did not receive a response. In a tweet on June 11, his media adviser shared a photograph on Twitter of a yellow bulldozer demolishing a property, writing: “Remember, every Friday is followed by a Saturday.”                  At the family’s modest home in Ranchi last Wednesday, women surrounded Mudassir’s grief-stricken mother, Nikhat Parveen, wiping tears from her eyes as she wailed.                 Parveen told CNN Mudassir had phoned her after he finished helping his father to say he was coming home. “He put his phone down, and then he died,” Parveen said.                 She said her son was waiting for his high school exam results, and on Tuesday, they found out he was awarded straight A’s for five of his six Year 10 subjects.                  “He used to tell me: ‘I’m going to get a government job. I’m going to go far in life,’” Parveen said.                 “He was incredibly intelligent … he was loved by all. He’s not here today, and everyone has tears in their eyes.”                   His father, Alam, said police have so far frustrated his efforts to file an FIR – a First Information Report – which is required to start an official investigation.                 “We have been trying to take legal action, but the authorities are not cooperating,” he said. “We filed a complaint with the police, but they did not register (it).”                 Homkar declined to comment on the claim, and Alam’s other allegations,pending the outcome of the investigation.                 Alam said his son’s death has robbed his family of their future.                  “I am (a) poor laborer, me and my son (now dead) would sell fruits and vegetables. He was the only son and future of my family,” he wrote in his police complaint.                 Mudassir’s mother asked why any shots needed to be fired on a busy street where children, like her son, were present.                 “Does anyone have the right to do that? Do the police or whoever else have the right to fire shots like this?”                 When asked what she wanted from police, she said with resolve: “I want justice for my son.”       CNN’s Arpit Goel and Teele Rebane contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

View more opinion at CNN.             When two spokespeople from India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made derogatory comments about the Prophet Mohammed last month, it prompted an international firestorm.              The incident led to protests among India’s Muslim minority in several states. Some Muslim-majority nations summoned their India ambassadors. India’s foreign ministry said the comments did not reflect the views of the government, and the officials involved – one of whom later withdrew her remarks – faced disciplinary action.                  But for India’s 200 million Muslims, these comments were not an isolated incident.                  Rather, they were the culmination of the BJP’s “engineering hatred of a common enemy,” says bestselling Indian author Arundhati Roy.      Indian officials demolish several houses after protests over anti-Islam remarks             “India’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there. We’re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously,” she told CNN.                  “Many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison, most of them charged under a dreaded law called the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, all of them for speaking up for minorities, Dalits and forest-dwellers facing displacement and state terror.                 “Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means. What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking?” writes Roy.                  In this email interview with CNN Opinion, Roy says Indian politics has something in common with the US Capitol riots, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stoking hatred, and talks about who the real power in India lies with.      CNN: What does this incident involving BJP officials’ comments about the Prophet Mohammed reveal about Indian politics today?  Roy: It reveals how successfully the clear and present existential threat posed by Hindu nationalism in India has been masked by the face it presents to the outside world. You know the people in strange clothes, the man in furs and antlers who stormed the US Capitol? We’re being ruled by their equivalent here. The difference is that they are not a collection of random lunatics. They are members of the most powerful organization in India – the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), whose founding ideologues openly admired Hitler and likened the Muslims of India to the Jews of Germany. RSS is the real power in India.     CNN: What is the connection between the BJP and RSS?  Roy: The ruling party, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), considered to be one of the richest political parties in the world, is only the front office of the RSS. Founded in 1925, the RSS, traditionally controlled by a handful of Brahmins, now has millions of members including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been a member since his teenage years, and most of his cabinet ministers.                  It has its own vast militia, its own schools, labor unions and women’s organizations. It’s not a political party, it’s something of a shape-shifter, a master of double-speak, its sources of funding are amorphous and leave no legal trail, it works through an array of affiliates, but it’s a nation within a nation.                 The RSS believes that India should be declared a Hindu nation, just as Pakistan, Iran and several countries in the Persian Gulf are Islamic nations, just as Israel is legally the “nation-state of the Jewish people.”             In fact, the RSS believes in what it calls “Akhand Bharat,” a sort of fantasy that is futuristic and ancient all at once – a future Ancient India which includes Pakistan and Bangladesh which will be conquered and subject to Hindu rule. To flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, socialand subnational identities, more diverse than all of Europe, into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process. It means setting aside the constitution and undoing the very idea of India.                  First in the line of fire is the Muslim community. Close behind are Christians – a tiny minority that is also being brutalized. Last year alone there were more than 400 attacks on Christians. Churches have been vandalized, priests and nuns beaten up, their congregations threatened and humiliated.                  In the last two national elections, in 2014 and 2019, the BJP has shown that it can win a solid majority in the national parliament without the votes of India’s 200-million-strong Muslim community. That has effectively resulted in a sort of disenfranchisement and political isolation of Muslims, which is extremely dangerous.      Opinion: In the world's largest democracy, 'looking Muslim' could cost your life             There is also a new anti-Muslim citizenship law, a sort of refugee-manufacturing policy in which those who cannot produce a mandated set of “legacy papers,” which few people have, can find themselves deprived of citizenship. Nearly 2 million people in the state of Assam have already been struck off the National Register of Citizens. Massive detention centers for those who have been stripped of citizenship are being constructed all over the country.                 But isolating Muslims is not enough. Creating an artificial majority out of a very diverse Hindu community that consists of thousands of castes and ethnicities is equally important if the BJP is to remain in power. The cement for that is engineering hatred of a common enemy. This requires an incremental ratcheting up of bigotry.                  Apart from the mass killings and lynching of Muslims by Hindu vigilantes in recent years, we have the steady drumbeat of hatred and outlandish disinformation beamed into peoples’ homes by approximately 400 TV channels and countless newspapers. On social media handles viewed by millions of people there are open calls for the genocide of Muslims – and videos demonstrating how it should be done.                  We regularly see provocative demonstrations by thousands of sword-wielding Hindu men marching through areas in which Muslims live. The deeply disrespectful comments about Prophet Mohammed made by a BJP spokeswoman on national TV this May was a part of this constituency-building exercise. As was the unconscionable bulldozing by municipal authorities of the homes of Muslims who dared to come out in protest.              To flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, social, and subnational identities… into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process             Arundhati Roy                 Some of the protestors publicly called for beheadings and hanging and asking for a blasphemy law which the BJP would probably be more than happy to pass and use to silence its critics in swifter and more deadly ways. These individuals helped to confirm every deeply held prejudice about Muslims that the Hindu Right works so hard to perpetuate.                  As a concession to international outrage, the BJP has suspended its spokeswoman, Nupur Sharma, but she has been openly embraced by its cadre. The polarization has worked in the BJP’s favor.      CNN: And what does Prime Minister Narendra Modi have to do with it? Roy: Modi has made no comment whatsoever about the spokeswoman or the protests. A standard tactic of his. In situations like this, his followers, correctly I believe, read his silence as support. Although he increasingly positions himself as a messiah, he is an RSS man, and he knows that the organization is grooming other leaders who are waiting in the wings. But for now, he is the uncontested figurehead.                  Modi made his political debut in October 2001. He was appointed, not elected, chief minister of the state of Gujarat. It was just weeks after the 9/11 attacks in the United States. The world was convulsed by Islamophobia. It was the perfect political climate for the RSS.                  A few months later, in February 2002, following an act of arson in which a railway carriage carrying Hindu pilgrims was burnt, there was a brutal pogrom against Muslims in the villages and towns of Gujarat. It lasted for weeks. While the police watched, more than a thousand people were slaughtered in broad daylight, women were gang-raped and burnt alive, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes. Subsequently the murderers were caught on camera boasting of their deeds. Many spoke of how they were inspired and protected by Modi.                 Modi was unapologetic and came to be known as “Hindu Hriday Samrat” – the Emperor of Hindu Hearts. Soon after the 2002 massacre, he called for state elections and won with a massive majority. He has never looked back since – he was elected Chief Minister of Gujarat for three terms and in 2014 was elected prime minister. And we in India have begun to look at massacres and hatefulness against Muslims as an integral part of election campaigns. During Modi’s tenure as Gujarat Chief Minster, Hitler made it into a school textbook published by the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks as an inspirational leader.   CNN: Over the years, Modi’s popularity and his brand of politics has not waned. Why is that? Roy: For the same reasons that studies of the algorithms of Facebook and Twitter show that hatefulness gets far more traction than decency. Miserable people, oppressed people, unemployed people, people living in crushing poverty are voting themselves into further hellishness, their sunken eyes fixed on the object of their hate.                  After Modi’s shocking display of callous incompetence during the pandemic – the sudden lockdown in the first wave that led to millions of stranded workers many of who had to walk thousands of miles home to their villages, the millions of deaths in the second wave – some still shake their heads in sorrowful awe and say, “Without Modi, it would have been worse.”                  They’ve swallowed the story they’ve been fed about themselves, about their own lives. Meanwhile Modi has zero accountability. He has never addressed a single press conference in all his years as prime minister. All we get are staged performances and photo ops.      CNN: What has contributed to this situation where the Modi government feels immune from any international reaction or action?    Roy: I don’t think it is immune at all. On the contrary, our globe-trotting, head-of-state-hugging prime minister cares deeply about international opinion. None of us have ever seen him hug a fellow Indian. The optics of his foreign trips are carefully curated. His millions of followers refer to him as “Vishwa-Guru,” the Guru of the Whole World.      'We have been living in terror': Muslims in New Delhi say they are being targeted             Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson have all indulged him. International action and reaction is only a game of pragmatism and expediency. It has to do with trade and geopolitics, race, religion and ethnicity, and very little with values and morality.                  If India is buying a fleet of fighter planes from, say, France, it knows that lynching and a little mass murder will, at most, get a delicate finger-wag. A big market is excellent insurance against moral censure.                  Right now, foreign relations are a little tricky for India because of the Ukraine war and India’s proximity to Russia. So, India’s crimes in Kashmir and this very violent form of Hindu nationalism is coming under a little scrutiny. But these are all just bargaining chips in the Great Game. Sorry to sound so cynical, but I am.      CNN: How should India’s international Muslim trading partners respond? (And the world, for that matter?) Roy: Most of the countries that you refer to as India’s “Muslim trading partners” have long ago given up any pretense of democracy or diversity. They are already at the destination that Modi and the BJP are trying to drag India toward. The destination that we dread to arrive at, the theocratic state.                  India’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there. We’re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously. Failing because our elected leaders are blinded by hate – and crippled by a severe lack of intelligence, which is the more dangerous thing. The consequences will be unimaginable.                  As for what the rest of the world can do, all one can hope for is that people pay attention and form an informed opinion. And realize that their profits from this immense “market” will dry up if the market ceases to exist. The Indian economy is in a lot of trouble. Wealthy people, businesses big and small, have begun to flee. They are good and accurate weather vanes.        CNN: Is India truly the world’s largest democracy?  Roy: A democracy doesn’t just mean having regular elections. You cannot be a democracy when 200 million people who constitute a religious minority are expected to live without rights. When you can lynch them, kill them, incarcerate them, economically and socially boycott them, bulldoze their homes with complete immunity and threaten to strip them of citizenship. When the murderers and lynchers can aspire to move swiftly up the political ladder.      CNN: The damage done to Indian democracy – is it reversible?  Roy: The systematic indoctrination of people on the scale on which it has taken place over decades is hard to reverse. Every institution that is supposed to make up the system of checks and balances has been hollowed out, repurposed and deployed against people as a weapon of Hindu nationalism. In terms of political opposition, there are political parties that have successfully opposed the BJP at the state level in Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, but opposition is virtually non-existent at the national level.                  The whole system of elections has been gamed. You can win a huge majority of seats even without anything close to a majority of actual votes. In India, we have a first-past-the-post, multi-party democracy. This means that even if you get say only 20% of the vote in a constituency, as long as its higher than your closest rival, you win. A rich party can put up spurious candidates to split the votes. But that’s just one trick in a whole bag of tricks.                  And, anyway, how do you woo an indoctrinated population? By proving that you are a better, prouder Hindu? Nobody can beat the BJP at that game. And right now, that’s the only game in town. As far as mainstream politics goes.                  So, no, I don’t believe the damage is reversible. I believe we will be broken and then reborn. Change will only come when and if at all an accepting, gullible, fatalistic people realize what’s being done to them. And then it will come suddenly, and from the street. Not from the system. Until then… God help us.      CNN: What changes have you personally experienced that echo the changes taking place in India at large?   Roy: To begin with, many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison. Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means.                  What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? What does it mean to be considered a ‘success’ when the world is failing and everything you care about is being decimated? What is the moral way to be? The moral thing to do?                  I am one of those unfortunate people who saw this coming decades ago. I said so. I wrote so. At the time that made me something of a crazy outlier – one of those people who sets off a fire alarm right when the party’s going really well and everyone’s happy. In some ways it un-homed (not un-housed) me in all sorts of ways, literally and metaphorically – which is not a bad thing for a writer, actually.              What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking?             Arundhati Roy                  The idea of patriotism has been fused with the idea of Hindu nationalism, so people like myself are on the A-list of “anti-nationals.” Of course it helps their cause that I am not Hindu. My mother who raised me is Christian. My estranged father who I never really knew came from a Hindu family and converted to Christianity as did his father and his father’s father. But this doesn’t enrage them as much as the things I write and say. Particularly about Kashmir. A Bollywood actor and BJP member of parliament suggested that I be tied to an army jeep and used as a human shield by the Indian Army in Kashmir. They really should try that.                  Sadly, the BJP’s macro-radicalization has resulted in micro-versions of the same thing. It is mirrored by its allies, its doorkeepers, concierges and maintenance staff, as well as its victims. As everybody turns inward, bitter and doctrinaire, as every form of solidarity crumbles, as the garbage mountains grow and the rivers shrink, as stock characters locked into their own little ideological bubbles shout at each other on TV, I feel my own skin tightening around me, containing me, too. I struggle against that every day. The only home one has is in literature and poetry. That sentence that makes you gasp – or smile out loud. The song that breaks your heart.      CNN: What kind of India would you like to see – and how do we get there?  Roy: My dreams are not, and never have been, limited by the shape of the map of India, or any country. They’ve always been either much smaller or much bigger. The dream worth dreaming is to see our world moving toward a shared understanding of justice, however slowly, instead of racing away from it at the pace we are.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

Nupur Sharma, a spokesperson for the party, had made derogatory remarks regarding the Prophet Mohammed during a panel discussion on a news channel and her comments were allegedly followed by anti-Islam comments by another party leader on Twitter.     Related articleTwo killed in Sikh temple attack in Afghanistan's capital Kabul              Seven gunmen had tried to storm the temple in the early hours of Saturday morning and all were killed after a standoff that lasted several hours, according to Kabul police.                 ISIS-K said in its Telegram post that its suicide bomber Abu Muhammad al-Tajik had gained entry to the temple by throwing a hand grenade at the security guard officer at the entrance, killing him.                 “Armed with a rifle, pistol and hand grenades, he proceeded to shoot,” the worshippers inside the temple, ISIS-K said.                 A temple official said 30 people were inside the temple at the time.                 ISIS-K also claimed its members had clashed with Taliban government fighters trying to reach the temple, targeting them with a car bomb and four other explosive devices.                 It said the clashes between ISIS-K and the Taliban fighters had lasted three hours and that the suicide bomber al-Tajik had died in these exchanges.                  “The IEA [Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan] strongly condemns the targeting of the Hindu shrine in Kabul by the enemies of the Afghan people. The IEA expresses its condolences to the families of the victims and assures that serious measures will be taken to identify and punish the perpetrators of this crime,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, tweeted referring to the Sikh temple.     Related articleIndia is facing a firestorm over ruling party officials' comments about Islam.

Last year, ISIS claimed another attack against the Sikh community that killed more than two dozen people at another temple in Kabul.                  Saturday’s attack comes amid growing outrage in the Muslim world towards India for the comments by the BJP members and New Delhi is struggling to contain the diplomatic fallout from Muslim-majority nations like the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Oman and Iraq.                  The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemned the most recent attack, calling on Twitter for the “protection of all minorities in Afghanistan, including Sikhs, Hazaras and Sufis.”                 The European Union Ambassador to Afghanistan also condemned the attack, saying “religious (and ethnic) pluralism needs to be protected with full force.”                 India’s Foreign Ministry said it was “deeply concerned at the reports emanating from Kabul about an attack on a sacred Gurdwara in that city.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

White supremacy has long been bound up with rigid views about gender, masculinity and sexuality.                 Take a long-since-forgotten Ku Klux Klan raid on a gay nightclub in what’s today Miami-Dade County. In November 1937, nearly 200 members of the Klan, wearing spectral robes, publicly burned a cross during an induction ceremony.                 Then they descended on La Paloma nightclub, where they assaulted patrons in an attempt to close a joint that the Klan saw as an affront to tradition.                 Julio Capó Jr., an associate professor of history at Florida International University, analyzes how the raid and transnational forces shaped the city’s history in his 2017 book, “Welcome to Fairyland: Queer Miami Before 1940.”                 Capó has written before that the Klan claimed that its actions during the raid and elsewhere “represented its commitment to saving White homes, families, women and traditions.”                 To further explore the White supremacist dynamics that were on display last weekend in Idaho, we spoke with Capó, whose research focuses on how gender and sexuality have historically intersected with ethnicity, race, class and other aspects of identity.                 Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.     Why would White supremacists target a Pride event? Isn’t their bigotry focused elsewhere?             Homophobia is often rooted and embedded in anti-Blackness, in forms of White supremacy, including in building a particular vision of what the nation should look like or what they (White supremacists) imagine the nation should look like. Homophobia, whether it looks like an attack on a gay club or different forms of policy, is very much about White supremacy. Homophobia and White supremacy are often parts of the same structure.     The names of White supremacist groups change over time. But their core ambitions stay the same: They want to maintain a rigid social order. Could you give an example of a historical parallel that might put into context what happened last weekend?             As advances are made in, for example, LGBTQ rights, there’s a kind of fear among White supremacist groups that they’re losing their power. This story is now decades if not centuries old.                 When I was writing my book, I uncovered a raid on a gay bar on the outskirts of Miami called La Paloma. It was raided in November 1937, but not by police. It was raided by nearly 200 members of the Ku Klux Klan.                 A lot of people wanted Miami to be this town where they could live what they imagined to be a moral life (or) or live in what they wanted to be a model city. The city relied heavily on its tourist industry and on things like queer culture and queer entertainment, which provided forms of tourist dollars and pesos from the Caribbean and Latin America during this time.                 There was a debate about what Miami should look like, and the Klan wrote to the city commission basically saying, “Hey, there’s all this stuff going on, and if law enforcement looks the other way, we’ll take this into our own hands,” and they did. They raided the club.                 We could even take this more recently to Charlottesville, where some of the chants that you heard were “f**s, go home.” So, this isn’t a new story.     Among some White supremacist groups, there’s talk about declining birth rates and shifting demographics. Are there any links between these ideas and White supremacists’ perceptions of LGBTQ communities?             So much of this is at the root of anti-Blackness and anti-LGBTQ sentiments. Whether it was the integration of Black children into schools that had historically been White or something else, people have always talked about being concerned about children. The modeling and the language of “save the children” often gets employed by a lot of these groups – that no doubt happened in the 1970s with the Anita Bryant campaign. Much of this is tied to child protectionist language and to a very particular idea of what morality looks like or doesn’t look like and the dangers of being exposed to LGBTQ history or people. And the same with Black history. It’s such an interconnected history.     What do you think is important for people to take away from an attempted White supremacist riot near a Pride parade? It seems hard to separate this conspiracy to riot from many Republican leaders’ insistence on demonizing LGBTQ Americans.             We are very much in a particular political climate and in a very difficult time for a number of reasons. We’re seeing these tensions boil over, and not in new ways but perhaps in different ways. Anita Bryant won that battle in the ’70s, but she didn’t win that war.                 I think that it’s really important to find moments of hope. With the Idaho Pride event, someone reported it. Someone voiced their concern. In 1937, La Paloma reopened within just a few weeks, even though the Klan tried to shut it down.                 When people still host Pride events, when people still stand up for one another – these are forms of resistance and resilience, and should be understood as such.     The FBI is investigating what happened in Idaho, and a number of cities with upcoming Pride celebrations are giving their security measures a second look. They’re working to prevent violence in the short term. But what do you think needs to be done to find a long-term solution?             One of the things that has to happen is that we really have to understand these issues –  anti-Blackness, homophobia, misogyny, classism – as interconnected and in this way combat them. There’s no one quick solution. Rather, there’s a structural one that we need to work toward.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

In Indian Kashmir, police arrested a youth for posting a video threatening to behead the ruling party’s former spokeswoman who had made some of the remarks, officials said. The video, circulated on YouTube, has been withdrawn by authorities.                 Muslims have taken to the streets across India in recent weeks to protest against the anti-Islamic comments by two members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).                 Clashes have broken out between Muslims and Hindus and in some cases between protesters and police in several areas. Police in Uttar Pradesh arrested more than 300 people in connection with the unrest.                 Some in India’s minority Muslim community see the comments as the latest instance of pressure and humiliation under BJP rule on issues ranging from freedom of worship to the wearing of hijab head scarves.                 The BJP has suspended its spokeswoman Nupur Sharma and expelled another leader, Naveen Kumar Jindal, for the comments, which have also caused a diplomatic row with several Muslim countries.     Related articleIndia is facing a firestorm over ruling party officials' comments about Islam. Here's what you need to know             Police have filed cases against the two and the government has said the comments do not reflect its views.                 Muslim groups have demanded their arrest, while some hardline Hindu groups label them as brave and nationalist politicians.                 Over the weekend the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, Yogi Adityanath, ordered officials to demolish any illegal establishments and homes of people accused of involvement in riots there last week, the BJP’s state spokesperson said.                 The house of an alleged mastermind of the riots, whose daughter is a female Muslim rights activist, was demolished amid a heavy police presence on Sunday. Properties of two more people accused of throwing stones after Friday prayers were also demolished in the state.                 Mrityunjay Kumar, Adityanath’s media adviser, tweeted a photo of a bulldozer demolishing a building and said, “Unruly elements remember, every Friday is followed by a Saturday.”                 Opposition leaders said Adityanath’s government was pursuing an unconstitutional method to silence protesters.                 On Sunday, Jindal said his family faced continuous threats and some of his followers said a crude bomb was defused near his residence in capital New Delhi.                 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far not commented on the communal unrest.                 In the eastern state of West Bengal, authorities enforced an emergency law prohibiting public gatherings in the industrial district of Howrah until June 16.                 BJP’s West Bengal president on Sunday staged a sit-in protest and accused neighboring Bangladesh, a mainly Muslim nation, of inciting violence in the state.                 On Friday, two teenagers were killed in clashes between Hindus and Muslims in eastern India, police said on Saturday. Police opened fire to break up the violence in the city of Ranchi in Jharkhand state but it was not clear if the two victims were killed by the police or by rioters.                 Senior police official Surendra Kumar Jha said at least 14 police officials were injured in the incident in Ranchi and other areas. A curfew was imposed and Internet services suspended to stop the unrest escalating.                 Last week countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Iran – which are key trade partners of India – lodged diplomatic protests to demand an apology from Modi’s government for the comments.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Here’s what you need to know,India is trying to contain the diplomatic fallout as outrage grows in the Muslim world following derogatory comments made by ruling party officials about the Prophet Mohammed.,"Jun 11, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Helen Regan,International,"India is trying to contain the diplomatic fallout as outrage grows in the Muslim world following derogatory comments made by ruling party officials about the Prophet Mohammed.                 The United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Oman, and Iraq are amongat least 15Muslim-majority nations to have condemned the remarks, which were described as “Islamophobic,” with several countries summoning India’s ambassadors.                  The incident sparked protests in neighboring Pakistan and prompted calls from around the region to boycott Indian goods.                 India’s Hindu nationalist ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) disciplined the two officials involved, but the firestorm involving India’s major Arab trade partners is yet to die down.                  Here’s what you need to know.                 At the center of the controversy is Nupur Sharma, now suspended national spokesperson for the BJP – the party of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.                  On May 26, Sharma made comments during a televised debate on an Indian news channel about the Prophet Mohammed that were widely deemed offensive and Islamophobic.      Related articleWhy India is in damage-control mode with Arab nations               Most Indian news outlets have not directly quoted Sharma’s original comments.                 Sharma later withdrew her remarks and said it was never her intention to “hurt anyone’s religious feelings.” On Twitter, Sharma said her words were a response to derogatory comments made during the debate about a Hindu god.                 “If my words have caused discomfort or hurt religious feelings of anyone whatsoever, I hereby unconditionally withdraw my statement,” she said.                 Another BJP spokesperson, Naveen Jindal, who has since been expelled, had also made comments about the Prophet on social media.                  The BJP said on June 5 it had suspended Sharma and expelled Jindal from the party.                  “The Bharatiya Janata Party is also strongly against any ideology which insults or demeans any sect or religion. The BJP does not promote such people or philosophy,” the party said in a statement on June 5 without directly referring to the comments from Sharma or Jindal.                  Police in the Indian capital Delhi have also registered cases against Sharma and several others accused of disrupting public tranquility and incitement, according to a tweet from the Delhi police’s official Twitter account.                  A complaint was also earlier filed in Mumbai against Sharma for her inflammatory comments.                 On June 8, Indian police said they had arrested a former BJP local youth leader in the northern city of Kanpur for posting inflammatory content on social media about Prophet Mohammed.                 The incident has led to protests among the country’s Muslim minority in several states. In Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur on Friday, at least 54 people were arrested in connection with the protests, senior Kanpur police official Pramod Kumar told CNN.                 The BJP’s move to suspend its spokesperson failed to stop the controversy escalating beyond India’s borders.                  Qatar, Kuwait and Iran summoned India’s ambassadors, and the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation issued statements of condemnation. Malaysia was the latest country to condemn the remarks. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the High Commissioner of India to Malaysia on Tuesday to convey their “total repudiation over this incident.”                 Protesters in the Pakistani city of Lahore called on Indian Prime Minister Modi to issue an apology. And some stores in Kuwait have removed Indian products from their shelves following similar calls for a boycott.      Related articleIndia's ruling party suspends official over comments about Islam             The hashtag “Anyone but the Prophet, oh Modi” has been trending on Twitter in all six Gulf countries, and as far away as Algeria. Oman’s outspoken Grand Mufti Sheikh Ahmad Al-Khalili, the chief religious figure in the country, called Sharma’s comments “a war on all Muslims” and a matter that “calls for all Muslims to rise as one nation.”                 Modi has not publicly commented on the incident but Indian embassies in Gulf nations have made statements saying the comments “do not, in any manner, reflect the views of the government of India” and the government “accords the highest respect to all religions.”                 CNN has reached out to India’s Home Affairs Ministry for comment.                  Depictions of Islam’s Prophet are considered blasphemous by many Muslims and offending images or comments have in the past led to mass boycotts, diplomatic crises, riots and even terror attacks.             On June 8, the terrorist network al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) issued a statement condemning the remarks from the BJP officials and called for revenge, warning they will “find refuge neither in their homes nor in their fortified army cantonments.”                 But Mohammed Sinan Siyech, a non-resident fellow at Observer Research Foundation, a global think tank based in Delhi, said that such threats are more of a recruitment strategy than a solid plan.                  “In some ways this is them trying to publicize their views rather than taking action,” Siyech said.                  AQIS had not recruited many people since forming in the subcontinent in 2014 so might not have the capacity to carry out such an attack, he said.                  In 2015, Islamist militants attacked the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which had printed cartoons of the Prophet, and a Jewish supermarket in Paris, killing 17 people.                 For many of India’s 200 million Muslims, Sharma’s comments were not an isolated incident.                  They came amid a broader trend in India, which has cracked down on its minority Muslim population ever since Modi’s BJP came to power nearly eight years ago.                 Analysts say there has been a rise in support for extremist Hindu nationalist groups and suspected hate crimes against Muslims since 2014.                  In January, a senior member of the right-wing Hindu Mahasabha political party called on her supporters to kill Muslims and “protect” the country. It triggered an outcry made worse by the subsequent lack of arrests.                 In February, the southern state of Karnataka banned headscarves in classrooms, sparking protests in the state and major cities including the capital New Delhi. The demonstrations prompted rival protests from right-wing Hindus who chanted a religious slogan in support of the BJP.     Related articleOpinion: In the world's largest democracy, 'looking Muslim' could cost your life             In 2018, India’s current Home Minister Amit Shah said Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers from Bangladesh were “termites” and promised to rid the nation of them. And between 2015 and 2018, vigilante groups killed dozens of people – many of whom were Muslims – for allegedly consuming or killing cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus, according to Human Rights Watch.                 In 2019, India’s Parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims. It led to extended protests and international condemnation.                 And in December 2020, Uttar Pradesh enacted a controversial anti-conversion law, making it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                 All of this, analysts say, is evidence that Modi and his BJP party have pushed an agenda of Hindu nationalism onto secular India, a country of 1.3 billion people.                 Analysts said Modi has walked a tightrope between keeping his Muslim international allies happy while pushing his party’s Hindu nationalist agenda at home.                 “Modi has tried very hard to prevent his party’s domestic political agenda from spilling over and poisoning India’s relations with the Gulf states,” said Hasan Alhasan, a Bahrain-based fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who researches Indian foreign policy in the Gulf.                  “The extent to which Sharma’s comments have clouded India’s relations with the Gulf states is unprecedented, and that’s of course because she is, or was, the spokesperson of the BJP.”                 India has much to lose if it can’t keep a lid on the controversy. It comes as Gulf states and India look to enhance their economic partnership.                  India, the world’s third-biggest importer of oil, looks to the Middle East for 65% of its crude. The South Asian nation also sends to the Gulf states millions of workers who send home billions of dollars in remittances each year. And the UAE has singled out India among seven other nations as its future economic partner.                 The Gulf states are key sources of India’s oil and gas imports, with bilateral trade worth more than $100 billion, according to Alhasan.

India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday suspended a spokesperson and expelled another official after derogatory comments they made about Islam’s prophet led to an outcry in Arab countries.                   “India was taken aback by the response,” said Kabir Taneja, a fellow with the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “Communal issues are not new in India and in previous cases, we have not had such a response [from Arab states].”                   On May 26, BJP spokeswoman Nupur Sharma made comments on an Indian news channel about Prophet Mohammad that were deemed offensive and Islamophobic.

India, the world’s third-biggest importer of oil, looks to the Middle East for 65% of its crude imports. On the other hand, the Asian nation sends millions of workers to the Gulf states who send home billions of dollars in remittances.                    “There are over 8 million non-resident Indians across the Gulf. The Gulf states are key sources of India’s oil and gas imports, and bilateral trade is over $100 billion,” said Alhasan. “So it is a very important set of relationships from the Indian perspective.”                   The UAE alone, where some 3.5 million Indians live, accounts for 33% of remittances to India, at more than $20 billion a year.                   The UAE has singled out India among seven other nations as its future economic partner.

The UAE pact aims to see annual trade rise to $100 billion in five years and contribute to the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs in India.                  Abdulaziz Sager, chairman and founder of the Gulf Research Center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, said that nature of India-Saudi relations gives Riyadh political and economic leverage over the Indian government.                     “I don’t think that will have a jeopardizing effect in terms of the economic or political relations because India is still an important country,” said Sager. “It is an important relationship but Saudi Arabia is not going to accept any sort of insult to the Prophet or undermining of religious Islamic issues,” said Sager.                     There are more than 2.2 million Indians in Saudi Arabia, according to Indian officials.                   Taneja said India knows the clout Gulf states have over it because of the diaspora in those countries. “That is why we saw such a brisk response from the government.”       CNN’s Esha Mitra contributed to this report.

Briton sentenced to 15 years in prison in Iraq for artifact smuggling               A retired British geologist was sentenced to 15 years in prison by an Iraqi court on Monday for attempting to smuggle ancient artifacts out of the country.                   Extreme drought has wreaked havoc in Iraq, causing sandstorms that have sent thousands of people to the hospital. But for some archaeologists it has been a temporary blessing.                  As water levels in the Mosul reservoir dropped late last year, an ancient city emerged, and scientists rushed to study it before it disappeared underwater again.                  A team of German and Iraqi-Kurdish archeologists was in a race against time after the 3400-year-old city under the Tigris River in Iraq’s Kurdistan region was uncovered this year.                   As the water levels began to rise again, scientists rushed to excavate and document what is believed to be the urban center of the Mittani Empire, which stretched from northern Iraq through Syria and into Turkey.                   The researchers, who announced their findings last week, were able to map a massive fortification of walls, storage facilities and an industrial complex. The team was stunned at how well preserved the city walls were, made from sun-dried mud bricks.                   “This good preservation is due to the fact that the city was destroyed in an earthquake around 1350 BC, during which the collapsing upper parts of the walls buried the buildings,” the researchers said in a statement.                  To prepare for the city’s looming reflooding, excavated buildings were covered with plastic sheeting and gravel fill. The city is once again underwater, waiting to be rediscovered.

When, as journalists, we prepare for a job, we think carefully about our questions, locations and equipment. But for one of us, documentary photographer Roshan Abbas, there is an added consideration – how much of his true identity to reveal.                  Abbas, co-author of this article, is a Muslim man in India. A country where, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch, Muslims are being vilified and evicted from their homes, their freedom of religious expression stifled.             It’s oppression Abbas has experienced firsthand, choosing not to wear a kurta – a loose, collarless shirt – that might point to his identity as a Muslim, when traveling the country for work.

Just one example of the targeted persecution of Muslims is a controversial citizenship law granting Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants, introduced by the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019.                 Prime Minister Modi has previously suggested that people protesting against the law can be “identified by their clothes” – a clear reference to Muslim protesters. Little wonder then, that Indian Muslims feel they have had to change how they dress, eat and speak in public.                 Tensions between Indian Hindus and Muslims have been flashpoints for decades, even before the British left in 1947 and the country gained independence. But since Modi’s government came to power in 2014, crimes against the Muslim minority have steadily increased.              Until recently, members of the BJP hadn’t outwardly acknowledged their goal of making India a Hindu nation. Othering Muslims, the country’s second largest religion, has proven to be an effective strategy in the BJP’s majoritarian politics.                 Now, India’s roughly 200 million Muslims – just over 14% of the population – are defending their right to live.                 Last month, local authorities and bulldozers razed shops and homes in Jahangirpuri – a low-income, predominantly Muslim neighbourhood in Delhi. The demolition followed communal clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the area. It mirrored the manner in which authorities responded to similar outbreaks of violence in other parts of the country – with bulldozers.     His house was demolished because he is Muslim, he says             What we are seeing in India is more than the systemic oppression of Muslims and other minorities. Prior to 2014, Muslims already accounted for only 14% of the population, but almost 20% of inmates in India’s jails.             But with authorities having abandoned their fundamental duty to safeguard the constitutional rights of minorities, India’s Muslim population is being rendered insignificant by the day.                 What’s more, open calls for violence against Muslims have become increasingly frequent. Following the southern state of Karnataka’s controversial ban on headscarves in classrooms earlier this year, a member of a Hindu nationalist youth group called for those who wore hijabs to be “cut… into pieces.”             And in December last year, a Hindu leader at an event in the northern state of Uttarakhand called for “Hindus to take up weapons” to ensure a “Muslim didn’t become the prime minister in 2029.”                 Yet world leaders seem unbothered by the state of affairs on the ground in India. There are no sanctions or wide condemnations of the Modi government. What little international media coverage there is of the situation – in our experience as journalists – been pushed aside to cover the war in Ukraine. And while that news needs due coverage, so does this.                 There have been some international breakout moments. On his recent visit to Gujarat, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited a JCB plant and posed for photos on a bulldozer – the same brand of bulldozers used to demolish Muslim-owned shops and homes.                  This caused outrage both in India and the UK, with members of the opposition in the UK even going so far as to question whether Johnson’s trip to India “helped legitmize the actions of Modi’s far-right government.”                  It is perhaps unsurprising that Modi has yet to condemn the recent spurts of communal violence across the country. Despite India being the world’s largest democracy, and constitutionally secular, the BJP has repeatedly stoked the flames of communalism, othering Muslims, branding them dangerous and violent.             In recent years, several BJP-governed states passed a “love jihad” (or “anti-conversion”) law. The law aims to prevent women from converting when they marry outside their faith, particularly, as the nickname suggests, keeping Hindu women from marrying Muslim men. It’s been likened to the 1935 Nuremberg laws banning marriages between Jews and those of “pure” German blood in Nazi Germany.                 This year, we find ourselves inching further toward a propaganda nation-state. A controversial film about a fictional university student who finds out Islamist militants murdered his Kashmiri Hindu parents was openly praised by Modi.                 The film enjoyed a “tax free” status in several states to make it more accessible to a wider audience. However, this too was accompanied by anti-Muslim sloganeering and its screening in “mixed population areas” of Delhi was accompanied by increased police presence.                 Islamophobia has permeated every aspect of Indian society. Our cities are being renamed to erase traces of Muslim history, while Muslims in metropolitan areas face ghettoization on account of structural biases.                 And while beef and meat bans intimidate economically deprived marginalized groups including Muslims, the gross double standards of beef exports from India continue. (Cows, for those unfamiliar, are sometimes considered sacred in Hinduism.)                 Indian Muslims are forced to navigate social spaces with an eye of caution, amid a so-called “anti-terror” law to arrest and incarcerate for years without trial. For many activists and journalists jailed under the law, their only fault is their Muslim identity. But any unjust incarceration does more than silence the brave; it instills a sense of fear in the young minds of the Muslim community.

India on the Brink, a genocide prevention summit, also declared that the country was on the brink of genocide.                  How Abbas dresses for work is just the tip of the iceberg; Muslim women continue to face the brunt of Hindu nationalism. What’s happening to India’s Muslim population is a humanitarian issue we should all be paying attention to.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

In many tweets, Barnette also spread the false conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim.                  In one speech uploaded to YouTube in 2015, Barnette forcefully argued it was OK to discriminate against Muslims and compared rejecting Islam to “… rejecting Hitler’s or Stalin’s worldviews.” In comments on her radio show, she said accepting homosexuality would lead to the accepting of incest and pedophilia. One post she wrote called a transgender person “deformed” and “demonic.”                  Barnette surged in recent polls in the upcoming Pennsylvania Republican US Senate primary, putting her in a dead heat between Donald Trump-endorsed former TV star Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund manager David McCormick. The Pennsylvania Senate seat is one of the one of the best pickup opportunities for Democrats this November, and Barnette’s sudden, rapid rise is causing worry among Trump allies.                  Barnette has had a quick and unpredicted rise in the polls ahead of next Tuesday’s primary. She is best known as an Army Reserves veteran and conservative political commentator who regularly appeared on Fox, and previously she was the host of a Christian radio show called “Truth Exchange,” which also had a website where she sometimes blogged. She previously ran for Congress in 2020 in Pennsylvania’s 4th Congressional District but lost to Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean.                   Barnette’s campaign did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.                 In posts, and comments on her radio show, Barnette frequently condemned being gay and transgender.                  “Two men sleeping together, two men holding hands, two men caressing, that is not normal,” she said on her radio show in July 2015, when a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for same-sex marriage.                  On the same show, Barnette argued accepting same-sex marriage would lead to a “slippery slope” of accepting incest and pedophilia, in an episode that was deleted from her SoundCloud page after CNN’s KFile reached out to the Barnette campaign for comment.                   “If love is the litmus test, who are we to say, well, your love is legitimate love, same-sex couples, but your love, father and daughter, is not legitimate. Or your love, one man and three women, is not legitimate, or one older man and a 12-year-old child. If love is the litmus test, it becomes a very slippery slope. And that is where we, we find ourselves today.”      In one 2015 post, Barnette attacked the transgender former reality star and Olympic champion Caitlyn Jenner as “deformed” and “demonic,” while attacking what she called a “barrage to normalize sexual perversion.” In comments in the same post, Barnette warned of a “take-over” occurring by the “Homosexual agenda.”                   On another show from the same time, Barnette hosted “two ex-gays” to show “the real story behind all those happy ‘gay’ photos we see, & God’s Redemptive story in both of their lives.” One conversation featured the president of “Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays & Gays (PFOX).” In one post from 2010, Barnette wrote the “homosexual AGENDA” seeks “domination.” In a post in 2013, Barnette said America couldn’t coexist with the “Homosexual agenda.”                  “The aggressive homosexual agenda is coming soon to a kitchen table near you,” she wrote.                  In tweets and posts, Barnette frequently targeted Islam and Muslims. In one post, on her website, Barnette shared an obviously doctored image of a Muslim man holding up a sign in front of the rubble of the World Trade Center that said, “Vote Democrat! We need your help to kill you.”      Speaking in December 2015, in a speech posted online, Barnette argued it was acceptable to discriminate against Muslims and Islam, comparing it to rejecting the worldviews of Stalin and Hitler, leaders who systematically discriminated against and ordered the killing of millions of people – including Jews, people with disabilities, Slavs and gay men.                  “You are not a racist if you reject Islam, or if you reject Muslims, because they are not a race of people. They are a particular view. They are people that have a particular view of the world, and we have a right to discriminate against worldviews,” she said. “We discriminated against Hitler’s Nazi Germany view of the world, right? That was a worldview. That’s how he saw the world around him. And we discriminated against it. We rejected it. We rejected Stalin’s view … of the world, right? Because that’s a particular view of the world that we don’t agree with.”                  “We have the right to discriminate against worldviews because all views are not morally equal,” she added. “All views are not equal. So we have the right to reject it. And let me just say offhand, I reject how Muslims see the world.”      She tweeted in 2015, “There is nothing rational about Islam.” In another she wrote, “Pedophilia is a Cornerstone of Islam.”                  In 2019, Barnette attacked Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for comments she made about Trump, tweeting she was a “MUSLIM” in all capital letters.                   “Aren’t you all so glad you voted in the first ‘openly’ Palestinian Muslim? (Sarcasm for ya’ll who don’t get sarcasm),” wrote Barnette.              Barnette also frequently shared the conspiracy theory that Obama, who is a Christian, was Muslim. One tweet derided Obama as a “Muslim or from another country.”                   On her radio show and in speeches, Barnette frequently called Obama by his full name, Barack Hussein Obama, apparently to imply he was Muslim.                  “We have a president in office right now, Barack Hussein Obama,” she said in 2015 in a speech. “I try to mention his name as much as possible. Thinking that at some point a light bulb is going to go off in someone’s head.”                  “Don’t we get it? Obama is a Muslim!” read one tweet in January 2016.                  “Obama is a Muslim. Doing Muslim like THINGS!” read one 2016 tweet. One 2015 tweet called him “Muslim Obama.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/us/eid-al-fitr-ramadan-muslim-american-milestones/index.html,These young Muslim Americans hit significant turning points in their lives this Ramadan. Here’s how they observed the holy month,"Six months after Mussab Ali started his first year of Harvard Law School, he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and underwent chemotherapy during Ramadan.","May 1, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Aya Elamroussi,International,"Six months after Mussab Ali started hisfirst year of Harvard Law School, he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and underwent chemotherapy during Ramadan.                 Ali was 23 at the time and had just become the youngest school board president to lead Jersey City public schools in New Jersey – a feat he strove toward for years – just as the district was navigating the coronavirus pandemicin winter 2021.                 Suddenly, the virus was not only a health issue discussed during intense board meetings on how to safely reopen schools.                  As a Hodgkin’s lymphoma cancer patient, Ali’s life depended on not catching the virus that had already killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. He also felt pressured to meet his obligations as a law student and a school board official – all while battling cancer.                  “The struggle aspect of it was this impossible balancing act,” Ali told CNN. “I think back, having gone through that and coming out the other side, it’s kind of ridiculous.”                  At the time, Ali was living with his family in their Jersey City home while undergoing chemotherapy and attending law school virtually. His mother quit her job as a teacher in New York to avoid catching the virus, and his father and siblings went to great lengths in their months-long quarantine.                  “It was very lonely. I didn’t have a sense of community. I didn’t get to feel this very special month where you get to see people and celebrate every night,” Ali recalled.                 Due to his treatment, Ali couldn’t fast during Ramadan, which is one of the most communal times of the year for millions of Muslims around the world.      Related articleRamadan Fast Facts             Ramadan serves as a spiritual resetting for Muslims who use the holy month to become closer to God through increased prayer, Quran reading, giving to charity and the general practice of good deeds.                  The annual ritual is marked by abstaining from food, drink and sexual activity from a little before the sun rises until the sun sets in a practice of self-discipline and patience. The general goal is to nurture those habits and maintain them beyond Ramadan, which ends Sunday at sundown this year.                 Muslims usually gather with family and friends for iftar, the meal after sunset that breaks the daylong fast – a tradition Ali described as “Thanksgiving every night for 30 days.”                 But last year, Ali didn’t experience any of that.                  “I just remember struggle,” Ali said.                 Ali, now 25, said he’s filled with gratitude to experience his first Ramadan this year as a cancer survivor after praying to reach the milestone.                 “For some people, especially for non-Muslim people, that might be a weird thing to have been asking for – asking to have the ability to not eat all day,” Ali said. “But that’s something that I really wanted.”                  For millions of Muslims, this Ramadan marks a particularly special milestone. It’s the first time many have been able to safely celebrate together since the pandemic began. It’s also the first time many are observing the holy month after undergoing significant changes in their own lives.                 CNN spoke with Muslim Americans who reflected on how this year’s Ramadan marks a turning point for them. Here’s what they had to say.                  Amanda Rushlow’s soul-searching journey began with an existential question: “I remember asking God, ‘What do I need to do to get into heaven?’”                 The question came during a plant medicine ceremony in Peru last year at a time in her life when she was on a search for spirituality and trying to get closer to God.                 The answer was an epiphany that led her to read the Bible extensively and explore Christianity, but she noticed what she described as “dissonance” in the faith between what was often preached versus what the Bible taught.                 Then she started having conversations about faith with a Muslim friend. To her surprise at the time, their beliefs had overwhelming similarities.                  “I remember so much would be aligning,” Rushlow told CNN. And she asked herself, “How is this true? … One of us has to be wrong, and I was very convinced that I was the one who was right.”                  Within the US, there are about 3.45 million Muslims, according to 2017 estimates by the Pew Research Center.                  And while the population has been steadily growing, more than half of Americans say they don’t personally know someone who is Muslim, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center report. Another survey showed that 52% of Americans said they either know “not much” or “nothing at all” about Islam.                 Rushlow took her friend’s advice to research Prophet Mohammed, whom Muslims believe is the messenger of the faith, but with the goal to find fault with the beliefs. And after going down the Internet rabbit hole where she sifted through articles and videos – it was time to go to the source: the Quran, Islam’s holy book.                 She listened to it on a trip from her home in Michigan to Arizona.                 “I just couldn’t stop listening. I had headphones on the whole time I was hiking. Headphones on the entire flight there and back,” Rushlow told CNN.                  And then it hit her: “This is my God,” she said. “I was overwhelmed.”     Related articleA Ramadan etiquette guide for non-Muslims             As she reflects on her first Ramadan as a Muslim, she was filled with heartwarming emotions, especially during her first visit to a mosque during night prayers. She has also found community in the Detroit area with other women who converted to the faith.                 “My heart felt so raw and open,” she said.                 Rushlow has spent the month reading the Quran, journaling and building the habit to pray the five daily obligatory prayers.                  “It felt like such a gift receiving Islam. It’s an honor … I will not eat happily out of obedience and out of submission,” she said. “It warms my heart so much to be able to participate.”                  For the past five years, Sharmin Hossain has been missing out on the Ramadan spirit.                  The 29-year-old was in a relationship and lived in New York City with a partner who didn’t observe the holy month. She also didn’t tend to her other spiritual practices.                 “I just did not have anybody to break fast with,” she said. “I remember how alone I was.”                 For Hossain, this Ramadan has marked a new phase in her life. She’s single for the first time in five years, and she’s using the time to go to Friday prayers more, “which is a big deal for me,” Hossain said, adding that she goes offline for two hours to attend the weekly sermon and prayer.                  She’s also marking the holy month in a new city after moving to Philadelphia a few months ago.                 “The first few days were actually surprisingly some of the most beautiful days because all my friends would break fast with me every day,” Hossain said.                   One of her close friends who isn’t Muslim has also been working out and breaking fast with her.                  “The communal part of it is something I didn’t know was really missing from my experiences and why previous Ramadans were so much harder just getting through the day,” she said.                   This year, Philadelphia’s slower pace has also allowed for more community gatherings.                 “It just feels very close and tender,” she told CNN. “This was definitely a more special Ramadan being single and being able to intentionally fast differently and go out to prayers by myself.”                 As a queer Muslim, she said she’s often on the receiving end of people’s surprised reactions when they learn she practices the faith.                 After her divorced parents learned of her queer identity about five years ago, she became estranged from her mother. But her father has been accepting and supportive of who she is.                 “When I’m in a mosque, I’m not thinking, ‘Oh, I’m a queer Muslim. May Allah forgive me and accept my prayers,’” she said. “I go into the mosque knowing that I’m a divine creature of the most Divine, and Allah knows that I worship Him and Him only, and I’m here to do that and not a sinner because I exist as a queer Muslim.”                 Living alone for the first time brings its own set of challenges, and with Ramadan coming at a time when Mohsin Mirza was taking on a new job thousands of miles from family and friends, it added to the emotionally and mentally challenging experience.                  “I definitely miss the community environment. There are people whose faces you don’t see except for a few months of the year, and this is one of those months,” said Mirza, 28, who recently moved to Washington, DC, from California’s Bay Area.                 “There’s more homesickness now than there would be in another month,” he noted. “So there’s a certain detachment.”                  Mirza belongs to the Shia sect of Islam, which comprises of about 10-13% of the world’s Muslim population, according to a 2011 Pew Research Center report. Most Muslims follow the Sunni sect of the faith.                  Ramadan is one of those times when Mirza feels a heightened sense of being a minority within a minority in the US because there are slight differences in how people in both sects choose to practice. Shia Muslims break their fast a little later than Sunni Muslims and commemorate certain days during the holy month in specific ways.                  While Mirza said he feels Ramadan brings the entire Muslim community together, he felt the distinctions more this year when he went to iftar events and was surrounded with Sunnis who rushed to break their fast before him.                  “It makes you feel a little different and puts you on the spot,” he said. “There’s always a hint of awkwardness. … It can be the source of some discomfort.”                 At another event, times to break the fast were announced for both Shias and Sunnis.                 “It’s a kind of small example of respect and inclusion that helps those of us who are a minority within the broader Muslim community feel like institutions that have been set up for the Muslim community are for us as well,” he said.                 Mirza also described experiencing some difficulty accessing a mosque for Shia Muslims in the DC area without a car. He has attended prayer at his local mosque, but he prefers to visit a Shia mosque when possible.                 Overall, Mirza said the experience has affirmed his view that the Muslim community worldwide is more similar than different.                  “In so many spaces, our communities are integrated and working together,” he said. “When those differences come up, they’re an opportunity to have discussions about why, and that can lead to mutual respect and understanding.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.             Out of the world’s nearly 2 billion Muslims, only about 4 million are Americans. So it’s not surprising that many of us often assume we have little relevance to the immediate concerns, let alone future prospects, of the ummah, the global Muslim community. But at a time when Muslims everywhere are searching for new visions, American Islam has something special to offer.                  That’s not to say we’ve done everything right, or even achieved the right outcomes for the right reasons, but we’ve preserved something essential from Islam’s past without which there can be no promising or prosperous Islam in the years to come. To explain why, consider Eid al-Fitr, the big holiday that marks the end of Ramadan.                  It’s soon… ish. I only say that because my Eid and yours may not fall on the same day.                  For peculiarly American reasons, many American Muslims might celebrate the same Eid on a different date. Even between kith and kin: My immediate family lives in Ohio. But some of my extended family, like my dad, live in Maryland. (Same time zone, mind you.) Of course, I plan to call the Maryland Moghuls and wish them an Eid Mubarak. I just don’t know when their Eid will be.                   To the average American, this might sound strange. Before you call your parents to wish them a Merry Christmas, you don’t have to confirm that you’re all celebrating Christmas on the same day. But on a consistent basis, many American Muslims have no idea, up to and including the day beforehand, exactly when they’ll be celebrating their holiest holidays.                     That’s because we track our religious calendar by the moon. But we don’t agree on how to track the moon. Some Muslims (let’s say Team A) contend it’s entirely sufficient to astronomically calculate lunar phases in advance, meaning that they’ll know how to organize their sacred obligations years ahead.                  Others (let’s say Team B) believe astronomical calculation isn’t sufficient. They hold that someone qualified must actually see the first crescent moon as well (of course, it has to be an astronomically viable sighting by someone who won’t mix up the moon for Mars). This is a live dispute. Sometimes a minefield. For while I’m with Team B, our local mosque is Team A.                   Meanwhile, my father’s mosque sides with Team B, although he himself believes that the calendar should be anchored to Mecca, no matter where you are (Team C?). For many Muslims, especially outside America, this debate is an anachronism at best. A centralized body, often government-run or backed, decides such things for everyone.                   As a recent Pew analysis finds, “Islam is the most common government-endorsed faith,” which holds in places as diverse as Southeast Asia and West Africa. Even where there is no state religion, many Muslim-majority countries, from Turkey to Indonesia, feature centralized clerical bodies or offer some degree of state protection to designated faiths.                   Of course, calendrically speaking at least, there’s a benefit to that level of coordination. After all, what’s the logic in not knowing when your most important religious occasions are set to commence? Unless you consider this minor hindrance a condensed symbol, a small thing that stands in for a much bigger truth, a challenge that is more so an opportunity. As I do.                  Because America (mercifully) has no single Muslim directorate, neighboring mosques, even from the same denominations, might celebrate Eid (or, for that matter, start Ramadan) on different days.      A Ramadan etiquette guide for non-Muslims             It’s as if some churches did Christmas on December 24 and others in the exact same town went with December 25. Further, though, it’s as if several didn’t know which day it’d be until December 23. And then the next year it was 11 days (give or take a day) before one of those days. (The lunar year being shorter than the solar year, Ramadan reverses through the seasons on a 33-year rhythm.) The next time Ramadan will overlap with all of April, as it did this year, is roundabout 2055.                   I hope that even then, in 2055, we’ll still be disagreeing.                   Of course, when I was growing up, plenty of Muslims used to get quite irked by such disunion (even though we seem fine with the idea that when we start and stop fasting each day differs by geography). Often these frustrated Muslims didn’t like the idea that all of us couldn’t concur. Sometimes they considered our divergence damning evidence of a broader deficiency, with worrisome consequences for Muslim cooperation on more urgent matters.                   The more I reflect on it, though, the more I suspect it’s the other way around. Because we have too little experience embracing disagreement, we don’t cooperate and collaborate all that effectively. Maybe an additional reason the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, modeled variations in his prayer, his recitation of the Qur’an, and in a number of other areas wasn’t just to create flexibility in those specific things.                  But perhaps it was also to empower his followers to live Islam in his absence, as one day they would have to – a Prophet, yes, but also still a mortal man. The lunar debate reveals what Islam was meant to be and, I pray, what Islam could be again. Orbiting this simple, significant truth: Because Muhammad is the last Prophet, there’s no revelation after him.       France is on a dangerous collision course with its Muslim population             Upholding that is one of two conditions of becoming and staying Muslim. (The first is unitarian monotheism.) After the Prophet’s passing and forevermore, there will never again be anyone who can conclusively decide on a matter. This design feature, this core consequence of the Islamic creed, should hearten democrats and deject despots.                  Because it means there’s no Islam without each of us having the rights and responsibilities that flow from moral agency. We can and should create communities to translate our strengths and priorities into the world, but none of these should impose on any other – and all of these should start and end with the sacred status of the individual in Islam.                     After all, we are judged by God individually. And that which God holds each individual accountable for, no one should deny.                   Of course, they can – practically speaking.                   But then they’ll have to answer for it – theologically speaking. (It’s called the afterlife.)                   American Islam doesn’t just present a provocative contrast with rigidly hierarchical interpretations of Islam, but actually also – dare I say – more closely approximates the founding Islamic spirit. And we’ll desperately need that egalitarianism, flexibility and nuance if we’re going to thrive in the future that accelerates toward us.                   From climate change to cultural secularization, from rapidly growing populations to the turbulence introduced by disruptive new technologies, we face too many challenges and too much uncertainty not to invest in autonomy. A dynamic, flexible ummah – a web of overlapping sentiments – would be much more likely to prepare us for a fast-changing future.

But many more can’t – not because of Covid, but because people in power decide what is and isn’t Islam. Their Islam or not-Islam.  It’s no wonder there’s a rising tide of atheism and cultural secularism in so much of the Muslim world.                  People don’t feel attached to something they aren’t responsible for. Or made to feel they have any right to. How different for those of us who have to choose for ourselves – and choose again and again. If you focus on the messiness that follows, you’ll miss the point. But if you focus on why there’s messiness in the first place?                   So, yes, I will call the Maryland branch of the family this weekend. I’ll tell them that on Monday morning, we’ll be heading to the Islamic Center of Greater Cincinnati for Eid prayers, but the 10 a.m.service, not the 7 a.m., thank God. They’ll wish me Eid Mubarak. And maybe I’ll wish them Eid Mubarak. Because while Monday will be my Eid, it might not be theirs.                   And we’ll do the exact same thing next year.                   And that’s more than just OK. It’s genuinely beautiful.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Because of slavery and the system of racial caste that it created, US society tends to view race and ethnicity through the limited categories of Black and White.","Apr 29, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Mirna Alsharif,International,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here.                 “You ask 10 different people what it means to be Arab, and you could get 10 different answers.”                 That’s how 31-year-old Danny Hajjar, who’s Lebanese American and grew up in Boston, describes the diversity and richness of Arab and Arab American identities.                 “People from Lebanon, for example, have a different idea of what it means to be Arab compared with people from Morocco,” he told CNN. Hajjar now lives in Washington DC.                 But with that complexity can come frustration, especially in a country such as the US. Because of slavery and the system of racial caste that it created, US society tends to view race and ethnicity through the limited categories of Black and White.                 “I always tick ‘other’ and then write in Middle Eastern, Lebanese or Arab,” Hajjar said. “I remember, distinctly, when I was applying to high school – I went to a private high school – I ticked ‘other’ and the admissions person asked me what I was, and when I told them, they changed it to White. I still can’t believe that happened. That was really something.”                 Put a little bit differently, while the treatment of identity in the US is robust and rigorous in some ways, it’s impoverished in others. And there are consequences.                 “Our community is uniquely disadvantaged because we’re not granted the ability to accurately communicate our identity on the census and other survey data, meaning that the socioeconomic challenges of our heavily first-generation and immigrant communities, as well as the wide range of environmentally linked diseases specific to our ethnic population, are undocumented,” 20-year-old Nooralhuda Sami said.                 Originally from Iraq, Sami and her family moved to Dearborn, Michigan – one of the US cities with the most densely populated Arab community – in 2010.                 “There are so many repercussions of this (lack of data and visibility) in Dearborn I observed growing up. Most notably in the south end of Dearborn – racism, classism and capitalism, and extremely high respiratory illnesses among its refugee and Yemeni residents,” Sami added.                 As the US celebrates Arab American Heritage Month, it’s important to acknowledge the community’s long history, which stretches to the end of the 19th century, when Arabs started to immigrate to the US to escape conflict, persecution and other hardships.                 Arab Americans can trace their origins to 22 Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Yet on records such as the census and even on medical paperwork, US society tends to see this dimension of diversity with little nuance – when it sees it at all.                 Based on the standards set by the Office of Management and Budget, there are seven categories for data on race and ethnicity: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic or Latino, according to the 2020 census program memorandum.                 As a result, Arab Americans must select “White” or “other” on the census and similar data products.                 It’s worth noting that the Census Bureau acknowledges just seven of the 22 Arabic-speaking countries: Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Morocco and Jordan in its ancestry survey. People who write in “Arab” or “Arabic” are listed under the “Arab” subcategory, and those who list one of the other countries are counted as “other Arab.” The Census Bureau also tabulates people who write in Kurd and Amazigh as “other Arab.” Though Kurds and the Amazigh originate from the Middle East and North Africa region, they’re ethnic minorities and don’t identify as Arab.                 “We’re the invisible minority. We’re treated as a minority in all aspects, but we’re identified as White. White isn’t a minority in this country,” Samer Khalaf, the national president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a grassroots organization, told CNN.                 “Because we’re not counted, because we’re invisible, we don’t get the culturally and linguistically competent help that many other communities get, whether it’s mental health resources or Covid-19 information,” he added. “We don’t get those resources because we’re White and fall under the generic White community that doesn’t get needs-based assistance.”                 This invisibility, this lack of a more granular identifier or category, can take a psychological toll.                 Consider 23-year-old Ayia AlMufti, who was born in Iraq right before the US invasion. She said that, growing up in a largely White community in Detroit in the post-9/11 era, she encountered anti-Arab racism everywhere, particularly in comments about her background and her faith.                 Such experiences structured her and many other young Arab Americans’ thinking about race and identity.                 “For so many of us, being counted as White doesn’t reflect our day-to-day experiences,” AlMufti said. “We know that we’re not invisible to the government. They clearly see us. We wouldn’t be the targets of discriminatory counterterrorism programs if they didn’t.”                 The whitewashing of Arab Americans, she added, feels like a dispossession of culture, “a violent act of erasing our existence and diminishing our collective identity and power.”                 Crucially, visibility isn’t always an uncomplicated good. At times, it can be attended by heightened vulnerability.                 “Some people think that identifying themselves (as Arab American) can put a target on their back, so we have to think about it from that side as well,” AlMufti said.                 Still, there are lots of benefits to securing greater visibility on the census and elsewhere.                 “An identifier is important for every single reason we can think of,” said Maya Berry, the executive director of the Arab American Institute. “It’s important for the trillion dollar-plus federal budget, the voter registration ballots, the classes for English as a second language. I can’t think of a way that data and information don’t affect everyday life. For us to be rendered invisible data-wise, it’s harming the community.”                 The Arab population of the US is just north of 2 million, according to the 2020 ancestry survey. But advocacy groups say that there’s a severe undercount of the community due to the lack of a more concrete identifier.                 Most Arabs in the US live in and just outside of big cities on the coasts and in the Midwest. Wayne County (which includes Detroit) in Michigan, Cook County (which includes Chicago) in Illinois, Los Angeles County in California and Kings County in New York have the country’s largest Arab populations, per the survey.                 Even with the clusters on the coasts and in the Midwest, it’s clear that the distribution of the Arab population across the country is as wide-ranging as the nearly two dozen countries members of the community can trace their roots back to.                 Arab Americans have long been key components of the national fabric.                 On April 1, President Joe Biden celebrated April as Arab American Heritage Month and expressed gratitude to the community “for representing the best of who we are.”                 “The history and story of the Arab American community is deeply woven into the diverse tapestry of America,” Biden wrote on Twitter. “This National Arab American Heritage Month, I thank the community for all that you have done to help move us forward.”                 Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered a similar message that day.                 “Immigrants with origins from the Arab world have been arriving to the United States since before our country’s independence and have contributed to our nation’s advancements in science, business, technology, foreign policy and national security,” Blinken said. “The litany is long and includes Private Nathan Badeen, a Syrian immigrant who fought and gave his life during the American Revolution.”                 Arab Americans’ contributions extend far beyond the spheres of foreign policy and national security.                 “Former NASA scientist Farouk El-Baz, who led the agency’s study of the moon’s geology prior to the Apollo 11 landing, comes immediately to mind,” Mahmoud El-Hamalawy, a member of the Arab Americans in Foreign Affairs Agencies group and the communications coordinator for the Department of State, told CNN.                 “The successes of Lebanese American designer Reem Acra, the late Lebanese American poet Kahlil Gibran and the Egyptian American actor Rami Malek reinforce those contributions by showcasing to the world that America continues to be the land of possibility and opportunity for all immigrants,” El-Hamalawy added.                 Of course, this isn’t to suggest that there’s anything close to adequate representation throughout all aspects of US life. In the US Congress, for instance, the number of Arab Americans is still meager.                 Arab American Heritage Month isn’t officially honored by the entire federal government. But it isn’t difficult to detect why securing broader recognition would be significant.                 “For us to claim our place in US society, as so many others have done, it’s important to be recognized by the government,” Khalaf, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee national president, said. “We’ve contributed a lot to this country and to its success. We can’t have that erased or watered down.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/india-kashmir-files-controversy-intl-hnk/index.html,India’s latest box office smash ‘The Kashmir Files’ exposes deepening religious divides,"A new movie based on the mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s has sparked huge debate in India, with critics arguing that its graphic violence and religious stereotyping may exacerbate tensions between the country’s Hindus ...","Apr 28, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Rhea Mogul,International,"“If you don’t leave from here, we will burn your houses,” a bearded Muslim man in a traditional skullcap cries as he rallies against Kashmir’s minority Hindus.                  The packed mosque erupts in rapturous support of his disturbing call. “Go away from here,” continues the man. “Convert, leave or die.”                 This is a scene from Indian filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri’s controversial new movie, “The Kashmir Files,” which is based on the mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits – members of Hinduism’s highest caste, the Brahmin, or “priestly class” – from the restive region as they fled violent Islamic militants in the 1990s.                  Produced on a relatively small budget of around $3 million, it has become the highest-grossing Hindi film released in India during the pandemic, raking in more than $30 million since it hit theaters last month.                   A large part of the film’s success may be down to India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While India’s government did not fund the production, the movie has been praised by several prominent politicians, with some BJP-ruled states waiving tax on tickets – and others giving police officers and government workers time off to watch it.                  Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi – who has previously been criticized for failing to condemn violence against Muslims – backed the movie. During a parliamentary meeting in New Delhi in March, he said there had been a “campaign to discredit” the movie before praising the filmmaker for “showing the truth.”                   Not everyone in India agrees. While there is little doubt that many Kashmiri Pandits suffered at the hands of Islamic militants, critics have questioned the timing of the film’s release and argued that its graphic violence vilifies Muslims and reinforces negative stereotypes.                   Some have also suggested such portrayals – as well as the plot’s alleged historical revisionism – could exacerbate conflict between India’s Hindus and Muslims at a time when religious tensions in the country are increasingly hostile.                  Several videos that went viral on social media appear to show audience members screaming Islamophobic hate speech outside movie theaters and calling for boycotts of Muslim-owned businesses.                  In one, a man can be heard imploring audience members to never watch a film with Muslim actors. In another, a man tells a reporter to “stay far away” from Muslims after exiting the theater. “They can attack us again,” he is heard saying.                  Several petitions have been filed to prevent the film from being shown in local theaters, out of fear that the movie could fuel – or has already fueled – anti-Muslim sentiments.                  And some Muslims have reported fearing for their safety while watching the movie. Recounting her experience in the Washington Post, prominent Indian journalist Rana Ayyub wrote: “I left the theater, just 30 minutes into the movie, feeling humiliated and physically unsafe. A man yelled at me “Ja Pakistan!” (Go to Pakistan).”                   While some Kashmiri Pandits believe the film helps spotlight a neglected part of their history, Nitasha Kaul, a Kashmiri novelist and associate professor in politics and international relations at the University of Westminster, said the film is a “troubling” account of her community’s painful experiences of murder, violence and forced displacement.                  She believes displaced Pandits – of whom about 60,000 fled Kashmir after January 1990, according to the Indian government – have never been given adequate support and were left to battle their trauma in isolation while attempting to build new lives elsewhere.                  Kaul believes the BJP is brazenly adopting the film for political gain and to further a Hindutva ideology that seeks to transform secular India into a Hindu nation.                 “The movie is divisive and clearly has propagandist intent,” said Kaul in a phone interview. “It is Islamophobic and deeply so. It has missed numerous opportunities to portray any solidarity between Kashmiri Pandits and Kashmiri Muslims. And it has been backed by those who control the state.”                 Agnihotri has repeatedly rejected criticism of his movie.                   “The truth inspired me to make this film,” the director told CNN via WhatsApp, explaining that he wrote the script after speaking with hundreds of Kashmiri Pandit families who were impacted by the violence.                  “I believe the biggest enemy of humanity is terrorism, so I decided to make a film based on the living victims of Kashmir genocide.”                  “How can a film on terrorism be propaganda?” he added. “The film is only against terrorism. I have not criticized Muslims.”                  The BJP did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.                  Tensions in Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region, have run high for decades due to a complex and bitter territorial dispute between India and Pakistan that has, on several occasions, led to military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.                  In the 1980s, an insurgency by separatist Islamic militants began targeting Kashmiri Hindus – who were considered pro-India by the separatists – forcing thousands of people to flee their homes and killing as many as 400, though estimates vary.                  The militants also attacked fellow Muslims during the unrest, according to Kaul.                 Against this backdrop, “The Kashmir Files” follows the story of a young Hindu university student who fled Kashmir for New Delhi as a young child after his family was killed by insurgents. Raised by his grandfather and shielded from the nature of his parents’ deaths, the student goes on a journey to uncover the truth of his past, aided by old newspaper clippings. The timeline flits between the past and present.                  But according to Kaul, “The Kashmir Files” rewrites history and ignores political and geographical complexities by blaming regional instability on Muslims alone. Furthermore, she added, the movie fails to depict any of the recorded examples of solidarity between the two religious groups during the conflict – or acknowledge the violence carried out by militants against moderate Muslims.                  “The film completely collapses the multi-dimensional Kashmiri trauma into a very simplistic morality tale,” she said. “It relentlessly hammers away that Kashmiri Muslims are the perpetrators of all suffering… instead of showing any solidarity or attempts by Kashmiri Muslims to help the Pandits. It universally reduces them to terrorist figures.”                 Umesh Talashi, a Kashmiri Pandit who is now a member of the Jammu Kashmir National Conference political party, was 6 years old when the insurgency began. Speaking about the movie, he told CNN that sympathetic Kashmiri Muslims helped his father hide from Islamic militants during the insurgency.                  “I will never forget the help they gave my family,” he said over the phone from his home in Jammu. “I’m not against the depiction of cruelty against the Kashmiri Pandits in the film. But I’m against how all Muslims were depicted as evil terrorists. It is fueling hate and creating a social divide instead of healing old wounds.”                 The director acknowledged he had heard “a few stray stories” but that the film “is not about the Hindu-Muslim brotherhood,” instead choosing to focus on “victims and what happened with them because of terrorism.”                  Numerous reviews have noted that Muslims are portrayed as villains throughout the film’s historical scenes, with the men often depicted holding weapons and wearing heavy kohl-eyeliner and Islamic dress as they commit heinous acts of violence.                  Farooq Malik Bitta, a character seemingly based on real-life separatist figures Farooq Ahmed Dar and Yasin Malik, commands the most horrifying scenes, including one where he forces a Pandit woman to eat rice soaked in her murdered husband’s blood. Elsewhere, a Muslim neighbor, who at first shows concern for a Hindu family’s safety, later betrays them by giving the militants their hiding location. Muslim children are even shown tormenting a young Hindu boy.                  In the movie’s modern-day timeline, Kashmiri characters praise the BJP for revoking the region’s constitutional autonomy and bringing it under closer government control in 2019 – a move that was, in fact, criticized by many high-profile Kashmiris and international human rights organizations. A liberal university professor is meanwhile portrayed negatively because she advocates for an independent Kashmir and sympathizes with the region’s Muslims.                 When asked about if the events depicted in “The Kashmir Files” could drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims, Agnihotri said such accusations were “agenda-driven” and that his film is a “response” to “religious fundamentalist terrorism.”                  The movie has been well-received in many quarters – with reviews describing it as “must watch” and “gut-wrenching,” while others commend the actors’ performances. Aarti Tikoo, a Kashmiri Pandit and journalist, wrote that the film has “done what nobody else in the Indian cinema could accomplish.”                  “It brings out, in multiple shades, the denial of our story by the Indian bureaucracy, media, academia and intelligentsia,” she wrote. “The most gruesome acts of terror unleashed on Hindus in Kashmir and later their life in displacement and destitution in refugee camps in Jammu, have been shown with remarkable intensity, and yet poignantly.”                 And the success of the film has not surprised Agnihotri, who said he’s “very glad” that it has resonated with people. “We tried to tell honest stories as sincerely as possible.”                 He said he was also prepared for criticism.                 “I knew it would come from Western media especially because they are obsessed with Islamophobia. So many people had to leave their motherland. Nobody is talking about Hinduphobia.”                 Delhi-based film critic Tanul Thakur says the Indian film industry – which includes Bollywood and, prior to the pandemic, generated around $2.5 billion a year – has always been “invested in the idea of nationalism.” Compared to the “secular, inclusive values” of films made in the post-independence era, many of today’s storylines reflect the government’s religious agenda, he said.                  Since Modi came to power in 2014, the “tone has changed,” Thakur said in a phone interview, adding: “We’ve also seen a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment and caste-pride (in movies).”                  “The Kashmir Files,” is just one of many Hindu nationalist narratives that have proven popular among movie-goers. The 2017 comedy “Toilet: Ek Prem Katha” (“Toilet: A Love Story”), featuring Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar, is about a man who builds his wife a toilet in their small village home, a nod to the BJP’s rural hygiene campaign.                  The 2018 historical drama “Padmaavat,” which tells the story of a beautiful Hindu queen whose husband is killed by a Muslim sultan, was meanwhile criticized for glorifying the misogynistic Hindu practice of “sati” (whereby a widow self-immolates) and for depicting Muslims as barbaric.                  “PM Narendra Modi,” a 2019 biographical drama based on the life of the prime minister and played by Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi, chronicled Modi’s successful rise from poor tea seller to the most powerful man in India.                 Though nationalist movies like these rarely attract the political backing enjoyed by “The Kashmir Files,” support from the government may take the form of what is and is not shown in theaters. Indian filmmakers have faced censorship for decades, with reasons ranging from religious objections to accusations that plots are “obscene” or “immoral.”                  As a result, movies have been pulled from cinemas and even banned from being released altogether.                  Take the 2007 drama “Parzania,” which tells the real-life story of a Parsi family whose son goes missing during the Gujarat religious riots of 2002 – a time when Modi was chief minister of the western Indian state.                  Although the movie was approved by India’s Central Board of Film Certification, movie theaters in Gujarat refused to screen it.                  Writer and director Rahul Dholakia said state officials feared backlash from right-wing Hindus unhappy with the film’s portrayal of them instigating the riots, which Indian government estimates say led to more than 1,000 people – 790 of whom were Muslims – killed in communal violence, with thousands more displaced.                  Dholakia told CNN via email that he faced numerous hurdles while promoting his film.                  “The biggest challenge was to release ‘Parzania’ in the theaters, because in Gujarat they refused to give me a single screen. They canceled all my allotted shows three days before release,” he said, adding officials told him “no one will watch the film.”                 “I offered to pay for all (the) seats, so that they didn’t lose money. It was then that they said it was a matter of law and order.”                  TV shows and movies have been boycotted, and commercials even forced off air, following outcry from the Hindu right.                  In 2020, Netflix received significant backlash in India for a scene in the series “A Suitable Boy” that depicts a Hindu woman and Muslim man kissing at a Hindu temple.                  That same year, Indian jewelry brand Tanishq withdrew an advert featuring an interfaith couple following online criticism.                  In June 2021, India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting proposed an amendment to its certification process that would allow the government to re-evaluate films that have already been passed by the censorship board – a move that the BJP’s opponents said would give politicians sweeping censorship powers. More than 100 actors, filmmakers and producers penned an open letter imploring the government to rethink its decision, calling it “another blow to the film fraternity.”                 By contrast, the BJP’s overt support for “The Kashmir Files,” which opened in all major theaters across the country, is seen by some critics as a double standard – particularly given the movie’s violent content and sensationalized interpretation of historical events.                  “Hindus and Muslims have been working together to heal from the pain,” Talashi said. “Kashmiri Muslims are apologetic about the past. But when you see such propaganda, when you feel such hatred, it becomes very difficult for us to bridge that gap.”     Top image caption: Women walk past a banner of “The Kashmir Files’” outside a cinema hall in the old quarters of Delhi on March 21, 2022.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/europe/french-muslim-voters-2022-election-intl-cmd/index.html,A vitriolic election campaign marked by anti-Islam narratives has left many French Muslims feeling marginalized,"Hiba Latreche took a last gulp of water and reached for a date, her eyes flitting between the plates of food before her and her phone screen as it blinked toward 5:42 a.m., the beginning of her fast.","Apr 22, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Joseph Ataman,International,"Hiba Latreche took a last gulp of water and reached for a date, her eyes flitting between the plates of food before her and her phone screen as it blinked toward 5:42 a.m., the beginning of her fast.                 This year, the month of Ramadan coincides with the presidential elections in France, the climax of a campaign that has been marked by anti-Muslim vitriol on a scale not seen for decades.                 As France goes to the polls for the presidential run-off on April 24, many French Muslims like Latreche have been facing a difficult question: Do these would-be presidents really represent my interests?                 Considering the candidates who entered the race, the answer for many is no.                  Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate ​who will challenge incumbent Emmanuel Macron in Sunday’s final round, lists “eradicating Islamist ideologies” from France as her second manifesto priority.                  Eric Zemmour, a former TV pundit convicted three times for hate speech, racial or religious hatred, has said he wants to “save France” from Islam. Center-right candidate Valerie Pecresse declared the headscarf a “sign of a woman’s submission,” claiming with a nationalistic flourish that “Marianne is not a veiled woman.” Zemmour and Pecresse polled fourth and fifth, respectively, in the first round and have been eliminated.                 Even Macron found time in his only campaign rallybefore the first round vote to highlight the threat of Islamists and Muslim “separatists” in France, entwiningFrance’s motto of “Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité” (liberty, equality, brotherhood) with another favored French Republican value: Laicité (secularism).                 Only one candidate, the third-placed far-left politician Jean-Luc Melenchon, has historically taken a position more supportive of the Muslim community. First round polling by Ifop suggested that some two thirds of French Muslim voters backed him. He too was eliminated after the first round of voting.                  “What’s really scary with this upcoming election is that most of the (top) candidates simply rely on programs based on stigmatization of minorities, on the erosion of our most basic rights and freedom,” Latreche, a law student, said ahead of the first round.                 With the “normalization of Islamophobia, we directly face the consequences,” added Latreche, who is also a vocal activist for the civil liberties of young Muslim women.                 The French political landscape this year is vastly different from just a few elections ago. With the country’s traditionally heavyweight center-left and center-right forces struggling, the political extremes have profited.                 In the first round of the presidential election on April 10, Le Pen and Zemmour, the two far-right candidates with the most extreme policies affecting the lives of Muslims in France, ​together ​collected just over 30% of the total votes; Le Pen ​alone received enough votes to enter the runoff with 23% ​of the first round votes​. Their surge has been accompanied by a clamor of anti-immigrant and anti-Islam narratives that have dominated much of the debate and coverage.                 Strasbourg’s Grand Mosque – the largest in France – sits tucked discreetly away on a riverbank in the eastern border city.                 Many of the worshipers there say they don’t feel represented by any of the dozens of candidates who competed​ for the presidency in the first round.     Related articleOpinion: Macron flirted with the far-right. And France lost              “We’re constantly being marginalized, excluded from society and then being told that we’re not taking part in society,”said Latreche. Being refused agency and choice over her own life and contribution to society, she felt, inevitably had a negative effect on her mental health and that of her friends, she added.                 As he entered for evening prayers, Wagner Dino expressed dismay at the choice of candidates.                 “There is no one who presents himself, who really has the necessary parameters to put everything in place, to have a France united with Muslims,” he said.                 Mosque volunteer Safia Abdouni said she believes none of the candidates “know what we are going through, our daily life and what we really need.”                 “I feel that I’m not represented as a young, female student. As a young, female, Muslim student, even less,” she added.                 Yet Saïd Aalla, the president of the Grand Mosque, said that if young Muslims “want to change the situation, that can only happen with the vote.”                 Aalla did not express a preference for any of the contenders. As a cleric, he’s prohibited by French law from publicly backing a political candidate.                 In successive election seasons, hijabs and Muslim women’s headscarves have been easy targets for politicians trying to fire up support for traditional French Republican values.                 “Laicité” – or secularism – claims to ensure equality for all by removing markers of difference, rendering all citizens French first and protecting freedom of worship in the private sphere. Religious symbols are banned in ​primary and secondary schools, public office and state places of work, as well as even in some sports federations.                 “Laicité per se is not a problem,” according to Rim-Sarah Alouane, a PhD candidate in comparative law at the University Toulouse-Capitole and a specialist on religious freedoms and human rights in Europe.                 “Laicité has been transformed (and) has been weaponized as a tool for political identity in order to target the visibility of Muslims in France, of French Muslims, and especially Muslim women, and the wearing of the headscarf. So it’s more of the modern illiberal interpretation of laicité that is problematic, than laicité itself,” she said.                 Today’s laicité debate has put hijabs front and center in France’s culture wars pitting ​what conservatives describe as “secularism​” against religious civil liberties                 Le Pen and Zemmour both proposed banning ​what they refer to as “the hijab,” but neither campaign has offered detail on what exactly such a ban would encompass, or how it would be enforced. In her campaign manifesto, Le Pen has proposed banning in public all “Islamic attire,” a definition that critics say is open to arbitrary and imprecise interpretation. The French government has already banned women from wearing the niqab – a full-face veil with an opening for the eyes.      Related articleThe quest for égalité: What's at stake for women in the French election             The Macron government reacted furiously to a diversity campaign funded in part by the European Union last year, which depicted pictures of women wearing the headscarves superimposed over the same images without the head covering. The campaign tagline was, “Beauty is in diversity, as freedom is in hijab.”                  The French government demanded an investigation into the campaign and its withdrawal in France. In the words of one minister: “We can’t confuse religious freedom and a campaign for the promotion of the hijab, it’s not acceptable.”     Last month, the French Supreme Court ruled that local bar associations can ban headscarves, and other “religious symbols,” from courtrooms in the name of secularism – forcing hijab-wearing women like Latreche to choose between their career and ​the public practice of ​their faith.                 “It’s actually extremely demotivating and disheartening to see that, you know, we wouldn’t be able to help to contribute to society and to make it more vibrant despite our abilities,” Latreche said, “just because we are choosing to exercise our rights.                 “We (should) have control over our own rights and bodies and beliefs,” she said.                  Ludwig Knoepffler, a member of Le Pen’s campaign team, denied that Le Pen’s ​anti-hijab platform is done “in the name of laicité.” Rather, he ​​said the intent was to combat totalitarianism.                 “The idea is to fight the hijab as a political tool used and promoted by Islamist militants,” he said. “If you believe that the Islamist political project is indeed totalitarian, then you have to fight its distinctive signs. The same way you would ban the swastika in the public sphere, as is the case already.”                 Le Pen addressed the topic during the presidential debate Wednesday night, calling the headscarf “a uniform imposed by the Islamists.”                 Macron accused her of creating a “system of equivalence” among Islamism, terrorism and foreigners that would “create civil war.”                 Aalla, the mosque president, said France’s Muslims have the same aspirations as other citizens.                 “The Muslims of France have been here for several generations, but we still continue to regard them as strangers,” he said.                 Aalla decried the idea of a “Muslim vote.” There are Muslims who support all French parties, he said – people that hope to be taken into consideration by politicians, particularly regarding religious freedoms.                 For legal scholar Alouane, debate about the ​headscarf​ is a fearmongering distraction: “I mean, we have inflation, the price of energy has increased massively, there is poverty, our public services are being dismantled, unemployment and so on… and all we talk about, is a piece of cloth that women wear… like, seriously.”                 Aalla said that French Muslims expect France and French society to devote themselves to economic, social questions, to those of housing or discrimination, the questions “that all citizens, Muslims included, expect from their new president.”                 But for the French citizens and voters gathering to pray and break their fast amid a darkening political atmosphere, the hopes of many in their community can be summed up in one phrase: “Liberté, égalité, fraternité.”       Journalist Camille Knight contributed reporting. © 2024 Cable News Network.

His home was one of several properties in Khargone city’s Chhoti Mohan Talkies neighborhood, in India’s central Madhya Pradesh state, ​that he says were demolished by authorities following violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims that broke out on April 10 – the day of the Hindu festival Ram Navami.                 Authorities have ​defended the demolitions by saying they had acted against both “rioters” and “encroachers,” claiming the houses and shops were built illegally on public land. But Baig and others spoken to by CNN say only Muslim homes have been targeted.                 Experts say the demolitions are the tip of a far deeper problem and that this is only the latest in a string of attacks on the country’s Muslim population, fueled in part by the ​ascendance of India’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).                  They argue that Muslims in BJP-run Madhya Pradesh have been disproportionately punished following the violence, raising fears that members of the country’s ​largest minority religion – about 200 million of India’s 1.3 billion population are Muslim – are being persecuted under the BJP.                 They point to similar problems in the capital New Delhi, where ​witnesses told CNN that authorities began demolishing shops and other structures in the predominantly Muslim neighborhood of Jahangirpuri on Wednesday, days after violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims broke out following Hanuman Jayanti, a celebration of the birthday of the Hindu god Hanuman.                 For Baig, there is an extra sense of injustice.                 Baig said he and his neighbors were nowhere near the scene of the clashes.                 “I don’t know what is happening in my country,” said Baig, who ​says he has lived in the property for more than 30 years. “But all I can say is that I’m paying the price of being a Muslim.”                  The communal violence in Khargone erupted after groups of Hindu men carrying saffron flags – a color associated with Hinduism that has in recent years become increasingly politicized – marched through Muslim-majority neighborhoods on Ram Navami, a festival that celebrates the birth of the revered Hindu god, Lord Ram.                  The details of the clashes are disputed. Violent skirmishes between Hindus and Muslims erupted, with some men throwing stones and holding weapons in the air, according to video from local news outlets. Houses and cars were set on fire, and at least one person died ​– a Muslim man – in the clashes, state police told reporters. A curfew was imposed in the city to quell the violence on April 10, and some restrictions were lifted after 11 days, they said. The government said they have set aside a cumulative sum of $131,000 for families affected by the violence.                  But it is the scenes of state officials bulldozing properties that gained the most attention, with activists and citizens decrying the move as unjust and unlawful.                 Dr. Tameezuddin Shaikh was at home on April 11 when he received a phone call from a friend informing him that authorities were bulldozing his son’s medical shop in the predominantly Muslim neighborhood of Talab Chowk in Khargone.                 “I was stunned,” said Shaikh, who ​says he often provides free services to impoverished and marginalized families. “There was a curfew imposed in the city and I had not been given any notice warning of any illegality. I live far away from my medical store, and with the curfew imposed, there was no way that we could go and stop the demolitions.”                 About a dozen shops in Talab Chowk were demolished by Khargone authorities, according to Shaikh.                   Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra ​described the state’s actions ​as a form of revenge, telling reporters on April 11: “From the homes where stones were pelted, we will turn those homes to a pile of stones.” He offered no proof the ​residents whose homes were destroyed had been linked to the violence.                 Shaikh said neither he nor his son were involved in the violence. And he has served the local community from that shop for more than five decades without an issue, he added.                 “I’m a respected name in Khargone, having served people all my life,” he said. “But all the medicines and everything in my clinic worth over 10 lakh rupees ($13,000) turned to rubble.”     Related articleHijab protests spread in India as girls refuse to be told what not to wear             Muslim group Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind has filed a petition in India’s Supreme Court, urging an intervention into the demolitions, and calling them a “violation” of India’s constitution.                 According to lawyer and activist Kawalpreet Kaur, district officers “cannot take the law into their own hands and cannot be the adjudicating authority.”                  “They cannot decide who is a criminal,” she said.                   Rahul Verma, a fellow from the Centre for Policy Research, said the demolitions in Madhya Pradesh were “unprecedented.”                  “It’s not a job of the municipal office to give punishment to people who might be involved in ​stone-pelting or violence,” he said.                 Ayub Khan, a resident of the Aurangpura Square neighborhood, about 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) from Talab Chowk, lost seven shops when authorities demolished them a day after the violence.                  Khan ​says he lost more than $26,000 in the destruction, and now faces the daunting task of rebuilding without sufficient money. He plans to file a petition against state officials in the country’s Supreme Court.                 “The demolished shops had stood there for over 70 years and we never received a single (government) notice,” he said. “Indeed my shops were demolished because I am a Muslim who refused to bend before BJP leaders. The way the district administration is targeting Muslims after the violence in Khargone, it’s evident that they hate a particular community.”​                 CNN contacted the secretary for Madhya Pradesh’s Home Minister, Secretary Home Minister, Khargone’s District Collector and the police, but did not receive a response.                 Tensions between Indian Hindus and Muslims have ​been flashpoints for decades – even before India gained its independence from the British. But when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP swept to power in 2014, promising economic reform and development, experts feared his rise could signal an ideological shift ​away from the nation’s secular ​norms to​ward those of a Hindu-nationalist state.                   The BJP has its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu group that counts Modi among its members and adheres to Hindutva ideology – which seeks to make India the land of the Hindus.                  Analysts and activists feared Modi’s election would leave India’s Muslims – about 14% of the country’s population – vulnerable to exploitation.             According to Debasish Roy Chowdhury, co-author of “To Kill A Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism,” the “demonstrable subjugation and domination of Muslims through their constant humiliation and disempowerment” is “central” to the BJP’s Hindutva project.                  “It charges the party’s Hindu-right voter base, as well as helps enlist more supporters by constantly polarizing voters on the basis of religious identity through a relentless campaign of hate,” he said.                 And according to Chowdhury, Hindu vigilante groups are “increasingly allowed more leeway.”             Over the last eight years, several BJP-run states have imposed new laws that critics say are rooted in Hindutva ideology. At the same time, reports of violence and hate-speech against Muslims have increasingly made headlines across the country.      Related articleAn election in India's most populous state pits Covid-19 anger against Hindu nationalism             The most controversial new laws are in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, ruled by Hindu monk-turned-politician Yogi Adityanath. The state has introduced laws to protect cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus, from slaughter, and made it increasingly difficult to transport cattle. It has also introduced an anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                  Most recently, the BJP-ruled southern state of Karnataka banned Muslim girls from wearing ​religious headscarves in classrooms, prompting several to challenge the decision in the ​state’s top court – a battle they ultimately lost.                   According to Muslim author and journalist Rana Ayyub, Muslims are “made to feel like victims in their own country.”                  “From what I see in India right now, I feel for my Muslims,” she said. “I feel for my brother each time he goes for Namaz (prayers) wearing a skullcap during the month of (Ramadan).”                 And the demolition of Muslim-owned properties during Ramadan, according to Ayyub is “demonizing and demoralizing.”                 “It’s like (state authorities) are doing it purposefully,” she said. “They’re trying to tell us that (during) a month that is sacrosanct for Muslims, ‘we are going to humiliate your beliefs and your system’.”                 Baig continues to live in a small room in his home – the only one spared demolition – with his wife, children and ailing father.                  They have no running water or electricity. Food is running out, ​he says, and with his livelihood destroyed Baig does not know how he can afford to feed his family.                 “With temperatures touching 42 degrees Celsius (107 degrees Fahrenheit), we are struggling to soothe our crying children,” his wife Parveen said.                 Meanwhile, Khargone district officials have posted ​numerous photos and videos to their official social media, showing police patrolling the streets and bulldozing more properties.                  “Do not let harmony become divided,” read a tweet from Tuesday. “Create an atmosphere of peace and harmony.”                  But Baig ​believes that the very institutions in place to protect him and his family betray​ed him by destroying their home.                 “I want to ask the government, how can a man who struggles to make ends meet, but feeds his family by working hard each day, have the means to indulge in (violent) activities?” ​Baig asked.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The incident Saturday was the second report of vandalism at West End Islamic Center in the past six months.                 The most recent incident took place during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Police found “trash, graffiti, tables and chairs flipped inside the building” as well as a shattered glass window, Lieutenant Matthew Pecka told CNN.                 “There were no notes or specifics regarding graffiti,” said Pecka. “Henrico Police has responded, documented the incident and this remains an open active investigation. We want all community members to feel safe in their place and choice of worship.”                 Pecka added the incident is not currently classified as a hate crime and there will be increased patrols in the area.                 The previous incident took place in November 2021 and it is not known if the two incidents are related, said Pecka.

The statement includes pictures of the damage.                 “Rights of all people of faith is a founding principle of America,” read the statement. “We do not know or understand the motivation of the person(s).

The riots erupted in several of Sweden’s southern cities after burnings of the Quran by Rasmus Paludan, leader of the Danish far-right Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party.                  Paludan planned and carried out the anti-Muslim demonstration, posting a picture of himself on social media with a burning Quran and declared intentions of burning more.                 Police “don’t know for sure yet” if the riots began as a protest to the anti-Muslim rally led by Paludan, the spokesperson said, adding that the police were “looking into why and who.” CNN has reached out to Stram Kurs for comment.                 In the city of Norrköping, three people needed medical attention after being hit by police bullets during clashes between police and protesters.                  “Three people seem to have been hit by ricochets and are now being cared for in hospital. All three injured are arrested on suspicion of crime,” police said in an online statement, adding none of the injuries were life-threatening.                 The violence spread south to the city of Malmö on Saturday and continued throughout Sunday, the spokesperson said.                 Police used weapons against the rioters, the spokesperson said, but would not confirm local media reports that tear gas was used. Rioters can be seen hurling objects at police in video filmed by the Reuters news agency Sunday, which also shows vehicles ablaze.                 Police believe that people with links to criminal gangs took advantage of the situation, according to the spokesperson.                 Officers saw no further unrest on Monday but will continue to be present in Norrköping, they added.                 Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has also condemned the violence.                 Countries with Muslim majority populations have condemned the burnings of the Quran, with Saudi Arabia calling Paludan’s actions a “deliberate abuse of the Holy Qur’an.”                 In a statement published on their state news agency SPA on Sunday, the kingdom called the burnings “provocations and incitement against Muslims by some extremists in Sweden” and stressed “the importance of concerted efforts to spread the values of dialogue, tolerance and coexistence, reject hatred, extremism and exclusion, and prevent abuse of all religions and sanctities.”     Related articleThe 'anti-woke' crusade has come to Europe. Its effects could be chilling             Turkey’s Foreign Ministry denounced the “vile attacks against our holy book,” adding in a statement: “There is still hesitation to prevent Islamophobic and racist provocative acts, and committing crimes of hatred openly and publicly are tolerated under the guise of freedom of expression.”                 In Iraq, the government urged the Swedish authorities to stop “provocative” actions.                 “[The act] was considered a provocation to the feelings of Muslims and extremely offensive to their sanctities…this matter has serious repercussions on the relations between Sweden and Muslims in general,” a statement by the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Sunday.                 In a tweet, the Emirati diplomatic adviser to the president, Anwar Gargash, rejected the “hatred” and “intolerance” against Islam.                 The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs “condemned the intentional abuse of the Holy Qur’an” by the far-right, saying it is “among the extreme right-wing practices that incite against immigrants in general and Muslims in particular.”                 Kuwait “expressed its utter condemnation and disgust towards the acts of desecration perpetrated by Swedish extremists against the Holy Quran,” the state news agency KUNA said.                 And Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the action “contradicts all religious values and principles, human rights principles and basic freedoms, and fuels feelings of hatred and violence and threatens peaceful coexistence.”       Additional reporting from Reuters. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The charges against Mohammad Moiz Omar, a 24-year-old Mississauga resident, include assault with a weapon; administering noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm; possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose; utter threat to cause death or bodily harm; carrying concealed weapon; and mischief to religious property, according to the release.                 The attempted attack took place Saturday around 7 a.m. local time at Dar Al-Tawheed Islamic Centre during the dawn prayer of Fajr, police said. The mosque said in a Facebook post the suspect who walked in was also armed with “numerous other sharp edged weapons.”                 Noonrani Sairally, who’s been attending the mosque for more than a decade, told CNN Monday he heard a noise about seven to 10 minutes after the congregation started morning prayers.                 “I heard a hissing noise over the sound system followed by a scream and when I turned around, I saw this man with a can of bear spray and a hatchet in his hand,” he said.                 Sairally said that’s when worshippers, who were lined up in the middle of the mosque, immediately approached the attacker and pinned him to the ground.                   “He (the attacker) didn’t realize the spray was making noise so that immediately alerted people in the first row,” Sairally said. “One of the young fellows in that row saw the hatchet and acted very quickly to knock it out of his hand. Then everyone quickly jumped on him and pushed him to the floor.”                  The attacker didn’t say anything as worshippers waited for police to arrive because he had inhaled bear spray and was having trouble breathing, Sairally said.

Carrying saffron-colored flags and matching scarves, the men chant loudly in unison as they taunt their targets: Muslim women in hijabs who remain huddled in one corner of the street.                 The visual confrontation between their black and blue Islamic garments and the raging sea of saffron – a color closely associated with Hinduism – is symbolic of deepening divisions in the country caused, in part, by the rise of Hindu nationalism.     Makes me so sad to see the youth of India divided- pic.twitter.com/eOpFsNjuFl             What started in January as a peaceful demonstration by six Muslim students protesting for the right to wear hijabs in their state-run school has morphed into a larger movement defined by gender, religion and clothing. And the arrival, weeks later, of counter demonstrators clad in saffron is indicative of the blurring lines between the Indian state and religion.                  The orange-yellow hue, seen as a symbol of divinity in Hinduism, has been brazenly adopted by the far-right Hindutva movement and, in recent years, increasingly politicized. The movement seeks to homogenize Indian culture around Hindu values.                 For India’s Muslims, meanwhile, the hijab has become a symbol of resistance against the wave of Islamophobia spreading across the country, as women wearing the religious garment protest in various towns and cities in support of the students.                  “I started covering my head three years ago as a protest against crimes against Muslims,” said 23-year-old Muslim activist Afreen Fatima in a phone interview. She had been demonstrating in her hometown of Allahabad in northern Uttar Pradesh state.                 “But now, it has become a spiritual obligation for me. It’s an assertion of my identity. I am an Indian Muslim and I’m not going anywhere.”                 The hijab, an Islamic headscarf, is worn by millions of Muslim women around the world as a sign of modesty and privacy. But in some countries the garment has proven controversial, with critics depicting it as a symbol of oppression or arguing that it is incompatible with secular values.                  In 2004 the French government banned religious garments, including the hijab, in state schools. Seven years later France became the first country in Europe to ban all face-covering garments in public spaces, with policymakers describing the move a matter of national identity and security.      Other European countries have since followed suit with similar restrictions, though the types of veil permitted – and where they can be worn – differ.                 In India, however, the hijab is neither banned nor restricted in public spaces, and the right to practice one’s faith is guaranteed under the country’s secular constitution. But, like elsewhere in the world, Muslim women can face backlash and discrimination for choosing to wear one.                  According to Indian poet and activist Nabiya Khan, Muslim women are “imagined in an Islamic veil and seen as submissive” because they do not “fit the feminist narrative of the liberal elite.”                  “I wear (a) hijab because I want to,” she said via WhatsApp. “It serves me a religious and spiritual significance. It brings me closer to my god.”                 The conflict in Karnataka began after a small group of hijabi students were denied entry to their classrooms in the coastal city of Udupi, according to the petition they later filed in the state’s top court. In early January, the girls staged a protest outside their government-run school, demanding they be allowed inside. But their teachers refused.                 Their demonstration prompted rival protests from right-wing Hindus carrying saffron scarves and flags (such as those captured in the aforementioned video), chanting a religious Hindu slogan in support of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and demanding the girls remove their head coverings.                   The clashes proliferated through Karnataka, with the state ordering a three-day closure of all high schools and colleges in early February. Authorities in the state’s capital, Bengaluru, also banned protests outside schools for two weeks.                  Karnataka’s education minister B.C. Nagesh said he supported banning the hijab in educational institutions. Citing the state’s mandate on religious attire, the CNN affiliate CNN News-18 that Karnataka’s government “is very firm that the school is not a platform to practice dharma (religion).”                  But activists say the hijab row runs deeper than a dress code, claiming it’s just the latest in a wider crackdown on India’s minority Muslim population since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP came to power almost eight years ago.                 The BJP did not respond to CNN’s request for comment or to allegations that it advocates Hindu nationalism and is using the hijab row for political gain. When asked about the hijab controversy during a meeting with reporters in February, India’s Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, told CNN the matter was for Karnataka’s government to handle.                  Karnataka has already passed legislation that, critics say, is rooted in Hindutva ideology. Last year, the state banned the sale and slaughter of cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus. It also introduced a controversial anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                 For Fatima, the hijab row is just the latest move from authorities to quell Muslim voices.                  “This movement is us fighting for our faith, identity and religious freedom,” she said. “By wearing our hijab and taking this stand, we are telling Hindus that we are not going to back down.”                 In one of the most striking scenes from the February stand-off, a hijab-wearing Muslim student, Muskan Khan, does exactly that. In another video, which also went viral, Khan is seen being accosted by men as she gets off her scooter to hand in a school assignment.                 They heckle her, demanding she take off her hijab. But instead of complying, Khan shouts back “Allahu Akbar” – meaning “God is great” in Arabic – and punches her fist in the air.                 Her raised fist has become an icon of defiance. In an act of solidarity, scores of Muslim women have changed their Twitter profile photos to a silhouette of Khan’s raised fist, while her likeness has appeared on placards and posters at demonstrations.                  Ashish Bagchi is one of many designers and artists who have shared illustrations inspired by Khan on social media. His image depicts her walking with her head held high as saffron-tinted arms – representative of the Hindu right – encroach on her.                  Bagchi’s personal political works, which appear on his Instagram and Twitter, present a narrative of India’s shrinking freedoms.                 “What really moved me was the way she stood her ground,” he said. “What stood out for me was those men shouting and brandishing her with their saffron stoles. Sadly, the saffron color now symbolizes a particular political ideology.”                 The color saffron has roots in Hinduism – one of the world’s oldest religions – and represents peace. About 80% of India’s 1.3 billion people are Hindu, and the color is seen draped on idols in the temples, tied around the neck of cows and used as street decorations during festivals.                  But ever since the BJP swept to power with a Hindu nationalist agenda in 2014, the color has become increasingly politicized. Modi and his compatriots are often seen donning saffron-hued clothing and accessories at election rallies, while supporters wave the party’s flag (which is primarily saffron) or other similarly colored ones.                   “The appropriation of saffron is a way of signaling that the party is not just political, but deeply rooted in religion,” said Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at India’s Ashoka University, in a phone interview.                  “The color serves the purpose of a ‘uniform’ and gives BJP supporters a sense of unity and commonality.”                 The BJP’s Yogi Adityanath, Chief Minister of India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, is one high-profile figure who is almost always seen dressed head-to-toe in the color. Arguably one of the most polarizing figures in Indian politics, Adityanath – a former Hindu priest – is known for his provocative rhetoric against Muslims.                 And while not every Hindu that wears the color espouses Hindu nationalism, when politicians dressed in saffron make statements against the country’s minorities, it emboldens far-right groups to do the same, according to historian Aditya Mukherjee.                  “The religious symbolism used by the Hindu right today is a complete inversion of what Indian culture is. They have given the color a different meaning,” said Mukherjee.                  “This is not what the Hindu religion stands for. And it’s certainly not an organic feeling coming from many Hindu Indians.                 “It is a very scary moment for India,” he added, referring to how extremists have carried out violent attacks against Muslims.                      It is symbolic, perhaps, that as saffron becomes an increasingly common sight in public life, the hijab’s status in India has now been thrown into question. Karnataka’s High Court has finished deliberating over whether schools can ban headscarves or not, and a ruling is expected soon. In the meantime, its interim order to prohibit all religious clothing in educational institutes with an existing dress code or uniform, still stands.                  For the activist Fatima, removing the hijab is “like asking our women to strip.”                  “It is fathomably disturbing. It is unethical,” she said, adding that she will not be “silenced” by the growing Hindu right.                  “The options we as Muslims have to demand justice are very few. Muslim women have it worse. We don’t have the privilege to remain silent. We will assert our identity even more.”      Top image caption: Students and activists hold banners while shouting slogans during a demonstration in Karnataka after Muslim students were told not to wear hijabs in schools.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

She writes: “We are painfully seeing that refugees are selectively ...","Mar 8, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Arwa Damon,International,"Editor’s Note: Arwa Damon is CNN’s award-winning senior international correspondent usually based in Istanbul and President and co-founder of the charity INARA. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             I see parallel images in the floods of humanity coming toward me. One is happening in front of my eyes on the Ukraine-Poland border; large hands clutching little ones, tiny heads resting on weary shoulders, the constant hum of rolling suitcases. I see faces frozen in shock, etched with lines of trauma that will never fully fade. Their eyes glazed over in sheer disbelief, minds unable to comprehend the lives they have left behind.                   The other image has superimposed itself in my psyche, created by the torrent of memories from covering the 2015 refugee crisis. Back then, crowds crushed against concertina wire on the Greece-Macedonia border. A mother cradled her baby under a plastic tarp in the pouring rain, a father held up his listless feverish little girl saying, “look at her, look at her state, in Syria she was a princess.”                 Today it feels like the world has woken up and finally realized how ruthless and murderous the Russian government is. As if for years Syrians were not dying under the same Russian bombs. As if countless Syrian voices were not begging the world to help them. At the time, they asked me, “why doesn’t the world care about us?” But I could never answer the question without crushing them even more. How do you tell someone their life is not part of a geopolitical calculus, that in the grand scheme of the puppet masters their life is not worth all that much?                  We are painfully seeing that refugees are selectively welcomed, and war criminals are selectively punished. It’s not just the western media that is biased; it’s the western world.                 I hear it in the rhetoric coming out of from politicians, journalists and global leaders. Rhetoric about how Ukrainians are a “prosperous middle-class people,” “the family next door,” “civilized.”  As if what is defined as a human worth saving is identified by the color of their skin, the language they speak, the religion they practice or where they were born.      Refugee tells CNN he was told they were 'not allowing Blacks' to board train             The ugly truth is our humanity is skin deep. And it breaks my heart.                  Today in Poland I see the beauty of what can happen when refugees are welcomed. When kindness and compassion is what greets those on the run for their lives. When hundreds of volunteers wait for bus after bus with signs offering free rides and warm places to stay. When security forces of the host nation facilitate movement, provide information and shelter. When a stranger says, “It’s OK, you are safe now, what can I do for you?” ​                 Again, I flash back to what happens when refugees are not welcome. In 2015, none of the restaurants or cafes around Hungary’s Budapest train station allowed refugees inside. Those fleeing were corralled like cattle by security forces until they broke through and just ran. Miles and miles of people walking, hoping and praying someone would show them mercy.                    There was so much anti-refugee rhetoric from European governments and populations back then, shrouded in fears that ISIS would infiltrate, that those on the road were “too different.”  And yes, this was also at the peak of ISIS’s bombings in Europe. But it was also the peak of ISIS and other terrorist groups attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond.                  At the heart of this is the sad reality, that the refugees I’ve reported on in years past were from the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan and were deemed “the other” by many in the Western world. And for some reason that made their pain and suffering unrelatable.                 I told the world on CNN the Syrians are like anyone else; they had dreams, homes, a sense of security they believed in. I felt like it was not resonating, not penetrating. For the vast majority of our Western audience, they remained “the other.”                  As a journalist, I often ask myself: Did I somehow fail back then? How could I have told those refugee stories to make the world care? I have carried that guilt with me for years, still even today. Because surely, there should have been a way to show the Western world – the same world now standing with Ukrainians; that the Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and others who took this same path through Europe are just like them.                  I am Arab American, but my appearance – light skinned, green-eyed, fair haired – is so outside of the Arab stereotype no one questions if I belong.                  I see Syrian and Iraqi faces in those of the Ukrainians. And I’m taken back to Greece in 2015 when an elderly, elegant Syrian lady fleeing for safety in the mud grabbed my arm, her touch as soft as my Nana’s.                  I remember that same year, a woman in Hungary asked us not to film, not because she was worried about the security of her family still in Syria, but because she did not want them to see her humiliated, sitting on the ground, dirty.      'He has decided to destroy the whole world': Six global voices on Putin's invasion of Ukraine             This week I looked at the Ukrainian women and children filing on the waiting buses, and I am so relieved for their sake that their refugee story is different.                 It wasn’t all bad. I did witness some heartwarming moments in 2015. People on the highway connecting Hungary to Austria stopped with strollers, food, and water for the refugees. Apologizing for the behavior of their government saying, “We are not all like that.” And at makeshift gathering points local efforts did eventually combine with those of larger charities to provide basic shelter. But none of it compares to what I am witnessing here in Ukraine and Poland.                  At every refugee relocation center and border crossing, there are mountains of clothes, stuffed animals, strollers, and so much more. An entire system and army of volunteers working together to help fleeing Ukrainians in need.                  I remember when then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would take in one million Syrians. The refugees I was with in Hungary began weeping with joy; finally feeling welcome and no longer treated like unwanted garbage. But ultimately as the months dragged on, Europe’s bigger solution was to cut a deal with Turkey to close the migrant route, freezing those on the road in limbo.                 Seven years later, many of them are still in the same camps and makeshift centers, their lives stagnant. Some children born in the camps have never known a real home. Many are likely unaware Syrians are still in these makeshift camps.             I juxtapose those memories with what is happening across the world today, with so many nations declaring all Ukrainian refugees welcome. I see Western nations offering these refugees yearslong residencies, work permits and free transit into other countries.                  I see how Western and other powers express outrage over Ukraine, the very same nations that, at best, offered lip service when it came to Syria and those that just kept their mouth shut. I see country after country, western and non, unified in pressuring Russia, slapping harsher sanctions than ever before. I see credit card companies denying use in Russia, airlines stopping services and products being boycotted.                  No matter where they are from, the refugees’ emotions are so similar: the inability to comprehend how their reality became so suddenly and violently altered, and the survivors’ guilt that ravages those who fled, even if to save their children, even if rationally it was the only choice.                 Each war is its own, its outlines drawn by powers larger than the individual, and by the greed and cruelty of geopolitics. But the pain of humanity caught up in the tug-of-war remains the same. The agony of realizing that not only is home no longer safe – it may no longer exist at all.

Some of those comparisons went overboard, causing outrage in the Arab world.","Mar 4, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Abbas Al Lawati,International,"Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index              Latest Market News              Hot Stocks              The Middle East found itself dragged into coverage of the conflict in Ukraine  over the past week as journalists descended on the country to cover the biggest European war in decades.                   Western war reporters, more used to being deployed in Middle East conflict zones, were quick to make comparisons. Some of those comparisons went overboard, causing outrage in the Arab world.                  “This isn’t a place, with all due respect, you know, like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades,” said CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D’Agata, referring to Ukraine. “You know, this is a relatively civilized, relatively European… city.” He later apologized.                  Other news outlets poured sympathy on Ukrainian victims, with interviewees and correspondents pointing out that, unlike Middle Eastern refugees, Ukrainian victims were “white,” “Christian,” “middle class,” “blonde” and “blue eyed.”                  In a matter of days, hashtags, and even t-shirts, featuring the phrase “civilized” surfaced in the Middle East in protest.                   The media coverage prompted the New York-based Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association to issue a statement condemning the “pervasive mentality in Western journalism of normalizing tragedy” in places like the Middle East.                  Its president Hoda Osman, who has reported for several Western media outlets, including France24, ABC News and CBS News, said the contrast between coverage of Western victims versus Middle Eastern ones demonstrates a dehumanization of the latter.                  We asked her why she feels this is happening and what can be done about it.      Western news outlets have many more minority journalists than they used to. Has that diversity trickled down to coverage?              There’s no doubt that having more minority journalists would lead to better coverage, whether it’s through catching misinformation, bias and racism, booking interviews with knowledgeable people who understand the nuances, offering background and context or helping with something as simple as correct translations and pronunciations.                   Over the past 16 years, we’ve seen the number of journalists of Arab and Middle Eastern descent working in the Western media grow significantly. There’s also more diversity in the type of media outlets [Middle Easterners] are a part of, from local TV stations and newspapers to occupying senior positions at national and international news outlets. But we still need more. Simply being in the room makes a difference and results in improved reporting.         Is the level of bias that you see in the Western press unprecedented? What’s the difference this time?              What is sad this time is that the [offending] comments came so casually, spontaneously, and as a result, revealed existing bias, something we would expect a journalist covering an international event to be above.                  Sadly, we were not shocked. The remarks got some attention thanks to social media, but we knew this kind of bias and racism exists.         How seriously do you think news outlets are taking these claims of bias?               I think public pressure will have some impact. I also expect that many organizations truly want to do the right thing.                  We have called on newsrooms to train correspondents on the cultural and political nuances of regions they’re reporting on, and not rely on American- or Euro-centric biases.       Do you think now that Western journalists have covered a European war they will be more sympathetic to victims of Middle Eastern wars?               To be honest, I don’t think it even matters whether or not they do. We are just asking journalists to be journalists and do a good job of reporting without inserting their own biases into the story and making unnecessary comparisons.        The transcript has been edited for length and clarity Saudi Arabia ready to mediate between all parties on Russia-Ukraine               Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received a phone from Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday and offered to mediate talks between Moscow and Kyiv.      Iran says it can reach top oil output two months after nuclear deal              If a nuclear deal is reached, Iran will be able to ramp up its oil production to max capacity in less than two months, Oil Minister Javad Owji was quoted as saying on Thursday.      Up to 20,000 Ukrainian tourists stuck in Egypt, awaiting return to Europe               As many as 20,000 Ukrainian tourists are stranded in Egypt as the Ukrainian embassy in Cairo arranges to fly them to Europe. They are mainly residing by the Red Sea resorts, said Ukrainian diplomat Yevhen Zhupeyev in a news conference in Cairo.       As part of our commitment to safeguarding the #ArabianLeopard, today, on #ArabianLeopardDay, the 10th of February, let's together build and share awareness for the plight of these Critically Endangered majestic cats.             Human intervention has led to the number of Arabian leopards in Saudi Arabia to dwindle to less than 200. The kingdom is now trying to change that.                  Saudi Arabia last month launched an awareness campaign to shed light on the critically endangered feline, as authorities work with conservationists to safeguard the remaining leopards.                  The smallest member of the leopard family, Arabian leopards arrived in the northern Arabian mountains almost 500,000 years ago, the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) says on its website.                  The Saudi city of AlUla is one of the oldest cities in the Arabian Peninsula and has become a hub for the kingdom’s heritage.                  Humans are the main cause driving the animals towards extinction, said the commission.                   “The expanded human presence has reduced and fragmented the Arabian leopards’ habitat,” the RCU wrote in an awareness brochure, adding that conflict between communities raising livestock in the area and the leopards’ attempts to prey on the herders’ animals lead to humans either attacking or even hunting the leopards.                   In an effort to boost awareness, Saudi Arabia marked its first ‘Arabian Leopard Day’ on February 10, where it lit up landmarks with photos of the endangered cats with the hashtag #ArabianLeopardDay. In 2019, it launched a global fund to finance conservation projects, and last September saw the birth of a rare female cub in a captive-breeding program in the city of Taif.                  Arabian leopards emerged from Africa and hold symbolism for the peninsula’s population. The commission says there may be less than 50 adult leopards left in the country. There are also few remaining in Oman and Yemen, with the last sighting in Saudi Arabia dating as far back as 2014.                  Conservation projects have also been underway in Oman since 2014, where a leopard community has taken refuge in the mountains of Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve.                  In Yemen, dire conditions resulting from ongoing war have led to neglect, with posts on social media showing the wild cats either dead or captured.      Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.             “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed.” These were the words of Ukraine’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze, during a recent BBC interview about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.                 It wasn’t so much what he said, it was more what was implied; that not all lives have equal value. And that idea – the belief that some races are superior to others – is a fundamental principle of racism. It’s alarming to me that Sakvarelidze was left unchallenged during his interview.                   As a Black, African woman without the benefit of blue eyes or blonde hair, it’s been equally emotional to see the number of racist and ignorant comments in the coverage on Ukraine that have passed unchallenged by the interviewers and media platforms that have aired them. CBS, Aljazeera, France’s BFM TV and ITV have all reported the invasion in ways that illustrate deep bias, informed by a belief system that screams of an old-world, White-led, order.                  ITV News correspondent Lucy Watson on ITV reporting back to the studio summed up the collective hypocrisy and underlying narrative that the Ukrainian war has exposed when she said: “The unthinkable has happened…this is not a developing, third-world nation; this is Europe!”     We can't ignore the darker sides of global unity on war in Ukraine             According to the narrative she believes, “unthinkable things” happen only in “third world nations” (now an outdated and derogatory term, someone should tell her), and that narrative is perpetuated by the type of stories she and many like her, have heard about the continent.                  In Africa, it’s the stories of conflict in Ethiopia, insurgency in Mozambique, election violence in Uganda, and the recent coups in Mali, Chad, Guinea, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Guinea Bissau. But it’s clear that far too many are not paying attention to them because the people in these stories are not rich or from the Global North.                  It’s the reason why the ‘unthinkable things’ that happen in places like Africa are typically reported in terms of issues, numbers and trends – rather than the people, the emotions and the lives destroyed. In Africa our stories tend to offer simplistic analysis that lacks context and nuance, and prioritizes headline-grabbing proclamations, like this one from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about an “an epidemic of coup d’états” in response to the six coups in five out of 54 African countries over an 18-month period.                    These examples have shown us that global media is complicit in perpetuating racist narratives, by not encouraging diversity in its newsrooms and giving an unrestricted platform to reporters and influential spokespeople with implicit biases that are left unchallenged. But rather than dwelling on this, I want to share some of the facts that should make us all rethink the traditional and stereotypical ways we dismiss non-White, non-rich countries and their people.                  The traditional world order is undergoing a dramatic shift, driven by Covid-19, China, Russia, and movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter. The new world order is providing an opportunity for the world to rethink the little they know about the rest of the world.                   By 2050, Nigeria will overtake the United States as the world’s third-most-populous country with a population of 400 million people. That’s one reason enough to pay attention. Africa’s population is growing rapidly and experts predict it will account for half the world’s people growth in the next two decades.              This means that more than a quarter of the world’s population will be on just one continent – Africa. The thought that the world will be overrun by Africans (no blue eyes or blonde hair here) will be an uncomfortable idea for some people, especially if they are unaware of the roughly 125,000 millionaires, 6,200 multimillionaires, 275 centimillionaires, and 22 billionaires that exist on the continent today.      As the granddaughter and daughter of Jews who escaped Kyiv, I cannot remain silent now             Indeed, a report by the University of Southern California in 2019, highlighted how poorly Africa is depicted in the US. It also revealed that Americans seldom see mentions of Africa or Africans on TV entertainment shows or in the news.                  When they do, the portrayals are often negative and stereotyped. According to the report, most mentions of Africa (43%) appeared on national or local news and tended to be ‘hard’ news stories which often fed the stereotype. After politics (32%), crime received the most mentions (16%), while business and the economy accounted for just 8% of news coverage.                   Over 60 research papers, reports, books, academic journals that we analyzed from the year 2000 written on Africa in the media told us that poverty, conflict, corruption, disease and poor leadership were the five frames through which most stories are told about Africa.                  This persistent portrayal of a single story is the reason why over the years, Africans have fought back with hashtags like #TheAfricaTheMediaNeverShowsYou  and #SomeoneTellCNN over a 2015 CNN report describing Kenya as a “hotbed of terror,” for which it later amended. And organizations like Africa No Filter, which set out to shift stereotypical narratives about Africa, were created.  It’s the reason why the Twittersphere erupted recently when journalist Alan Macleod put together his greatest hits of racist coverage of the Ukraine invasion – thank you, Alan!                  Contrary to what negative media portrayals might have you believe, Africa actually has some of the world’s fastest-growing economies. For example, to most of the world, Rwanda is synonymous with its 1994 genocide. But with an average GDP growth predicted of 6.7 between 2021-2025, it is in the top five of the fastest-growing economies alongside India. Rwanda has been able to attract foreign direct investment and is one of the easiest places to do business in Africa (after Mauritius) according to a World Bank index. This means Rwanda and countries like Seychelles, Mauritius, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Kenya are worth considering as potential destinations for investment, not just development dollars.      'He has decided to destroy the whole world': Six global voices on Putin's invasion of Ukraine             Don’t ignore the data that shows that there are more than 400 companies that earn annual revenues of $1 billion or more in Africa, or that the second fastest-growing tourism market in the world is right here in Africa.                   It’s also unlikely that many in the Global North will know any of this because it doesn’t fit the narrative both have been fed about non-white, ‘third world countries.’                 The fastest-growing developer community and tech start-up ecosystem in the world is in Africa. Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania are ranked in the top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. This means they have some of the highest grass-roots adoptions of cryptocurrencies in the world. In fact, Kenya has been ranked first in the world when it comes to peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. Given all this digital activity, it is hardly surprising that Africa is one of the fastest-growing markets in terms of venture capital activities and financial technology.                  Africa is also regarded as the world’s second-fastest-growing and profitable payments and banking market after Latin America, according to this McKinsey study.                 The reality is that much of what is happening in Africa today is unexpected. For example, six countries; Namibia, Cape Verde, Ghana, South Africa, Burkina Faso, and Botswana have a higher Press Freedom Index rating than the USA, according to Reporters Without Borders.                 But that doesn’t fit the persistent image of a broken continent where nothing works, and where its sad, dependent people lack agency to make a change. The truth is there is new dynamic energy and entrepreneurial spirit on the continent which is a story that is largely untold, and its evidenced by the low esteem with which those in the Global North hold us.

View more opinion articles on CNN.             Russia’s unjust invasion of Ukraine is a tragedy, and its stark consequences are being played out for the entire world. As events have unfolded, the media has rightly presented the conflict as a human rights catastrophe that inspires a unified global solidarity. But many Black and brown activists and observers, myself included, are also expressing this solidarity – while critiquing the apparent double standard and racial bias evident in both media coverage of and social media response to images of largely White Ukrainians engaged in violent resistance against Russian forces.                  Western coverage of the war has highlighted how scenes of death emanating from Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine are made all the more horrifying because, “They seem just like us.” One CBS news segment went viral, primarily for all the wrong reasons, after the reporter opined that  the “relatively civilized, relatively European” country of Ukraine was not where one expected to see such heartbreaking chaos.                  That correspondent, Charlie D’Agata, issued an apology, saying, “I spoke in a way I regret, and for that I am sorry,” noting his words were an attempt to convey that Ukraine – unlike other countries – hadn’t seen “this scale of war” in recent years.                   On the BBC, Ukraine’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor described the scenes of carnage in starkly racialized terms, explaining that, “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blond hair and blue eyes being killed.”  A commentator on Al-Jazeera opined that the Ukranian refugees were not mere exiles from the Middle East or North Africa: “They look like any European family you would live next door to.”                  On French television, the attacks on Ukraine have been depicted as an unimaginable assault on “a European city” unworthy of such a transgression. In Britain, The Daily Telegraph interpreted the Russian invasion as nothing less than an attack on “civilisation itself.” One reporter on UK television noted, “This is not a developing, third world nation; this is Europe!” as if to highlight the incongruence of events that, although apparently more routine when happening in the darker parts of the world, should not occur in areas where predominantly White populations reside.                  The cumulative sum of the coverage evokes patterns of racial bias that prioritize the lives, well-being and futures of White victims of war – too often at the expense of Black lives.                   The Arab and Middle East Journalists Association (AMEJA) released a statement condemning what it called “orientalist and racist” coverage, asserting that it’s been casting largely White victims of violence, death and suffering as more worthy of the world’s moral empathy and political assistance than people of color around the world experiencing similar crises.      Refugee tells CNN he was told they were 'not allowing Blacks' to board train             The racial framing of media coverage of the crisis in Ukraine also elides the very real plight faced by Africans and others in the war-ravaged nation.      Students, immigrants and others from Africa (or who are of African descent), India and Pakistan who have been trying to flee report being delayed, sent to the back of the line or outright rejected, primarily because of their skin color. Representatives from Kenya, Ghana and Gabon – three African nations who belong to the United Nations Security Council – have lodged formal complaints alleging racism at the border where Africans living in Ukraine have sought refuge.                  “The mistreatment of African peoples on Europe’s borders needs to cease immediately, whether to the Africans fleeing Ukraine or to those crossing the Mediterranean,” Martin Kimani, the Kenyan Ambassador to the UN, said Monday. Kimani’s words were echoed by the Ghanaian Deputy Ambassador to the UN, Carolyn Oppong-Ntiri who pleaded that humanitarian aid be directed equitably toward Africans affected by this crisis, “including medical care in line with the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality.”                  The “just like us” tenor of the coverage underscores the uncanny power of race to both implicitly and explicitly shape intellectual analysis, political calculations and moral judgements.                  It also betrays a poor sense of history. The idea that, in contrast to Iraq and Afghanistan, which are presumably used to ceaseless conflicts, Europe is a bastion of peace and civility is absurd. Any student of 20th-century global history, especially as it relates to the carnage of the First and Second World War, will appreciate just how wrongheaded such sentiment is.      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              The posture of surprise over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also ignores the complicity of recent American leadership – former President Trump’s sycophantic relationship to Vladimir Putin, which in certain instances marveled at the Russian leader’s autocratic tendencies as a sign of laudable strength.                   There is some hope to be found in the United Nations’ admission that racism has hindered access to care for African and non-White refugees. No problem can be solved without first being confronted.                  The global crisis of racism, inequity and anti-immigrant xenophobia might seem secondary to the violence of the conflict in Ukraine but in truth, they are inextricable concerns. Russia’s assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty reflects the growing strength of autocratic leaders, such as Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. Similarly, the treatment of African refugees in Ukraine in the context of war illustrates the xenophobia and racial intolerance that has fueled Brexit and aspects of the anti-globalization and nationalist movements that have flourished over the past decade.                 One of the most important lessons of Russia’s war against Ukraine is that the whole world continues to watch, respond to and take cues from not only American and Western power, but more tellingly, the power of our example. No single ethnic, racial or religious group has a greater capacity for civilization, personal dignity or citizenship than others. Now is the time to stand with all Ukrainians, immigrants and refugees seeking refuge from the storm of war.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

As the granddaughter and daughter of Jews who escaped Kyiv early enough to evade the barbaric Babyn Yar massacre in 1941, when more than 33,000 Jews were shot to death by Nazi forces, my DNA is ingrained with the call to protect the Jewish people.                  To think that 80 years later, Russian forces would strike the area of the Babyn Yar memorial site and desecrate the memories of the Jews who were murdered there, is sickening.                   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rightfully tweeted, “To the world: What is the point of saying never again for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar?”                 I will not stay silent and sit back as these atrocities play out before our eyes.

When my grandfather, a tank commander in the Red Army, received advance intelligence that the Jews in Kyiv would be massacred, he mobilized his military resources and smuggled my grandmother and father to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia, where they remained until 1945.      Oppose the Ukraine war without feeding racial stereotypes             They were fortunate to have a path toward survival carved out by my grandfather, who went on to lead a brigade to liberate Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust. And despite being a Jew, he became a national war hero and received the Order of Lenin in 1954.                  Now, with Russia seemingly targeting innocent civilians in Kharkiv’s central square, and the 40-mile long Russian convoy approaching Kyiv, the United Nations estimates that more than 800,000 refugees have already evacuated Ukraine since the outbreak of war. Many of these refugees are women and children torn apart from their husbands, fathers and brothers who remain in Ukraine, banded in their determination to protect their land and defend their democratic values.                  It seems history is repeating itself less than one century later, and the heartbreak I feel stems from the understanding that this unprovoked conflict, started by yet another dangerous man, will lead to so much unnecessary suffering.                  To remain indifferent is not an option. We all have a moral obligation to halt this tragic suffering through an outpouring of humanitarian aid to the innocent refugees and victims.                  It is also critical that we all become students of history – to expose evil, to shame the dark forces of bigotry and anti-Semitism that still persist, to call out Russian President Vladimir Putin for attacking civilians and to protect the innocent children in Ukraine who are caught in the crossfire of his disturbed ambitions.      The world condemns Putin's war             It is not lost on me that Putin has tried to rewrite history and justify this war with the unhinged assertion that he is trying to “denazify” Ukraine. To invade a nation led by a proud Jewish man – and then to strike, intentionally or not, the area of a Holocaust memorial site honoring the death of thousands upon thousands of Jews is as far from “denazification” as one could imagine.                  Zelensky is Jewish. His grandfather, who fought in the Soviet Union’s Red Army during World War II, lost three of his brothers to Nazis. And out of the dark ashes of the Holocaust, the Jewish President of Ukraine is leading the emergence of a global front united against Putin’s unjustified war.                  And despite Putin’s misinformation and propaganda campaigns, Ukrainians are taking to social media to capture the reality of the Russian invasion. I personally know how powerful social media can be.                  In October 2018, I launched my own watchdog organization to combat anti-Semitism. Three weeks later, an anti-Semite killed 11 innocent Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Because I already had a strong social media following, my nascent organization’s response to that massacre exploded on social media. Since then, I haven’t stopped leveraging the power of social media to expose and hold anti-Semites publicly accountable. In the last week, we’ve seen the power of TikTok and other social media platforms as Ukrainians capture what they’re seeing and experiencing on the ground.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              And for all of us around the world watching this horrific war unfold, amplifying the truth on social media is critical, but it is not enough. To meet the needs of Ukraine’s exploding humanitarian crisis, we must take action to protect the innocent children and civilians whose lives have been upended by war.                 As Zelensky pleaded to the European Union, “We have a desire to see our children alive. I think it’s a fair one.”                  The children of Ukraine and the Jewish orphans from Odessa need our help. Let us all show up for them.       © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

On the surface, the US commando raid in Syria that left ISIS chief Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi dead may look like a game-changer, but experts warn the resurgence of the group is likely to press on undeterred.                   “Thanks to the bravery of our troops, this horrible terrorist leader is no more,” declared US President Joe Biden, hours after the end of the operation that targeted Qurayshi in the Syrian rebel enclave of Idlib.                    Biden may have hoped for the same fanfare that greeted his predecessors when they took out ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before him. But ISIS experts were quick to throw cold water on claims of a significant blow to the group. Qurayshi is no Baghdadi, and a group that once commanded a piece of territory bigger than the United Kingdom is now a guerrilla insurgency with its leadership scattered.                   But the group that delivered genocide, mass execution and oppression has proven that it remains a formidable force. A United Nations report released Friday said the terror group is far from vanquished. In fact, it remains a potent force in Iraq and Syria, with a growing presence in Afghanistan and West Africa, according to the UN analysis.                 The report – compiled by UN experts on ISIS and al Qaeda before Qurayshi’s death and covering the last six months of 2021 – said ISIS may still have up to $50 million in its coffers.                   Even before his demise, according to the UN experts, ISIS had lost several important members of its senior echelon. And yet the group remains a threat. Instability in both Iraq and Syria “indicate that an eventual ISIL resurgence in the core region cannot be ruled out,” the report concludes, referring to the group by its alternate acronym.     Related articleISIS leader killed in US raid had dark past but spent years under the radar             In Iraq, ISIS stages attacks on an almost daily basis. In Lebanon, officials says it has found fertile recruiting ground in the city of Tripoli. And the United Nations says ISIS may still have $50 million in its coffers and up to 10,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq.                   Last week ISIS launched its biggest attack in three years when the group’s fighters attempted to free inmates from a prison in northeast Syria.  It lost the week-long standoff, and hundreds of ISIS inmates, including children, as well as scores of US-backed Kurdish fighters, died in the fighting.                  The uptick in ISIS violence has the region’s security officials on edge, precisely because the picture is murkier  than it was in ISIS’ heyday, when the group seized Mosul in 2014. Then, a US-led coalition, as well as Iran-backed Shia armed groups, fought years-long battles that ultimately led ISIS territory to vaporize. Now ISIS is virtually invisible. Its spread is detectable but appears to not have a single source.                    For that reason, the US raid – as dazzling as the optics may have been to some – raises more questions than it answers. What was the ISIS leader doing in Idlib, where the group’s ostensible rivals Hay’at Tahrir al Sham, a former al Qaeda affiliate, dominates? How was he able to command cells further afield in Syria and Iraq?                     Far from reassuring observers and security officials, the devil in the details of Thursday’s operation seems to confirm what experts have been saying for months: Qurayshi was the head of a snake, but it will require a lot more sophistication and international cooperation to exterminate the pit from which he came.

She is the co-founder of The Three Hijabis and a Labour councillor for Oxford city council. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.              French lawmakers last month voted to ban women and girls from wearing hijab while playing sports – showing the world once again that when it comes to further politicizing, targeting and policing European Muslim women, our clothing choices and bodies, France is in a league of its own.                 The French Senate voted 160 to 143 in favor of the ban on wearing the hijab and other “conspicuous religious symbols” in sports competitions. The amendment was proposed by the right-wing Les Républicains, which argued the hijab could risk the safety of athletes wearing it while playing sports.                 You really couldn’t make this up.                 In France, Muslim women using their agency, and exercising their human rights to wear what they choose to wear, is deemed a safety risk. France’s attempt to apparently liberate and save Muslim women from ourselves and our headscarves is a racist and colonial project dressed up as upholding the country’s secular values. The project heaps Islamophobic harm on Muslim women.                 Indeed, it is misogynistic and hateful to force women to remove hijab – as much as it is misogynistic and hateful to force women to wear hijab.                 The proposed ban is opposed by Emmanuel Macron’s government and French lawmakers expressed “regret” over the government’s “lack of will” to put a stop to what they describe as the “development of Islamism in sport,” CNN reported. It comes against the backdrop of a forthcoming presidential election in April, where France’s domestic politics continue to lurch further to the right, and many Muslim residents and communities of color are being subjected to divisive and toxic political rhetoric on Islam, immigration and race.                  In just two years, France is also hosting the Olympics, meant to bring nations together in a united show of inclusivity on the world stage. A divisive and discriminatory hijab ban only shines a further spotlight on how ill at ease France is with building a modern multiculturalism state.                  The proposed law will now be revised by the National Assembly, which is expected to have the final word. All of which means that, for now, Muslim women playing sports in hijab have been given extra time to do so with the bill prevented from being passed in its current state.      How mega clubs deal with sexual abuse allegations is bigger than sport              France is home to roughly 5.7 million Muslims and the largest Muslim population in Europe, according to the Pew Research Center. As of 2019, 31% of French Muslim women were wearing hijab, according to Statista, so this sports ban will have a profound impact on many women. Yet again, French lawmakers have chosen to continue on a dangerous collision course with the country’s Muslim population and especially French Muslim women.                 The attempts to ban Muslim women from wearing hijab while playing sports is viewed by many Muslim women and activists I’ve spoken to as taking a page straight out of the Afghan Taliban and Iranian regime’s playbook by denying women their own agency. This ban is viewed as being about much more than denying women the right to play sports, if that wasn’t outrageous enough.                  The sports hijab ban is about further dehumanizing, minimizing and erasing French Muslim women who choose to wear hijab. It makes Muslim women targets of state-sanctioned gendered Islamophobia and right-wing hate.                  I’m one of three British Muslim women campaigners and passionate football fans calling ourselves “The Three Hijabis.” Last summer, alongside Amna Abdullatif and Huda Jawad, I launched a viral petition calling on England’s Football Association, the British government and tech companies, to work on banning racists from football for life, following the abuse inflicted on three young Black England players after the Euro finals at Wembley against Italy.                  The campaign has garnered 1.2 million signatures. Within 48 hours of our petition launching, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stood in parliament committing his government to working on delivering our demands.                 Our campaign made headlines in the UK and received global media attention. However, if we were three French Muslim women, we likely would not have been permitted to enter the country’s mainstream public or political space in the same way – simply because we wear hijab.     This is what victory at the Beijing Games looks like              It’s a stark contrast I have experienced first-hand. In 2015, I presented a BBC documentary about what it means to be young, French and Muslim in France following the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in Paris. As part of the documentary, I went to the French parliament to interview Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, France’s youngest ever elected woman politician and the niece of far-right leader, Marion Le Pen.                 I was told I couldn’t enter the parliament building because of my hijab. I explained that I was a journalist, there to interview a politician. Yes, I’m a Muslim woman wearing hijab, but I’m also British – “I’m as British as fish and chips,” I told the receptionist in the hope she would understand that my hijab was irrelevant to how I do my job. The receptionist looked horrified and confused and then told me I could proceed for my interview.                  In Europe, there is a tried-and-tested winning formula for politicians hoping to appeal to voters on the right-wing fringes ahead of national elections. And that involves turning Muslim women and our clothing choices into a political football. Many a populist European politician in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Netherlands and Switzerland, and of course France, has used this tactic as a way of attracting voters. They delve into Muslim women’s wardrobes and pull out hijab, niqab and burqa as exhibits supposedly threatening the very fabric of western values and way of life.                 In France, we have of course been here before. Multiple times. In 2004, France banned the wearing of hijab in schools alongside Christian crosses and the yarmulkes, worn by observant Jews. The ban was imposed, so the state said, on the grounds that state institutions are supposed to be “religiously neutral.”     Then in 2010, France became the first country in Europe to impose a ban on full face veils, known as the niqab, in public spaces including public transport and parks, streets and administrative buildings. Women caught wearing a niqab in public space face a 150 euro fine and being arrested by the police.      French lawmakers have proposed a hijab ban in competitive sports. The impact on women could be devastating.              In 2016, authorities across 15 towns and municipalities across France banned the “burkini” – an all-in-one modest swimsuit that covers the whole body except the face. Again, the ban was imposed to supposedly uphold France’s secular values.                 And in May 2020, when France, like many countries across Europe and the world, made face masks mandatory in some settings like public transport to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus, France’s full face veil ban remained in place. Meaning, while French citizens were required to cover their faces by law, French Muslim women citizens covering their faces with the niqab continued to face the prospect of being fined and arrested by police.                 In 2018, the United Nations Human Rights Committee said France’s ban was a violation of religion and could impact Muslim women by “confining them to their homes, impeding their access to public services and marginalizing them.”                 When it comes to hijab and how Muslim women choose to dress, there is widespread cognitive dissonance in the French republic, illustrated once again in fine fashion by a recent Instagram post by Vogue France hailing actor Julia Fox’s arrival at Paris Men’s Fashion Week while wearing a Balenciaga trench coat, with a black headscarf, sunglasses and the caption: “Yes to the headscarf!”                 The post attracted widespread criticism from Muslim women and others pointing out the double standard of a white, wealthy, famous, American actress being praised for wearing a headscarf as a fashion choice – while a French Muslim woman choosing to wear a headscarf in her own country faces restrictions on her life choices and movements and possibly being fined and criminalized by the state. Vogue France later deleted the Instagram post.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook              This is the hypocrisy that France must grapple with.

An apology followed, along with a two-week suspension – but the controversy has forced deeper questions about the history and evolution of race and identity in the US.                  Goldberg made her comments during a conversation about a Tennessee school board that removed Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel series “Maus,” about the horrors and trauma of the Holocaust, because of alleged concerns about “rough, objectionable language” and nudity.                 Swiftly, various groups pointed out as false the actor and comedian’s assertion that the genocide of 6 million Jews had nothing to do with race.                 “Racism was central to Nazi ideology. Jews were not defined by religion, but by race. Nazi racist beliefs fueled genocide and mass murder,” the US Holocaust Museum wrote in an apparent subtweet.                 The Auschwitz Memorial Twitter account directed Goldberg to a “seven-chapter online course” about the Holocaust.                 To better contextualize the events of the past week, I spoke with Emily Tamkin, who’s a senior editor at The New Statesman and the author of two books: 2020’s “The Influence of Soros: Politics, Power and the Struggle for an Open Society” and the forthcoming “Bad Jews: A History of American Jewish Politics and Identities.”                 The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.     When you heard Whoopi Goldberg’s comments, what were your thoughts?             My first reaction was that I think that she’s probably one of many people, specifically one of many Americans, who thinks this. And I say that because I think that the US has a very specific conception of race and racism. And people can, without ill intention, assume that that construct is held across time and space – that because this is what racism has always meant in the US, it’s necessarily been understood the same way elsewhere.                 But while racism is real and has real implications for people, it, like race, is shaped around society – and by society.                 I think that it’s important to recognize that her comments were coming from a place of ignorance, not hatred. That distinction matters, and I hope that we can keep it in mind in these discussions.     Why do many Americans appear to struggle to understand the relationship between antisemitism and racism? Does it have anything to do with the history of race here?             If you go back to the 1790 Naturalization Act, the criterion for naturalizing as a US citizen was Whiteness. I think that some people think that Jews “became White” in the postwar period and as we moved into the suburbs and through the GI Bill. Many American Jews did move into what we think of as mainstream American suburban life at that time. But most American Jews, for most of American history, have been legally coded as White.                 Now, there were exceptions. For example, there was a stipulation in the state of Maryland’s constitution until 1826 that said that Jews cannot hold public office. And there were instances of antisemitism throughout that period, particularly at the turn of the century, when more and more Jews from Eastern Europe started coming over and there was an influx of immigrants. But most American Jews have enjoyed Whiteness under the law.                 If you look at my great-grandparents, under the census around the turn of the century – the early 1900s – they were recorded as White. Also around that same time, there were many more Jewish immigrants coming in, and that was actually an issue, because the status of American Jews as White was challenged, because here came people who were far greater in number and further culturally removed, and they thought of themselves as ethnically distinct. And the US didn’t really have a framework to process them, because it thought in terms of Black and White.     Related article'It is really dizzying for our community': Growing antisemitism forcing Jewish Americans to be more vigilant             Now, interestingly, you had Jewish thinkers and some communal leaders at that time who were very intentional about defending Jews as White. Why? Because they understood that in the US, Whiteness brings with it rights and privileges. That remained true, by the way, even though in the ’20s, immigration legislation was passed that restricted immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe.                 That’s the US context. You had this one understanding of racism really shaped around White and Black, and people, many of whom came from somewhere else where the thinking was different, were being slotted into that. Meanwhile, an ocean away, you had Nazi Germany, where the construction was just different, where Adolf Hitler was writing very specifically about the “German race” and the necessity of racial purity and the superiority of “Aryan blood.” And, by the way, it wasn’t only Jews whom Hitler thought of as racially distinct. He also drew a distinction between Germans and Slavs. We might look at all that and say, “They’re all White people.” But, again, it was a different context, so the understanding of race was different.                 Recent discussions have raised the question of the Whiteness of Jews. What I’d say to that is, one, not all Jews are White, but also, in my day-to-day in the US, I go about as a White woman. If we were in Europe in the early 20th century, I would’ve been understood differently.     The Tennessee school district’s decision to pull Art Spiegelman’s “Maus” exists in the same environment in which laws are empowering school districts across the country to ban a variety of books related to identity and histories of oppression. What do you make of all this?             I think that it’s really important that the ban of this book is considered within this broader context. You have “Maus” being banned. You have the report out of Southlake, Texas, where a school leader said – a superintendent later apologized – that if you teach about the Holocaust, then you also need to teach “opposing” views. Which: I don’t even know what that means. You have Toni Morrison’s work being banned. You have LGBTQ books being challenged.                 To me, what stands out is that you have school board members and legislators and parents saying: “Well, we just don’t want our kids hearing this language at a young age.” And: “We want our kids to be proud of the US – to be proud of their history.” All of this made me remember that when I was around 9 years old, somebody drew a swastika on a bathroom stall at my school. I’m sure that my parents didn’t want me to encounter that when I was 9. I’m sure that your parents would’ve liked for you to encounter racism later in life than you did. I’m sure that the children who are working through their sexuality or whose parents are members of the LGBTQ community have questions and would like to have access to materials.                 I’m not equating being Jewish in the US with being Black in the US or with being gay in the US. I’m saying that there’s so little regard for anything that challenges the feelings of White Christian straight America – and so little regard for the feelings of any other parents or their children. I don’t think that that’s conducive to educating kids, and it’s certainly not conducive to teaching history, because what this discussion really gets at is the fact that these are complicated, messy issues, and that history is nuanced – but that learning it is what will help us grapple with the world around us today.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

He was an Iraqi religious scholar and was a driving force behind the group’s brutal persecution of Yazidis.,"Feb 4, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Tim Lister,International,"In the early hours of Thursday morning, the head of ISIS died during a US raid in northwest Syria just as the extremist group was in the midst of a revival.                  Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi killed himself and his family after igniting a bomb at the beginning of the operation, according to a senior Pentagon official.                  Qurayshi succeeded ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019 after his demise. When Qurayshi took over the organization, the vast swathes of territory the group controlled – an area larger than the size of the United Kingdom at its peak – had largely vaporized. Observers dubbed him a Caliph without a Caliphate. Yet he sought to reinvigorate the organization.                  In recent months, he oversaw a resurgence of ISIS in various parts of Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Iraq reported an uptick in violence linked to ISIS. In the Kurdish-controlled northeastern part of Syria, the group staged a lethal days-long attempted jail break in a bid to free ISIS members. Hundreds of inmates, including children, died. Scores of Kurdish fighters also perished in the clashes.                  In Lebanon, multiple regional and local reports have indicated that the group has been recruiting scores of  members from the northern city of Tripoli, one of the areas hardest hit by the country’s devastating economic crisis.                  Throughout it all, Qurayshi – who was known by several aliases – kept a low profile, much like his predecessor. The US Rewards for Justice program offered a reward of $10 million for information about him. His history in the organization is also murky. But snippets from interviews with ISIS prisoners paint a picture of a man with a dark past as a member of Baghdadi’s inner-most circle.                  Qurayshi became a “religious scholar” with al Qaeda in Iraq, before the group rebranded itself as the Islamic State. In 2014, he “helped drive and justify the abduction, slaughter, and trafficking of the Yazidi religious minority in northwest Iraq,” the Rewards for Justice notice says.                  Much of the Yazidi community lived in an area close to what some analysts believe was Qurayshi’s home town of Tal Afar in northern Iraq. In 2014, after ISIS had taken Tal Afar and Mosul, the group enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and children and murdered thousands of Yazidi men, in what the United Nations has called a genocide.                  The Commission for International Justice and Accountability, an NGO that investigates and gathers evidence of major international crimes such as terrorism, said Qurayshi was “one of the key architects of the Islamic State slave trade in Yazidi women and children.”                 “He personally enslaved and raped captive women,” said Nerma Jelacic, the group’s deputy director.                  Counter-terrorism expert Daniele Raineri has noted that he was “the deputy who managed to spend the years since 2010 almost totally under the radar.” But when others in the ISIS hierarchy were taken or died in battle, he became one of the group’s leading ideologues.                  In a 2018 interview with Saudi-owned al Arabiya, a senior ISIS detainee in Iraq, Ismael al Eithawi called Qurayshi “the most prominent of Baghdadi’s surrounding circle.”                  A 2018 internal ISIS document repeatedly describes Qurayshi as “the deputy” to Baghdadi. He died in an operation similar to that which killed Baghdadi. And it is yet unclear if the operation will stem the group’s resurgence or if the cycle of extremist violence will continue undeterred.                  ISIS has not acknowledged his death and it’s as yet unclear who may replace him. Few if any of Baghdadi’s inner circle are thought to be still at large.

At that moment, he quickly realized the atrocities his family survived were unknown to many.                 The other boy drew the symbol without knowing its meaning simply because it caught his eye, said Igel, who is now 41 years old.                 Decades after that encounter, Igel and many other Jewish people in America are reminded in 2022 that ignorance and intolerance continue fueling perceptions about their communities. In recent weeks, a hostage standoff in Texas, vandalism at two Chicago synagogues, flyers with anti-Semitic language being distributed in several states and even “The View” host Whoopi Goldberg’s comments on the Holocaust have made Jewish people more vigilant and highlighted a “growing crisis” in the United States, experts and Jewish advocates said.     Related articleAs a Holocaust survivor, I'm deeply saddened by Whoopi Goldberg's 'careless' words             “You see anti-Semitism coming at Jews from all sides,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). “It is really dizzying for our community, and it’s a growing crisis for the country.”                 Anti-Semitism persists nearly 80 years after an estimated six million Jewish people and five million others were killed as a result of the Nazis’ racist ideology during the Holocaust. Anti-Semitic incidents in the US have been on the rise for years, with 941 incidents in 2015 and 2024 incidents tracked in 2020 by the ADL.                 “These issues are happening in our houses of worship, and in the supermarkets where we shop and in the communities where we live,” said Greenblatt, adding that in-person incidents are only a portion of the hate, compared to the threats and harassment that happen online and is “a tremendous problem.”                 Although Greenblatt and others in the Jewish community have accepted Goldberg’s apology after she falsely declared on “The View” that the Holocaust was “not about race” this week, many still see it as a clear sign of the need for more education about the Holocaust.                 A 2020 survey of 11,000 Americans, commissioned by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, showed a “worrying lack of basic Holocaust knowledge” among adults under 40.                 More than half of respondents were not aware that six million Jews were killed, 48% could not name a concentration camp where Jews were taken during the Holocaust and 11% said they believed Jews caused it, according to the survey.                  Igel, who chairs the Florida Commissioner of Education’s Task Force on Holocaust Education and the board of The Florida Holocaust Museum, has made it one of his goals to fight for more education.                  “It’s on me, it’s on you because the survivors are no longer going to be here very soon,” he said.                 Igel’s grandparents were Polish farmers and got married the night Adolf Hitler invaded Poland. He says they would tell him stories about how various other farmers hid them and eventually helped them escape.                  “My grandfather had a thick accent you know, he would always say it was the worst in people but we always want you to know it was the best in people, too,” Igel said.                 For him, the Holocaust must be discussed and taught in schools because the “absence of these lessons leads to a lack of empathy.”                 Across the country, there are only 22 states that require some form of Holocaust education in K-12 schools, according to the US Holocaust Museum. The states’ mandates vary from annual Holocaust remembrance weeks to providing a manual to history and literature teachers that “emphasizes the causes and ramifications of the Holocaust and genocide.”                 But in recent months, there have been a number of controversies surrounding how the Holocaust is being taught and the materials used by teachers. In January, a Tennessee school board removed the graphic novel “Maus” by Art Spiegelman from the eighth-grade English language arts curriculum, citing “rough, objectionable language” and a drawing of a nude woman.      Related video'Maus' author reacts to his book being pulled from curriculum             “Maus,” which was initially serialized and then published in two volumes in 1986 and 1992, is a blend of historical fiction and memoir that follows Spiegelman’s Jewish parents in 1940s Poland, from their early experiences of anti-Semitism to their internment in Auschwitz. It depicts Jewish people as mice and Nazis as cats.                  Last year, a staff member at a Washington, DC, elementary school was investigated after allegedly telling third-grade students to reenact incidents from the Holocaust and a school administrator in Texas told teachers that if they have books about the Holocaust in their classroom libraries, they should also include books that present “opposing” views.             “It was the antisemitic, systematic murder of 6 million Jews and there is no legitimate ‘opposing’ perspective to that,” said Joel Schwitzer, regional director of the American Jewish Committee, Dallas.                 Security has become a concern for Jewish synagogues and the attack on worshippers at the Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas last month has led more Jewish leaders to seek help to keep their congregations safe.                 Evan R. Bernstein, the national director and CEO of Community Security Service, which trains volunteers to help secure synagogues and Jewish institutions, said he had been concerned that the Jewish community was not taking threats seriously because deadly shootings at synagogues in Poway, California, and Pittsburgh were no longer “top of mind.”                 A few weeks before the standoff in Texas, he says, some synagogues he had been in touch with did not appear to have an interest in taking “a deeper dive on security.”                 Since the standoff, the group has seen an increase in calls and has scheduled multiple trainings every night over the next month.                 “There’s been more and more investment in security in the different major cities and communities around the country but it needs to stay that way. I think there needs to be reminders and the reminder shouldn’t have to be a Colleyville,” Bernstein said.     Related articleJewish communities across the US are on heightened alert after the Texas standoff: 'Is our community under attack again?'             In the weeks since the standoff, a man was arrested after being accused of spray-painting swastikas on columns at Union Station, another man in Chicago is facing hate crime charges in connection with a series of antisemitic vandalism incidents at synagogues and Jewish schools, and  anti-Semitic flyers were distributed to homes in South Florida and at least five other states.                 While those incidents were not violent, Bernstein says, there’s been a continuation of the wave of anti-Semitism the country had seen in the years prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, which may have slowed down in-person incidents but continued being “rampant” online.                 For Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish community has been vigilant and resolute as they face anti-Semitism in various ways but only an interfaith and wider response is needed to stop hate and bigotry.                 “Just like I would say to you that racism is not simply an issue for Black Americans and it’s an issue for all Americans,” he said. “I would say anti-Semitism isn’t just a problem for the Jewish people. It’s an American problem that demands an American solution.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Riggs Kwong, 50, was off-duty when the incident occurred on January 16, according to a news release from the office of Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez.                 Kwong was charged with “third-degree assault as a hate crime, third-degree menacing as a hate crime, third-degree assault, third-degree menacing, second-degree aggravated harassment, falsely reporting an incident and improper use of colored or flashing lights,” according to the release.                  Kwong pleaded not guilty on Monday, the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office told CNN in an email. He has been released without bail and will return to court on March 22, the DA’s office said.                 Kwong was suspended from the NYPD following his arraignment, according to the department.                  He has been an officer with the NYPD for 18 years, according to his department profile.              CNN reached out to Kwong’s attorney, Thomas Tuffey, for comment but has not heard back.                 On January 16, Kwong blocked the victim from driving down Church Avenue, the DA statement said, citing an investigation. The victim then followed Kwong and drove in front of his car as he was turning onto a service road.                 Kwong then allegedly videotaped himself saying to the victim, “I’m trying to make a left here on the service road and this terrorist is terrorizing me, you’re upset because I didn’t let you make a U-turn, Mr. Mohammed … Al Qaeda, terrorist, ISIS…,” according to the press release.                  The victim exited his vehicle to take a picture of Kwong’s license plate and got back in his vehicle while Kwong continued to use racial slurs, according to the press release, and the victim once again exited his vehicle to slap the hood of Kwong’s vehicle.                  Kwong then exited his vehicle and allegedly spat in the victim’s face and the victim spat back. Kwong punched the victim several times, “causing him to fall to the ground and continued to punch him and use anti-Muslim language,” according to the press release.                  When the victim stood up, Kwong punched him again, causing him to fall and lose consciousness, the district attorney’s office alleges.                 Kwong called 911 and told the dispatcher, as well as NYPD officers who responded to the scene, that the victim threw the first punch, according to the press release.                  According to the Brooklyn DA’s office, video surveillance from the scene allegedly shows Kwong punching the victim “without the victim ever punching the defendant.”                 This case is being prosecuted by the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Hate Crimes Bureau.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Earlier this month, McMinn County, Tennessee, Board of Education removed the book from its eighth-grade English language arts curriculum, citing “rough, objectionable language” and a drawing of a nude woman.                 During the roundtable discussion, Goldberg said she was surprised that the nudity in “Maus” – and not the Holocaust itself – is what appeared to concern the school board, while co-host Joy Behar replied that the nudity concerns were likely “a canard to throw you off from the fact that they don’t like history that makes White people look bad.”                 “Well, this is White people doing it to White people, so y’all gonna fight amongst yourselves,” Goldberg said, referring to the Holocaust.                 While none of the co-hosts pushed back after that statement, the conversation then turned to how some are attempting to ban problematic parts of the nation’s history, particularly history dealing with race and racism, from being taught in schools.                 Goldberg responded: “If you’re going to do this, then let’s be truthful about it because the Holocaust isn’t about race.” She added that the Holocaust, which saw an estimated 6 million Jews and 5 million others killed as a result of the Nazis’ racist ideology, was about “man’s inhumanity to man” and said it involved “two White groups of people.”                 In a statement late Monday, Goldberg said she made an error with her comment.                 “On today’s show, I said the Holocaust “is not about race but about man’s inhumanity to man.” I should have said it is about both,” she wrote on Twitter.             “As Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League shared, “The Holocaust was about the Nazi’s systematic annihilation of the Jewish people – who they deemed to be an inferior race.” I stand corrected.”                 She added: “The Jewish people around the world have always had my support and that will never waiver. I’m sorry for the hurt I have caused.”                 While many Jewish people today are seen as White because of their skin tone, whether they should be characterized this way remains a subject of debate given that Jews across the world continue to face blatant anti-Semitism. In Nazi Germany, Jewish people were considered a “race” – the Nazis attributed many negative stereotypes about Jews to “an unchanging biologically determined heritage,” according to the US Holocaust Museum.                  During the show, when Goldberg again insisted that the Holocaust wasn’t about race, some of her co-hosts began challenging her statements.                 Behar responded that the Nazis considered Jews to be a different race, while Ana Navarro noted that the Holocaust was “about White supremacy” with the Nazis killing both Jewish and Roma people. Sara Haines added that the Nazis did not view Jews as White.                 Still, Goldberg continued to insist that the underlying issue was one of “how people treat each other” and the segment concluded shortly after.                 The segment captured the attention of the internet, with many Jewish leaders and institutions refuting Goldberg’s statements.                 “Racism was central to Nazi ideology,” the US Holocaust Museum wrote in a tweet shortly after Goldberg’s comments began circulating. “Jews were not defined by religion, but by race. Nazi racist beliefs fueled genocide and mass murder.”                 Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, also condemned Goldberg’s remarks and she used part of his comment in her statement of apology.                 “No @WhoopiGoldberg, the #Holocaust was about the Nazi’s systematic annihilation of the Jewish people – who they deemed to be an inferior race,” he said. “They dehumanized them and used this racist propaganda to justify slaughtering 6 million Jews. Holocaust distortion is dangerous.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Cohen, the top intelligence official at DHS.                  Online forums linked to domestic violent extremists have referenced Jewish targets tied to conspiracy theories about Covid-19, the outcome of the 2020 election and “even the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and resettlement of Afghans to the United States,” according to the letter obtained by CNN.                  The joint notice comes two days after the Colleyville, Texas, hostage standoff at Congregation Beth Israel, which the FBI is investigating as a terrorist incident.                  The investigation into Saturday’s incident is still in its “initial phases,” the officials said, adding that “while this appears to be an isolated incident, and there are currently no additional specific and credible threats associated with it, we will continue to monitor all reporting to ensure this incident is not a catalyst for similar attacks.”                   The officials pointed out that the US is in a period of “heightened threat,” which includes threats from domestic violent extremists and those inspired or motivated by foreign terrorists.                  The threat is exacerbated by a divided society and the global pandemic, according to the letter, which says that in some cases, social stressors and other personal factors have mixed with ideological issues, resulting in violence.                  “Foreign influence actors have also promoted narratives online intended to sow discord in the U.S. and foreign terrorist groups continue to encourage followers to conduct attacks and use social media to incite violence,” the letter notes.                  On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said DHS will work with Congress to increase funding so faith-based communities can upgrade their security and protect themselves against terrorism, hate crimes and targeted violence.                   Congregation Beth Israel was a recipient of DHS grant funding as part of the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, according to Mayorkas.                   Funding, which is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, can be used in several ways, such as enhancing physical security, installing cameras, hiring security guards and cybersecurity upgrades. Other grant funding goes toward prevention and response programs to equip communities to identify when individuals are moving down the path to violence.                  “This kind of threat did not begin when this attack started yesterday, and it will not end with the hostages free,” Mayorkas said during a media briefing.                  He said the “harsh reality” is that there continues to be a “rise in the language of hate and its connectivity to violence.”                  “We need to ensure that we not only protect our houses of worship and all places of assembly, but that we become aware of the signs that someone is going down a path toward violence,” Mayorkas told reporters.                   CNN reported last week that a year after the attack on the US Capitol, homeland security and law enforcement officials nationwide were bracing for potential “unprecedented” levels of violence in the year ahead.                  The country remains polarized, and many people are angry and frustrated about their individual selves or society’s conditions after two years of Covid-19 upheaval, turbulent economic conditions and government restrictions, sources and nongovernmental researchers told CNN.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Why is little being done to stop them?,"At a conference in India last month, a Hindu extremist dressed head-to-toe in the religion’s holy color, saffron, called on her supporters to kill Muslims and “protect” the country.","Jan 15, 2022",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Rhea Mogul,International,"At a conference in India last month, a Hindu extremist dressed head-to-toe in the religion’s holy color, saffron, called on her supporters to kill Muslims and “protect” the country.                  “If 100 of us become soldiers and are prepared to kill 2 million (Muslims), then we will win … protect India, and make it a Hindu nation,” said Pooja Shakun Pandey, a senior member of the right-wing Hindu Mahasabha political party, according to a video of the event.                  Her words and calls for violence from other religious leaders were met with a roar of applause from the large audience, a video from the three-day conference in the northern Indian city of Haridwar shows.                 But across India, people were outraged. Nearly a month on, many are still furious at the lack of government response or arrests over the comments, which they say highlights a worsening climate for the country’s Muslims.                  After mounting pressure, India’s top court intervened on Wednesday, asking for a response from state and federal authorities within 10 days.                 Pandey and several others are being investigated by local police for insulting religious beliefs, a charge that carries a possible sentence of up to four years in prison, Haridwar police officials told CNN.                 Neither Pandey, nor the others, have publicly commented about the outcry or investigations.                 Late Thursday, police in Uttarakhand state, where Haridwar is located, arrested a man who spoke at the event, senior Haridwar Police official Shekhar Suyal told CNN. It is unclear what the man said at the event. Police have not formally charged anyone with any crime.                  CNN has contacted India’s Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Hindu Mahasabha and Pandey, but has not received a response.     Related articleIn Hindu-nationalist India, Muslims risk being branded infiltrators in their own country             Analysts say the Hindu Mahasabha is at the tip of abroader trend in India which has seen an alarming rise in support for extremist Hindu nationalist groups since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power nearly eight years ago.                  Although these groups aren’t directly associated with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his own Hindu nationalist agenda, and the lack of repercussions for these groups’ previous vitriolic comments, has given them tacit support, making them even more brazen, analysts say.                   Analysts fear this rise poses a serious danger to minorities, especially Muslims – and worry it may only get worse as several Indian states head to the polls in the coming months.                  “What makes the Hindu Mahasabha dangerous,” said Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University near India’s capital, New Delhi, “is that they have been waiting for a moment like this in decades.”                 Founded in 1907 during British rule at a time of growing conflict between Muslims and Hindus in the country, the Hindu Mahasabha is one of India’s oldest political organizations.                 The group didn’t support British rule, but it didn’t back India’s freedom movement either, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was particularly tolerant of Muslims. Even now, some members of the group worship his assassin, Nathuram Godse.                 The Hindu Mahasabha’s vision, according to the group’s official website, is to declare India the “National Home of the Hindus.” The website says if it takes power, it will not hesitate to “force” the migration of India’s Muslims to neighboring Pakistan and vows to reform the country’s education system to align it with their version of Hinduism.                  With its controversial campaigns and ideology, Hindu Mahasabha has always been a marginal political force. The last time the group had a presence in Parliament was in 1991.      Related articleIndia is investigating a fake website that offered Muslim women for sale             But according to Verniers, their “strength is not to be measured in electoral terms.” And in the past eight years since Modi came to power, they appear to have expanded in numbers and influence based on the size and frequency of their meetings, he said.                 While the group does not publicly disclose how many members it has, Verniers said they are “comfortably in the tens of thousands.”                 Hindu Mahasabha targets rural communities in northern states, where there is a large BJP presence, encouraging them to vote for parties that align with their Hindu-nationalist ideology, including Modi’s BJP, Verniers said.                  Modi, in turn, has publicly honored the Hindu Mahasabha’s late leader, Veer Savarkar, for “his bravery” and “emphasis on social reform.”                  And as Hindu Mahasabha has grown in recent years, it has become more outspoken.                 In 2015, Sadhvi Deva Thakur, then a senior member of the group, caused widespread controversy when she told reporters Muslims and Christians should undergo forced sterilization to control their population growth. CNN has reached out to her for comment.                  Pandey, who spoke at the December conference in Haridwar,was arrested in February 2019 after a video showed her shooting an effigy of Gandhi, according to CNN affiliate CNN News-18.Photosuploaded to her official Facebook page last May show her worshipinga statue of Gandhi’s assassin. CNN has not been able to confirm whether she was formally charged over the February 2019 incident.                  Hindu Mahasabha isn’t the only right-wing Hindu nationalist group to espouse violent sentiment towardliberals and minorities – including India’s200 million Muslims, who make up 15% of the country’s 1.3 billion population.                 At last month’s conference, several speakers called on India’s Hindus to “defend” the religion with weapons. Another called for the “cleansing” of India’s minorities, according to video from the event.                  But according to Verniers, Hindu Mahasbha one of the largest right-wing political groups aiming to make India the land of the Hindus.                 And while the group’s campaigns and ideas are decades old, they’re more bold about them now.                  “The escalation of their hate speech is reflective of the state of affairs in India,” said Verniers. “But they are able to get away with it more.”                 The reason extremist groups appear to be on the rise is clear, according to experts: they have impunity and support.                  India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section which criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs.                  According to lawyer Vrinda Grover, any group inciting violence is barred under Indian law.                  “Police, states and the government are responsible to ensure (inciting violence) doesn’t happen,” she said. “But the state, through its inaction, is actually permitting these groups to function, while endangering Muslims who are the targets.”                  Pandey’s rant and some of the other calls for violence werethe “worst form of hate speech,” according to Verniers.                   “This is the first time I find myself using the term ‘genocide’ in Indian politics,” he said, referring to the comments made at last month’s conference. “They have tacit support in the form of government silence.”                 That’s because Modi also has a Hindu nationalist agenda, experts say.     Related articleIndian comedian Vir Das sparks explosive online debate with controversial tale of 'two Indias'             Modi swept to power in India in 2014, promising economic reform and development for the country.                  But starting from his first term as Prime Minister, minority groups and analysts say they began to see a significant shift in India’s ideology from a secular to a Hindu nationalist state.                 The BJP has its roots in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing-Hindu group that counts Modi among its members. Many RSS members are adherents of the Hindutva ideology that the Hindu Mahasabha preach – to make India the land of the Hindus.                  In 2018, India’s current Home Minister Amit Shah said Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers from Bangladesh were “termites” and promised to rid the nation of them.                  The BJP’s Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of the north Indian state Uttar Pradesh, known for his anti-Muslim views, once compared Muslim Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed, the alleged planner of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, according to the Press Trust of India.                 Between 2015 and 2018, vigilante groups killed dozens of people – many of whom were Muslims – for allegedly consuming or killing cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus, according to a report from Human Rights Watch.                  Modi publicly condemned some of the killings, but the violence continued, and in 2017, his government attempted to ban the sale and slaughter of cows –currently illegal in several Indian states – nationwide.                  Human Rights Watch said many of the alleged murders went unpunished in part due to delayed police investigations and “rhetoric” from ruling party politicians, which may have incited mob violence.                 In 2019, India’s Parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims. It led to extended protests and international condemnation.                 In December 2020, Uttar Pradesh enacted a controversial anti-conversion law, making it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.                  Other states, including Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Assam, introduced similar laws, leading to widespread harassment and, in some cases, arrests for interfaith couples, Christian priests and pastors.                 All of this has only served to encourage extremist groups like theHindu Mahasabha, say experts.                  Zakia Soman, a women’s rights activist and co-founder of the Muslim group Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, said “a failure of governance” had given rise to more right-wing extremists.                  “Our community is realizing that we have become second-class citizens in our own country,” Soman said. “Minority bashing and hate is becoming regular and normalized. As the intensity increases, the venom and violence in their language also increases.”                  A 21-year-old Muslim student in Delhi, who chose to remain anonymous for fear of backlash from right-wing groups, said Muslims are filled with “a sense of fear” every time right-wing Hindu groups make hateful comments.                  “It gives us a sense that we don’t belong here,” he said.                 Despite police investigations and public outrage, legal action against those who spoke and were present at December’s event have been slow.                 In a letter submitted to Modi on Friday and seen by CNN, students and faculty of the prestigious Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore and Ahmedabad said his silence “emboldens” hate, adding there is “sense of fear” among minority groups in India.                  Some experts agree the government’s silence has only emboldened these groups further.                   “Hate speech precedes hate crimes,” Grover, the lawyer, said. “And we are witnessing a crescendo of hate crimes. These groups are rapidly spreading poison through society.”                  A 2019 US intelligence report warned that parliamentary elections in India increase the possibility of communal violence if Modi’s BJP “stresses Hindu nationalist themes.” It added that state leaders “might view a Hindu-nationalist campaign as a signal to incite low-level violence to animate their supporters.”                  The BJP – which rarely gives statements on the issue –says it does not discriminate against minorities, adding in a statement last March that it “treats all its citizens with equality” and “laws are applied without discrimination.”                  But analysts fear the BJP’s divisive politics will could lead to increased violence against minority groups in the lead up to pivotal state elections this year.                  And reported episodes of violence against Muslims have already increased ahead of this year’s state elections.                  In December, crowds of India’s Hindu-right confronted Muslims praying on the streets in the city of Gurugram, just outside of Delhi. They prevented Muslims from praying, while shouting slogans and carrying banners in protest.                  “It is an electoral strategy,” said Verniers, the political scientist. “Create religious tension, activate religious polarization and consolidate on the Hindu vote.”                  Grover, the lawyer, said criminal laws are “weaponized” in India, adding anyone who challenges those in power “face the wrath of the law.”                  “Muslim lives in India are demonized,” she said. “The Indian state is in serious crisis.”                    On January 1, Pandey held a live broadcast for her more than 1,500 Facebook followers. The subject was “Religious Parliament,” her post said.                 For the 21-year-old student, it is difficult to “expect any sense of justice” for Indian Muslims. He says even having a Muslim name is enough to make him feel unsafe.                  “It is really scary to carry the Muslim identity in India today.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Ilhan Omar’s legislation to create a special envoy to combat Islamophobia, a week after progressives introduced a separate resolution to strip Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of her committee assignments following her anti-Muslim comments calling the Minnesota Democrat a terrorist.                 The bill would address the rise in incidents of Islamophobia worldwide and still needs to pass the Senate before it could go to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.                  The legislation was previously sitting in the House Foreign Affairs Committee for months but was voted out of committee last week as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced increasing pressure from members of her own party to take aggressive action against Boebert for her racist remarks.                 Debate for the legislation was interrupted Tuesday night following objections made by Democrats against GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who insulted Omar during his remarks. Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor, who was serving as chair of the session, ruled that Perry’s comment “impugns the patriotism or loyalty of the member of the House” and ruled his remarks “not in order.” Debate continued shortly after Castor’s ruling.                 The Biden administration said in a statement it supported this legislation.                  “Religious freedom is a fundamental human right. This freedom is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is also part of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Our country’s commitment to defending freedom of religion and belief goes back centuries, and the Administration strongly believes that people of all faiths and backgrounds should be treated with equal dignity and respect around the world,” the statement said.                 The vote on the bill in the House comes after progressive Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced a resolution, cosigned by other progressives, that would strip the Colorado Republican of her committee assignments if passed.                 Last week, Pelosi dodged when she was asked if she supported that resolution and repeated her call for GOP leadership to punish members of their conference.                 The call to have Boebert removed from her committee assignments for her controversial comments is not made in isolation. Threatening violence is the reason why Democrats stripped Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona of their committee assignments earlier this year after incendiary comments or actions they made.                 Omar said last week she was “very confident” Pelosi would take “decisive action” against Boebert over the Colorado Republican’s anti-Muslim remarks.                 “I’ve had a conversation with the speaker and I’m very confident that she will take decisive action next week,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”     This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

The bill, led by Omar that CNN exclusively reported in July, is scheduled to get voted out of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on Thursday, Omar’s office told CNN, and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer’s office announced the bill will get a floor vote on Tuesday. The bill would still need to pass the Senate before it could go to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.                 “As the United Nations said this year, anti-Muslim hatred has reached ‘epidemic proportions’ and every country must take action,” Omar said in a statement to CNN.                 “I am excited for the opportunity to bring forth legislation to address this crisis alongside Rep.

Lauren Boebert of Colorado suggested to a crowd in September that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, whom she called “black-hearted” and “evil,” was a terrorist.                 In those same remarks, she said that she felt safe around Omar because the Democrat wasn’t wearing a backpack while they were in an elevator together.                  It’s another instance in which Boebert suggested Omar, who is Muslim and wears a hijab, was a terrorist. On Monday, the two lawmakers sent dueling statements about a phone call between the pair set up by Boebert after she apologized last week to “to anyone in the Muslim community I offended,” when similar comments surfaced on social media.                 The video of Boebert’s anti-Muslim comments, made in New York at a September Staten Island Conservative Party dinner, were posted on Facebook that month by an attendee running for borough president.      Related articleRep. Lauren Boebert suggested Rep. Ilhan Omar was terrorist in anti-Muslim remarks at event              “One of my I staffers, on his first day with me, got into an elevator in the Capitol. And in that elevator, we were joined by Ilhan Omar,” Boebert told the crowd in September. “It was just us three in there and I looked over and I said, well, lookey there, it’s the Jihad Squad.                 “She doesn’t have a backpack, she wasn’t dropping it and running so we’re good,” Boebert adds, through laughter and applause from the crowd which briefly makes her remarks somewhat inaudible.                 Additionally, at the September event, Boebert also disparaged Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Minnesota, another Muslim member of Congress.                  “Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. These are just black-hearted evil women,” Boebert said.                  Boebert’s remarks were also posted on Twitter in September by Mike DeCillis, a New York Democratic congressional candidate. They received little attention outside of a local press write up, which noted she called her “the jihad squad” and a “black-hearted evil” woman.                 On Monday, Boebert and Omar spoke on the phone, according to statements from both lawmakers.                   “I have reflected on my previous remarks, now as a strong Christian woman who values faith deeply I never want anything I say to offend someone’s religion,” Boebert said in a video posted to Instagram. Boebert said Omar asked her to publicly apologize which she would not do and instead challenged Omar to issue an apology of her own for some of the comments she has made in the past.                 In her statement, Omar said Boebert refused to apologize to her.                 “Instead of apologizing for her Islamophobic comments and fabricated lies, Rep. Boebert refused to publicly acknowledge her hurtful and dangerous comments,” she said. “She instead doubled down on her rhetoric and I decided to end the unproductive call.”                   A spokesperson for Omar called the elevator story “a fabrication.”                 In her statement blasting Boebert on Monday, Omar said Boebert had “a clear pattern for Islamophobic hate speech,” and cited the local press write up of the September event and comments where Boebert called Omar “a full-time propagandist for Hamas” and she said Omar was an “honorary member of Hamas” and that we have “terrorist sympathizers” in Congress.                 Omar on Monday blasted Boebert’s September comments in a message to CNN’s KFile.                 “It just gets worse,” Omar told CNN. “This is unhinged, and she continues to be emboldened by her party. This is their brand and it’s dangerous.”                 Similar comments surfaced last week on social media when the Twitter account PatriotTakes, a left-wing group that researches right-wing extremism and is associated with the liberal PAC MeidasTouch posted a video of Boebert at an event in Colorado on Nov. 20.              In the since-removed video posted on Facebook from an event that day, Boebert implied Omar had been mistaken for a terrorist in an elevator on Capitol Hill.

I see fret all over his face. And he’s reaching. The door is shutting. I can’t open it.”                 “What’s happening? I look to my left and there she is, Ilhan Omar, and I said, ‘Well she doesn’t have a backpack, we should be fine,’” Boebert continued.                 Last week, Boebert apologized to any offended in the Muslim community.                 “I apologize to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep Omar,” Boebert said in a statement posted on Twitter. “I have reached out to her office to speak with her directly.

Congress can’t be a place where hateful and dangerous Muslims tropes get no condemnation.”                 On Friday, Omar called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to take action against Boebert.                 “Normalizing this bigotry not only endangers my life but the lives of all Muslims,” Omar said in another tweet. “Anti-Muslim bigotry has no place in Congress.”                 Democratic leaders said Boebert should fully retract her comments, noting in a statement the congresswoman’s “language and behavior are far beneath the standard of integrity, dignity and decency with which the Constitution and our constituents require that we act in the House.”                 McCarthy said he spoke to Boebert on Friday in the wake of her comments and encouraged her to meet with Omar.                 “She has apologized for what she said and has reached out to Congresswoman Omar to meet next week,” McCarthy said in a statement. “I spoke with Leader Hoyer today to help facilitate that meeting so that Congress can get back to talking to each other and working on the challenges facing the American people.”                 McCarthy’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Boebert’s September comments.

Lauren Boebert of Colorado apologized to “anyone in the Muslim community I offended” on Twitter Friday after video surfaced of her making anti-Muslim comments last weekend about Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.                  In the video, posted last Saturday on Facebook from an event that day, Boebert implied Omar had been mistaken for a terrorist in an elevator on Capitol Hill.                  “So the other night on the House floor was not my first jihad squad moment,” Boebert told a crowd. “I was getting into an elevator with one of my staffers and he and I were leaving the Capitol, we’re going back to my office and we get in the elevator and I see a Capitol Police officer running hurriedly to the elevator. I see fret all over his face. And he’s reaching. The door is shutting. I can’t open it.”                  “What’s happening? I look to my left and there she is, Ilhan Omar, and I said, ‘Well she doesn’t have a backpack, we should be fine,’” Boebert continued. “So we only had one floor to go and I say, do I say it or do I not? And I look over and I say, ‘Look, the jihad squad decided to show up for work today.’ Don’t worry, it’s just her staffers on Twitter that talk for her. She’s not tough in person.”                 Boebert’s comments were flagged by the Twitter account PatriotTakes, a left-wing group that researches right-wing extremism and is associated with the liberal PAC MeidasTouch.                  CNN has reached out to Boebert and multiple members of the congresswoman’s office for comment but has not received a response.                  Boebert said Friday she had contacted Omar’s office.                 “I apologize to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep Omar,” Boebert said in a statement posted on Twitter.                  “I have reached out to her office to speak with her directly.

The Democratic leadership also called on McCarthy to act.                 “Leader McCarthy and the entire House Republican Leadership’s repeated failure to condemn inflammatory and bigoted rhetoric from members of their conference is outrageous,” they said. “We call on the Republican Leadership to address this priority with the Congresswoman and to finally take real action to confront racism.”     McCarthy said he spoke to Boebert on Friday in the wake of her comments and is encouraging she meet with Rep. Omar.                 “She has apologized for what she said and has reached out to Congresswoman Omar to meet next week,” McCarthy said in a statement. “I spoke with Leader Hoyer today to help facilitate that meeting so that Congress can get back to talking to each other and working on the challenges facing the American people.”CNN reached out to McCarthy’s office multiple times on Friday for a comment about Boebert, but they did not provide a statement to CNN until Saturday.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.             Michael Flynn, Donald Trump’s former National Security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and was later pardoned by Trump, wants to make it clear that in the United States, “If we are going to have one nation under God – which we must – we have to have one religion.”                 Of course, to Flynn, that one religion is Christianity. (After all, 75% of White evangelicals voted for Trump in the 2020 election, according to exit polls.)                  Flynn made these remarks in Texas on Saturday as part of the “ReAwaken America Tour,” a conservative conference that features other Trump supporters, like Roger Stone and the My Pillow CEO/election conspiracy peddler Mike Lindell. While speaking at the event, Flynn referenced a passage from the New Testament book of Matthew, saying, “You have to believe this, that God Almighty is, like, involved in this country, because this is it … This is the shining city on the hill.”                  That’s when Flynn triggered a wave of backlash with his suggestion America should have one singular religion. “One nation under God, and one religion under God,” he said. “I don’t care what your ecumenical service is or what you are.”                  Now imagine if a Muslim or Jewish American leader made the same comment that the United States should have one faith, and that it should be Islam or Judaism. The outrage from the right would be deafening. But with Flynn’s comments, there hasn’t been noticeable pushback from conservatives. In fact, it’s been the opposite. GOP Ohio Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who is Jewish, appears to see Flynn’s comments as being in step with his own “Judeo-Christian values”: “We Stand with General Flynn,” Mandel tweeted in response to the backlash. “America was not founded as a secular nation.” Politics does truly make strange bedfellows.       Related article'Patriot Purge' has a chilling method to its utter madness             In contrast, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is Muslim American, tweeted in response to Flynn’s comments, “These people hate the US Constitution.” I don’t know if Flynn and those who support his mindset “hate” the Constitution, but I am certain that they either don’t believe in or don’t understand our Constitution and the freedom of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment.                  This is the same Flynn who in 2016 repeatedly pushed debunked conspiracy theories that there was an effort to impose Islamic Sharia law on the rest of the country. “This Sharia law business, what’s happening right here in the state of Texas is unbelievable,” Flynn said at a San Antonio event that year hosted by ACT! for America, an anti-Muslim hate group per the Anti-Defamation League. At another 2016 speech in Texas, as CNN detailed, Flynn again falsely claimed there are Muslims who want to dominate America by imposing Islamic law: “I want people to understand that there are different laws that are not our laws that others try to impose,” he said.                  As a Muslim, let me be clear that there aren’t any Muslims – then or now – trying to impose any of our religious beliefs onto the law of the United States. This was simply part of the right-wing demonization of Muslims because it played well with the GOP base. It’s the same reason why, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump lied on NBC saying Muslims “don’t want the laws that we have. They want Sharia law.”      Related articleIt didn't go well for Texas at the Supreme Court             Beyond despicably demonizing other faiths, these examples show an idea of “freedom of religion” that ironically revolves around imposing one’s beliefs upon the rest of us. Several on the right have been showing us that for years. For example, when Mike Huckabee ran for president in 2008, he bluntly said the US Constitution should be amended “so it’s in God’s standard” – phrasing he later clarified after critics caught wind of the quote. And during his 2012 presidential run, Rick Santorum declared “our civil laws have to comport with a higher law: God’s law.” These Republicans were telling all who would listen that their goal was turning their religious beliefs into American law.                 And we now have Republicans doing just that with their religion-based oppression of women’s reproductive rights. The most visible example is the Texas GOP’s anti-abortion law, which has garnered headlines for empowering private citizens to behave as vigilantes with the ability to sue anyone involved in securing an abortion beyond about six weeks of pregnancy. When Texas’ Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the legislation, he explained the rationale behind it as being faith-based: “Our creator endowed us with the right to life, and yet millions of children lose their right to life every year because of abortion,” he said. “In Texas, we work to save those lives and that’s exactly what the Texas Legislature did this session.”                  That’s the same reasoning behind the Arkansas ban on nearly all abortions except to save the life of the mother. When the state’s GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed it, he declared the law was predicated upon his “sincere and long-held pro-life convictions.” (As with the Texas law, Arkansas’ ban has faced legal challenges for its obvious violation of Roe v. Wade.)     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             These laws are based on the religious belief held by some that life begins at conception. Having the freedom to personally follow one’s faith is what our nation is predicated upon. Turning those religious beliefs into laws every American then must follow, however, is not. In fact, it’s un-American, given that our First Amendment states “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.”                 No one should be surprised by Flynn’s comments. He’s simply repeating what some in the GOP have long championed: The idea that “freedom of religion” is imposing their religious beliefs upon the rest of us. It’s no wonder, then, why many on Twitter reacted to Flynn’s comments with the phrase “American Taliban.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The pages from Islam’s holy book were seen scattered on the floor. In Islam, the Quran is considered sacred and cannot be placed on the floor or on any dirty surface.                 Players who recognized the religious text posted photos of the scene on Twitter, with one gamer demanding the game’s developers and publishers “remove the pages immediately.”                 “Call of Duty is made for everyone. There was insensitive content to the Muslim community mistakenly included last week, and has since been removed from the game,” an Activision spokesperson said in a statement to CNN on Friday.                  “It should never have appeared as it did in game. We deeply apologize. We are taking immediate steps internally to address the situation to prevent such occurrences in the future.”      Activision Blizzard publishes Call of Duty, one of the best-selling game franchises in the United States for over a decade.                 “Sometimes the whole point of a diverse team isn’t just for gender balance, sometimes it’s at least one person pointing out hey maybe putting an entire cultures holy scriptures onto the floor to be stepped as you kill people is super insensitive?” Anisa Sanusi, a Muslim video game developer based in London, wrote on Twitter. “Leave the Quran out of it.”                 In Call of Duty: Vanguard, which is set in World War II, players “experience influential battles” of the war as they fight in Europe, the Pacific and North Africa, according to the game’s website.             The pages of the Quran appear during zombie mode during the Der Anfang campaign, a survival mode in the game in which players face a wave of zombie soldiers, according to players who posted the screenshots on social media.     Related articleIraq's bloodiest battle will be a video game             “I understand the effort it takes to make a video game world feel real and believable, however for a piece of set dressing, they could have literally used any other blurb of writing,” Sanusi told CNN. “There was absolutely no reason to bring in the Quran into this.”                 Sanusi, 31, said she found the game’s inclusion of the Quran “disrespectful.”                 “There is a bare-level minimum of respect expected when it comes to how you treat and portray a religion with 2 billion followers on the planet,” she said.                 “When dealing with portraying a culture that is not your own, it’s important to have sensitivity measures to avoid instances of cultural appropriation, or in this case, an unintentionally offensive outcome.”                 This is not the first time Call of Duty has attracted negative criticism from Muslim players for insensitive content.                 In 2012, developers of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 had to remove a multiplayer map that showed Islamic religious texts including the word “Allah,” which is Arabic for God, in a bathroom, according to Fortune.                 Rami Ismail, a Muslim Dutch-Egyptian game developer, said he is “annoyed and exhausted” with the constant misrepresentation of Islam in the gaming industry.                 “Games have used Muslim lands as war zones and Muslim people as targets for decades – it is tiring to see additional disrespect towards our people,” Ismail told CNN. “Things like this just really shouldn’t happen.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

State Sen.-elect Ed Durr met with Muslim community leaders in the state on Wednesday, according to Selaedin Maksut, the executive director of the state’s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, who told CNN that the conversation with Durr “went very well.”                  “To be honest, I think it went very well, we got exactly what we came for,” Maksut said. “He committed to renouncing that hate speech and not engaging in it moving forward.”                 Maksut was joined by local Muslim leaders when he met with Durr Wednesday evening. They shared stories of how it felt to grow up Muslim in America, and how Durr’s words have impacted them, Maksut said.                  Maksut said Durr apologized sincerely and committed to standing against Islamophobia and other forms of hate.                 Durr ousted New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney last week, winning the powerful Democrat’s seat in state Senate District 3. Wednesday’s meeting came as Durr was under fire for old tweets that were uncovered by news outlets, including CNN, including one from 2019 in which he referred to the Prophet Muhammad as a “pedophile” and Islam as “a false religion” and “a cult of hate.”     Related articleRepublican Ed Durr will defeat New Jersey's Senate president, CNN projects             Durr told local reporters after Wednesday’s meeting that his discussion with Muslim leaders was “very open” and said he believes progress was made.                 “It’s very easy to hate somebody that you don’t know, but if you know them personally, and you talk to them, it’s very hard to hate them, don’t you think?” he said. “As I reiterated to the group inside … I stand against Islamophobia and all forms of hate and I do commit to that. And I look forward to working with the Muslim community.”                 Durr also said he was given a copy of the Quran, which he was seen holding when he spoke to reporters Wednesday evening.                 Maksut said that while the election took him by surprise, he now looks forward to working with Durr on legislation that impacts the Muslim community.                 “Now we have a connection with him so we look forward to working with him on things that will impact the Muslim community,” Maksut said. “We’re going to hold him to that commitment.”                 CNN obtained cached and archived copies of tweets in which Durr indicates support for QAnon and expresses Islamophobia. CNN contacted Durr and Twitter for comment.                 Durr apologized for his Islamophobic comments in a statement to CNN affiliate KYW. “I’m a passionate guy and I sometimes say things in the heat of the moment. If I said things in the past that hurt anybody’s feelings, I sincerely apologize. I support everybody’s right to worship in any manner they choose and to worship the God of their choice. I support all people and I support everybody’s rights. That’s what I am here to do, work for the people and support their rights.”                 He expressed a number of controversial views on his Twitter account.                  In one tweet from the summer of 2020, he wrote to another Twitter user using the hashtag “WWG1WGA,” a well-known QAnon phrase that means, “Where we go one, we go all.”                 Durr also expressed xenophobic ideas, tweeting in 2018 that New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, should “stop pushing #sanctuary state & inviting #illegals to our state.” He added the hashtags “#BuildTheWall,” “#NoIllegals” and “#MAGA.” CNN also unearthed a tweet from Durr at the state’s first lady, Tammy Murphy, calling Covid-19 the “China virus” and blaming the “influx of #IllegalAliens” for “the return of diseases.”                 Durr’s Twitter account has since been deleted.

By the end of the two hour-plus marathon session, the justices did not seem to be ready to make a major statement about the scope of the government’s ability to claim a “state secret privilege,” which permits the government under some circumstances to block the release of information in a lawsuit that could harm national security interests.                  Several of the justices seemed to be looking for ways to rein in a lower court opinion that went against the government and to send the whole issue back to the lower courts for further review. Such a move would dodge a major opinion that could shape the future of domestic surveillance, exploring the government’s stated needs for secrecy against arguments made by critics who believe the privilege is sometimes used to conceal abuses and thwart accountability in the courts.     Related articleSupreme Court seems poised to expand Second Amendment rights and strike down NY handgun law             The dispute stems from a lawsuit brought by Yassir Fazaga and two other Muslim men, who say an undercover informant for the FBI infiltrated a mosque in Orange County, California, in 2006 and spent more than a year collecting names, phone numbers, emails and other information culled from the community as a part of a counterterrorism investigation. According to court papers, the FBI told informant that they wanted to “get as many files on this community as possible.”                  The informant attended classes at the mosque, gathered information related to charitable giving and attended Muslim fundraising events, all the while going to daily prayers. Most of his interactions were recorded using devices provided by the FBI.                 After his identity was ultimately revealed, Fazaga brought suit.                   A district court ruled in favor of the government and dismissed the claims under the so-called state secret privilege. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed the decision holding that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act – a law aimed electronic communications – provides for procedures for challenging unlawful electronic surveillance in early stages of litigation and takes priority over the states secret privilege.                 The US government then filed an appeal with the Supreme Court.                 Ahilan Arulanantham, a lawyer for the men (two US citizens and one lawful permanent resident), told the justices Monday that his clients should be able to have their day in court after the government violated the Constitution’s protection of freedom of religion.                   Arulanantham said the appeals court was right to permit the case to proceed because FISA allows the review of the lawfulness of the surveillance and at least – at the threshold – displaces a claim based on “state secrets.” He said that the “state secrets” privilege authorizes the exclusion of evidence but not the use of secret evidence to entirely dismiss a case.                  Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler told the justices that the federal appeals court decision holding that FISA displaced the state secrets privilege would seriously undermine the executive branch’s ability to protect the nation’s secrets. He said the privilege is “critical in safeguarding” national security.                 Justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum expressed skepticism at times of the ruling by the 9th Circuit, suggesting they would order the court to wipe away the opinion and start anew.                 Chief Justice John Roberts said that he didn’t think the intent of Congress was to pass the FISA law in order to block the government from being able to assert the privilege. He said such an interpretation would be akin to trying to “bury and elephant in a mouse hole.                 Justice Brett Kavanaugh and others suggested they could instruct the lower court to revisit the particulars of the case at hand and leave a broader opinion concerning the scope of the “state secret” privilege for another day.                 “I feel like we’d be doing a drive-by in this case on a massively important issue if we get into that,” he said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

View more opinion articles on CNN.             When Muhammad Ali died in 2016, he was accorded the equivalent of a state funeral, complete with a eulogy that featured President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton. During the last three decades of his life, from lighting the Olympic torch in Atlanta in 1996 until his death, Ali became a virtually sanctified figure, embodying the movements for civil and human rights that he came to symbolize in America and around the world.                 As “Muhammad Ali,” a new four-part documentary series made by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon explains, it didn’t start out this way. The film’s cumulative power, for both a historian familiar with the period and for people less familiar with this history, is its ability to unpeel hidden layers of a story that has become American folklore.                 “Muhammad Ali” offers the most fulsome portrait of the iconic sports star to date, showing him to be a man full of paradoxes. A freedom fighter who abandoned one of his early mentors, Malcolm X, in favor of a group that would take advantage of him for over a decade. A Black nationalist and pan-Africanist who warmly shared the stage with the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, whose legendary corruption and record of human rights violations seemed antithetical to Ali’s human rights advocacy. A family man whose multiple marriages were marked by infidelity.      Related videoWhy Ken Burns took on 'the greatest athlete of the 20th century'             The film successfully illuminates how the highs and lows of Muhammad Ali’s life personify much of the political conflict and racial upheaval that marked American life – and the larger world – in the 1960s. The mythology of Ali that emerged in the 1990s onward tends to sanitize this legacy, making the icon a more comfortable exemplar of American exceptionalism by smoothing his rough edges (and America’s, too). This documentary’s greatness lies in how it reminds a new generation of audiences that Muhammad Ali’s athletic excellence and political rebellion mutually defined not only his time but also our own era of racial and political reckoning.                  “Muhammad Ali” expertly locates the roots of the age of Black Lives Matter in the political storms of the 1960s. The film’s depictions of that era’s racial segregation, police brutality and cultural antipathy for Black folk feel achingly familiar to contemporary audiences.                   Ali’s audacity – telling reporters (and many White Americans) in 1964 after becoming world heavyweight champion, “I don’t have to be what you want me to be, I’m free to be who I want” – disrupted an unspoken racial compact for Black athletes and reimagined the boundaries of the possible in ways that anticipated our present moment.                    Born and raised in the violently segregated city of Louisville, Kentucky, of the 1940s and 1950s, Cassius Marcellus Clay came of age in a historical milieu indelibly shaped by race. Clay was only six months younger than Emmett Till, whose 1955 lynching in Mississippi sent shockwaves throughout the nation, including Clay’s hometown.                   The young Clay found a safe haven in boxing, where he displayed keen observational abilities to go along with the fastest hands in the history of heavyweight boxing; by 1960, at the age of 18, he had won an Olympic gold medal in Rome. At first, reporters loved the handsome, brash and cocky young fighter whose quotable lines – like “I’m so mean, I make medicine sick” – made for good copy.                   Until they didn’t.                   One of the many pleasures of Ali documentary is watching Clay’s evolution into Muhammad Ali. Clay had purposefully stayed out of the civil rights struggles that were increasingly making headlines during the early 1960s – better to protect his sponsors, “the Louisville Syndicate,” the White power brokers bankrolling his early career. Yet he yearned for a personal dignity that he quickly realized could not be bought.                   Clay found inspiration in the Nation of Islam; an encounter with a Nation of Islam member selling the newspaper, “Muhammad Speaks,” in Miami, where he trained for fights, piqued his curiosity about becoming a Muslim. Attending religious services at Miami’s Temple No. 29 Mosque, where ministers preached that God was Black, showed Clay an alternate reality to the institutions of White supremacy normalized in his youth. Clay flourished, hearing a message of Black political and cultural self-determination that dovetailed with his own aspirations for enjoying a kind of personal dignity perpetually denied to African Americans.                    The film provides a potent explanation to why Clay became so attracted to the Nation of Islam. Rather than abandon the Black world he grew up in for anticipated riches, Clay sought dignity for himself and others. As a budding NOI devotee, Clay met Malcolm X, the group’s national representative, who would become one his most important friends and mentors. Clay and Malcolm grew attracted to each other’s hidden depths, rarely visible to the general public.                   “Muhammad Ali” slows down the story of the young champion boxer’s rise enough for us to see the risks – some would say reckless – the young Clay took in shaping his personal and professional destiny. Drawn to a religious group characterized by some mainstream journalists as “Black supremacists” held the potential to destroy Clay’s boxing career, but he refused to back down, maintaining his religious faith as a protective shield against racist insults and threats.                  The film also explores Ali’s eventual rejection of Malcolm X in detail, offering one example of the way in which the champ’s charisma and bravado at times concealed a gift for self-preservation that could be ruthless.                   While guiding Ali’s evolution in his identity as a Black Muslim, Malcolm X was falling out with the leader of the National of Islam, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm broke with Muhammad in early 1964, announcing his plans to form his own organization. In May 1964 Ali toured Africa on a trip initially orchestrated by Malcolm, with whom he briefly reunited with in Accra, Ghana. Malcolm tried to greet him; with harsh words, Ali turned away. Their friendship ended there, to Ali’s later regret, especially since Malcolm was killed the following year in a political assassination while giving a speech in New York.                 As the film shows, Ali became, by his trip to Africa, a global symbol of Black pride. He embraced the NOI’s racial separatism not out of weakness but from a position of strength. He basked in his growing celebrity, meeting with African leaders, wading through tremendous crowds and deepening his ties to a global Islamic community.                   Ali’s personal belief in Islam dovetailed with political convictions about the need to confront White supremacy, no matter the cost. “Muhammad Ali” illustrates how even as his significance to Black communities in the United States and abroad grew, Ali’s charisma, bravado and humor curdled in the eyes of millions of White Americans as he strayed further from their idea of what a Black male athlete should be. Ali’s refusal to fight in, or approve of, the Vietnam War turned him into a despised figure in mainstream America and burnished his stature as a countercultural icon.                   Denied status as a conscientious objector, hounded by a boxing commission’s refusal to let him fight domestically, Ali fought overseas throughout 1966 before being stripped of his boxing license and heavyweight championship the next year, for refusing to be drafted into the army.       Sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for resisting the draft in 1967, Ali became an itinerant Black Power spokesperson, with the NOI distancing themselves from the former champ as he faced stiff political headwinds. In so doing, Ali became a model for Black resistance to systemic racism domestically and American imperialism abroad.                   The fighter once so quick he could evade the blows of all of his opponents now discovered that he could take a punch, figuratively and literally. In the 1970s Ali engaged in a series of brutal matches, fighting Joe Frazier three times, and regaining the heavyweight championship in an upset victory over George Foreman in the “Rumble in the Jungle” in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo).                   Ali’s professional redemption paralleled the rise of anti-Vietnam War sentiment in America. His popularity within the Black community spread into the mainstream and he became a kind of Rorschach test for the nation. His professional rivalry with Joe Frazier re-captivated the imagination of the predominantly White sports world. The film documents how Ali vilified Frazier as “ugly” and “dumb,” a man whose only admirer was conservative President Richard Nixon. In these and other instances the viewer gets detailed portraits of Ali’s cruelty, casual at times, in service of his own ambition.                 In defeat Ali became a figure who earned admiration and empathy. Losing to Frazier, as he did in front of millions on television and multiple celebrities in “The Fight of the Century” in 1971, humanized him in the eyes of White Americans and amplified the love Black folks held for him. He made disastrous financial decisions, supporting a gigantic entourage, giving money away to strangers and allowing the Nation of Islam to control his finances, as detailed in journalist Jonathan Eig’s superb recent biography, “Ali: A Life.” The film also documents Ali’s insatiable womanizing and the emotional trauma this inflicted on his wives and family                  Part of the heartbreak of Ali’s story is his seemingly endless appetite for punishment and suffering. A promise to retire following his 1975 “Thrilla in Manila” – his final battle against Joe Frazier – faded until his last fight in 1981, a sad beating at the hands of the unremarkable Trevor Berbick, which ended his boxing career for good. He emerged from his boxing career with a slower gait, halting speech and the symptoms of the Parkinson’s diagnosis that would come in the 1980s.

For many Americans who came of age after Ali’s boxing career was long over, the image they know of the icon is of a trembling man, lighting the Olympic torch in Atlanta in 1996. Now this film brings to life for those viewers the Ali who in his prime rejected an American Dream rooted in racial animus against Black people, who proudly adopted a Muslim name and projected an unapologetic pro-Blackness. His principled anti-war stance fulfilled Malcolm X’s prediction that the young boxing champion from Louisville would become a symbol for millions of the world’s dispossessed. Ali became an avatar of social and political change, not when he made it look easy in the ring, but when things got harder.                   Ali’s personal and political odyssey was an American epic, one that “Muhammad Ali” allows us all to experience.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

And you don’t even know it.”                    Between 1960 and 1981, Ali fought 61 professional heavyweight bouts in a glittering career that made him a global icon, but arguably his biggest fights were outside of the ring. His remarkable life story is once again in the spotlight, the subject of “Muhammad Ali” – an expansive, four-part, eight-hour documentary by the renowned filmmaker Ken Burns, airing on PBS.                 “He intersects with all of the things that not only were the most important issues of that day, but of our day as well,” Burns told CNN Sport, “He’s so much bigger than boxing. Sports and the role of sports and society, Black athletes and race and religion and faith and politics and war. There isn’t a button that he doesn’t push, either deliberately or accidentally – and he’s so amazing.”                 But the crux of Burns’ narrative is that he wasn’t always revered, in fact, for many years in the United States, Muhammad Ali was dismissed, feared and even despised.                 The latter-day image of Ali is that he was flamboyant, loquacious and audacious. A larger than life character who was beloved.                 “The biggest misconception about Muhammad Ali is that everybody loved him,” explains ESPN’s Howard Bryant, who is featured in the film. He told CNN Sport, “One of the greatest misconceptions about Ali is that White people loved him from the start. They didn’t. That he belonged to everyone from the start. He didn’t.”                 One of Ali’s daughters, Rasheda, told CNN Sport that her father’s life was far from the fairytale that today’s generation might assume it to be. “His life was in danger. He had death threats placed upon him because a lot of people didn’t like him,” she says.                 “They didn’t respect him. They thought he was unpatriotic. There was a lot of racism at that time.”                  From his humble beginnings in Louisville, Kentucky, Burns charts the rise of a promising – if unvarnished – athlete, who was inspired by the civil rights movement of the time.                 Born Cassius Clay in 1942, Ali was almost the same age as Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black boy who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955. According to the film, Ali was said to be haunted by the image of Till’s mutilated corpse, which his mother allowed to be photographed in an open casket at his funeral.                 After winning the Olympic gold medal in 1960 and turning professional later that year, Ali often listened to Louis Farrakhan’s 1961 song, “A White Man’s Heaven is a Black Man’s Hell,” but he knew to tread carefully on race because offending his group of all-White sponsors in Louisville might have damaged his chances of landing a title fight.                 Throughout the 60s, though, “Gaseous Cassius” began to find his voice, and not just to torment his opponents ahead of their fights. The late Alex Poinsett of Ebony Magazine described him as “a blast furnace of race pride, a pride scorched with the memories of a million little burns.” Additionally, his alignment with Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. ensured that he was viewed with suspicion by the White establishment in America.     READ: Long before Colin Kaepernick knelt, a Black female athlete defied the National Anthem             But after beating Sonny Liston to become world heavyweight champion in 1964, he saw no further reason to compromise his beliefs, telling the media, “I don’t have to be what you want me to be. I’m free to be what I want and to think what I want to think.” He soon changed his name to Cassius X, and would later change it again to Muhammad Ali and joined The Nation of Islam.                 As the new world heavyweight champion, Ali embarked on a five-week tour of Africa and the Middle East and quickly realized the power of his status, but he struggled to find acceptance at home.                 “The press is constantly trying to paint him as something other than what he actually is,” explained the civil rights leader Malcolm X at the time. “He is trying his best to live a clean life and project a clean image. He doesn’t smoke, he doesn’t drink. In fact, if he was White, they would be referring to him as the all-American boy.”                 In countless film clips and newspaper clippings, Burns’ film reveals a stubborn refusal by many people and organizations to acknowledge Ali by his name. “He’d been Muhammad Ali for ten years, [but] they still called him Clay,” Howard Bryant told CNN. “They were sending their own political message: ‘I am refusing to acknowledge you.’ And that is a powerful attack in and of itself: ‘I am not going to acknowledge your own existence.’”                 Little Ali ever did, though, was quite as divisive as his refusal to fight in the Vietnam War.                 Initially classed 1-Y and disqualified from military service because his writing and spelling skills were sub-standard – “I just said I was the greatest, I never said I was the smartest,” Ali joked – he was then reclassified 1-A and therefore eligible for the draft. Ali poured scorn on the reversal, “Without any test, without checking to see if I’m any wiser,” and he opposed the war on religious and moral grounds, he said in the film.                    Ali was now fighting battles on multiple fronts. On February 6th, 1967, he’d tormented Ernie Terrell in the ring because his opponent had refused to recognize his name. Ali’s performance was described by sports writers as “mean and malicious” and “a barbarous display of cruelty.”                 But two months later, Ali refused to step forward when his name was called at his scheduled induction into the US military, and according to the film, within hours the New York State Boxing Commission had stripped him of his license, and he was banned from boxing for three years.                 He was later sentenced to five-years in prison and a $10,000 fine for dodging the draft.                 Ali was unrepentant, “Why should me, and so-called other negroes, go 10,000 miles away from home here in America to drop bombs and bullets on other innocent Brown people?” Ali said that he was prepared to go in front of a firing squad if his punishment required it, “I’m prepared to die,” he says in the film.     Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features             In the prime of his career, Ali lost more than three-and-a-half years in the ring, and he resorted to speaking tours on college campuses to make ends meet. He couldn’t box, but he was still fighting.                 “He used his tongue to lacerate racism and White supremacy and oppression in America,” said Todd Boyd, professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts.                 “He became more militant, not less. He became more assertive, not less. He became more confrontational, not less.”                 Ali was addressing Black Panther rallies and anti-war hippies, uniting disparate groups around a common cause.                 When he finally got his boxing license back in 1970, Ali was able to expose the racism in America and the folly of the war. NAACP lawyers discovered that the New York State Athletic Commission had licensed 244  boxers who were guilty of crimes far worse than conscientious objection: manslaughter, second degree murder and armed robbery among them.                 “We were shocked at the numbers and the range of criminal offenses,” said lawyer Michael Meltsner, “It confirmed our sense that Ali had had been singled out for treatment because of his identity because of his affiliation with the Nation of Islam and because he was a prominent black figure.”     READ: Jack Johnson - The Black boxer who sparked race riots after world heavyweight win             As the anti-war protests grew, Black American men, many who had begun to see themselves as cannon fodder in Vietnam, had slowly become disenchanted and the war was now becoming more universally unpopular in the United States.                  “Even the people who disliked him the most at some level had to admit Vietnam was a failure,” Bryant told CNN Sport. “And if Vietnam was a failure, then how you treated him had to be addressed.”                 Many of his former detractors now cheered Ali on the comeback trail; against Joe Frazier in 1971 – the first time ever that two unbeaten boxers had fought for the heavyweight title – he made more money in one night at New York’s famed Madison Square Garden than the baseball star Hank Aaron had made in his entire career, according to the film.                 But he’d lost some of his speed and had to learn how to take a punch, a strength that would one day become his greatest weakness.                    For the first time in his career, Ali lost a fight – a unanimous judge’s decision – after 15 rounds of brutal boxing in the so-called ‘Fight of the Century.’     READ: ‘The Fight of the Century’ - A divided US nation 50 years on             But, three months later, he got an unexpected victory. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction against him: a shopkeeper ran after him in the street to break the news. In a film clip that was only discovered late in the editing process, Ken Burns says that Ali demonstrated an extraordinary awareness of his place in American history.                 Asked how he felt about the court’s decision, Ali told a reporter, “Well, I don’t know who’ll be assassinated tonight, I don’t know who’ll be enslaved or mistreated or deprived of some other justice or equality. All I can talk about is my case. And I’m thankful that the courts recognized my beliefs and my sincerity in this case.”                 “He’s thinking about way back for 350 years of the ill-treatment of Black people,” Burns explained to CNN Sport, “He’s thinking about Emmett Till and looking ahead to names he couldn’t have known but knew in his heart would be there like Rodney King, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. He has this presence, and you realize, my God, he is here for something bigger than himself.”                  Two of Ali’s four wives are profiled in the documentary and the producers didn’t shy away from some of the less flattering aspects of his life – his philandering and his cruelty to some of his opponents. “Our superficial media culture today presumes that heroes are perfect,” says Burns, “In fact, the Greeks have told us for millennia that a hero is not perfect.                 “He’s a serial womanizer, unfaithful to at least his first three wives and he treats Joe Frazier and several other opponents with a kind of disdain and Jim Crow language that’s inexcusable to my mind.”                 However, Burns points out that the women in his life still regard Ali with affection: “You see in their eyes the pain of that infidelity, but the love is still there, there’s a kind of forgiveness and understanding that they had a chance to accompany, for a time, an extraordinary human being.”                 “Ali could have $30,000 dollars in his pocket one afternoon and he’d come back with nothing,” said his second wife Khalilah, describing his extreme generosity to those less fortunate than himself. “He just loved to give if somebody was hurting, he loved to help the pain. I think he’ll go to paradise because of that, because he did give a lot to charity!”                 His daughter Rasheda described her father to CNN Sport as a gentle soul, a “teddy bear” at home. “My dad was very strong and powerful,” she said, “But my dad was very sensitive. He cried when he would read passages of the Quran, when he would be spiritually connected. He didn’t like going to funerals, it made him really sad.”     READ: Muhammad Ali’s grandson marks professional boxing debut with a victory             “He was such a generous human being,” adds Burns. “In fact, on his gravestone it says, ‘Service to others is the price you pay for your room in heaven.’ And I’ve got to assume he’s got a deluxe suite there.”                 Ali continued boxing in the 1970s, winning two of the most iconic fights of all time, ‘The Rumble in the Jungle’ against George Foreman in Zaire and the ‘Thrilla in Manila,’ a third fight against Joe Frazier.                 He was the first to win the world championship three different times and according to the film, earned $50 million, more than all the heavyweight champions combined before him, but the catalog of his ill-advised later fights is painful to watch, depicted in visceral detail on-screen.                 In 1980, Larry Holmes landed 340 punches to Ali’s 42, a one-sided fight that left the winner Holmes in tears and stunned the witnesses who were watching from ringside. “It was like watching a train wreck,” said the American journalist Dave Kindred, “Like watching a friend get run over by a truck. As emotional a night as I’ve ever had as a sportswriter.”                 Ali fought one more time. It was another one-sided bout against Trevor Berbick in 1981 – three years later he was diagnosed with the disease that would define the rest of his life.                  As Parkinson’s disease ate away at his central nervous system, the once quick-footed, fast-talking athlete was now in obvious decline. For a while, Ali was reluctant to admit it, but even he recoiled when he saw a clip of himself on The Today Show. “That man looked like he was dying,” he said.                 Perhaps the movie should have ended in 1974, when the underdog Ali outwitted and outboxed Foreman in Zaire. Instead, the denouement is a very different kind of comeback.  Ali had been largely forgotten until 1996, when he appeared unexpectedly in Atlanta, shaking but defiant, to light the Olympic flame.                 Bryant believes this was the moment that America undeniably fell in love with him: “Because he couldn’t talk [back]. He was safe.” Speaking in the film, Kindred agreed, “He can’t hurt us anymore, he can’t make us mad anymore. The game that we asked him to play to entertain us has left him looking like this. For every reason that we disliked him, now we love him because he was right.”                 “You can’t deny this American story,” concludes Bryant. “The thing with these public figures, especially the athletes, is that they are wallpaper for our lives. As they grow, we grow. You start looking and you reflect on your own life and at some point, you have to say, ‘Maybe, he wasn’t the problem. Maybe, I was.’”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

View more opinion on CNN.             Who could have predicted that in the two decades following the 9/11 attacks, the United States would wage various kinds of military operations in seven Muslim countries – in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen –  at the cost of at least $6 trillion and more than 7,000 American lives?                  In addition, tens of thousands of soldiers from countries allied to the United States died, as did hundreds of thousands of ordinary Afghans, Iraqis, Libyans, Pakistanis, Somalis, Syrians and Yemenis who were also killed during the so-called “war on terror.”                  All of this carnage was traceable back to Osama bin Laden’s decision to launch the 9/11 attacks.                  Al-Qaeda’s leader is one of the few people of whom it can truly be said that he changed the course of history. Just as an account of Nazism would be nonsensical without reference to the persona and worldview of Adolf Hitler, or a history of France after the revolution of 1789 would make no sense without an understanding of the goals and personality of Napoleon Bonaparte, so too our understanding of al-Qaeda and the ideology and violence it spawned would be incoherent without reference to bin Laden.                 This is an unapologetically old-school view of how history is actually made, which posits certain individuals are able to ride the tide of human events and shape them in new and unexpected ways.      Related articleWhat 9/11 tells us about unifying America             Of course, that is not to deny the importance of circumstance. Hitler could not have become Hitler without two hugely significant events: Germany’s defeat in World War I and the Great Depression. Nor could Napoleon have become Napoleon without the opportunities presented to him by the chaos of post-revolutionary France.                  But it’s impossible to understand World War II and the Holocaust without understanding Hitler’s ambitions and ideology, just as it’s impossible to understand why the largest army hitherto assembled in Europe marched into Moscow in September 1812 just weeks before the onset of the brutal Russian winter without understanding the vast ambitions of Napoleon.                 Bin Laden also came of age at a time of important historical changes. As a young man, he lived through a period of great ideological ferment in the Muslim world. During the 1970s, the early promises of socialism and Arab nationalism had delivered little in the way of prosperity or peace in the Middle East, and a new interest in religion gripped the region, a period of Islamic awakening that peaked in 1979 — the first year of a new century on the Muslim calendar — with three seismic events.                 First was the overthrow of the Shah of Iran by the cleric Ayatollah Khomeini, which showed the world that a US-backed dictator could be toppled by religious revolutionaries.                  Second was the armed takeover of Islam’s holy of holies, the mosque in Mecca, by Sunni militants. The assault on Mecca pushed the Saudi royal family to take a more conservative religious line at home and to finance the export of conservative Wahhabi clerics and mosques around the Muslim world (in part also to combat the rise of the new militant Shia regime in Iran).                  Finally, the “infidel” Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan precipitated a global movement of Muslims who traveled to Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan to help combat the Soviets. It was a thrilling time to be a deeply committed Muslim, as the 22-year-old bin Laden already was.                  In 1987, bin Laden set up a base — “Al Qaeda” in Arabic- — in Jaji in eastern Afghanistan, where he and a small group of followers fought the Soviets. From that base was forged a new group, al-Qaeda, and also a new doctrine of globalized jihadist terrorism, culminating in the 9/11 attacks, which reshaped the greater Middle East and also the United States itself in unexpected ways.      Related articleThe raging new Donald Trump campaign starts up where he left off             Bin Laden pushed forward with the 9/11 attacks despite internal opposition within al-Qaeda. In July 2001, Saif al-Adel, a senior al-Qaeda military commander, and Abu Hafs the Mauritanian, the group’s religious adviser, told bin Laden they opposed attacking the United States because they feared the likely American response and were worried the operation would anger the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, who were then hosting them in the country.                 Abu Hafs the Mauritanian was also concerned killing American civilians could not be justified on religious grounds.                 However, bin Laden ruled over al-Qaeda like a medieval monarch, and leaders of the group who were skeptical about the looming attacks in the United States were forced to go along with them.                 Bin Laden had a strategy for the 9/11 attacks that went beyond simply murdering as many American civilians as possible. He firmly believed the attacks would result in the withdrawal of American forces from the entire Middle East, which would then lead to the collapse of the US-supported Arab regimes that bin Laden despised.                 It was a strategy that made little sense, as the United States would surely follow its own interests and was hardly likely to abandon its substantial role in the Middle East. But bin Laden truly believed that the US was weak, just as the former Soviet Union had been, and could only absorb a few blows.                   He drew inspiration from other terrorist groups that had successfully attacked American targets, such as Lebanese Hezbollah, which had bombed the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 241 American Marines, sailors and soldiers. Within a few months of the attack, the United States pulled out all of its troops from Lebanon. The Marine barracks bombing was very much on bin Laden’s mind as he plotted attacks he believed would result in the United States removing its troops from its bases in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia.                  Perhaps the most profound change in the United States brought about by the 9/11 attacks was to greatly expand the military power of the US presidency. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), which Congress passed days after the 9/11 attacks, allowed President George W. Bush to “use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, or harbored such organizations or persons.”      Related articleWe're not villains or victims -- we're people seeking a better life             This authorization sanctioned “forever wars” that lasted for two decades after 9/11. Three presidents as different from each other as presidents Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump used the same authorization to carry out hundreds of drone strikes against groups such as ISIS, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Shabaab and the Pakistani Taliban. Few of these strikes had any connection to the perpetrators of 9/11.                  The AUMF was also used to justify various types of US military operations in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. And, of course, 9/11 fueled the flawed rationale for Bush to invade and occupy Iraq in 2003.                 This result was exactly the opposite of bin Laden’s aim with the 9/11 attacks, which was to push the United States out of the greater Middle East, so its client regimes in the region would fall. Instead, new American bases proliferated throughout the region – in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda lost the best base it ever had in Afghanistan. Rather than ending American influence in the Muslim world, the 9/11 attacks greatly amplified it.                  Bin Laden later put a post-facto gloss on the strategic failure of 9/11 by dressing it up as a great success and claiming the attacks were a fiendishly clever plot to embroil the US in costly wars in the Middle East. Three years after 9/11, bin Laden released a videotape in which he asserted, “We are continuing this policy of bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy.”                  There was no evidence it was really bin Laden’s plan in the run-up to the 9/11 attacks, although it is true the investment of American blood and treasure in the wars in the greater Middle East likely weakened the United States.                 Bin Laden’s 9/11 attacks also had unpredictable, long-term effects on US politics. Real estate impresario Donald Trump launched his political career with the lie that President Barack Obama wasn’t an American and was secretly a Muslim. This lie was especially potent in the context of 9/11, one of the hinge events of American history that touched off a surge of anti-Muslim prejudice. During his presidential campaign, Trump often claimed he had seen “thousands” of Arabs cheering the 9/11 attacks from their rooftops in New Jersey. This was false, but it played well with Trump’s base.     Related articleHe's on the FBI's most-wanted list and is now a key member of the Taliban's new government             Trump’s presidential campaign also took place during a wave of mass casualty jihadist terrorist attacks in the West. On November 13, 2015, ISIS terrorists killed 130 people in Paris. Within seven months of the Paris attacks, ISIS-inspired terrorists killed 14 people at an office in San Bernardino, California, and 49 people at an Orlando nightclub. As a result, in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, just over half of Americans said they were “very” or “somewhat” worried they, or a member of their family, would be victims of terrorism. This was the largest number to feel this way since just after 9/11.                  Sensing a real political opportunity, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslim immigration to the States and asserted that many Muslims have “great hatred towards Americans.” Polling in early 2016 showed half of all Americans supported banning Muslims traveling to the United States. Other polls showed terrorism as a top-two issue for Americans, with Trump holding a slight advantage over his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, on the issue.                 For al-Qaeda, 9/11 was a great tactical victory. The group inflicted more direct damage on the United States in one morning than the Soviet Union had during the Cold War. But ultimately, it was a strategic failure for the organization, just as Pearl Harbor was for Imperial Japan. A longtime associate of bin Laden’s estimated as a result of the US campaign against al-Qaeda after 9/11, 1,600 of the 1,900 Arab fighters then living in Afghanistan were killed or captured. And almost a decade after 9/11, bin Laden himself was killed by US Navy SEALs raiding his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.                   But now al-Qaeda has been given a new lease on life by President Joe Biden’s ill-considered and hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan and the speedy takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban.

Yet Islam continues to be largely misunderstood by many, which has given way to Islamophobia and even violence against Muslims.                 While Islamophobia existed long before 9/11, a dislike for Islam and Muslims became more deliberately weaponized in the service of war and politics in the post-9/11 world, says Dalia Mogahed, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU).                  Mogahed and others say that post 9/11 Islamophobia has manifested in different ways around the world, including the adoption of the Muslim travel ban – one of former President Trump’s signature policies; the persecution of the Uyghur people in China since at least 2017; and the mass murder of the Rohingya in Myanmar.                 Twenty years after 9/11, ignorance about Islam and an “othering” of its adherents continue to be driven by tropes. Here are the most common:                 Islam started in the Middle East, but has since spread all over the world. From the Rohingya in Myanmar, to the Uyghurs in China, and Bosniaks in the Balkans, Muslims are an extremely diverse community and do not come from a single region.                 Although many people use the terms “Muslim” and “Arab” interchangeably, it is not accurate to do so.                 “Arabs are actually a minority of the Muslim population, both globally and in United States,” Mogahed told CNN. “They make up 20% of the world’s Muslims.”                 Muslims are not a monolith, and are of all different races, skin tones, ethnicities and speak different languages.                 Patriarchy and the oppression of women are issues that exist in all communities, not just Muslim ones.                 “This is a common one we get, and it speaks to the ignorance and lack of context about Islam,” said Zainab Chaudry, spokeswoman for the national headquarters of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). “Islam granted women rights to an education, property ownership, inheritance, and divorce.”     Related article'Those people are not me'             “One of the key points to keep in mind is that culture often gets conflated with religion,” Chaudry said. “Islam actually encourages women to keep their autonomy and agency.”                 While interpretation of religion can result in the oppression of women, it’s usually rooted in other issues as well, Mogahed said.                 “It is a problem of egos, power, and self-interest and happens in spite of Islam, not because of it,” she said.                 The hijab is a veil covering the hair that some Muslim women wear in order to practice modesty.                 “The reality is that according to survey research, about half of Muslim women in the US wear it and half do not, it’s an even split,” said Mogahed of the ISPU’s findings.                  While some governments, like those of Saudi Arabia and Iran, have made the hijab mandatory for women in public spaces, Islam itself forbids compulsion of any sort.                 “It should be a personal decision for each woman,” Chaudry said. “It alone is not an accurate indicator of piety.”                 Claims that Islam encourages violence against non-Muslims are usually the result of people isolating verses from the religious texts that grant Muslims the right to defend themselves.                 “Cherry-picking verses from any religious text, including the Quran, and isolating them from their broader context and misapplying them to justify or condone any kind of violence is inappropriate and deeply harmful,” said Chaudry.     Related article'Innocent Until Proven Muslim': How Islamophobia lingers in post-9/11 era             In fact the Quran is very clear about violence. Chapter 5, Verse 32 states: “Whosoever kills an innocent human being, it shall be as if he has killed all mankind, and whosoever saves the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind.”                 Members of all faiths have carried out violence, Chaudry said. It has more to do with the individual than it does the religion.                  “People who regurgitate the myth that Islam is violent haven’t studied the religion,” she said.                  In the West, the term “jihad” is often used interchangeably with “holy war.” But that’s not what it means.                 Jihad is an Arabic term meaning “to strive” or “to struggle.” In the context of Islam, it means to work toward becoming a better Muslim.                  There are two types of jihad, inner and outer, with the former being known as the “greater jihad,” and can encompass anything from not giving into temptations or making a greater effort to pray.                  Outer jihad, or “lesser jihad,” can refer to a military struggle, but more commonly refers to actions like being kind to others or being a good representative of the faith.                 Mogahed points out that the term “holy war” originated from The Crusades, a series of wars initiated by the Christian church, and does not originate in Arabic or the Muslim tradition at all.                 “And war is not and can never be holy,” she added.                 Allah is the Arabic word for “God,” not a special and specific god that Muslims worship.                  “Muslims worship the god of Abraham, the same god Christians and Jews worship,” Mogahed said. “Christian Arabic speakers call God ‘Allah’ as well.”                 Jesus is a prophet in Islam, just as Muhammad is. The notion that Muslims do not believe in Jesus is one rooted in the “othering” of the religious group.                 “Muslims believe in all of the prophets mentioned in the old and new testaments [of the bible],” Mogahed said. “Muslims see Muhammad as the final prophet, rather than the first and only, like many incorrectly believe.”                 As a matter of fact, there’s an entire chapter dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the Quran, Chaudry said.                  “Jesus has a really prominent role in Islam, and he is beloved to Muslims just as Muhammad is,” she said.                 Sharia has become a bit of a dirty word in the West, and is sometimes interpreted as incompatible with democracy. That couldn’t be further from the truth, Chaudry said.                 “Sharia is a set of guidelines that are taken from the Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammad that are designed to help Muslims live a moral and ethical way of life,” said Chaudry. “People have developed misconceptions about it because of misinformation shared through media, pop culture, and anti-sharia bills that contribute to hysteria.”                 As a matter of fact, part of Sharia is that Muslims must abide by the law of the land in which they reside, said Chaudry, which debunks the notion that Muslims want to bring the guidelines to the West.                 Even Muslim-majority countries don’t fully adopt or follow sharia, but rather a hybrid of laws left behind by European colonialism and sharia, added Chaudry.                 The collective blame of the Muslim community following the actions of terrorists is “immoral,” Mogahed says.                 “It’s unethical and bigoted to blame an entire group for the actions of individuals,” she said. “It says that unless and until we condemn acts of terrorism, then by default, we are guilty.”                 “The idea that Muslims have to do that or it’s fair game to assume we agree with terrorism is unacceptable.”                 The endorsement of any and all Islamophobic tropes is dangerous not only for Muslims, but for everyone.                 “Endorsing these tropes is linked to approval of war, violence against civilians and anti-Muslim policies,” she said. “Fear kills freedom, so Islamophobia is bad for democracy, not just Muslims.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

He hadn’t engaged in illegal activity. But his innocence didn’t matter, he said, because he was Muslim.     Muhammad Tanvir, who was living lawfully in the US, said that, in 2007, FBI agents approached him and asked him to consider working as an informant against Muslims. Tanvir refused, but the FBI continued to pressure him over the next several years, eventually placing his name on the no-fly list, he said. Being on the list limited his ability to travel domestically, and made it impossible to travel abroad. He quit his job as a long-haul trucker because he couldn’t fly, and alleged that after he bought a ticket to visit his ailing mother in Pakistan, he wasn’t allowed to board.                 Tanvir’s experience wasn’t unique. In 2013, he and two other men – Jameel Algibhah and Naveed Shinwari – filed suit, saying that the FBI had placed them on the no-fly list to coerce them into acting as informants.                 In December 2020, in a unanimous decision, the US Supreme Court held that, under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, federal officials may be liable in their individual capacities if they violate a person’s religious rights. The high court also said that the three men were entitled to seek damages.                 Very definitely, the outcome was a victory for the plaintiffs. Yet the decision had a dark undertow. It served as a reminder that, in crucial ways, the social and political fallout from September 11, 2001, can still inflict great harm, even 20 years on.                 After all, it was in the weeks following the terrorist attacks – a tragedy that claimed almost 3,000 lives – that the US government dramatically expanded its use of the no- fly list, a move that attracted criticism. The backlash came from progressive quarters, and was aimed at the fact that the list disproportionately targeted innocent people even for appearing to be Arab or Muslim.                 It was here, in the aftermath of 9/11, that the US saw the start of an era of heightened Islamophobia, as well as the launch of the war on terror and the invasion of Afghanistan. To discuss how Islamophobia has congealed – been institutionalized – in the two decades since 9/11, I spoke with Dr. Maha Hilal, author of the forthcoming book, “Innocent Until Proven Muslim: Islamophobia, the War on Terror and the Muslim Experience Since 9/11.”                 The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.     Islamophobia certainly existed in the US long before 9/11. But could you explain how the war on terror became a turning point in this history?             I always go back to George W. Bush’s speech on September 20, which was the first time he used the phrase “war on terror.” And in that speech, he set the boundaries of the war on terror that he would conceive with his administration. He essentially talked about how the US must respond to this terrorist violence, and how there was really no choice but to do it with violence. The main targets were obviously the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and he mentioned that this wouldn’t be a war against Islam, that basically there are some good Muslims.                 If you were an average Muslim, you might’ve thought on hearing the speech: “OK, this isn’t targeting all of us. It’s really just targeting the quote-unquote bad Muslims.” But in acquiescing the Muslim population and in making them believe that this wasn’t a large-scale targeting of Muslims, the Bush administration actually made it easier to move forward with many of the policies that it developed, especially in the earlier years.                 And we know that institutionalized Islamophobia was at the very core of the war on terror from the onset, from the signing of the AUMF (the Authorization for Use of Military Force), to the war in Afghanistan, to the memorandum that gave the CIA the authority to detain suspects.                 We know this not because of explicit policy language but because of whom these policies targeted. Part of what I talk about in my book is the way that target populations are socially constructed, and these constructions are embedded in policy design and implementation. So, usually what happens is that people view at least some policies as neutral on their face, which then means that they can’t be Islamophobic. However, when it comes to whom these policies are targeting, it’s been either exclusively or disproportionately Muslims.     Something that too often seems to be missing from conversations on 9/11 is the fact that it hit different parts of the Arab and Muslim American communities differently. Could you talk about that?             That’s the tricky thing about Islamophobia, because Muslims are an extremely diverse population. When I talk about my definition of Islamophobia, I believe that it’s rooted in anti-religious animus, but then there are intersecting identities that make different Muslims’ experiences of Islamophobia different.                 I’ve talked with Black Muslims, and one thing I’ve heard repeatedly is that they don’t know if they’re being targeted because they’re Muslim or Black or both. Or with countering violent extremism, the US government heavily targeted the Somali population. So, I think that there are all these different manners in which we have to consider Islamophobia.     What do people get wrong about the post-9/11 landscape for Arab and Muslim Americans?             The way I think about the war on terror is that, in the beginning, it targeted non-citizens. My analysis of that is that the idea that US citizenship provides certain rights wasn’t something that the US government wanted to go after immediately, even though it did in part. The war was more robustly targeted at non-citizens.                 But then, eventually, we saw the proliferation of policies targeting citizens, because once you successfully merge Muslims as one collective monolith – which wasn’t that hard to do, since that had been a construction for a long time – the citizenship piece just dissolves. It doesn’t matter if you’re American if you’re also Muslim, because the Muslim identity trumps the American identity in terms of what rights you’re afforded.     Are you concerned that what’s happening in Afghanistan – especially the framing of the situation – will have a negative impact on Afghan refugees in the US?             Absolutely. But the narrative on Afghanistan has been problematic from the beginning of the war. Donald Rumsfeld said in 2001: “We did not start this war. So understand, responsibility for every single casualty in this war – whether they’re innocent Afghans or innocent Americans – rests at the feet of al-Qaeda and the Taliban.”                 This is troubling because the US de facto assumes that violence is the only legitimate and justifiable intervention. In my book, I talk about how there were lots of narratives that described 9/11 as a break with history. The strategic role of that was to say that history starts now. But why does history start now? No, it started when empire began.                 In regard to Afghanistan, the US has often put itself in the position of, first of all, trying to get rid of all the terrorists, which is impossible if you’ve decided that history started in 2001, because you’ll never actually get to the root of the problem. And second, it’s always that Afghans need the US’s help. What I think is problematic about the way President Joe Biden has been talking about Afghanistan is that he keeps saying that this wasn’t a nation-building project. But the original goal in going to Afghanistan was to capture Osama bin Laden, who was killed in Pakistan in 2011. So, what, exactly, was the US doing for the last 10 years?                 And there’s so much paternalism, which has pretty much been the approach to all countries, particularly Muslim countries, that have been targeted by the US under the guise of the war on terror. It’s essentially: We need to help you figure out that terrorism isn’t the way to go. But that eliminates the possibility of discussing the discrimination that Muslims face and the state violence that the US commits.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Every Muslim in America has a story to tell. Here are some of them.","Sep 10, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Alaa Elassar,International,"(CNN) — Many Muslims in the United States point to September 11, 2001, as the day their relationship with the country changed.                 Islamophobia had always existed, but the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia seemingly made it worse – much worse.                 Muslims of all stripes – citizens, immigrants and refugees – faced backlash. Many were ostracized and harassed, some physically assaulted and even killed. Charged rhetoric, successive wars and attacks further inflamed the situation.                 Feeling condemned for crimes they didn’t commit, some Muslims changed their names and clothing to conceal their identities, while others clung even tighter to their faith. A few became outspoken advocates for the community.                  Every Muslim in America has a story to tell. Here are some of them.                 Ruwa Romman, 28, is a Palestinian American community organizerand policy analystliving in Duluth, Georgia.                 When the terrorists attacked, she was 8 years old and had just recently immigrated to the US with her parents. But the dream she had of building a new life in America quickly turned into a nightmare.                 “I remember the hallways and the day seemed darker even though I remember it was sunny outside,” Romman told CNN about her experience in school that day. “I don’t think I fully understood what was happening since I barely spoke English.”                 Still, she recalls the long list of insults hurled at her as a child: “terrorist” and “sand n****r.” Some even asked if she was related to Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda mastermind behind the attacks.                 Romman says she can’t remember a single day in elementary school when the bullying stopped. High school wasn’t much better – with one teacher pulling her out of class to ask if her family belongs to a terrorist group.                 Outside of school, a close friend’s family banned her from their home because she was Muslim and “dangerous,” she said. Airport travel required numerous bag checks – sometimes three times during a single trip.                  The bullying and harassment set Romman on a path to educate and advocate for her community, even at a young age.                 “I felt this sense of duty to never respond to every terrible comment made to me and instead try to educate people,” Romman said. “Looking back at my younger self, I’m so angry and sad for her. I didn’t have to do any of that. I was a kid trying to grow up and figure out my life. All of a sudden I’d become an ambassador for a billion people around the world.”                 “I remember trying so hard to get people to just see me as a person,” she added. “I stubbornly ignored the reality in front of me that my community was being systemically targeted from airports to universities to mosques. It wasn’t until I was around 18 that I began to learn about government entrapment, surveillance of students in Muslim Student Associations, and so much more.”                 In 2016, Romman joined the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, as their communications director. She’s since become a community organizer, policy analyst and consultant working on related issues.                  Romman says advocating for US Muslims and the issues they face is daunting, but sees hope in every small victory.                 “We will continue to be politically engaged and unapologetically so.” Romman said. “Muslims are no longer willing to carry that burden. None of us committed 9/11. Why should we carry that burden?”                 Qasim Rashid, 39, is a Pakistani American human rights lawyer living in Stafford, Virginia.                 He remembers standing with coworkers in front of the office TV watching the World Trade Center collapse. Like the others, he was shocked by the news, but then he overheard a colleague whisper “rag heads” and fear set in.                 “I moved here when I was four, so this was the only home I knew,” Rashid told CNN. “I’m American through and through in every sense of the word. But I was 19, Muslim, and I had a beard, and suddenly people couldn’t see me as American.”                 Random police stops became his norm. Racial slurs that once felt so jarring eventually became predictable. And anytime Rashid met someone new, he braced for when they would inevitably bring up 9/11.                 “Whether I liked it or not, just by existing I was suddenly representing 1.6 billion Muslims,” Rashid said. “I knew if I didn’t take an active role in writing my narrative, my story, someone else is going to do it for me and it’s not going to be true.”                 He channeled his desire for truth and justice into studying law, and now works as a human rights lawyer representing Muslims, among other marginalized communities.                 “There have been immense atrocities and horrific violence committed against Muslims because of 9/11. We saw things like the Patriot Act, the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay and the indefinite detention of people without due process of law,” Rashid said.                 “I knew I had to do something to create the kind of country I thought America should be; one based on justice and compassion,” he added. “Becoming a lawyer was an acknowledgment that this country has noble values of equal justice and protection and a constitution worth fighting for.”                 Much of Rashid’s work has centered on issues of immigration, asylum and women’s rights.                  Fighting for justice in the court system hasn’t been easy, he said, but he’s heartened by the next generation, which has become increasingly vocal about rights issues and intolerant of hate.                 As for young Muslims, he offers these words of advice: “Be fierce and be courageous in your identity. You don’t need to be ashamed or shy about it. Embrace it fully and confidently, and do so while leading with justice and creating an inclusive world for all voices.”                 Nakibur Rahman, 44, is a Bangladeshi American university professor living in Fayetteville, North Carolina.                  He immigrated to the US just weeks before 9/11 – young, confident and inspired to make his dreams come true. But everything changed that fateful morning, and the future didn’t seem so bright anymore.                 “What came to my mind immediately was my friends and family in New York, one who worked in the towers,” Rahman told CNN. “It was a very traumatic moment for me, and I hadn’t even had the time to think about what this could mean for my community.”                 His loved ones were found safe, but the fear and panic he felt remain with him to this day.                 “If I close my eyes, it’s like I’m watching a movie,” Rahman said. “I can see exactly what happened from the moment I woke up to the moment I saw the attack on TV. After that, it was like my life stopped and I couldn’t remember anything.”                 Rahman said he was fortunate to receive loads of support from his community in Maine, where he was in graduate school at the time. Still, he thought twice about doing or saying anything that could be misconstrued as suspicious.                 “I was lucky to be surrounded by kindness, but something would always bring me back to reality,” he said. “I was constantly reminded of the same question: Am I going to be subject to backlash because a Muslim group committed this? It made me sad and very careful.”                 His fears were bolstered by frequent news reports of hate crimes targeting Muslims. He said it led to a terrifying realization for the Muslim community that ultimately brought them together.                 “The Muslim community learned that the things we cherish most in this country, the First Amendment, liberty, and pursuit of happiness could be taken away from us in a second,” Rahman said. “We came together because of that.”                 For decades, Muslims have lived in the shadow of 9/11, but Rahman believes the future won’t be as dark.                 “Muslim organizations we see today that are flourishing were born after 9/11, when we realized that if we don’t start helping ourselves, be active in the community, tell our sides of the story, no one else is going to do it for us,” he said. “And we refuse to be made the scapegoats forever.”                 Ashanti Jabri, 27, is a data analyst and martial artist living in Atlanta.                 Jabri says he always felt like an outsider in the South. Being both Black and Muslim, he was taught to be wary of racism and Islamophobia from a very young age. But Jabri didn’t really understand what that meant until the morning of the attacks.                 He was outside playing with his brother and some neighborhood kids when the news broke.                 “It was an absolutely beautiful day, there was nothing around me but laughter, before my dad screamed our names and we ran to the house,” Jabri said. “He took us into our parents’ room, and my mom was sitting on the bed crying and CNN was playing in the background. It was extraordinarily scary.”                 His parents explained what happened, before telling their children that even though they hadn’t done anything wrong, their lives would be forever changed.                 Jabri was told that he was no longer allowed to play or be outside alone. For a year, his mother took off her hijab and his father stopped wearing a kufi, a traditional cap worn by some Muslim men.                 “For our safety, we had to live very under the radar,” he said. “As a child, I was just terrified all the time of anyone realizing I was Muslim and thinking I was a bad person. I felt like I didn’t know who I was anymore because of the way the world saw Muslims. Was I the enemy?”                 Jabri struggled with his identity for years. He debated dropping his middle name, Omar, because it sounded Muslim. At times he tried to hide his religion, and often questioned if it was his responsibility to fight back against Islamophobia.                 “It was like I felt the need to constantly denounce those acts and ideologies, to remind people ‘Those people are not me. I am not that kind of Muslim’,” Jabri said. “I was constantly analyzing myself and what I had to say instead of dealing with the issues 9/11 caused me as a Muslim.”                 Jabri said his whole life was marked by incessant reminders of 9/11, including harassment from community members and law enforcement. His mother was verbally and physically assaulted, and he was once questioned by the FBI after a trip abroad.                 “Every day after 9/11 was a very constant reminder that I was living in a place that wasn’t comfortable with me existing as me,” Jabri said. “Being a Black man as well as a Muslim in America, it felt like people only saw me as a threat. My very essence intimidated people and I didn’t know how to live with that.”                 Jabri still feels “abandoned, hurt, and criminalized” for being himself, but says he’s now more confident in his identity and does not harbor animosity.                 “I’m just grateful to be part of a community that’s so strong and resilient to survive that kind of backlash,” he said.                 “We have seen the best out of Muslims after 9/11,” Jabri added. “We went from our communities being near obscurity to hearing our wonderful voices in journalism, sports, politics, arts, business, and activism. So many voices have been given a chance to be heard and show what Islam is really about.”                 Nadia Ahmad, 41, is a Pakistani-Indian American professor living in Altamonte Springs, Florida.                 Ahmad was buried in a pile of books and LSAT practice tests when her sister called to tell her the US was under attack and authorities believed Muslim extremists were to blame.                 “I flung the books from my lap and started pacing around the house, thinking what would happen,” Ahmad told CNN. “I had that same feeling when Donald Trump was elected President in 2016. What will happen to us?”                 Her heart broke for all the innocent people who died. She also knew the backlash against Muslims would be harsh, and wondered if her law career was over before it could even start.                 It wasn’t long before news of hate crimes targeting Muslims began to make national headlines. Some Muslim women who typically wore the hijab removed their headscarves, but Ahmad refused.                 She described her hijab as a “shield” and the source of her courage.                  “I didn’t care if I stuck out like a sore thumb,” Ahmad said. “I remember a few days later when I went back to my LSAT class and stopped at a nearby gas station, a man yelled at me, ‘Go back to your country.’ I stared back at him and his pathetic existence and walked away.”                 Almost immediately, Ahmad began organizing within her community to educate and advocate for Muslims.                 “I don’t think I paused to process what had happened on 9/11, because I was too busy responding. I couldn’t grieve, because I felt under siege,” Ahmad said. “Everything changed suddenly. The ground beneath our feet was shifting. At the same time, there was no way as an American-born, Berkeley-educated Muslim woman I would cower in this situation.”                 She organized local meetings that brought the Muslim community, government officials and law enforcement together to tackle such issues as civil rights protections and hate crime reporting. When the US declared its “War on Terror” and invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, she helped organize anti-war rallies in Orlando that were attended by thousands. She was even invited to speak at Church Center for the United Nations about women’s rights and wartime violence.                 All the while, Ahmad silently battled depression, anxiety, and paranoia that she attributes to the backlash she faced after 9/11.                 Now, as a law professor, she aims to inspire young people to continue fighting for Muslim rights in the US.                 “Muslims now are stronger as a community,” she said. “While in many ways we are so powerless and silenced, we have fought back against stereotypes. We have added our own narratives.”                 Aneelah Afzali, 44, is an Afghan American community organizer in Seattle.                 Before coming to the US, her family fled as refugees from Afghanistan to Germany to escape an invasion by the former Soviet Union.                 In America, they hoped to build a new and promising future for themselves. But the journey toward a better life away from war and injustice wasn’t going to be easy.                 On the morning of the attacks, Afzali was glued to the TV in her dorm room, watching in horror as the World Trade Center’s towers fell. “I had difficulty breathing, and a sickening feeling grew in my belly – about those killed, about what this would mean for our country and the world,” she said.                 Then came worries that her family, friends and community were also at risk.                 “Here I was, grieving like other Americans for those killed and their family and loved ones – but unlike other Americans, I knew Muslims could not simply grieve,” said Afzali. “Even though Muslims were killed in the attacks, and Muslims were part of the frontline workers risking their lives to try to save so many in New York and beyond, Muslims were still being demonized and collectively blamed. And that broke my heart.”                 Afzali said she felt “disgusted, angry and sad” that the perpetrators claimed Islam as their religion.                 As hate crimes targeting Muslims increased, so did her anxiety. She was especially concerned for her parents, who owned a small market and gas station. When her father hung an American flag at the store, she wondered if it was enough to protect them from bigots.                 After graduating from law school, Afzali worked for two firms and ran the legal department at a healthcare IT company. She did her best to educate those around her about Islam and American Muslims, but always felt she could do more.                 In 2013, after what Afzali calls a “spiritual transformation,” she left her legal career andfounded the American Muslim Empowerment Network (AMEN), a grassroots organization dedicated to educating Americans on Islam and building coalitions to fight Islamophobia. AMEN has trained more than 5,000 people on related issues.                  Despite the group’s success, Afzali worries that recent events in Afghanistan could spark a new wave of bigotry and violence against Muslims in the US.                 “I fear the narrative may shift again because we often see the wholly inappropriate conflation of the brutal behavior of groups like the Taliban with the teachings of Islam, which drives Islamophobia,” she said. “And with the looming Afghan refugee crisis, we may also experience an increase in xenophobia as well.”                 The hope, she says, is that Americans will take all the positive things they’ve learned about Muslims since 9/11 and use it to work toward unity and justice.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

In the anthology “It’s Not About The Burqa,” editor Mariam Khan highlights the importance of centering Muslim women in this discussion, writing that they are “more than burqas, more than hijabs, and more than society has allowed us to be until now.”                 “We are not asking for permission any more. We are taking up space.”                  As Muslim women find themselves marginalized by society, Khan speaks to the way that they must forge their own narratives and create visibility in spaces that weren’t built for them.                  That’s exactly what parkour athlete Sara Mudallal is doing.                  By practicing the sport, Mudallal hopes she can encourage more women to enter what she describes as a “male dominated” field.                  “It’s kind of intimidating for women to sometimes come in and hang out and things like that. But now, recently, more women have been showing up, so it’s been more comfortable for women to come in and practice,” 26-year-old Mudallal tells CNN Sport.                  “It starts with one and you have to stand up for that, and then you bring more people in.”                 In most of the parkour jams she attends – where parkour practitioners congregate and train together – she says she’s often the only hijabi athlete.                  “I still am like the only person who wears the hijab, of course […] we still have a long way to go with that for women to feel confident in themselves,” she says.                  But Mudallal is used to standing out.                 She grew up in Los Angeles, where she was athlete of the year in high school – and garnered the same title in middle school three years in a row.                  “I’m very well-rounded. Like I can play soccer, I can play basketball, I can play football. I can play tennis. Except golf – I don’t know how to play golf,” she muses.                  When she was 12, her mother enrolled her in karate classes, where she went on to earn a first and second degree black belt.                  At the beginning of 2015, Mudallal decided to start wearing a headscarf. That same year, a friend introduced her to parkour.                  Having gained significant lower body strength and core balance from karate, she says she was built for the sport.                  “My legs were already pretty strong,” Mudallal says. “In terms of taking a bad landing … I was safe.”                 “I’ve always loved climbing and jumping on things and didn’t really know that was a sport, didn’t really know it was a technique.”                 As a beginner, Mudallal says she was welcomed into the parkour and freerunning community with open arms.                  “I do not feel that people did not want me in the group,” she says. “I didn’t give them that chance to make me feel that way. It’s about personality, it’s about how strong you are. If you are shy doing anything because of what you’re wearing, you have to check yourself with that, then why are you wearing it, you know?                 “I didn’t really care, if I was wearing or not wearing [a headscarf], my interests are still the same. And I really wanted to do parkour, so I went in regardless of what I look like on the outside.”                 While sport has always given Mudallal the space to express herself, Iranian parkour coach and former national gymnast Fatemeh Akrami has memories of feeling hampered as a young athlete.                  Growing up as a shy child, Akrami’s mother signed her up for local gymnastics classes when she was six, in the hopes of bringing her out of her shell.                  “I was a super shy girl, I didn’t even say hi to strangers. I was hiding behind my mother’s back because I was so shy,” the 27-year-old Tehran native tells CNN Sport.                  Despite her initial apprehension, Akrami quickly excelled. She says she won her first medal at a national competition when she was 12 and joined the national team a year later. Akrami went on to clinch two gold medals and one silver at the Islamic Solidarity Games in Iran in 2007.                  But while Akrami was enjoying success in the spotlight, she was struggling behind the scenes.                  She says that due to international gymnastics dress code rules at the time, she wasn’t able to compete on a global stage in accordance with Iran’s mandatory hijab law, which was enacted by the Islamic Republic in 1983.                 Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the country hasn’t dispatched a single female athlete to participate in the Olympics in swimming, wrestling or gymnastics – including at this year’s Tokyo Games.                  “It’s even harder for the girls in Iran,” Akrami says. “You train like an Olympian, but you never get there, so it’s hard to keep yourself motivated.”                 “I think like in ten years I didn’t attend a funeral, a wedding, a birthday party, none of them,” she adds.                  Dealing with the pressure of competing in any high intensity sport is challenging, but Akrami says that juggling the demands of training while attending school was doubly exhausting.                   “Gymnastics is a very hard sport. You have to put a lot of effort because you have to be mentally and physically prepared to be in a competitive level,” she says. “We were experiencing a lot of pressure.”                 “In the weekdays, I used to go to school from 7:00 a.m. until 1p.m. And then from the school, my mother used to pick me up and then [go] straight to the gym until 10:00 p.m,” she adds. “So in the Friday, which was the weekend […] there was no rest. So we had to train from 9:00 in the morning until 9:00 in the evening.                 “Training hard gives you mental pressure because you get tired, you have school, you have homework, you have training. Like sometimes, the training don’t go well, you don’t get the skill right. It takes too long, sometimes you get injured.                 “I don’t remember sleeping at night without having pain.”                 After Akrami left her career as a professional gymnast at the age of 18, she was looking for a fresh start.                  She had just begun university, when one of her peers encouraged her to try out parkour.                  “It was like, ‘OK, what’s next?,’” Akrami says. “I always needed something more because gymnastics is a very exciting sport and […] every day you need the adrenaline rush.                 “He stopped in a park and told me, ‘Do you want to try some of the parkour skills?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, let’s give it a try. I think in the first thirty minutes, I got five or six […] skills of parkour, and I myself was super, super surprised.”                 While Akrami used to feel restricted by gymnastics, she says parkour gives her “self-confidence.”                 “In gymnastics, everything is so disciplined, you have to do everything just as they say. No more, no less. But in parkour, you can do any move with your body,” she says. “The philosophy of parkour is all about the freedom.”                 “You can do parkour wherever you want, whenever you want and with any dress you want. Like there’s no dress code. I can compete in a competition with my Islamic dress and that’s fine.                 “And you can do all the skills with your own body, with your own style, so it gives you a lot of choices. That’s the feeling of freedom that parkour gives.”                 Mudallal adds, “What’s cool about parkour is that every single person moves differently.”                 “It makes me feel free. It makes me feel like possibilities are endless, and I can do anything,” Mudallal says. “I fell in love with it as soon as I started.”                 Since Mudallal started practicing parkour, she has gone from strength to strength.                 Since posting videos of her freerunning adventures on social media, she has amassed over 35,000 followers.                  In July 2021, she attended the Red Bull Art of Motion competition in Greece – widely considered one of the highest-profile freerunning events in the sport.                  “It’s like for the first time, I felt like, ‘Oh, my God, like this is fate.’ Like this is being handed to me on a platter and I’m not going to say no to moving forward,” Mudallal says.                  “I just decided to, like, move forward with it and practice more and take it seriously more, but take it seriously in a way where I would still love it and not be dragged to go do parkour because it’s like my job. No, I want to do it because I love doing it,” she adds.                  In 2018, Mudallal also became the first hijabi athlete to appear on the assault course TV show American Ninja Warrior.                  “It was definitely something,” she says. “First time experiencing a game show […] understanding how TV and Hollywood […] how all that works.”                 “In terms of the hijab aspect, yes, that’s like my title. I am the first hijabi to go on American Ninja Warrior, but it’s like I was literally walking like any other person,” she adds. “They mentioned it on TV, but it wasn’t very focused on that.”                 Even though Mudallal is best known for being a hijabi parkour athlete, she says that being known by a singular label can feel reductive.                  “It’s a title I’ve had for a very long time. And moving forward, I don’t want to be only known as that because anybody could be a hijabi parkour athlete, but are they good at what they’re doing?” she says. “I want to show I’m definitely more than that.                 “It’s not up to people that wear hijab who play those sports to break them [stereotypes]. But it’s good to build that awareness that, ‘Hey, sit down, you know, like, stop creating that stereotype.’                 “I hope one day […] people will see me past the hijab.”                 Mudallal says that for some Muslim girls, making the decision to step outside one’s comfort zone can be met with hostility from people both inside and outside their community.                  Six years into her parkour journey, she says she still receives critical comments from people on social media.                 “In terms of what people say, I’m very past that, very past that. Because imagine if, like, I did stop parkour, I did listen [to] what people say – I’m the one who’s going to be miserable, like they’re just going to keep moving on with their life,” Mudallal says.                  “My word of advice to everyone who wants to move forward with this is stop asking, ‘Should I move forward?’ Do it. It’s a simple thing to say, but it’s a hard thing to do.                 “Everyone else is going to move forward, but someone’s always going to be stopping you for some reason. So you have to move past that. You have to get over that wall.”                 Akrami’s message to young Muslim girls? “Don’t let anything stop you.”                 “Go for it. Try and you’re going to accomplish it. I accept the fact that it might be harder a little bit, but it’s not impossible.”                 Luckily, both athletes can fall back on the support of their families.                  Mudallal says, “What I’ve noticed is […] sometimes in terms of culture, it’s like Arab fathers are very restrictive of what they want their daughters doing. And what’s different about my father is that because I’m the oldest child, he was always, ‘Sara, you’re going to grow up and you’re going to be independent, you’re going to grow your own business, you know, you’re going to make your own money.’                 “My mom is the same thing, you know, ‘You got to be strong, got to put your foot down, be confident.’ From where I am today, they’re just always, always, always supporting me.”                 Reminiscing about her gymnastics career, Akrami says she “gave up so many times.”                 “We never were a very rich family, but they gave me all I needed, all I wanted […] financially, mentally, […] so that was why I could stand all the pressure,” she adds. “They are super proud of where I am today.”                 Mudallal hopes that by sharing her story, she can encourage people to appreciate the depth and nuance of her journey and create space for more young Muslim women to step into the parkour industry.                  “I hope to see more girls like me pursue it,” she says. “The importance of me doing parkour. It’s just an expression of […] what I preach, of my movement. What I’ve grown, what I’ve taken in, what I’m showing out.                 “Parkour is still fairly a male dominated sport. And for women in general, they are increasing for sure, year by year and […] actually making a statement.”                 Akrami also hopes to see more girls freerunning, which is why she became a parkour coach when she was about 20.                  “I was like, ‘OK, there are so many girls and they are so passionate about parkour. You have to teach them what you know,’” Akrami says.                  So far, she says she’s taught 100 girls how to parkour and given certified training to about 50 more to become parkour coaches themselves.                  “When they get this skill, it gives me a better feeling than when I do the skill,” Akrami says.  “Because when they feel things, when they feel the joy, when they get excited, like, ‘OK, I got the skills,’ they’re screaming and running.”                 By sharing her knowledge, she hopes she can teach her students life skills, such as resilience and determination.                  “I’m really happy to let them [students] know, at least, that they can do this. So many of them are like, ‘No, we cannot train. It is impossible to train in Iran, to train parkour in Iran.’ At least they realize that it’s possible, you just haven’t got there. But it’s possible,” Akrami says.                  “It’s amazing how when you start doing parkour, it gives you the vision that nothing is as hard as it looks, even in life,” she adds. “When you try it, when you succeed and you are like, ‘Wow, did I really do that? Did I really jump that far?’ Yes, you did it. It was looking super hard […] but you never know unless you try it.”                 Ultimately, parkour is rooted in a counterculture that gives people who can be sidelined by society a way to center their stories and make themselves as visible as possible.                  Like Mudallal, Akrami shares her videos of her parkour tricks online to “let other people in the other countries and other continents of the Earth, to let them know that we exist.”                 “It’s like very common, and it’s a very interesting sport that so many girls are so passionate to start and to do. And yeah, we exist, we train parkour, and parkour has no limits and has no borders.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

She is the author of several books, including “Against White Feminism: Notes of Disruption” (W.W. Norton, August 2021). The views expressed here are hers. View more opinion on CNN.             “Turn Turk Tim and Renounce Thy Faith/In words as well as actions/Is it worse to follow Mahomet than the Devil?” So wrote Benjamin Franklin in “Poor Richard’s Almanack” in 1741. Franklin’s maxim here, comparing the Prophet Muhammad to Satan, is but one example of early American Islamophobia.     According to scholars Peter Gottschalk and Gabriel Greenberg, one in five enslaved persons brought to the United States from Africa were believed to be Muslim, but Puritan leaders like Cotton Mather dismissed the existence of Muslims altogether. Historian Thomas Kidd quotes Mather’s smug claim, “We are afar off, in a Land, which never had (that I ever heard of) one Mahometan breathing in it.”                  The Islamophobia that exists in the US today, politically weaponized as a legitimate political view by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, weighs heavily on Muslim-American shoulders. My daughter, who was months old when the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon and the hijacking and crash of United 93 in Pennsylvania happened, dreads September 11 just like so many other American Muslim children. Every September since the attacks, it seems, bullying and teasing ensue in American schools.                  In this way, Muslim-American children are rendered suspect year after year, ensuring that they always bear the wounds of being unfairly demonized.                 But as the world acknowledges the 20th anniversary of the attacks, it’s crucial to understand that America did not start discriminating against Muslims after 9/11. The seeds of Islamophobia in this country were sown long ago and nourished for centuries, though they bore their most poisonous fruit after September 11, 2001.      Related articleIt's time for America to do some 'nation building' at home             Recognizing these early roots of American Islamophobia, rather than focusing on a singular event, is one important way to counter its further (and still growing) proliferation. According to the Pew Foundation, in 2017 a whopping 48% of American Muslims said they had personally experienced discrimination, despite the fact that they make up a paltry 1.1% of the total US population. In March 2021, Pew found that 78% of Americans say Muslims are likely to face discrimination in the US.                 It was in the last century that the US government also got into the act of singling out Muslims for mistreatment. In February 1987, the New York Times ran a story about a detailed memo originating from within the Immigration and Naturalization Service, then a division of the Department of Justice. It outlined a plan to apprehend, detain and deport large numbers of Iranians and Arabs living in the United States in case of a national emergency – not unlike the detainment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.                  The memo reflected then-President Ronald Reagan’s desire for a more aggressive approach to the growing threat of terrorism faced by Americans, evident in bombings and hijackings in the 1980s. The work was the product of a committee within the INS authorized by the DOJ. After the memo became public, according to Politico, the committee was terminated and the plan abandoned. In interviews later, also according to Politico, committee members defended the rationale for the memo but also insisted the plan was not seriously considered for implementation.                 Not long after the towers fell 20 years ago, Muslim non-citizens were indeed told to report to “special registration.” The National Security Entry-Exit System (NSEERS), which carried echoes of what the 1980s plan proposed, required all male visa-holders above the age of 16 coming from 24 Muslim-majority countries to submit to being photographed, finger-printed and interrogated, even if they had no connection whatsoever to any terrorist activity and had never been accused of any crime.      Related articleOn 9/11, my 'White card' was revoked According to a 2012 Penn State Law and Rights Working Group report, nearly 80,000 men were singled out and subjected to NSEERS because they largely came from countries that shared a religion with the 9/11 hijackers. The message to ordinary Americans was clear: Muslims were either terrorists or terror sympathizers.                 While he was evasive about the details, Trump often spoke of establishing what amounted to a Muslim registry. But Trump’s virulent Islamophobia was never unique.                 I know people who were harassed and questioned by agents of the FBI. Right-wing media stoked Americans’ fears, while the NYPD racially targeted Muslims as part of their “Muslim Surveillance Program.” The program was the target of several lawsuits, which settled without the NYPD’s admission of wrongdoing; then-mayor Michael Bloomberg’s failure to apologize for the program cast a shadow over his 2020 presidential run.                 In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the West and the United States committed what essayist Pankaj Mishra has termed “intellectual suicide.” The much-touted Enlightenment values of tolerance, cosmopolitanism and a public sphere open to all were rejected with a resounding thud.      Related articleADL head: On NY Islamic center, we were wrong, plain and simple               The American military’s occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan only worsened the problem. The US’s handling of those conflicts made it even easier for everyday Americans to point fingers at American Muslims as the enemy within. Popular culture has helped to harden these fears. The apprehension of Islamic terrorists in shows like “24” and “Quantico” and movies like “Zero Dark Thirty” further engrossed Americans in an armchair version of the War on Terror.                  Twenty years after 9/11, many American Muslims are still forced to live an apologetic existence, one where being pulled off planes for simply “traveling while Muslim” and speaking Arabic has remained all too common. Despite the defeat of Trump and the installation of a Democratic administration in the White House that is avowedly committed to civil rights, Islamophobia still undergirds what defines a terrorist act.                  That’s largely because the provision of the Patriot Act (enacted after the 9/11 attacks and intended to shore up US national security and itself a product of pervasive anti-Muslim fear) that criminalizes support for terrorist organizations cannot be applied domestically without running afoul of the First Amendment and other complications involved in labeling domestic groups as terrorist organizations. What counts as “terrorism” legally is primarily limited to foreign threats. As such, White supremacists and other domestic radicals and terrorists, while noted by the FBI and others as a far greater threat than foreign terrorist elements, too often evade scrutiny and are not labeled or charged as terrorists. Not only does this make our country less safe, but it also helps – in tandem with cultural representations like the ones above – to perpetuate stereotypes about Muslims as terrorists.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             Muslim Americans, meanwhile, still have little recourse in a political environment where they are regarded by many as perpetual foreigners, even as White extremists radicalize in greater numbers, flexing themselves in moments like the insurrection at the US Capitol. All Americans should know this and be ashamed of this.                  Over 250 years may have passed since Benjamin Franklin’s racist sarcasm, but too many American Muslims who have known no country other than the United States still face pressure to “renounce thy Faith” to be considered truly American. Reckoning with post-9/11 Islamophobia alone won’t address that history – and unless we do that, the future for American Muslims remains uncertain.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Because I am Muslim,” she said.                 In early July, the 32-year-old pilot and proud feminist was among more than 80 Muslim women – journalists, writers and influencers – whose photos were posted on a mock app called Sulli Deals, a derogatory term for Muslim women typically used by right-wing Hindu men.                   Users were offered a chance to “buy” the women like commodities in an auction – and while the women weren’t actually for sale, they say it left them scared, traumatized and angry.     I don’t use my surname in Uber and Ola. I have a religion neutral first name.Am I hiding my Muslim identity?Yes…you bet I am.             Two months later, the site has been taken down by US-based platform GitHub, but the women are still angry none its creators have been detained or arrested. They say the lack of action highlights the discrimination Muslim women face in Hindu-dominated India, where outspoken advocates of women’s rights are singled out for attack on social media.                 They say they won’t be silenced.                 Khan’s complaint is one of at least four filed with Indian police by victims, opposition lawmakers and activists. Praveen Duggal, a senior official for Delhi police, confirmed India’s cyber cell unit is investigating the complaints, but said he could not share any further details because it was a “sealed matter.”                 India has laws targeting cyber crime, but it doesn’t have a specific legislation against cyber bullying, despite a surge in abuse directed at Indian women.                  Khan and other feminist activists say they are being targeted by men hiding behind handles on social media, who are attempting to intimidate them – and Indian authorities aren’t doing enough to stop it.                  Besides their religion, one thing the women share is their strong view on gender rights in India.                 By most global measures, the country performs poorly on gender equality. Fewer than a quarter of Indian women are in the labor market, and even then they earn about 20% of a man’s wage, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap 2021 report.                  Violence against women remains a problem, with more than one in four women abused or controlled by her partner during her lifetime, the report added.      “Men are threatened by women who are assertive in our country.”Hana Mohsin KhanPilot             No explicit threats of violence were made against the women on the Sulli Deals app, but they say the publication of their Twitter handles with photos copied from their social media accounts was an invitation for abuse.                 Khan has 15,000 followers on Twitter and regularly receives hateful comments – primarily from men. She said the volume increased after her photo appeared on the app.                   “Men are threatened by women who are assertive in our country,” she said. “And vocal, outspoken Muslim women are the biggest level of threat in their eyes.”                 Of India’s 580 million women, approximately 6.5% are Muslim, according to the most recent government census conducted in 2011.                 After the “auction” photos went viral on social media, 21 of the women joined a WhatsApp group one of them created for mutual support, including poet Nabiya Khan.                 Nabiya Khan regularly posts her prose to Twitter to amplify the voices of marginalized people in India, which she believes caught the attention of the Sulli Deals trolls.                 “Men think sexual violence is a valid punishment (for being an outspoken woman),” said Nabiya Khan, who is no relation to Hana Mohsin Khan.     When i say Muslims, i am speaking for myself here. We might be tired but we will never give up.             She has also lodged a complaint with police but says she hasn’t heard anything.                 “I was expecting that my complaint would be met with dignity but seeing that no step has been taken in the direction of justice, it just makes me angry,” she said.                  The women say the online abuse is indicative of the mood towards Muslims in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014.                 In recent years, reports of anti-Muslim hate crimes have increased and several BJP-ruled states have passed legislation that critics say has contributed to a rise in religious polarization.              For example, in 2019, India’s parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims.                 Anti-Muslim bias is also present in the police force, according to a survey of about 12,000 police officers. The 2019 Status of Policing in India report found about half of the Indian police surveyed thought Muslims were “naturally prone” towards committing crime.                 Zakia Soman, a social activist and founder of the Indian Muslim Women’s Movement, said prejudice was also apparent online, where attacks against Muslim women had escalated in recent years.                  “You have paid bots on social media who target women, journalists or anyone who is dissenting in this country,” Soman said.     “If it is women from another community, it becomes bestial. You are talking about auctioning women like cattle.”Zakia SomanIndian Muslim Women’s Movement             “These conservative and radical (people) are obsessed with women’s sexuality. And if it is women from another community, it becomes bestial. You are talking about auctioning women like cattle. It shows a medieval mindset.”                 Cyber abuse is a major problem in India, particularly against women.                 According to a 2019 report from Amnesty International, Indian female politicians receive nearly twice as much abuse online compared to their counterparts in the US and the United Kingdom.                  The report examined the 7.1 million tweets that mentioned female politicians and found that nearly 1 million posts were abusive or problematic and included hateful and sexist abuse.                 In India, many cases also go unreported, according to cyber law expert Karnika Seth.                  “(After the victim) is pursued, they want closure. In many of these cases, the families and the victim want to wrap up the case, especially in cases of cyber stalking,” she said.

How Twitter became so toxic for India's women politicians             During an August 8 parliament session, India’s Minister of Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw said the internet’s rapid growth had caused a “rise in cyber crime across the world.”                  However, India doesn’t have a uniform law against cyber bullying and the number of cases of registered with police in India is low.                 Just seven cases of cyber bullying against women and children were registered in the country in 2017. That rose to 40 in 2018 and 45 in 2019, according to the National Crimes Record Bureau. It is unclear how many went to court, and if any convictions were made.                 Activists say the Indian penal system is confusing and exhausting to navigate, so many victims don’t bother to file a complaint. If they do, lawyers have to submit electronic evidence pulled from the accused’s device, which is difficult – if not impossible – to obtain, Seth said.                 And if a complaint does make it to court, it can also take years for a verdict.                 “There is such a huge backlog (for cyber crimes),” Seth said. “The police are not well equipped either.”                 It’s not the first time Muslim women have been targeted in fake online auctions.                  In May, an Indian YouTube account called “Liberal Doge” uploaded a video similar to the app, which appeared to “auction” Muslim Pakistani women, posting photographs without their consent, according to local media reports.                 The account has since been deleted by YouTube for violating its “strict policies” that prohibit hate speech, including content promoting violence or hatred based on gender and religion, a YouTube spokesperson told CNN.                 According to YouTube, three similar accounts were also removed. It is unclear if they were run by the same person. CNN was not able to independently verify the content of the channels.

On July 30, Priyanka Chaturvedi, a politician for the opposing Shiv Sena party, wrote to IT Minister Vaishnaw urging him to take action against Sulli Deals and Liberal Doge.                  In her letter, which she posted to Twitter, Chaturvedi pointed out that the “lack of stringent and efficient preventative laws and punishments” is a motivating factor for such crimes to continue in the future.                  “In a country where women are struggling with gender bias, these incidents yet again lay bare the protection and safety of women, especially in cyberspace,” the letter said. “It pains me to see that hardly any movement with regards to this case has been taken as of now despite the seriousness of it.”                 CNN contacted Vaishnaw’s office for comment but did not receive a response.       “Muslim women will not be suppressed into silence.”Nabiya KhanPoet             Hana Mohsin Khan and Nabiya Khan say the lack of action by authorities highlights the lack of available support in India for victims of online abuse.

And it is in this spirit that I have been reflecting on a stance ADL took 11 years ago when we opposed the location of the then-proposed Park51 Islamic Community Center & Mosque near Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan. Originally known as Cordoba House, and modeled after institutions such as the JCC in Manhattan, now known as the Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan, and the 92nd Street Y, the project planned to include community and cultural spaces with the goal of fostering interfaith dialogue and promoting peace and understanding. I believe the stance we took is one for which we owe the Muslim community an apology.                  Further, amidst ADL’s reflection, and approaching the 20th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, our nation’s sudden and disastrously planned withdrawal from Afghanistan is heartbreaking. For me personally, and ADL as a whole, this catastrophe made our Teshuvah all the more urgent.                  Today one can see how the Cordoba House could have helped to heal our country as we nursed the wounds from the horror of 9/11. As we near the 20th anniversary of that tragic day, the need for healing remains. Arguably, it has attained an increased urgency after the tumult of recent years and especially now as we prepare to welcome refugees from Afghanistan, including many who supported our troops and our ideals, and now flee the onslaught of the Taliban. Sadly, rather than heal, we have seen Islamophobia persist in ugly ways.                   As the leading anti-hate organization in the US, with experts tracking extremism of all sorts, ADL is committed to help our Muslim allies counter Islamophobia. Indeed, we have been doing so for many decades. And this is exactly why, as a dear Muslim friend told me recently, ADL’s stance on the Cordoba House project was “a punch in the gut to the Muslim community.” I hope that by righting this wrong, we can be better allies in the fight against the rise in anti-Muslim hate that is coming – and it is coming.     Related articleWe must keep our promises for the little girl huddled in a refugee camp. That girl was me             I say this, because as most Americans were praying for the Afghan people, generously donating funds and preparing to welcome some number of Afghan civilians into our great nation, some so-called “experts” began spreading alarmist and Islamophobic disinformation in shameless attempts to block these brutalized civilians from coming to the United States. Adding to the alarm, these insidious conspiracy theories are coming during a time that the FBI is reporting the highest level of hate crimes in over a decade.                  And that is likely just the opening chorus of anti-Muslim sentiment that I fear will swell in the weeks, months and years ahead.                  We’ve seen it before.                  We saw it in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The FBI tracked a massive spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2001, compared to 2000:  a jump from 28 incidents to 481. Muslims were profiled, attacked and killed, mosques were desecrated, slander flowed in the media and even members of the Sikh community were attacked simply because they wore turbans.                  And we saw it again in 2010, when a media storm rose up around Cordoba House. While the country was in many ways less polarized in 2010 than in our present moment, it was still a fraught time. A time when you could almost see the lines that divide us today being drawn.                  When Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf and Daisy Khan envisioned the creation of Cordoba House, they intended to foster better relations between the Islamic world and America, and to serve as a public rejection of extremism.      Related articleTrump adviser Stephen Miller warned of 'Iraqs and 'Stans' in the US while slow-walking the entry of Afghan allies             Sadly, it was portrayed very differently. Some polemicists immediately pounced. The media dubbed it the “Ground Zero Mosque,” an unfair name that instantly cast the project in a negative light. Mayor Michael Bloomberg argued for it. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich railed against it. The impassioned families of victims could be heard on both sides of the debate. Other public figures piled on, virtually climbing over each other to be heard. The tension reached a boiling point as local community boards repeatedly voted in favor of the project amidst continued protests and counter protests.                  Then ADL weighed in. Although before my tenure, I know that ADL struggled with the decision, trying to balance a genuine desire to support a noble endeavor but also to support the victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist attack who voiced opposition. And so, ADL decided not to oppose the project outright,  but instead tried to take a nuanced position, advocating for a location change that the organization felt would help lead to the type of reconciliation the project itself was meant to represent.                   There are likely other ways ADL’s voice could have improved rather than impaired the conversation.  For instance, as some of the organizers later reflected, more engagement early on with victims’ families could have gone a long way in achieving the ultimate goal of fostering reconciliation and peace. Daisy Kahn once explained how the goal of Cordoba House was to “repair the breach and be at the front and center to start the healing.” Perhaps ADL should have helped facilitate such a discussion.                  And yet, we chose to weigh in differently. And through deep reflection and conversation with many friends within the Muslim community, the real lesson is a simple one: we were wrong, plain and simple.                  Ultimately, the project as envisioned never came to be – with the development primarily becoming another familiar condominium tower.                   We can’t change the past. But we accept responsibility for our unwise stance on Cordoba House, apologize without caveat and commit to doing our utmost going forward to use our expertise to fight anti-Muslim bias as allies.      Related articleThe leader of the anti-Taliban resistance speaks out             As we see the signs of another surge in anti-Muslim hate, it is imperative that the collective we – civil society, the business community, elected officials and the American citizenry writ large – embrace the idea and intent of Cordoba House and work together to foster peace.                  We have seen Muslims demonized in recent years in ways that make the heart ache – from the early talk of a “Muslim registry” in days after the 2016 election to the travel ban imposed the following year on Muslim-majority countries to the unfounded conspiratorial claims of Muslims invading the US that still show up in the rantings of some prime-time cable news personalities. This is in addition to the all-too frequent use of slander and stereotypes of Islam on social media platforms. ADL’s most recent survey of online hate and harassment found that Muslim respondents regularly experience identity-based harassment. This kind of ugliness seems to be on a permanent loop.                 It’s clear that some of the wild charges lodged against Cordoba House – that it was organized by “radical Islamists” and “terrorist sympathizers”  – were part of this pattern. And we must not allow this pattern to continue, especially as Afghans seek refuge in the promise of America.                 This must start with the Biden administration stepping up to ensure Afghan refugees do not face burdensome roadblocks or are unjustly denied entry to our nation. This is why over 300 organizations, including ADL, signed a recent letter to President Joe Biden expressing “our support for a robust humanitarian response from the United States and our commitment to assist Afghans in danger” while also imploring the administration to “expand opportunities for Afghans to seek refuge.”      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             But the work doesn’t stop there. It is on all of us to fight back against the Islamophobic attempts to prevent refugees from gaining asylum. Again, we already see the disturbing “invasion” claim being thrown around again in direct reference to Afghan refugees. Some have tried to rationalize their hate by invoking the White supremacist “Great Replacement” theory. All of it is wrong.                  We are better than this. We actively can choose not only to reject hate, but to embrace those in need. ADL’s stance on Cordoba House was an error that pales alongside the abrupt abandonment of our Afghan allies, but all of us should draw upon our better angels and welcome those poor and huddled masses who today seek our support.

Thoughts and prayers. Promises of “never again.” They are not enough. Seven years after ISIS committed genocide against the Yazidi community, my ethno-religious minority, in Iraq, hundreds of thousands of people remain internally displaced and more than 2,800 women and children remain missing. Shelter, clean water, health care and education are luxuries, if available at all.                 Those of us who were there – who ran for our lives to the protection of Mount Sinjar, who heard the gunshots as men and older women were shot and dumped into mass graves, and who, like me, were sold into sexual slavery – cannot forget what happened or how the world ignored our cries for help.                  After escaping from my ISIS captors, I lived in a camp alongside hundreds of Yazidis. I felt the raw humiliation of residing in makeshift tents without privacy, work, or education. I saw these conditions erode our traditions, our way of life, and our communal ties. During that time, I imagined my life swallowed up by a statistic – becoming one of the millions of displaced people who live, on average, 10-20 years in a camp.     Related articleISIS Fast Facts             Today, much of my family still lives in that same cramped caravan. My niece has never known life outside the camp. When I visit family, the space between us is emptied by an overwhelming silence. We do not need to utter a single sound to communicate our shared sorrow. I can see the pain clearly in their eyes.                  The questions that nag at me day in and day out are: Why will the world not act? What do the Iraqi government and international community hope to gain from ignoring our homeland’s redevelopment, deprioritizing accountability and relegating Yazidis to life in displacement?                 Seven years later, the Yazidi community’s struggle for survival is still largely ignored. There have been no multilateral search and rescue efforts for the missing women and children. Around 80 mass graves lie unexhumed around Sinjar, the Yazidi homeland where ISIS carried out its genocide. Neither Iraqi national nor international courts have established proceedings to try ISIS criminals for genocide and sexual violence.     Related articleUN report warns ISIS is reasserting under new leader believed to be behind Yazidi genocide              Regardless of the rationale, the results are clear. ISIS has come one step closer to accomplishing its goal of preventing Yazidis from living in our homeland with dignity. Seeing this, other terrorist groups and oppressive regimes can only be encouraged to commit genocide and sexual violence, knowing that they will not be held accountable.                  Governments and international institutions take the easy way out time and time again. They formulate promises and claim to resolve territorial disputes. For instance, under the Sinjar Agreement, concluded in October, Iraq’s federal government and Kurdish regional authorities agreed to stabilize local governance and security. But they don’t follow through with steps as easy as appointing a local mayor.                 The United Nations collects evidence of the atrocities through its Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da’esh/ISIS (UNITAD), formed in 2018. But the UN stops short of referring the case to the International Criminal Court or establishing a court by treaty for prosecuting ISIS’ crimes against humanity. It funds short-term aid to displacement camps instead of investing in sustainably rebuilding Sinjar.

The Sinjar Agreement and UNITAD’s evidence collection would make significant differences in the daily lives of Yazidis if they were acted upon – if those in power cared enough to extend a helping hand.                 With every shortcut taken by national and international authorities, the road to recovery for my community becomes longer and more dangerous. Is seven years not long enough? There are no shortcuts available to Yazidis – no way to truncate our trauma. But still, we have not given up.                  We do not want your pity. We want the international community to take responsibility for protecting the basic rights of Yazidis by investing in Sinjar’s redevelopment and holding ISIS accountable.

A significant part of the current political and racial divides in the United States has been fueled by reports that America will become a majority-minority country within our lifetimes. Conspiratorial and racist so-called “replacement” theories have inspired White nationalists in American society, ranging from those bearing tiki torches in Charlottesville to Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the rioters at the US Capitol on January 6.                   In this context, the preliminary data from the new US Census – which reveals a declining White population – exposes ways in which America’s changing demographic landscape is stoking paranoia regarding the loss of White power, even as it also fuels ambitious hopes for the future of multiracial democracy.                   Headlines that tout a White population in decline further provoke existing fear, anxiety and anti-immigrant loathing. But at the same time, more Americans than ever are self-defining as multiracial, making headlines about the loss of White identity less of the proper focus than one about a 21st century multiracial democracy.

This map shows America’s changing landscape             Families like the one President Barack Obama grew up in, as the son of a Black Kenyan father and a White mother with Kansas roots whose sister was half Indonesian and whose maternal grandparents helped forge his identity, are not outliers; they are a growing branch on the national family tree. Framing this new Census data as the first decrease in the White population since 1790, as the Washington Post did, helps to fan the flames of racial and partisan rifts. Hispanic and Asian American young people driving national population growth augurs a future powered by citizens who reflect the diversity that is at the heart of our national story.                   Journalists report on facts, so it’s understandable that they would identify a large drop in the White population, reflected in data, as significant. Objectively speaking, it is.       Related articleThe Census shows the GOP base is shrinking fast. So why does its power seem secure?             Yet the trap of seeing the drop in White population as the only, or even the main, story of the Census data reinforces our own insistence on seeing these transformations through a cynical lens. Pitting White America against hordes of threatening “colored” people is part of a long, complex, and fraught history – one wherein changing definitions of “Whiteness” both expanded and restricted the boundaries of citizenship.                    This fear-driven narrative also has tremendous policy and historical implications. Republican-controlled state legislatures have used Census data in gerrymandering efforts to target Black voters and other voters of color. Their tactics have turned voter suppression from a blunt art into an exacting science that defies the spirit and intent of both the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.                   Narratives of White decline linked specifically to the Census arrived in the 21st century, shortly before America elected Obama, the nation’s first Black President. The reports helped to fuel White racial anxiety about maintaining racial, economic and cultural privileges that have become synonymous for many with American identity.                   The Obama presidency ignited a free for all in American politics that continues to this day. The rise of the Tea Party, Birther Movement, Donald Trump’s presidency and his “Make America Great Again” ethos all share deep-seated racial fears that have haunted the nation since its founding.       Related articleHistory shows we ignore Tucker Carlson at our peril             Over the past two decades, some Republicans have used forecast demographic changes related to the Census for partisan political advantage, helping to sustain and grow a whole ecosystem trafficking in racially intolerant appeals that have remade American politics. The rise of a right-wing public sphere we are now seeing – untethered to science, objective facts and past support for voting rights and racial justice – depends on a narrative that presents democracy as a zero-sum game, with historic White winners on the verge of being replaced by citizens and immigrants of color.      Concern over plunging White birthrates, both nationally and globally, center “replacement theory” conspiracies theories that view demographic shifts as fundamentally reordering power relations in a way that will lead to the end of Whiteness. Such nativistic fears traffic in racism against non-White groups and sexism by seeking to impose patriarchal control over women’s reproductive futures. And in the Age of Trump, racist narrative tropes about the nation’s future became more mainstream, trumpeted by right-wing media stars as an existential threat to White Americans.                  We have been here before. In the early 20th century, White nativists spread misinformation and racist conspiracy theories warning that the onslaught of immigrants and the threat of race-mixing would spell the end of what they proudly considered a White man’s republic. Anti-immigrant legislation, specifically 1924’s Johnson-Reed Act, instituted a quota system that made it virtually impossible for immigrants of color to enter the United States until the passage of 1965’s Hart-Celler Act, one of the cornerstones of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.      Related articleUS history holds a chilling warning about restricting votes             Toxic narratives of White decline are baked into this country’s history of institutional discrimination in ways that go back to the 19th century – and beyond anti-Black racism – as well. White nativism, buttressed by eugenics theories of scientific racism that classified non-White and non-Nordic races as inferior, discriminated against Irish, Italians and others during the 19th century. As the category of ethnic “Whiteness” shifted to include these previously marginalized European groups, however, the xenophobia and nativism never waned.                   The end of the Civil War and Black people’s hopes to compete in a free labor market against native-born and immigrant alike triggered further massive White anxiety, violence and racist policies that led directly to the Jim Crow system of legalized racial oppression that still impacts our democracy today.                  Today, contemporary right-wing media narratives frame America’s growing non-White population as a problem to be solved through gerrymandering, xenophobia and anti-democratic legislation that ensures White supremacy thrives for generations.                  And yet, America’s changing demographics tell a different, more inspiring story. Rather than a narrative of White decline, what if we saw in this data the increasing numbers of racially blended families and mixed-race children – and understood them as signs of a more racially diverse, economically just and culturally rich future?

If you’ve had your Covid shots, you may agree with Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama, who said recently: “Folks supposed to have common sense, but it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It’s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.”                 And it’s not just the masses who are letting us down but people close to us: our coworkers, friends, family members. You may be furious at what you see as the selfishness and ignorance and lack of civic responsibility in the people in your life who refuse to get the jab.                 And you’re not alone – social media is rife with posts that attempt to convince people to get vaccinated by explaining how wrongheaded they are. It’s human nature. You might be doing the same kind of browbeating yourself.                 But here’s a question: How’s that strategy working for you? After you lay into the anti-vaxxers and the vaccine-hesitant, are they thanking you for setting them straight and rushing to make appointments?                 Our guess is, that’s not what’s happening.                 Instead, those conversations get heated, things get said that can’t be unsaid and you both leave feeling angry, frustrated and resentful. In the moment, it can feel good to indulge our emotions and let them have it. But the cost is high: We damage the relationship and they don’t get vaccinated. Even when we present them with clear, seemingly convincing facts.                 There’s a well-documented phenomenon in psychology called the “backfire effect.” Giving people facts disproving their incorrect beliefs can actually reinforce those beliefs. Researchers have observed this phenomenon in the context of political misconceptions, voting preferences, the decision to vaccinate one’s children and whether to get a flu vaccine oneself. The more people are confronted with facts at odds with their opinions, the stronger they cling to those opinions.                 And if arguing with facts backfires, you know what backfires even more? Criticizing, blaming and shaming them for being thoughtless, selfish, stupid, ignorant or psychopathic. You can check this yourself: When was the last time you changed your behavior in response to someone blaming or shaming you?                 We want to say that we feel your pain. We’re both vaccinated. We’re disappointed that the Delta variant, combined with widespread vaccine hesitancy, is prolonging the pandemic and necessitating continued mask mandates and lockdowns to control its spread. And we’re mortified at the resulting unnecessary suffering and loss of life. We’re angry too.                 Like Gov. Ivey, we also feel the urge to convince them to change by giving them the facts, arguing with them and criticizing and shaming them for their selfish disregard for others.                 The truth is, we care deeply about the issue. And we also care deeply about our relationships. When the two collide, it feels like we have to choose. Do I risk getting a breakthrough infection by spending time in a confined space with my unvaccinated family member, or do I risk the relationship by refusing to be in her presence, or demand that she wear a mask, or try to convince her to do the right thing?                 How do we balance risk and relationship?                 We’d like to share a process that reduces risk through relationship. While it isn’t guaranteed to get the unvaccinated people in your life to drop everything and make an appointment for the shot, we think it will significantly increase your odds of success.     Related articleThe new seriousness of Amsterdam             Our approach hinges on your willingness to give up control; to acknowledge that the person you’re trying to change has autonomy and will make their own decision. Of course, what you’re giving up isn’t control; it’s the illusion of control. The person you’re talking to is always free to get vaccinated – or not. You don’t get to choose for them. That’s why you’re trying so hard to convince them.                 So when we can’t persuade with facts or criticism, what can we lead with instead?                 Two things: empathy and curiosity.                 When we demonstrate empathy, we show the other person that we believe they have valid needs and concerns. Even if we disagree with their position, we acknowledge that it makes sense to them.                 How do you show empathy to someone who doesn’t want to get the vaccine? Let’s make this real: Think about someone you want to convince. First, be OK with your own feelings. Are you furious at them? Disappointed? Terrified? Do you look down upon them?                 Feel those feelings, own them, and don’t beat yourself up for having them. Instead, have empathy for yourself. Your motivations are good. You want to reduce suffering, save lives and allow people to congregate freely again without fear of infection. You care deeply, and because of that you feel strongly about the topic.                 But now don’t act on those emotions either. Instead, extend your empathy to the other person. What do they care deeply about? Here’s what we’ve heard from the vaccine hesitant people in our lives:                 “I don’t want to put unknown chemicals in my body.”                 “I don’t trust pharmaceutical companies.”                 “I don’t want to be told what to do about my body.”                 “These vaccines have been rushed through without enough research, and they aren’t even fully approved by the FDA.”                 “My chances of getting harmed by the vaccine are much higher than my risk of dying of Covid.”                 I know you can argue with these statements. You might be doing it in your head right now. But can you empathize with them as well?                 Does it make sense that someone would want to avoid putting unknown chemicals in their body? Is it reasonable not to fully trust the pharmaceutical industry? It doesn’t take a lot of Googling to find lawsuits and settlements of billions of dollars involving harms, false claims and withheld information by drug companies. Isn’t it true that we have only short-term data on the effects and side effects of the vaccines, if only because the trials began less than two years ago?     Related articleIt's time to turn up pressure on unvaccinated             In practice, empathy is about validating the other person’s perspective without agreeing or disagreeing with them. It’s making true statements that show the other person that you understand them to their satisfaction. For example:                 “It sounds like you’re fearful of the possible side effects of the vaccine. And that makes sense.”                 “It seems like you don’t trust the pharmaceutical companies that are producing the vaccines. I understand that”                 “You’re worried that we don’t have long-term data on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines. I get that.”                 And then, encourage them to talk. That’s where curiosity comes in. Ask questions, not to trap them in logical inconsistencies, but because you are truly curious about their answers. How do they compare the relative risks of vaccines and Covid? What data are they looking at? What makes them doubt the safety of the vaccine? What have they seen and heard?                 Once they feel like you care about their opinion so you can learn from it – and them – rather than demolish it – or them – you’re in a real conversation. Now you can get to the important questions: What do they want? For themselves, for their loved ones, for their country, for the world? Chances are, this is where you can find common ground.                  We all want people to be well, to be free from harm, to be free from coercion. We all want the economy to flourish – even though we may have very different visions of what that entails. We all want to be respected.

And this virus is sort of pitting those values against each other, and I’m coming down more strongly on the side of health, and you appear to value freedom more. But I hear your concerns about your health as well. And actually, I’m in favor of vaccination because I think it will give us all more freedom.”                 That was the approach we used with one of our vaccine hesitant friends. After a conversation full of respectful questions and discussion, she told us, “You know, I think I’m going to get the vaccine.” Instead of trying to change her, we created an environment in which she felt safe enough to change on her own.                 We’re not guaranteeing that outcome. We don’t know how your conversations will go. But when you don’t have actual power over someone, it’s only through a caring and respectful relationship that you can influence them to change. If you want a loved one to get vaccinated, approach them with empathy and curiosity, to communicate your caring and respect. It’s your best shot at helping them get theirs.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.             Earlier this month, the Biden administration reaffirmed the United States’ recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara, a disputed region on the northwest coast of Africa. The United Nations calls Western Sahara a “non-self-governing territory”; I call it home. My home is under occupation and my people, the Sahrawis, are under attack, and the US position on Western Sahara legitimizes this occupation and will be used as license for further attacks. I know this because I have lived it.                  As an outspoken advocate for self-determination in Western Sahara, I have long been a target for the occupying Moroccan government. I have been beaten, tortured, and abducted by Moroccan police while engaged in peaceful protests; after a particularly violent assault in 2007, I lost my right eye.              Because I refuse to be silenced, Morocco stepped up its efforts against me late last year. On November 19, while driving to my home in Boujdour, I was stopped at a police and military checkpoint. The authorities forced me into a police car and took me to a nearby police station, where I was interrogated, sexually assaulted, and told to go home and not to speak to anyone. I arrived home soon thereafter to find it surrounded by 21 police vehicles and numerous officers, who physically pushed me into the house. I have been forcibly confined to the house ever since.      Related articleTrump deal with Morocco is yet another headache for Biden team             My de facto house arrest, which is now in its ninth month, has absolutely no legal basis – I have never been shown a court order authorizing my detention or informed of any criminal charges against me.                  The Moroccan government has told Amnesty International that I’m not under house arrest and denied a statement by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights Defenders that included details of the assaults, saying that the rapporteur’s statement “interferes with the ongoing debates in the framework of the 47th Session of the Human Rights Council” and “do not fit at all with the framework of dialogue and mutual respect” it expected at the UN. Meanwhile, the occupying Moroccan forces appear determined to not just detain me unlawfully, but to harass, torture, and perhaps even kill me.                  Moroccan police, military, and other security agents maintain a constant presence outside the house and prevent anyone from leaving or coming in, even to bring food. They cut the electricity in mid-April. Police throw a toxic, foul-smelling liquid into the house on a near-daily basis, making it difficult to breathe. They frequently (and explicitly) threaten to kill me.                  Moroccan authorities have also repeatedly raided the home and brutally assaulted me, my sister, my brother, and my mother. In May, during one such raid, Moroccan agents raped my sister and I – in a barbaric message, they penetrated my sister using the broomstick that we use to wave the Western Sahara flag. Despite all this, I continue to wave the Western Sahara flag from my rooftop every day – an act of resistance that may end up costing me my life.      Related articleWestern Sahara independence leader declares the end of a 29-year-old ceasefire with Morocco             Unfortunately, my story is just one of many. Morocco’s repression of the Sahrawi people, and Sahrawi human rights defenders in particular, is well documented. The Sahrawis have struggled under Moroccan occupation since 1975, and this repression will continue until the occupation is ended. And while the United Nations Security Council supports giving the people of Western Sahara the chance to determine their own future through a referendum, Morocco has refused to allow the referendum to take place, depriving us of the chance to exercise our right to self-determination.                  My situation is desperate. On Wednesday, my international legal team submitted my case to the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, urging it to find I am being detained illegally and to demand my immediate release. However, in order to secure justice for me and the Sahrawi people, I also need help from the US.                  First, the Biden administration should immediately acknowledge Morocco’s occupation for what it is – an occupation – and stop recognizing Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. This recognition – originally announced by President Donald Trump via tweet in December 2020 – runs contrary to decades of established US policy on Western Sahara.                  When President Biden took over, we who are fighting for self-determination hoped that he might fix this. However, as recently as July 1, the State Department reiterated that there is no change in the administration’s policy. The Biden administration has claimed that human rights are central to its foreign policy – this is difficult to believe while it sides with Morocco in its occupation of Western Sahara and its repression of the Sahrawi people.                  Second, as part of its reengagement with the United Nations Human Rights Council, the US should press forcefully for a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. The U.N. General Assembly reaffirmed the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara as far back as 1966, when it was still referred to as “Spanish Sahara,” and the U.N. Security Council unanimously established a mission to coordinate a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara in 1991.             The US, for its part, has consistently voted in favor of Security Council resolutions seeking a referendum on self-determination. Since President Biden has advocated for a return to a rule-based international order, the US should take the lead to ensure that the long-promised referendum is finally held and the results are honored.                  And third, the U.S. should make the protection of human rights in occupied Western Sahara and self-determination for the Sahrawi people key issues in its bilateral relationship with Morocco. For example, the readout from a recent call between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita shows that while Blinken encouraged Morocco to reaffirm its commitment to human rights, the readout omitted any mention of Western Sahara or the right of its people to self-determination.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             For any productive change to occur, Morocco needs to know that its powerful allies care about both.                  I cannot find the words to describe the endless suffering that I personally, and the Sahrawi people more generally, have endured under this violent occupation. But we remain strong, our will unshaken, and we will persevere with our peaceful resistance.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Durrni allegedly pulled on the woman’s hijab, told her to take it off, and then punched her in the arm. When she didn’t remove the hijab, Durrni allegedly punched the man in the back.                 An hour after that attack, Durrni allegedly followed a 64-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman in Queens and made anti-Muslim slurs before punching the woman in the face and head several times, according to the NYPD.

And on July 25, Durrni allegedly bumped a 38-year-old woman wearing clothes traditionally worn by Muslim women into the street and yelled anti-Muslim slurs. Durrni allegedly pulled out a knife when the woman tried to call 911 on her cell phone.                 If convicted, Durrni could be sentenced to up to eight years in prison.

CAIR, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, typically publishes an annual report tracking hate crimes and bias incidents. The organization decided to release a mid-year “snapshot report” because of a spike in May and June, Robert McCaw, CAIR’s government affairs director, told CNN.                 The report, published Wednesday, highlights 38 of the hundreds of anti-Muslim bias incidents documented by the organization this year, CAIR said in a news release. The incidents include hate crimes, harassment, school bullying, discrimination and hate speech.                 The report is based on incidents directly reported to CAIR’s national office and chapters across the United States, as well as the media.     Related articleA NYC mosque was vandalized with anti-Palestinian graffiti             “This report serves as a reminder of the severe nature of Islamophobia and what needs to be done to combat it in the United States and around the world,” Huzaifa Shahbaz, CAIR’s national research and advocacy coordinator, told CNN.                  CAIR documented a spike in anti-Muslim incidents in May and June, including four at mosques in May alone. Those cases involved vandalism, harassment towards women who wear hijab or headscarf and an attempted stabbing, Shahbaz said.                 The spike coincided with renewed violence in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians.                 Between May 10 and 20, Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire killed at least 248 people in Gaza, including 66 children, according to the health ministry there. Twelve people in Israel, including two children, died as a result of Palestinian militant fire from Gaza, according to the Israel Defense Forces and Israel’s emergency service.                  Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire that began on May 21, but it has been fraught with tension and violence.                 Anti-Semitic incidents also increased across the United States during the same time, Jewish groups reported. CAIR has condemned those incidents.                 Although the report primarily focused on the US, it also included a section highlighting incidents in Canada, where CAIR said there has been a notable increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes.      Related articleA driver slams into a Muslim family, killing four people             Among them was the June 6 truck ramming attack that killed four members of a Muslim family in London, Ontario.

The report concluded with a series of recommendations “to reverse this disturbing trend” of increased anti-Muslim crimes and bias incidents. Among them is a call for President Joe Biden to condemn incidents when they occur, and aggressive federal prosecution when local law enforcement fails to act.                 “It’s time for our elected officials to speak up and out against anti-Muslim bias in the US, as well as the global phenomenon of Islamophobia that threats Muslims not only in the US but around the world,” McCaw said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

A report to the Security Council by the UN monitoring team charged with tracking worldwide jihadi threats, published Thursday, warns that these groups pose a growing threat in much of Africa. And both are entrenched in Afghanistan, from where al Qaeda plotted the 9/11 attacks.                  The UN report suggests a consistent pattern. Wherever pressure on jihadi terror groups is absent or negligible, they thrive. In Afghanistan, where the United States says it will complete its military withdrawal by August 31, the UN warns of a potential “further deterioration” in the security situation. In Somalia, the report says, US military withdrawal and the partial drawdown of the African Union Mission has left Somali special forces “struggling to contain” the al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab.                  In Mali, where France is winding down its counterterrorism mission, the report says that al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists have consolidated their influence and are “increasingly claiming populated areas.” In Mozambique, the report says, “the absence of significant counter-terrorist measures” have transformed the ISIS affiliate in central Africa into a “major threat.”     Related articleAl Qaeda promises 'war on all fronts' against America as Biden pulls out of Afghanistan             Jihadi terror attacks have declined in Europe and North America – but the UN experts expect this is temporary because terrorist violence has been “artificially suppressed by limitations in travelling, meeting, fundraising and identifying viable targets” during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, they believe the risk of online radicalization increased during the lockdowns.                  “One of the things that we highlight in the report that’s just come out is the possibility that the relaxation of lockdowns might mean that some pre-planned attacks can then take place,” Edmund Fitton-Brown, coordinator of the UN monitoring team told CNN.                 The report makes for sobering reading at a time when the United States and its allies – exhausted by the pandemic and keen to focus on economic recovery and standing up to China and Russia, have all but called an end to the 20-year ‘war on terror.’ As one leading analyst recently put it: “We might be done with jihadis, but they are not done with us.”                 The report warns that Africa is now “the region most affected by terrorism” – with al Qaeda and ISIS-aligned groups inflicting higher casualties there than anywhere else. In many areas, these groups are gaining support, threatening more territory, getting better weapons and raising more money.                 The UN monitors single out Somalia – which is beset by turmoil and getting less international military support than previously. They warn that Al-Shabaab may fill the vacuum as “strategic support” to Somali government forces declines. The threat the group poses further afield is underlined by a recent US indictment against an alleged Kenyan operative who “directed by senior Al-Shabaab leaders, obtained pilot training in the Philippines in preparation for seeking to hijack a commercial aircraft and crash it into a building in the United States.”                 Al-Shabaab is one of several terror affiliates to increase its use of drones for reconnaissance and has the ability to threaten low-flying aircraft in a region that depends on humanitarian flights to sustain vulnerable populations, the UN report says.                   Much of West Africa and the Sahel has in recent years been embroiled in jihadi violence. Last month Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari acknowledged the country was still grappling with a serious insurgency despite setbacks suffered by Boko Haram, whose leader Abubakar Shekau reportedly died during an attack by the regional ISIS affiliate (ISWAP) in May.                 The UN monitors say that while Boko Haram is “significantly weakened,” ISWAP may get stronger in the Lake Chad region and try to extend its operations towards the major Nigerian city of Maiduguri.     Related articleUN sounds warning over threat posed by emboldened Taliban, still closely tied to al Qaeda             The human toll of these insurgencies is stunning. In June, the United Nations Development Program estimated that Nigeria’s conflict with Islamist insurgencies through the end of 2020 had resulted in nearly 350,000 deaths, with 314,000 of those from indirect causes such as displacement and poverty.                 The UN monitors report that this year ISIS-affiliated terrorists have already killed hundreds of civilians in a series of attacks in Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger. And al Qaeda-affiliated groups in the Sahel are making a concerted push towards the Atlantic coastline – with Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, Benin, Ghana and Togo among countries at significant risk.                 On the other side of Africa, part of northern Mozambique is beyond government control. In March, the local ISIS affiliate briefly occupied the town of Palma – a critical hub in the country’s drive to develop its natural gas potential. The group collected between $1 million and $2 million from the looting of local banks, the UN report says, and is well positioned for future raids in the area.                 The threat from ISIS remains far from extinguished in Iraq and Syria, with the group bankrolled by estimated reserves of $25 million to $50 million. ISIS has “reasserted itself somewhat in Iraq” this year in the face of “constant counter-terrorism pressure,” the report says. Just this week, ISIS claimed a bombing in Baghdad which killed at least 30 people. The UN monitors say that according to member states, ISIS still has the “intent and capability to sustain a long-term insurgency in the Syrian desert” that borders Iraq.                  Elsewhere in Syria, the report states that “groups aligned with [al Qaeda] continue to dominate the Idlib area,” where terrorist fighters number more than 10,000. It says member states are concerned that jihadi fighters may relocate from that region to Afghanistan should the environment there become more hospitable.                  With the Taliban making rapid gains across Afghanistan, there is widespread concern the group will seize control of the country and allow it to once again become a platform for international terror. According to the UN report, al Qaeda is present in at least 15 Afghan provinces, and operates “under Taliban protection from Kandahar, Helmand and Nimruz Provinces.”      Related articleRockets land near Afghanistan's presidential palace during Eid prayers             In a CNN interview this week, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen said the group had made a commitment “not to allow any individual or group or entity to use … Afghanistan against the United States, its allies and other countries” and said terrorists will have “no place” in an Afghanistan under Taliban rule.                 But Fitton-Brown says the Taliban “have not broken their relationship with al Qaeda. They haven’t taken any steps against al Qaeda that they could not easily reverse and quickly reverse.”                  The Taliban’s offensive across Afghanistan “doesn’t give the international community much confidence that they are moving towards a real commitment to a stable negotiated and ultimately peaceful settlement in Afghanistan,” he says.                 There’s also concern that ISIS has a solid foothold in Afghanistan, with one member state reporting it currently has between 500 and 1,500 fighters. Despite being weakened in parts of eastern Afghanistan, the UN experts warn that ISIS’s regional affiliate “has moved into other provinces” and “strengthened its positions in and around Kabul, where it conducts most of its attacks.”                 As for the leadership of these terror groups, it’s a time of transition and uncertainty. The UN report notes that Amir Muhammad al-Mawla, who took over as leader of ISIS more than 18 months ago,  “remains reluctant to communicate directly with supporters.” It says ISIS’ “command and control over its provinces has loosened,” referring to its international affiliates.                 With al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri “assessed by Member States to be alive but unwell,” the UN report says it is uncertain where the group’s likely next leader would be based. Member States report that al Zawahiri’s “probable successor” is the veteran Egyptian terrorist Saif al Adel, who “is currently located in the Islamic Republic of Iran.”                   The UN monitors say that were he to get the top job, it’s unclear that Adel would go to Afghanistan. They add that “some Member States point to his history of living and operating in Africa and assess that he might choose to base himself there.”                 Two decades on from 9/11, the ability of al Qaeda and ISIS to threaten the West is currently lower than it has been. But the UN report shows that the danger posed by international jihadi groups has metastasized, and that they are entrenched in under-governed areas just as Western powers are preoccupied with other issues.                  “It’s important not to take our eye off counterterrorism and particularly important not to stop improving international counterterrorism cooperation,” says Fitton-Brown.                 Well over a generation ago, the international jihadi movement was energized by the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan. It is now celebrating the end of the United States’ military presence – and likely anticipating a new influx of recruits to propel the next generation of jihad – in Afghanistan and far beyond.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Ilhan Omar is leading a group of Democratic lawmakers in calling on Secretary of State Antony Blinken to create a special envoy to combat Islamophobia, as instances of anti-Muslim hate crimes continue to rise worldwide.","Jul 21, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Annie Grayer,International,"Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar is leading a group of Democratic lawmakers in calling on Secretary of State Antony Blinken to create a special envoy to combat Islamophobia, as instances of anti-Muslim hate crimes continue to rise worldwide.                 Omar, one of three Muslims serving in Congress, is sending a letter to Blinken to make the case for why the United States needs to play a heightened role in monitoring Islamophobic incidents around the world. The group also calls on Blinken to include state sponsored Islamophobic violence in next year’s annual human rights reports. The group is looking for Blinken to establish a special envoy that mirrors what the Department of State created to investigate and fight anti-Semitism.                  “As part of our commitment to international religious freedom and human rights, we must recognize Islamophobia as a pattern that is repeating in nearly every corner of the globe,” the lawmakers write in the letter. “It is past time for the United States to stand firmly in favor of religious freedom for all, and to give the global problem of Islamophobia the attention and prioritization it deserves.”                 Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, is co-leading the letter with Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and joined by 23 other Democrats including Reps. Karen Bass of California, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Adam Smith of Washington and Sara Jacobs of California.                  The group points to state actors and a rising number of individuals connected to larger White supremacist networks as perpetrators of Islamophobia. The letter to Blinken cites a 2021 annual report from the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) that found three countries, China, India and Burma, had “patterns of mistreatment and human rights violations against either their entire Muslim populations or particular sects of Muslims.”                 The request from lawmakers to Blinken comes just as the Council on American-Islamic Relations came out with a report that found an uptick in anti-Muslim hate crimes, particularly coinciding with the heightened conflict between Israel and Gaza in May. A source familiar with the letter sent to Blinken told CNN that the findings from CAIR’s report played a significant role in getting lawmakers to make this request now.                 Omar cited an uptick in “Anti-Muslim hate” as part of her reasoning calling for the position.                 “This year has seen over 500 incidents of hate in the U.S. — and those are just the ones that have been reported,” Omar said in a statement, and referenced a terror attack in Canada last month that killed four members of a Muslim family.                   “In countries around the world — from China to India to Myanmar — Muslim communities are being discriminated against,” the congresswoman added. “We must all stand united against this horrific rise in hate.”                 Omar’s push to establish a special envoy comes just a month after the Minnesota Democrat came under fire for tweeting, “We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban,” when describing her line of questioning to Secretary Blinken about having accountability in a hearing.                 A group of Jewish Democrats immediately jumped to criticize Omar’s comments, arguing that “equating the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban is as offensive as it is misguided.”                 Omar later clarified her comments as backlash emerged, stating that in her conversation with Blinken she asked about ongoing International Criminal Court investigations and “to be clear: the conversation was about accountability for specific incidents regarding those ICC cases, not a moral comparison between Hamas and the Taliban and the U.S. and Israel.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Children and women were among the dead and wounded, according to health and security officials. The attacker detonated his explosive vest in the Wahailat outdoor market in Sadr City, a predominantly Muslim Shia neighborhood in the east of Baghdad.                 Police officials said a number of shops and stores were also damaged in the blast.                  The market, like many other public places, had been packed with shoppers preparing to celebrate the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. Videos published on social media show women holding their babies and screaming as they flee the scene.       ISIS claimed responsibility hours after the blast happened, saying in a statement that it had been carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest. The terror group provided no evidence to support the claim.                   In a statement on Monday, the Iraqi military said the explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device (IED). However, two police officers said they have yet to determine the cause of the blast, as the investigation is still underway.                  Ali Yassin, a resident in Sadr City, said he has lost hope that Iraq will be a safe place for his four children to grow up.                  “Not a day goes by in Iraq without a tragic incident,” Yassin told CNN. “Why can’t we live like the rest of the countries? Why can’t we enjoy peace like the rest of the world?”                  “If I am financially capable, I would leave Iraq along with my family at once,” Yassin added.                  Top Iraqi government officials, including the Iraqi President and Iraqi Prime Minister, condemned the “terrorist attack” and vowed to bring perpetrators to justice.                  “We will not be calm unless we uproot the hateful and cowardly terrorism, and it is certain that the will of the Iraqis is beyond their criminality and villainy,” President Barham Salih said in a statement released by his office on Monday.                   Col. Wayne Marotto, the military spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, the global coalition to defeat what remains of the ISIS caliphate, offered its condolences for the victims’ families in a tweet on Monday.                 “This horrific attack right before Eid Al-Adha is a terrible reminder of the violence Iraqi children continue to face,” said Sheema Sen Gupta, the UNICEF Representative in Iraq, in a statement on Monday.                  “On the eve of Eid Al-Adha and as Iraqis mourn this sad moment, UNICEF calls for all actors in Iraq to work together towards a safer Iraq where children do not have to live in fear and where they enjoy their very basic activities and rights,” Gupta said.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The religious fault line between the two sides is only deepening, adding another explosive dimension to the volatile separation between red and blue America.                 Whites who identify as Christians composed a vastly larger share of the population in the counties Donald Trump won last fall than those captured by President Joe Biden, according to previously unpublished data provided to CNN by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute from a pathbreaking new study estimating religious affiliation at the county level.              What we’re seeing unfolding over the last four years, and coming into full flower now, the divides really are about American identity, much more than they are about a policy or even economics. Today we should probably replace ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ with ‘It’s American identity, stupid.’             Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO, Public Religion Research Institute                  While White Christians have fallen below a majority of the US population over the past decade, they still made up almost exactly two-thirds of the adults in the counties Trump carried – and an even higher percentage in the counties that provided him his largest margins, according to the new findings. By contrast, White Christians represent only about two-fifths of the population in the counties that voted for Biden – and an even smaller percentage in the counties that gave him his biggest margins.                 These new county-level findings fill in the picture that exit polls and other surveys have painted over recent years. On one side they show a GOP coalition still dominated by the White Christians who constituted a majority of the nation itself for most of our history; on the other is a Democratic coalition that has been fundamentally reshaped by America’s growing religious and racial diversity and is now split almost in thirds among White Christians, non-White Christians, and those who adhere to non-Christian faiths or no faith at all, according to the latest PRRI findings. Those latter two groups represent an absolute majority of the population in the counties Biden carried, PRRI found.                 The grounding of today’s partisan differences in such elemental components of social identity as religion – as well as race, education and age – helps explain why the balance of power has grown so difficult for either party to fundamentally shift, despite all the tumultuous events of recent years. It also explains why so many Americans consider the stakes in the political competition higher than ever. The PRRI results point toward a political competition that now revolves less around individual policy disputes than the larger question of whether America’s direction will be set by the predominantly White and Christian voters who have historically wielded the most power or by an emerging America defined by both religious and racial diversity.                  “What we’re seeing unfolding over the last four years, and coming into full flower now, the [political] divides really are about American identity, much more than they are about a policy or even economics,” says Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO of PRRI. “Today we should probably replace ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ with ‘It’s American identity, stupid.’ “                 Jones, like other analysts, believes a pervasive sense of loss and displacement in a diversifying country has solidified the strong affinity for Trump-style politics among many White Christians, especially White evangelical Protestants.                 “It really is hard to overstate how central to White Christians’ worldview is this idea of America as a White Christian nation,” says Jones, author of the book “White Too Long,” a history of the relationship between Christian churches and racial inequality. A poll of Trump supporters earlier this year by the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center underscores his point: Fully 87% of them agreed that “Christian faith is an essential part of American greatness.” That number rose to a near unanimous 97% among White evangelical Trump supporters.     Related articleQAnon is spreading amongst evangelicals. These pastors are trying to stop it             Both the Ethics and Public Policy Center polling and the Public Religion Research Institute’s annual “American Values Survey” document deep concern among Trump’s White Christian supporters, especially evangelicals, that social change of all sorts is eroding Christianity’s central position in American life. In the EPPC poll, 89% of all Trump supporters (and 94% of his evangelical backers) said that “Christianity is under attack in America today.” In the latest PRRI polling, three-fourths of White evangelicals agreed that immigrants are “invading” America and replacing its culture; just over 7 in 10 agreed that Whites now face as much discrimination as Blacks and that the values of Islam are incompatible with American values. Nearly 6 in 10 of them, in a recoil from changing gender roles, said that “society is becoming too soft and feminine.”                  This sense of siege, Jones said, has left many conservative Christian voters open to both Trump’s message of resisting social change and to wild conspiracy theories, such as his disproven claims about massive election fraud in 2020. In recent PRRI polling, roughly one-fourth of White evangelical Protestants expressed sympathy for the QAnon conspiracy theory and as many agreed that “true American patriots may have to resort to violence” to save the US.                 “I think as this central tentpole that has been holding up their worldview – America as a White Christian nation, their own private promised land – has fallen, just under the sheer weight of the changing country all around them, it has left them vulnerable to grasping at straws and believing in delusions,” Jones says.                 Behind this weakness for ungrounded political fantasy is an implacable demographic reality: White Christians have been relentlessly declining as a share of America’s population.                  Whites who identify as Christians composed a majority of Americans through almost all of US history. Even as late as 1968, when President Richard Nixon was first elected, Gallup polling found that 85% of Americans identified as White and Christian. (At that point about 60% of Americans identified as White Protestants and another roughly 25% as White Catholics.)                 That number has plummeted over the past half century as the nation has grown more diverse racially (reducing the White share of the population) and religiously (reducing the share of Christians). Different surveys plot the change at slightly varying speeds, but they all show the same trajectory, with the nation reaching a dramatic milestone sometime over the past decade. According to the annual General Social Survey by NORC at the University of Chicago, an independent research organization, White Christians fell below majority status in the country for the first time sometime between 2010 and 2012. Gallup, in figures it provided me, put the tipping point to minority status somewhere between 2016 and 2017. Though the Pew Research Center and PRRI did not conduct polls frequently enough to identify a precise tipping point, in surveys over the past decade both also found White Christians falling to well below half of the population.      Related articleOpinion: America is no longer as evangelical as it was -- and here's why             In the PRRI studies, White Christians reached a low point of 42% of the population in 2018. PRRI says the group has rebounded slightly since, to 44% of the population in the latest Census of American Religion, which it released last week. Gallup, though it places the share of White Christians slightly higher, hasn’t found a rebound: It shows their level stable at 47% since 2018. (Neither the General Social Survey nor Pew has numbers more recent than that.)                 The growth in PRRI’s data came primarily from an unexpected source: a slight increase in the share of Americans who identify as mainline Protestants, a faith that had seemed the most endangered over recent decades. White Catholics have also stabilized in the PRRI data, but the institute found the share of adults who identify as White evangelical Protestants, the bedrock group in the Republican coalition, continuing to slide; in PRRI’s data, evangelicals now comprise 14.5% of Americans, down from about 21% a decade ago. Jones says that while there is no conclusive proof in the data, there’s evidence to suggest that some White Protestants who once might have identified as evangelical have migrated toward more mainline Protestant denominations over unease with evangelical leaders’ unconditional identification with Trump.                 Notwithstanding their slight differences, all the major data sources agree on the broad trend of growing religious pluralism. The shrinking share of White Christians have been replaced partly by non-White Christians, who have grown from just under one-fourth of the population earlier in this century to slightly over one-fourth now. Even more important has been the rising number of Americans who don’t identify with any religious faith: They’ve increased from about 1 in 6 adults earlier in this century to nearly 1 in 4 now.                  These powerful currents have washed over both parties, but they have carried Republicans and Democrats to very different places. White Christians still make up 68% of adults who identify as Republicans, PRRI found, with White evangelical Christians (at 29%), the largest religious group in the party (if down from their numbers even in the GOP earlier this century). By contrast, White Christians now compose just 39% of those who identify as Democrats. Non-White Christians contribute about 1 in 3 Democrats, PRRI found, compared with only about 1 in 7 Republicans. The remaining Democrats (nearly 3 in 10) ascribe either to non-Christian faiths or no religion at all; those two groups represent roughly one-sixth of the GOP, only a little over half as much.                  In all, the two parties now present religious profiles that amount to snapshots through time. Today’s Republican coalition looks something like the religious profile in America overall about 25 years ago (the last time White Christians represented two-thirds of all Americans in the General Social Survey studies was around 1995); the Democratic coalition’s religious breakdown approximates what America itself might look like 10 or so years from now.                 Jones makes the same point from a slightly different vantage point: He notes that the religious composition of the Republican coalition now closely resembles the profile of Americans 65 and older, while the Democratic composition closely overlaps with the overall profile of adults younger than 30.                 The new county-level data from PRRI shows just how powerfully and pervasively these contrasts now shape the competition between the parties. In its latest report, PRRI made an unprecedented attempt to document American religious affiliation by county, drawing on 459,822 survey interviews with Americans across all 50 states that it conducted from 2013 to 2019.                 That report found sharp regional differences in religious affiliation, with all White Christians representing the largest share of the population across the Midwest and outer South, White evangelicals most plentiful in the deep South and unaffiliated, secular Americans most common in the Northeast and especially the West. At CNN’s request, PRRI research director Natalie Jackson crossed those findings with county-level results from the 2020 and 2016 presidential races. The results were striking.                 In 2020, White Christians made up 66% of the adult population in the nearly 2,600 counties Trump carried, many of them smaller and rural. In the nearly 550 counties that Biden carried (including 91 of the 100 largest), White Christians represented only 41% of the adult population. The difference was especially stark among White evangelical Christians: They composed 34% of the population in the Trump counties, compared with just 15% in the Biden counties. By contrast, non-White Christians represented almost 1 in 4 adults in the Biden counties, compared with about 1 in 10 in the Trump counties. Other Christians – a diverse group that includes Asian, Native American, mixed-race and Orthodox Christians as well as Jehovah’s Witnesses – constituted a comparably small share in each man’s counties (about 1 in 16). But those who subscribe to non-Christian faiths or no faith at all were a much bigger presence in the Biden counties (roughly 3 in 10) than Trump’s (about 2 in 10).                 This divergence was even greater in the counties that gave each side its biggest margins. In the nearly 1,100 counties Trump won by 50 percentage points or more, White Christians made up more than 70% of the population, PRRI found. Trump amassed his biggest margins, beating Biden by 80 percentage points or more, almost entirely in smaller rural counties – like Roberts, Borden, King and Armstrong counties in Texas or Hayes, McPherson and Grant in Nebraska – where White Christians represented about three-fourths or more of the population. By contrast, they made up fewer than one-third of all residents in the roughly 170 counties that Biden won by at least 30 percentage points; in Biden’s 20 best counties, most of them larger urban centers, White Christians constituted more than one-fourth of the population in just five.                 These county-level results confirm the religious divide evident in exit polls and other studies that analyzed the 2020 election results. In the recently released Pew Research Center “Validated Voters” study, for instance, Trump crushed by Biden by almost 70 percentage points among White evangelical Christians and posted solid (if reduced from 2016) margins of about 15 percentage points among both White mainline Protestants and White Catholics. Strong liberal social movements have persisted in both denominations for decades (particularly around issues of racial justice), but the fact that Biden, a White Catholic who positioned himself as a centrist, couldn’t push his vote with those groups much past 40% underscored how many barriers Democrats face with the bulk of their believers.                 Biden, in turn, dominated among secular voters and non-White Christians (though Trump apparently ran more competitively, as Republicans often do, among Hispanic Protestants, many of whom are evangelicals). Like polls in previous presidential elections, the Pew analysis also found that within each religious denomination Trump, as other Republican nominees before him, generally ran better with the voters who attended religious services most often, while Biden did better with those who attended less frequently, according to detailed results Pew provided me.                 Jones says it’s too early to tell if the recent stabilization in the White Christian share of the population represents a new plateau or merely a pause in their long decline. One key factor argues for the latter assessment: White Christians make up only a little more than 1 in 4 adults under 30 in PRRI’s data, compared with nearly 6 in 10 of those over 65. As the former continue to replace the latter in American society, that disparity suggests White Christians are more likely than not to continue shrinking through the 2020s. When measuring America by race and religion White Christians will likely remain the nation’s largest single group for years, but without the preponderant numbers that made them the clear first among equals in US life for earlier generations.                  How White Christians respond to that change in status will play a huge role in determining whether America’s political tensions continue to escalate. (The question is equally pertinent for Whites without college degrees, another core GOP group that also has, for the first time, fallen below a majority of the US population in this century.)                 As the new PRRI county data for 2016 and 2020 shows, a strong majority of White Christians have flocked to Trump’s promise to “make America great again” and implicitly restore a social order that placed them at its center. If that large a share of White Christians responded to such arguments when they still constituted a little over 40% of the population, there’s little reason to think that if their numbers shrink further fewer will be drawn to Trump-style messaging – even as he grows more overtly hostile to democracy.                  This process of contraction and radicalization is most apparent among White evangelicals, as evidenced by the conflict between relative moderates and militant conservatives in the Southern Baptist Convention.                  “My fear is that what’s going to happen is as the group shrinks it’s going to become more extreme and what’ll end up happening is that the moderating voices in that group will leave and then it becomes even more extreme,” says Jones.                  Such a “radicalization spiral” is very hard to break, he notes, and provides a huge pool of disaffected Whites willing to subvert democratic rules – or even resort to violence – if that’s what it takes to prevent a diverse and increasingly secular liberal coalition from, in their view, remaking American society.                  “It’s a crisis,” Jones says flatly. “There’s no other way to say it.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

But he decided to buck their advice,"As a child in Austria, Elie Rosen was told to keep his head down. But as he suffered amid rising anti-Semitism across Europe, he decided to stand up for his faith and his heritage.","Jul 8, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Antonia Mortensen,International,"Elie Rosen had never really listened as a child when his grandparents told him and his cousins to keep their heads down. He knew they had survived the Holocaust but he believed the world’s vow of “never again” and saw no reason for his generation of European Jews to fear.                  That changed when a man wielding a baseball bat came after him in front of his synagogue in Graz, Austria. The building had been repeatedly vandalized and while Rosen managed to reach his car and escape unharmed physically, he was shaken to his core.                  “After the attack, those warnings of my grandparents had kind of a flashback,” he told CNN. “This made me very, very sorry and brought tears to my heart and to my face,” he said.                  “Being physically attacked is a different dimension than being verbally attacked, which I am used to because anti-Semitism has risen in the last year.”                 Violence and oppression against Jews and their faith has been a constant in Europe, but recorded incidents of anti-Semitism have been on an alarming rise, partly fueled by lockdowns to stop the spread of coronavirus.                  In Rosen’s home of Austria, there has been the highest number of anti-Semitic attacks since the country started recording them 19 years ago.                  Benjamin Nägele, secretary general of Jewish Communities Austria, said its figures showed a 6.4% rise in reports of anti-Semitic incidents in 2020, even though he says many people do not report every time someone uses a slur against them.                  “We’ve seen a worrying trend not only in Austria, but throughout Europe when it comes to anti-Semitism, he said.                  Nägele said the verbal aggression comes first because it is so easy, especially online. “You can do it anonymously. You can do it a lot of times without fearing any prosecution,” he said. “And then you get encouraged to do it more, to be more aggressive, to actually add insult to injury and, at some point, get so radicalized that you then transfer it to the real world.”                 Katharina von Schnurbein, the European Commission’s anti-Semitism coordinator, said the issues were ancient but there had been a new impetus to some of the hate.                  “Anti-Semitic conspiracy myths have been there for centuries,” she told CNN. “Whenever there is a pandemic, they have come to the fore again. What we see is that, for example, during Covid, anti-Semitic tropes and conspiracy myths have increased significantly on social platforms.”                 As people marched in protest against strict lockdowns imposed by their leaders, the German RIAS organization, which tracks anti-Semitism, noted Jewish tropes among the placards.                  At one event in Bavaria, RIAS said, demonstrators held up a photomontage of people being forcibly vaccinated by people wearing uniforms bearing what looked like a Star of David and the word “Zion.”                  In another case in Berlin, a man appeared to accept the false conspiracy theory that the pandemic was caused by Jews, shouting at two identifiably Jewish pedestrians, “Are you not ashamed, what you did, you Jews?” RIAS reported.                  More than a quarter of the anti-Semitic incidents documented were related directly to the coronavirus, the group said in its annual report.                  The violence between Israel and Hamas in May this year again fueled anti-Jewish sentiment in Germany, RIAS found, with all Jews being targeted for the actions of Israel’s government and military.                  “Stop doing what Hitler did to you,” read one sign in English held up during a pro-Palestinian march in Berlin, the group said.                  Benjamin Ward, deputy director in Human Rights Watch’s Europe division, agreed that anti-Semitism was often cyclical and propelled by events in the Middle East. But he added, “If we look more broadly at the phenomenon of anti-Semitism in Europe, we see that it’s much older and also much wider. it’s really a European issue.”                 Across Europe, anti-Semitic attacks have been rising for years. France has seen numerous attacks – in 2012, three children and a teacher were gunned down at a Jewish school in Toulouse; in 2015, four people were shot dead and others held hostage in a kosher supermarket in Paris; in 2018, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor was killed when she was stabbed 11 times and then had her Paris apartment set on fire.                  Jewish cemeteries from France to Poland are regularly desecrated, and nine out of 10 European Jews believe that anti-Semitism is on the rise, according to a survey by the European Commission.                 In Brussels, Rabbi Albert Guigui is one of those responding by trying to hide his very identity, to look less Jewish.                  “Of course, I wear a yarmulke at home, but outside I prefer to cover my head less conspicuously,” he said, talking of the baseball cap he dons most days. “It’s not healthy to live in an atmosphere of fear and where you feel hunted.”                 As those with living memory of the Holocaust pass away, Guigui worries more hate will come.      Related articleNot just neo-Nazis with tiki torches: Why Jewish students say they also fear cloaked anti-Semitism             “There is concern precisely because there is no longer that barrier of memory,” he said. “Before, people couldn’t openly express their anti-Semitism because the memory of the Holocaust was there to remind people where such words lead. Now there’s been a liberation of the very speech that generates acts.”                 Back in Austria, Karoline Edtstadler, the country’s minister for the EU, said the government was worried because although it was trying to tackle the upsurge in anti-Jewish hate, the numbers of incidents online and in real life kept rising.                  “The positive thing, of course, is we have to foster Jewish life,” she said.                  That’s the new tactic of Rosen, who’s bucking the advice of his grandparents and choosing to stand tall as a member of Austria’s Jewish community, that now stands at about 15,000 people, a fraction of the 220,000 Jews estimated to have lived in Austria before the rise of Hitler.                  He says his grandparents’ approach of keeping a low profile after the Holocaust, or Shoah, was understandable but misguided, and it was time to show and introduce others to Jewish life and traditions.                 “The post-Shoah society of Jews often thought that being silent, not being too loud, would lead to a higher acceptance of Jews in the main society,” he explained, before saying that clearly did not work.                  “I will tell my son or young Jewish people to proud of being Jewish and not to be silent.”       Correction: In a previous version of this story, a photo caption misidentified the memorial to a Berlin synagogue looted in the Nazi era.

The Klan,” airing tonight at 9 p.m. ET/PT. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama from 1997-2001. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.             In the years after I prosecuted and secured convictions for two of the Klansmen responsible for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, I traversed the country giving presentations about the case and the contributing factors that led to that fateful day in 1963.                 That September, Ku Klux Klansmen planted a bomb in a prominent Black church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four young girls and injuring at least 14 other churchgoers. It would take 14 years before one of the men responsible was tried and convicted, and 20 more before I became the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama and took on the reopened case.                 As part of my prosecution, my team and I carefully studied the events leading up to the bombing – which dated back nine years to 1954 – and presented our findings to the jury.     Related articleWhat Jim Crow looks like in 2021             Perhaps one of the most important contributing factors was this: Words matter. That is, the rhetoric employed by our public officials and community leaders can have real-life consequences. In the case of my home state of Alabama, people like 1960s public safety commissioner Bull Connor and Governor George Wallace strategically used dog-whistle rhetoric that fed a White backlash to the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. Their hateful speech essentially gave the green light to racial violence. There was no question among the Ku Klux Klan and other White supremacists that Connor, who had control over Birmingham’s police and fire departments, and other public officials were sympathetic to their cause.                 It’s no surprise, then, that the Klansmen who were responsible for the 1963 church bombing believed they had cover from the very top. The Klan at large felt invincible, because at the time the Klan’s reach extended throughout government and law enforcement from the local level on up. And that historically deep-seated influence, combined with the challenges of systemic racism and implicit bias, remained a dangerous combination long after the 1960s.      Related videoHow the KKK's failures became lessons for White power             In the case of Michael Donald’s lynching in 1981, as examined in the new CNN Original Series “The People V. The Klan,” the local police in Mobile, Alabama, did not engage in such overt, vocal racism. But the broader Black community still had plenty of reason to mistrust. Throughout the early investigation, the department disregarded mounting evidence pointing to the Klan, instead floating theories that young Michael was caught up in drugs or other criminal activity that led to his brutal murder. The Mobile Police Department said they were trying to chase down every lead, but as the so-called “War on Drugs” began to mount in 1981, too many in law enforcement simply assumed that drugs were at the cause of every young Black man’s death. Of course, that wasn’t true – and we now know the Klan had targeted Michael as an act of retaliation after the case of a Black man accused of killing a White Birmingham police officer ended in a mistrial.                 While times had certainly changed between 1963 and 1981, racism remained stubbornly embedded within American communities and institutions, like Mobile and its police department. It continues to be one of the greatest challenges we face as we look to root out discrimination and disparate treatment within our criminal justice system.     Related articleBeulah Mae Donald's nightmare became a challenge to America              Today we find ourselves in similarly dangerous and yet unprecedented territory. In the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by violent extremists, we have seen troubling reports about those rioters’ connections to law enforcement and our military – positions of great responsibility and with the power to make life-and-death decisions on the job. While I do not believe there is some broader conspiracy among the police, our military and the myriad extremist groups in America to coordinate and advance racist ideologies, it’s clear that these views continue to find safe harbor within many of those institutions.                  Of the rioters arrested for the attack on the Capitol, at least 38 are current or former members of the U.S. military, according to an April CBS News accounting. At least five of those arrested were law enforcement officers at the time of the riot, and five more were former officers. Among those present, extremist groups including the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys to the Three Percenters and others are reported to have been driving forces organizing the mob. The Oath Keepers, notably, are a self-proclaimed organization of current and former law enforcement officials and military veterans.                  Though these extremists are a minority of our uniformed officers, the danger that they present from within our institutions is clear. The Capitol riot showed us a stark example of that most recently, shaking many Americans to their core. But this is a far greater systemic problem that has spanned generations in our country. It has taken different forms over time, but we are clearly still struggling to confront the influence of these hateful ideologies – as well as the infiltration of those who seek to advance them – within our public safety ranks and criminal justice system.                 Finally, let there be no doubt that the actions of those Capitol insurrectionists were prompted by similar dog-whistle style rhetoric from some of our nation’s top leaders. Once again, as we saw in the 1960s, hateful rhetoric prompted violent consequences.      Related articleAmerica desperately needs a Truth and Racial Healing Commission             The question then is, what can we do about this? How do you root out bad actors and hold institutions accountable?                 One solution starts within. Police and public safety officials need a clear, consistent set of guidelines and code of conduct to prohibit any support for or affiliation with extremist groups. To be effective, such rules must be upheld forcefully and discipline should be applied fairly, regardless of rank. Setting an example from within is key to rooting out racist behavior as well as discouraging those with extremist ties from seeking employment in departments to begin with.                  To date, disciplinary action appears to be inconsistent and lenient, given the authority officers are granted on the job. That lack of accountability sends a message again to extremists – however accurate it may be – that law enforcement continues to be friendly to their cause. We have to take steps to break that cycle. If we fail to meet this moment, I believe we will continue to see more attacks on democracy and on people of color by those who feel they still have cover from the top.                 But in the end, our public officials have to bear some responsibility for their rhetoric and choose their words carefully. Condemning violence after the fact is simply not enough and in many instances rings hollow.  Leaders must stand together, put partisanship aside, and do all they can to bridge divides, not make them wider.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/prabal-gurung-opinion-hyphenated/index.html,Prabal Gurung: Anti-Asian sentiment runs deeper than you think,"The Nepali American designer writes on the torrent of anti-Asian hate crimes, his continued fight for diversity in fashion and the need for Asian American communities to “be in every corner and exist in every space.”","Apr 7, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Prabal Gurung,International,"Editor’s Note: Prabal Gurung is a Nepali American fashion designer based in New York. All opinions expressed in this article belong to the author. The feature is part of CNN Style’s new series Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.             My 75-year-old Nepali mother, who lives in New York, goes for a walk every morning and every evening. I send her out in disguise: I bought her a blonde wig, and I tell her to wear it under a hat, glasses and mask. “Maybe then, they’ll leave her alone,” I think. I know it sounds crazy, but it’s my survival instinct kicking in.                 “I understand your concern and worry,” my mami, as I like to call her, told me the other day.                 “But I would rather get a walking stick or a cane, just in case something happens. I can fight back,” she assured me, adjusting her wig and hat.                  That’s just how she is: resilient, unafraid and a picture of grace under pressure. I admire her strength but continue to worry for her safety. I check in constantly so I know where she is at any given time.                  This is what it’s come to. A fear so constant that it’s crippling.              “By using terms like “China Virus” and “Kung Flu,” Trump gave the coronavirus a face, an Asian face, and for that, we have all suffered.”             Prabal Gurung                 Here’s where we’re at:                  A torrent of anti-Asian hate crimes have been committed, including the brutal assault of elderly Asian men and women in broad daylight. Among them is 65-year-old Vilma Kari, who just last week in New York, was told “F**k you, you don’t belong here, you Asian,” according to the criminal complaint, before being pushed to the ground and kicked repeatedly by her attacker. The shootings at three Atlanta-area spas have left six Asian women dead. Nearly 3,800 hate incidents have so far been reported to Stop AAPI Hate over the course of a year. It feels as if there’s an open season for violence against Asians.       Introducing CNN Style's Hyphenated series             By using terms like “China Virus” and “Kung Flu,” former US President Donald Trump gave the coronavirus a face, an Asian face, and for that, we have all suffered. While his damaging rhetoric has no doubt fueled these hate crimes, their roots are buried deep in underlying racist currents that have long impacted our communities in the United States.                    They can be found in every industry. For instance, when it comes to my world – fashion – the consequences of systemic racism play out daily. And not just in the form of microaggressions.                 As someone who has a platform, who has clout, I have always believed it’s my responsibility to speak out.                 Fashion at its purest, simplest form, is a reflection of the world we live in. It doesn’t operate in a vacuum but instead influences – and is influenced by – music, culture, social movements and politics.                  Whatever your views are, everyone engages with fashion at some level. For most of us, it’s one of the first decisions we make each morning. I believe in its greater purpose – as a tool of empowerment. But as much as fashion projects its power outwards, behind the scenes, it can be a very different story.                 I was born in Singapore, grew up in Nepal and lived in India, and in these countries, you’re faced with issues such as colorism, caste discrimination and hierarchal social structures. When I started my brand 12 years ago, I wanted it to show marginalized people that they are seen, and that they matter. But until recently, it’s been an uphill battle.              “I was advised to limit the diversity of my runways because clients wouldn’t be as receptive to non White models: “‘two Black women, two Asian women – OK that’s enough.’”             Prabal Gurung                 The question of who dictates style, or what we consider tasteful or chic, is still viewed through a colonial lens, shaped by centuries-old Eurocentric ideals. Unrealistic beauty standards are often elitist, discriminatory and ultimately, constructed to maintain a proximity to Whiteness that allows those in power to feel important and secure. Decision-makers are, predominantly, White.                 This plays out in a number of ways.                 Fashion inspired by minority cultures, or rooted in the heritage of a minority designer’s heritage, may be tokenized as “exotic” or “ethnic,” or disparaged in hushed tones as “tacky and garish.” Tone-deaf campaigns and racist garments are often created because there are no people of color in the room that feel empowered enough to stop them from going ahead.                 Early in my own career, I was advised to limit the diversity of my runways because clients wouldn’t be as receptive to non White models: “two Black women, two Asian women – OK that’s enough.”                 I also recall wanting to open a collection with Korean model Ji Hye Park, and it sparked such a big discussion with the brand’s other stakeholders. “Should we? Shouldn’t we? Is it cool? Does it make sense? Is this idea… luxury?”                  These kinds of conversations were initially shocking. But I became used to witnessing microaggressions or blatant discrimination against the few Asian people who, like myself and other people of color, were able to break into this industry. Yes, fashion continues to make strides in the right direction, but we still have miles to go. Today, I still see Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American and LGBTQ peers being tokenized by the industry, called upon to perform inclusivity.                 I’ve often been challenged about my “American-ness.” During a planning meeting for my label’s 10th anniversary collection in 2018, an investor asked me to express what I felt my brand stood for.                  I began explaining that American style had always been seen through a White lens. But as a first-generation Asian immigrant, as a minority, as a queer person of color, I wanted to redefine the country’s style because our experiences have been underrepresented. The way I look at this country is an amalgamation of different cultures, races, ethnicities, religions and sizes, and that should be celebrated.                 He, in turn, asked, “Well you don’t look American, how can you define American style?”                  It was clear to me what he meant by his statement: I wasn’t White, therefore I had no authority to shape the American ideal. And this despite being an American citizen who owns a business in this country – one who employs Americans and immigrants, embraces a “Made in America” production ethos and pays taxes. For some people it’s just never enough.                  I ended up turning that collection into a celebration of American identity and belonging, sending a diverse cast of models down the runway in denim, white short-sleeved shirts, rose prints and, during the finale, sashes bearing the question: “Who gets to be American?”     Why some Asian Americans are embracing heritage by dropping their anglicized names             While the show had a lot of positive feedback, and started a healthy dialogue about identity, there were some who felt it was too on the nose. This is how privilege works. It was a luxury to be in the position to say that it was “too much” or “too direct.” However, when it comes to fighting for basic human rights, it is never too much. It is never too loud.                   It’s clear that the road to a more equitable fashion industry is long. Until brands genuinely diversify their decision-makers and boards – not just with token hires, but with people actually willing to strike up difficult, uncomfortable conversations that challenge biases – it won’t change. And, let’s be honest, brands’ efforts to embrace Asian culture have been motivated by the spending power of countries like China, India and South Korea, not some moral awakening.                  But, cynicism aside, just like conversations brought about by the Black Lives Matter protests, the Stop Asian Hate movement is inviting renewed scrutiny of fashion’s role in perpetuating racism and discrimination – from runways and collections to workplace culture.             “We need to be in every corner and exist in every space.”             Prabal Gurung                 Asian Americans in the industry should recognize that we have an important role to play. As a whole, more than 60% of the global population lives in Asia, according to the United Nations. Asians are the world’s biggest consumers of clothing, and we manufacture most of it too. Yet, told that our voices don’t matter, we’ve mostly played supporting roles, quietly and submissively catering to the needs of businesses.                 It’s not enough. It’s time to speak out and step up.                  Take this time to donate, build your skills by participating in harassment intervention training, and support existing social justice organizations and initiatives such as Stop AAPI Hate and Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC. Familiarize yourself with non-profit organizations like Gold House and Define American who are shaping culture, forming solidarity through intersectionality and creating impactful, sustainable long-term solutions for challenges facing our communities.                 The solidarity protests over the past few weeks have been extremely heartwarming. I have demonstrated alongside my peers, activists, community leaders and regular New Yorkers, telling our truths and, between other minorities and marginalized groups, finding support and common ground.                  We need to be in every corner and exist in every space. The more that our stories are told, the more that our faces, our experiences and our humanity will not only be normalized but embraced.                   We must claim our rightful seats at the table, and then use those positions to empower other marginalized groups. Visibility is key, and we must craft our own narratives and tell our own stories.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/03/us/arab-americans-covid-19-impact/index.html,"The whitewashing of Arab Americans impacted by Covid-19 is a catastrophic public health issue, experts say","Arab Americans are forced to tick “White” or “other” on the Census and medical paperwork, which means that public health data collected on the community is largely anecdotal.","Apr 3, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Mirna Alsharif,International,"To learn more about the changing demographics of the US, watch “United Shades of America” Sunday at 10 p.m. ET/PT.             Dr. Raed Al-Naser was on the front lines at Sharp Grossmont Hospital in San Diego when patients first started coming in with symptoms of Covid-19.                 “The hospital was packed and the ICU was at full capacity,” the ICU pulmonologist told CNN. “And I saw a disproportionate number of Arab Americans in the ICU.”                 This realization, and a lack of public health data on the Arab American community, motivated Al-Naser to conduct his own research based on the patients he was seeing at Grossmont Hospital and his own private practice.                 “There is a large Arab American community nearby in East San Diego, specifically in El Cajon county,” Al-Naser said. “And because there is no identifier for the group, they’re all being counted as White Covid-19 patients and no one was noticing how the virus was specifically affecting this population.”                 Based on the standards set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), there are seven categories for data on race and ethnicity: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic or Latino, according to the 2020 Census program memorandum. As a result, Arab Americans are forced to tick “White” or “other” on the Census and medical paperwork, which means that public health data collected on the community is largely anecdotal, according to experts like Al-Naser.                 Arab Americans trace their origins to the Middle East and North Africa, which is traditionally comprised of 22 Arabic-speaking countries. They are not a monolith and can be White, Black and brown. Los Angeles and New York City have the largest populations of Arab American residents in the country based on data from the 2015-2019 ACS Ancestry survey. Both areas have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected minority and immigrant populations.                  Through his research, Al-Naser found that around 15% of Covid-19 patients classified as White were actually Arab American. Also, about 30 to 35% of Covid-19 patients in the ICU classified as White were Arab American.                 “The Arab American community is a historically understudied group because it has no identifiers, so Covid-19 exposed the invisibility of the group rather than created it,” he said. “It’s key to identify people at risk or else they’ll go unnoticed and the disparity will deepen.”                 Dr. Nadia Abuelezam, epidemiologist and assistant professor at Boston College’s Connell School of Nursing, has studied health disparities among the Arab American community throughout her career.                 “There are a lot of disparities in the community and they’re not well known because of the whitewashing that’s happening,” Abuelezam said. “The lack of identifiers limit our ability to use national data sets and receive funding to understand Arab and Middle Eastern American health results.”                 According to a study Abuelezam published in 2020, “there are a number of reasons why Arab Americans may be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, complications, and death, including exposure to xenophobia and stigma, pre-existing conditions,” like diabetes and hypertension, “multigenerational homes,” lack of social support for new immigrants, and poor adoption of prevention behavior,” which includes vaccine hesitancy.                 New York resident Mohamed Madboly, 26, is all too familiar with this as a first-generation Arab American.                 Last year, Madboly, his diabetic father and his mother, who has hypertension, all became infected with Covid-19.                  “I feel like America is intentionally neglecting Arab identities,” said Madboly about the lack of data on the community. “We’re blinded from our own statistics. This makes it very difficult for experts to draw accurate conclusions to help our community not only improve but get better. Especially in a time like now, where we need it more than ever.”                 Although public health data on the community is limited, prior samplings and independent studies show that Arab Americans’ health outcomes and needs are distinctly different from the outcomes of White non-Hispanics, according to Abuelezam’s study.                  A hospital-based study in Michigan found that Arab Americans have a higher prevalence of preexisting conditions like diabetes and hypertension than in White communities. Researchers also found in a study on Arab Americans in California that 55.2% of the respondents were overweight or obese, another condition that can mean increased risk and severity of Covid-19 and death.                 Also, Arab American homes are more likely to be multigenerational than non-Arab homes, which can “lead to greater transmission risk within households to older individuals, increasing vulnerability to infection,” according to Abuelezam’s study.                 There is also a lot of vaccine hesitancy within the community, which is corroborated by national data for flu and pneumonia vaccines, according to a study from the National Library of Medicine published in 2014.                 Research done by Al-Naser in East San Diego also found that most of his Arab American patients were socioeconomically underprivileged and had less access to insurance than his Black and Hispanic patients.                 So, not only is asking Arab Americans, like Madboly and his parents, to identify as White inaccurate, but it can also skew Covid-19 data, according to Abuelezam and Al-Naser.                 Advocacy groups, such as the Arab American Institute (AAI) and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), have been pushing for a Middle East and North Africa (MENA) categorization, which is a geographic designation that includes ethnic and racial options, to be adopted by the OMB for decades.                 Although the Census Bureau does not include identifiers for the community, it estimated MENA Americans at 3.1 million in the 2015 census.                 “It’s definitely an undercount,” Maya Berry, executive director of the AAI, told CNN. “The Census is about providing an accurate count of the community, so that its members can participate fully in our democracy. The limited publicly available data has always been used against the community.”                 Samer Khalaf, president of the ADC, which estimates Arab Americans at the 4.5 million range, agrees.                 “It’s an underserved community when it comes to social programs and mental health programs, because we can’t get the proper finances and resources to help the community,” Khalaf said. “And it’s not different with Covid. How can we tell how hard-hit the community is? How do we advocate for a proper allocation of resources, like the vaccine, in these communities if we can’t show what our concentrations are?”                 Advocacy groups expected the adoption of a MENA category in 2015 and 2017, according to Khalaf, but the OMB abandoned the motion upon the emergence of the Trump administration.                 CNN has reached out to the OMB for comment.                  The Biden-Harris administration drafted a “plan for partnership” with the Arab American community prior to its election pledging to “support the creation of a new Middle East North Africa (MENA) category, which was recommended by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017, so that Arab Americans can be more fairly counted and their needs studied and considered alongside other minorities.”                 “The Trump Administration politicized the 2020 Census, putting marginalized communities at risk of a drastic undercount, and abandoned the addition of a MENA category on the Census,” reads the Biden-Harris partnership plan.                 Khalaf is cautiously optimistic that the Biden-Harris administration could be open to adopting a correct categorization for the community. But he emphasized that this should have never been a partisan issue.                 “With the Biden administration, at least now we have a cabinet that will listen, said Khalaf. “Whether or not they act upon it is a different story.”       Nadeem Muaddi and Priya Krishnakumar contributed to this story.  © 2024 Cable News Network.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.             There are some obvious lessons we should draw from the Jan. 6 insurrection to ensure the United States never sees another attack like that. The first is that all involved, perhaps including Donald Trump for inciting the mob, must be brought to justice to serve as a deterrent to any others who might contemplate similar violence to overturn an election. Another is that the words of political figures and their media allies who appear to be advocating insurrection must be loudly denounced.                    In the past few days, we’ve seen the Michigan GOP state chair invoke the specter of violence against those not loyal to Trump and conservative Trump media allies saying on Newsmax that they wished the military would step in and take over from President Joe Biden. Before the attack on the Capitol this type of language was wrong. Today it feels like a dangerous continuation of the type of incitement that led to the Jan. 6 attack.                 Michigan GOP chair Ron Weiser made his comments at a Republican club meeting on Thursday, where he was asked how to remove from office two of the state’s Republican members of Congress, Reps. Fred Upton and Peter Meijer, who were among the 10 Republicans who voted with Democrats in February to impeach Trump for incitement of insurrection. Weiser responded, “Other than assassination, I have no other way other than voting out. OK?”                   There’s absolutely no place for using the word “assassination” by any American pollical leader as a tactic to remove political figures you disagree with – even if, as Weiser claims, the comments were taken out of context. Weiser’s comment is especially irresponsible given that Meijer publicly shared in January that he’d bought body armor after death threats against Republicans who’d voted to charge Trump.      Related articleThe fried-egg school of politics             Weiser wasn’t done with being vile. He also referred to the three statewide female Democratic officials, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, as “the three witches” and said his “job now is to soften up those three witches,” so come the 2022 election, “they are ready for the burning at the stake.”                 This is not just sexist, but violent imagery that is even more dangerous given that we learned last October Gov. Whitmer had been the target of a plot by right wing militia groups to kidnap and possibly kill her. Fourteen people were charged in the conspiracy, with Whitmer, in response, drawing a straight line to Trump – who had frequently publicly attacked her and called to “liberate” Michigan – for his refusal “to condemn White supremacists and hate groups like these two Michigan militia groups.”                 Meanwhile, over on the very pro-Trump network Newsmax, the network’s weekend co-hosts, Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known as “Diamond and Silk,” appeared on another show where they made a jaw-dropping call for the US military to remove President Biden from office. After the two shared their view that Biden has “a cognitive problem” because he tripped while climbing the stairs of Air Force One, Hardaway added, “Listen, I wish that the military would step in and take over.” She later demanded that the people currently in charge of our nation need to “go somewhere, sit down, and allow the military to take over from here.”     Related articleTrump's big lie could backfire in Georgia              Yes, on American television, hosts called for a military coup to overturn our democracy, remove the US President and have the military run the nation.                 I called and emailed Newsmax to see if, as a network, it supported or denounced their hosts’ call to overthrow our democratically elected government and replace it with military rule. They have not yet responded.                 Michigan GOP Chair Weiser, who also serves on the University of Michigan’s board of regents, at first refused to apologize for his words, instead remarking he should have “picked his words more carefully.” Then, in typical Trumpian fashion, he attacked the media and “leftists” for overhyping the issue.                 Weiser finally offered what The Detroit Free Press dubbed “an apology of sorts” on Saturday, after mounting pressure from elected officials and University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel, who slammed Weiser’s comments as being “particularly abhorrent” after the Jan. 6 attack “directed at elected officials, our democratic institutions, and the individuals who guard them.”     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             “I apologize to those I offended for the flippant analogy about three women who are elected officials and for the off-hand comments about two other leaders,” said Weiser, adding, (to his credit) “in an increasingly vitriolic political environment, we should all do better to treat each other with respect, myself included.”                 These are not normal times. We must swiftly and in one voice denounce political leaders or media pundits who suggest violence or call for a military coup. If not, a Jan. 6-style attack could happen again – and next time these un-American, anti-democratic forces may prevail.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/influencers-pandemic-travel-social-media-scli-gbr-intl-cmd/index.html,"As young people itch to leave lockdown, British health leaders face a new challenge: Influencers","When 21-year-old Daanish Hussain escaped London for Dubai over the New Year, he did what he does almost every day – reached for his phone, and documented his journey for his 550,000 followers on TikTok.","Mar 23, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Rob Picheta,International,"When 21-year-old Daanish Hussain escaped London for Dubai over the New Year, he did what he does almost every day – reached for his phone, and documented his journey for his 550,000 followers on TikTok.                 His video montage – which showed him swapping gray skies for sunshine in the United Arab Emirates – would draw the envy of many Brits, who have been banned from all but essential international travel for months.                  But he was far from alone. In recent months, as the UK has sat frozen in lockdown, countless social media stars have posted content from beaches, shopping malls and hotels in Dubai and other favorite hotspots – many staying in the city despite its own restrictions beginning last month.             “I noticed that a lot of influencers went away – like, a lot of influencers,” Hussain told CNN, admitting he has seen some anger in the comments on his travel videos.                  The travels of British influencers haven’t escaped the attention of the UK’s insatiable tabloids – screenshots of their foreign parties have been plastered underneath unflattering headlines for weeks.                 And influencers don’t need to leave home to draw a backlash. Last month, a leading official at the National Health Service (NHS) was forced to urge people not to follow the advice of Gwyneth Paltrow, who wrote on her blog that she eased the effects of long Covid with a variety of superfoods like kombucha and kimchi.                 But as young people become restless in lockdown, and as the vaccine rollout moves towards millennials, concern is growing from both inside and outside the influencing industry that their laissez-faire approach is rubbing off on followers.                 “One of the reasons marketers use celebrities in their campaigns is because they know it has an impact because consumers, particularly young people, want to emulate their behaviours,” Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told CNN on email. “Social media influencers are today’s celebrities. They should recognise the responsibility that comes with that and work to promote public health, not undermine it.                 “Influencers have got this huge pull – it’s in their very name, they influence,” added Keith Herman, whose company Trending Travel uses a network of influencers to promote locations around the world. “You’ve got to be careful how you use them.”                 The NHS’s dismissal of Paltrow’s suggestions for dealing with Covid-19 was unexpected, and gave a glimpse at the exasperation among health leaders that young people are seeing the pandemic through the eyes of their online idols.                 “Like the virus, misinformation carries across borders and it mutates and it evolves,” Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said after the actress suggested a particular diet had helped with the “brain fog” she experienced after having Covid-19.                  “We need to take long Covid seriously and apply serious science. All influencers who use social media have a duty of responsibility and a duty of care around that.”     How Dubai is paying the price for letting in tourists             The UK’s Home Secretary Priti Patel had similarly railed against stars taking flights to sunnier locations. “We see plenty of influencers on social media showing off where they are in the world – mainly sunny places,” she said in Parliament, emphasizing that people should simply not be traveling.”                 But if British media outlets are any indication, the admonishment has not filtered through the influencer community.                 “NO SHAME: Brit influencers STILL promoting parties and moan people are ‘quick to judge’,” The Sun reported last month – one of a flurry of critical stories. A number of former stars of the popular British reality television show “Love Island” have been heavily criticized by some followers for posting poolside pictures from the city, while one fitness influencer caused a viral backlash after telling ITV she left lockdown for Dubai because her “job is to motivate people.”             A glance at the comments on any influencer currently relaxing abroad shows that not everyone feels the same way. “Hard at work! Hope you’re enjoying the pandemic,” one user wrote under a recent image from former reality TV star James Lock, showing him jet skiing in Dubai. Similar posts from influencers often see a flurry of messages in which fans say they will unfollow the star.                 Hussain, who became one of Britain’s TikTok stars last year under his handle “its_danzy,” insisted the outrage is misplaced. “Some people don’t realize that social media’s a job,” he told CNN.                 As for his own reasons to travel, Hussain said he “had to go for business reasons,” but also “we were in a lockdown and it was for my birthday.” He added: “And I knew it would be good for content as well. People love different countries and that.”                 The university student is under no illusions that his sudden platform carries weight, including when his content runs counter to official advice. “People kind of look at you as a role model … when you have people value your point and value whatever you say, in a sense, I think that does kind of have an influence.”     A post shared by Danzy (@its_danzy)             And he admitted that he regretted, “to an extent,” posting about his travels. “You’re kind of telling people to do what the law’s telling you not to do.                 “But if I was there for a business reason, or for influencing reasons … I wouldn’t say that you should go as well,” he added. “If an influencer doesn’t do what they have to do, they’re not going to make money.”                 Others have been less relaxed.                  Herman, whose Trending Travel uses a network of influencers to promote locations around the world, said he has taken the costly decision to tell stars not to post content from abroad.                 “We realized quite early on that every time anybody posted, they were getting absolutely slaughtered on a sensitive subject,” he said. “I think some of them are more naive than anything else … We just said to all of the influencers that we had out (in holiday destinations): please don’t post.”                 Elma Beganovich, an influencer with 700,000 Instagram followers who has capitalized on her social know-how to set up a marketing company, told CNN that online stars must stick to a crucial rule: “You can’t be tone deaf.                 “Springing champagne at the pool at some exotic resort … that’s just not going to be socially acceptable,” Beganovich told CNN. “It’s become distasteful to say, look how ostentatious I am, when you know so many people have lost jobs or they have their loved ones hospitalized.”                 Beganovich’s company, Amra & Elma, works with a host of influencers who have had to adjust their output during the pandemic, urging them to ditch the “you don’t belong here, we’re too exclusive for you” attitude that has become a feature of Instagram pages in recent years.                 And failing to move with that trend could have a significant financial impact, she said, in an influencer marketing industry that is expected to be worth $15 billion by 2022 according to research firm Insider Intelligence.                  “For influencers, followers are everything,” she said. “They may lose their contracts, or have them downsized or paused,” if brands consider their behavior out of touch.                 More pressingly, health experts are becoming concerned about the impact of carefree content at a time when most of the world is still agonizingly stuck under a Covid-19 cloud.                 Polls in the UK show that younger people are more likely to be opposed to lockdown than elders. And soon, the UK’s expansive vaccine rollout will reach those ages too. Research by the Office for National Statistics revealed this month that one in six adults under the age of 30 were hesitant about taking a coronavirus vaccine, compared to far smaller numbers of over-50s.                 “Celebrities and public figures influence public perceptions, attitudes, and behavior, which comes with great responsibility,” said Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London. “We would hope that all influencers and people in the public eye would make their comments science-based and their actions clearly within the rules,” he said.                   “We know from other public health topics that images or accounts of celebrities engaging in harmful behaviors does play a role in others believing that the behavior is acceptable or normal,” Linda Bauld, Bruce and John Usher Professor of Public Health at Edinburgh University, added. “There are a number of studies illustrating that celebrities smoking in films influences youth smoking, and that alcohol endorsements by influencers increase the risk of alcohol abuse in teenagers.                 “It is therefore plausible that if we see influencers flouting lock down rules in the press, it normalizes that type of behavior, making it more acceptable,” she said.     Influencers are using their clout and getting paid to promote Covid best practices for New Jersey             “There’s a lot of things that one could say are a bit flippant and irresponsible” online, added Heidi J Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, a research group at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine created to combat vaccine hesitancy.                  “The reality is (young people) have been less affected by this pandemic,” she added. “(And) They’ve got a lot of exposure to this misinformation.                 “We shouldn’t kid ourselves about the wave of hesitancy we’re going to see in different settings, and particularly with younger people,” she said.                 But if they do provide a challenge, influencers can also present an opportunity.                 The British government has sought to bring them on side. Last month it appointed Alex George, a contestant on the reality TV show “Love Island,” who returned to work as a frontline doctor during the Covid-19 crisis, to be a Mental Health Ambassador. And last year £63,000 ($88,000) was given to 42 influencers in exchange for them promoting its coronavirus Test and Trace program.                 “I think it’s a good thing – we’ll need a diversity of types of voices,” Larson said. “It’s important to have some credible and authoritative voices on social media.”                 Even travel companies like Herman’s are looking to use influencers in a new way, encouraging them to start posting about how Covid-secure hotels are once they re-start promotions.                 And Beganovich is predicting lasting changes in the influencing industry, with a new interest in content from health experts. “I’ve seen ER doctors who gain a lot of popularity through Instagram,” she said. “Even influencers are influenced.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Asian Americans, already traumatized by a rising tide of hate, violence and rhetoric, have been living in fear for months.                 The murders of eight people, including six Asian women, among them four South Koreans, further disoriented and horrified a community already unfairly stigmatized by racial association during a pandemic that originated in China. And they laid bare for the rest of the country the agony of yet another minority group left to question its place in America, at a time of rising attacks and harassment amid cresting White nationalism and domestic extremism.                 Many Asian Americans feel exposed by a torrent of dangerous and racially motivated rhetoric by national figures on a cultural crusade. Most prominently that includes ex-President Donald Trump, who presided over four years of rising racial tensions and often used division as a tool of personal power.                 Campaigners talk of a perfect storm of prejudice targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander community that stirred latent hatreds as Covid-19 first arrived in the US, and was exacerbated by Trump’s relish in flinging around terms like “China virus.”                 “There is a lot of fear in the community not just because of the hate crimes of the last year, which are the result of xenophobic messaging around the pandemic by the former President,” Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen, a Democrat, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Wednesday. “There is a lot of history of Asian American violence in this country – and many of our parents or grandparents and ancestors experienced that.”                  Anti-Asian hate crimes are up 150% during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.                 NBA veteran Jeremy Lin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night that while he had experienced bigotry when he was younger, it was now much more pronounced.                 “It feels very different. I think growing up, it was always something that might be a little more subtle or verbal. But I think what we are seeing right now is a lot of physical actual violence, lives being taken. A lot of Asian Americans who are looking over their shoulders when they go outside, when they go to the grocery story,” Lin said.                 “I think there is a lot of racially charged hatred right now that we’re seeing and feeling.”     Related articleAsian Americans were already living in fear. The Atlanta-area spa killings feel like a terrifying escalation for them              Vivien Tsou, national field director for the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, described a personal sense of dislocation and horror after Tuesday’s killings, that she said were deeply felt in her community.                 On a day when the new Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told lawmakers that domestic extremism was the greatest threat to the homeland, Tsou argued that Asian Americans did not face distinct peril but were targeted by the same forces of hate endured by Black Americans and that were evident in the insurrection against the US Capitol on January 6.                 “While the focus is on anti-Asian hate, it all stems from White supremacy and anyone can be a scapegoat at any moment,” Tsou said.                  “This is something that we need to face together and stand in solidarity,” she said, referring to other ethnic minority groups.                 More broadly, the ordeal of the Asian American community revealed another dimension of the much discussed national reckoning over race A flurry of current events – from the crisis on the southwestern border, to Republicans’ voter suppression efforts, to the disparities in Covid-19 vaccine availability – all revolve to some extent around questions of ethnicity. And they are highlighting the particular pain of minority Americans that can never be felt and is rarely truly appreciated by those in the White majority.                 On Wednesday, a prospective juror in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer charged in the killing of George Floyd, was asked by a defense lawyer whether he had personal views that could shape his judgment.                 “Being a Black man in America, I experience racism every day,” the unidentified man said. He was later excused from service despite insisting he could deliver a fair verdict.                  The exchange didn’t just crystallize the question at the heart of a case with grave national implications – whether the US legal system can deliver justice to a dead Black man or whether an accused White police officer can get a fair trial in such emotive circumstances. It exposed the racism many Blacks, Asians and other minorities believe endemic that other Americans only see after tragedies or national outrages.                 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that the Asian American community needed the same consideration shown to Black Americans in the  aftermath of Floyd’s death amid a national outpouring over police violence.                 “In the same way African Americans across this country ask for support and we asked for people to stand with us over the summer, it’s important that people stand with our Asian brothers and sisters in the same way,” she said. “They are being targeted unfairly and in Atlanta, what we’ve seen – the worst has happened.”                 The extent to which Trump, who often refused to unequivocally condemn White supremacy, and his enablers are to blame for the rising racial prejudice is at the center of controversy in the wake of Tuesday’s attack.                 Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California told CNN on Wednesday that the hysteria whipped up by the ex-President – who at times referred to Covid-19 as “kung flu” has been disastrous for the community.                 “Since the start of the pandemic, he’s been calling this the China virus,” Chu told CNN’s Brooke Baldwin. “So, now we have had a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents.”                 The extent to which the plight of Asian Americans was caught up in Trump’s scorched earth strategy was revealed during a debate about a Democratic House resolution condemning violence against the community in September.                 A total of 164 Republicans voted against the measure, which some described as “woke culture on steroids.” Some members objected to drawing a parallel between the impact of the phrase “China virus” and the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II and historic discrimination against Chinese immigrants – both of which scarred America’s conscience and still resonates with many Asian Americans.                 The World Health Organization has advised against linking the virus directly to any region or ethnic group precisely because of the hate and harassment that has been endured by Asian Americans.                 But one of Trump’s top allies, Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, said in the debate that the measure was an example of “cancel culture” designed to prevent Americans talking truthfully about where the virus was first discovered.                 And even though Trump is no longer in office, much of the Republican Party can’t shake its relish for raising the specter of outsiders – often people of color – while hinting that they threaten majority White American culture.                 In a trip to the southern border this week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said that in addition to a stream of Central Americans, Yemenis, Iranians, Sri Lankans and “even” Chinese were crossing the frontier.     Related articleAsian Americans reported being targeted at least 500 times in the last two months               Increasing attacks on Asian Americans over the last year, including on elder members of the community, have left many scared to leave their homes or unwilling to venture beyond their immediate family networks. People have been verbally abused and accused of spreading Covid-19. Lin was called “coronavirus” on court. There have been especially troubling cases of xenophobic violence against elderly Asian Americans.                 “The Asian American community here is in shock,” Christopher Chan, the advisory chair of the Asian American Action Fund Georgia Chapter, told CNN on Wednesday. “We want attention drawn to this rising epidemic of hate crime, of crimes being committed against Asian Americans.”                 The specific motive behind the shooting spree in Georgia in which Robert Aaron Long, 21, has been charged, remains unclear according to police.                 But Bottoms said on CNN’s “The Situation Room” that it was hard to believe the alleged killer’s reported statement that he was acting on a motive rooted in sex addiction.                 “The fact that many of the victims were Asian … and that he targeted these Asian massage parlors. It’s very difficult to ignore that the Asian community has been targeted and it’s happening across the country,” the mayor said.                 Whether the rationale for the killing was racial or not, it does seem to have been motivated by some form of hate.                 “I know there has been a lot of questions about whether it is racially motivated,” Tsou said. “It is not just race, it is gender. These women were doing a day job to provide for their family. They were going out in a pandemic. This is another layer of fear that we have put upon our communities.”                 Community advocates say there has long been an issue of Asian women being objectified because they work in massage parlors or spas.                 Esther Kao, speaking on behalf of Red Canary Song, a New York collective that advocates for labor rights for (mostly Asian) massage parlor workers and sex workers, said women in the industry had faced a recent surge of racism.                 “But it’s not specific to the sex industry; Chinatown restaurants, workers have also gotten the same kind of threats, and also like lost income during this time,” Kao told CNN’s “Meanwhile in America” newsletter on Wednesday.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The objections, including a rebuke from the Guardian newspaper, come after the Society of Editors rejected allegations made by Prince Harry that racism had played a role in how the British press covered his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.                  The comments were made during an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in which the couple opened up about the challenges of life inside the royal family. The media coverage “was bringing out a part of people that was racist,” Meghan said.                 Society of Editors executive director Ian Murray said in a statement on Monday that it was “untrue” that sections of the UK press were bigoted. “It is not acceptable for the Duke and Duchess to make such claims without providing any supporting evidence,” he said, pointing to “universal supporting coverage” in the media of their marriage.      Related articleOne reason Meghan suffered racist UK coverage: The media is not diverse             The Society of Editors has 400 members, mostly working journalists, and runs the Press Awards, the premier annual awards event in British journalism. The event was formerly called the British Press Awards.                 “The UK media has never shied away from holding a spotlight up to those in positions of power, celebrity or influence,” Murray said in the statement. “If sometimes the questions asked are awkward and embarrassing, then so be it, but the press is most certainly not racist.”                 But several British journalists disputed that view.                 “We disagree with the Society of Editors statement on the Meghan and Harry interview,” the Guardian said in a statement posted to its corporate account on Twitter on Tuesday.                 “Every institution in the United Kingdom is currently examining its own position on vital issues of race and the treatment of people of colour. As I have said before, the media must do the same. It must be much more representative and more self-aware,” added editor-in-chief Katharine Viner.                 Journalists citeda range of evidence to support their claims that Meghan had received racist coverage, including comparisons of favorable coverage afforded Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, and statistics showing that UK newsrooms continue to struggle with diversity.                 But compelling evidence can also be found in headlines run by major tabloids. One Mail Online headline declared in 2016 that Meghan was “(almost) straight outta Compton.” Around the same time, The Daily Star ran a headline asking whether Harry would “marry into gangster royalty?”                 Sathnam Sanghera, a columnist at The Times newspaper and author of a recent book on how imperialism shaped Britain, said on Twitter that it “pains me to say that my industry has been in denial about its institutional racism.”     Related articlePiers Morgan blasted by co-host over Meghan: 'You continue to trash her'             HuffPost UK editor-in-chief Jess Brammar said on Twitter she disagreed with the Society’s assertion that it is “untrue that sections of UK press were bigoted.”                  And Anne Alexander, senior political producer for ITV’s “Good Morning Britain,” added that she was “still trying to process this ridiculous statement.”                 “How can you possibly say that no part of the media is bigoted?

In a letter posted online, journalists of color — including from The Guardian and Condé Nast — urged the Society of Editors to address bigotry and racism in UK media coverage, rather than pretend it doesn’t exist.     Related articleDoes the UK media have a racism problem? These journalists think so             Murray’s insistence that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had provided no “supporting evidence” to support claims of racist coverage showed a “willful ignorance” of the discriminatory treatment of Meghan by the British press, as well as of other people who do not identify as White, according to the letter.                 “We, the undersigned journalists of colour, working in UK media organisations, deplore and reject the statement issued by the Society of Editors, denying the existence of racism and bigotry in the UK press,”the journalists wrote.                 “The blanket refusal to accept there is any bigotry in the British press is laughable, does a disservice to journalists of colour and shows an institution and an industry in denial,” they added.                 The lettercited a range of evidence to support their claims, including a 2016 report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance which found that hate speech among traditional UK media, particularly tabloid newspapers, “continues to be a serious problem” and fuels prejudice.                  Compelling evidence can also be found in headlines run by major tabloids. One Mail Online headline declared in 2016 that Meghan was “(almost) straight outta Compton.” Around the same time, The Daily Star ran a headline asking whether Harry would “marry into gangster royalty?”                 On Wednesday, before Murray resigned, the Society of Editors issued what it described as a “clarification.”                  “Our statement on Meghan and Harry … did not reflect what we all know: that there is a lot of work to be done in the media to improve diversity and inclusion. We will reflect on the reaction our statement prompted and work towards being part of the solution,” the body, which runs the prestigious annual Press Awards, said in a statement.                 In another statement, Murray acknowledged that the organization’s initial remarks had been “heavily criticised.”                 “While I do not agree that the Society’s statement was in any way intended to defend racism, I accept it could have been much clearer in its condemnation of bigotry and has clearly caused upset,” he added.     Related articleOne reason Meghan suffered racist UK coverage: The media is not diverse             But the damage has already been done. ITV news anchor Charlene White on Wednesdayquit as host of the Press Awards. In a letter first reported by HuffPost UK, White told the Society of Editors that it should “look elsewhere” for a host.                 “Perhaps someone whose views align with yours: that the UK press is the one institution in the entire country who has a perfect record on race,” she added.                 The editors of The Guardian and Financial Times newspapers have also disputed the original statement from the Society of Editors.                  “There is work to be done across all sectors in the UK to call out and challenge racism,” FT editor Roula Khalaf said in a statement. “The media has a critical role to play, and editors must ensure that our newsrooms and coverage reflect the societies we live in,” she added.                 “Every institution in the United Kingdom is currently examining its own position on vital issues of race and the treatment of people of colour. As I have said before, the media must do the same. It must be much more representative and more self-aware,” added Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner.                 Reach Plc, which publishes the Mirror, the Express and The Daily Star, declined to comment on the Society of Editors statement. CNN Business has contacted the Daily Mail and The Sun’s publisher, News UK, for comment. Harry and Meghan said last April that they would no longer engage with major tabloids and have sued some newspapers.                 The British press remains overwhelmingly White compared to the overall racial and ethnic makeup of the United Kingdom.                 A report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in 2016 found that just 6% of journalists across UK newsrooms don’t identify as White, compared with about 13% of the general population. The same study found that while Black Britons make up 3% of the population, they account for just 0.2% of journalists.                 And according to a report last July from the Reuters Institute, none of Britain’s top 10 print, digital or broadcast outlets have a Black editor in chief.                 “The Society of Editors should have used the comments by the Sussexes to start an open and constructive discussion about the best way to prevent racist coverage in future, including through addressing lack of representation in the UK media, particularly at a senior level,” the letter from journalists of color said.                  “At a time when many industries and companies are engaged in a reckoning with race in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, we believe it would be a better use of the Society of Editors’ time to reflect on the lack of diversity,” it added.

The attack took place in Albu-Dour’s predominantly Sunni village in Salah al-Din province, about 84 miles north of the Iraqi capital. The area is under the control of Iraq’s Shia led paramilitary forces also known as the Popular Mobilization Units (PMUs).                  ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released Friday. The group said several ISIS militants carried out three separate attacks, including one where they “raided a house” in a village north of Baghdad and shot and killed six family members.                 They called some of those related to the people they killed “spies” who worked for the Popular Mobilization Units.                 ISIS released photos of the raid, including images of some of the victims. Iraqi security officials confirmed to CNN that they were indeed the victims.                 The terrorist group also killed a local police officer and a lawyer in two separate attacks in the same village, the Iraqi military statement said.                 Iraqi security officials said during the investigation they have “concluded that the perpetrators of the crime were elements of ISIS terrorist group who infiltrated the village on foot while wearing military uniform under the pretext of searching homes of the victims,” according to the statement.                 The attack occurred just days after Pope Francis’ historic visit to Iraq, on which he spread messages of peace and religious tolerance.     Related articlePope Francis condemns extremism as 'betrayal of religion'             Ammar al-Jaber, the governor of Salah al-Din, told CNN on Saturday that he requested for Iraqi Interior minister Othman Al-Ghanimi, who is visiting the area on Saturday, to allow local police to take full control of security in the area instead of the PMUs. Al-Ghanimi agreed to the measure, pending approval from the prime minister.                 Al-Jaber said paramilitary forces did a great job fighting ISIS between 2014 and 2017 but it’s now time for local police to take over the responsibility with the support of Iraqi army.                 In a statement on Friday, al-Jaber strongly condemned “the cowardly attack” and said the “security of citizens and the security of the province is a red line, and we will not allow Salah al-Din to be a hotbed for the repetition of such heinous crimes.”                 “The perpetrators of such accidents will receive their fair punishments, whoever they are and whatever their reasons, and investigations are underway at its highest levels,” the governor said.                 In December 2017, the Iraqi military declared it had “fully liberated” all of Iraq’s territory of “ISIS terrorist gangs” with the support of the US-led coalition and had retaken full control of the Iraqi Syrian border; however, ISIS militants are still able to stage sporadic deadly attacks in the country.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The 31-year-old was sentenced in December to five years and eight months in prison on what critics have described as politically motivated charges, but was released in February after serving more than 1,000 days behind bars. She was appealing for her sentence to be overturned and a five-year travel ban lifted.                 On her way into the appeals hearing Wednesday, Hathloul told reporters she hoped Riyadh’s Specialized Criminal Court would change her sentence – her first public comments since her arrest in 2018. The court, however, ruled that the original sentence should stand.                 “The judge denied the appeal and confirmed the sentence to five years and eight months in prison which includes 3 years of probation and 5 years of a travel ban during which Loujain cannot leave Saudi Arabia at any time,” according to a statement by her campaign.                   Hathloul was detained in May 2018 during a sweep that targeted other well-known opponents of the kingdom’s since-rescinded law barring women from driving. She had also challenged other legal restrictions on Saudi women enforced under the kingdom’s restrictive male guardianship system.      Related articleHow Biden can strike a blow against Saudi Arabia's human rights violations              She told her family she had been tortured and sexually abused in prison – allegations Riyadh has repeatedly denied – and her detention was condemned by the United Nations and international rights groups.                 Hathloul’s sentence, according to her campaign, includes restrictions signed by her that state she “cannot speak publicly about her case or reveal any details regarding prison nor celebrate her release on a public level.”                 In a statement in December, Hathloul’s family said she would remain on probation for three years, during which time she could be arrested for any perceived illegal activity.                 Her release in February came less than a week after the White House called on the kingdom to release political prisoners, including women’s rights activists. US President Joe Biden has vowed to pressure Saudi Arabia into improving its rights record, marking a departure from the Trump administration, which was reluctant to criticize the kingdom’s crackdown on dissent.                 The terrorism court convicted Hathloul on charges of harming national security, seeking to change the Saudi political system, and using her relations with foreign governments and rights groups to “pressure the Kingdom to change its laws and systems,” according to a charge sheet her family published in December.                 UN experts have called the charges against Hathloul “spurious.” In a six-page charge sheet for Hathloul’s case, seen by CNN, a section entitled “crimes committed” includes activism against the kingdom’s restrictive male guardianship laws, along with contact with foreign journalists and diplomats.     Related articleSaudi women empowerment 'a lie', say siblings of Loujain al-Hathloul a day after her release              The charges also relied on a series of alleged confessions, according to the documents, which state that Hathloul admitted to applying for a job at the UN along with confessing to being in contact with the human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.                 For much of her imprisonment, Hathloul detailed her hardships to her parents during their prison visits. Those allegations were later made public by three of her siblings who live outside the kingdom, and were corroborated by the court testimony of other female activists.                 Hathloul said she was sexually assaulted and tortured while in detention, including waterboarding, flogging and electrocution, according to multiple statements released by her family and supporters.                 Saudi authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of torture and sexual abuse in their prisons.                 According to her family, Hathloul has twice gone on hunger strike – in protest at her prison conditions, and because she was denied communication with her relatives.                 Hathloul’s sister, Lina al-Hathloul, who has been a driving force behind an international campaign for her release, shared a photo of her sister going into court on Wednesday and reacted to the ruling.                 “The international community should be outraged at this judgment and really take time to study their conscience as they continue to do business with Saudi Arabia,” Lina Al-Hathloul said Wednesday, according to the campaign.

Abdullah Alaoudh is Director of Research for the Gulf Region at DAWN, Visiting Professor at the Elliot School of International Affairs at George Washington and the son of prominent Saudi cleric and political prisoner Salman al-Awda. The views expressed here are their own. Read more opinion at CNN.             Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was released from prison earlier this month after serving 1001 days in prison for “crimes” that included contacting human rights groups and trying to change Saudi Arabia’s restrictive male guardianship laws. Loujain is by no means free, though. She is banned from traveling for five years and remains on a three-year probation, living under the constant threat of being jailed again.      Travel bans are not new in Saudi Arabia. But past rulers used them more sparingly. Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS)  took power, they have increasingly become a key instrument in his struggle to extinguish any semblance of dissent. MBS has not only gone after activists and dissidents, but also has prevented their families from leaving the country in order to bully and coerce them into keeping silent.      Nineteen members of the family of Saudi Muslim scholar and political prisoner Salman Al-Awda have been banned from travel outside Saudi Arabia, including six great-grandchildren, the youngest just a 1-year-old. MBS has also targeted royals, the rich and the powerful in an effort to intimidate, shake down and thwart any challenge to his power. The campaign against the Saudi power elite was launched in November 2017, when MBS’ security forces detained hundreds of the Kingdom’s richest royals and businessmen at the swanky and now infamous Ritz Carlton Hotel.  After enduring weeks of confinement that allegedly included torture and forking over assets under duress, the Ritz detainees were released – save for one who died in custody.  (A Saudi official told the New York Times that the allegations of abuse and torture are “absolutely untrue.”)                  The shakedown and intimidation continue, though, under the guise of the travel ban, a non-violent but still effective tool of oppression. Since the Ritz we estimate, based on our sources in Saudi Arabia, that hundreds of the rich and royal have been added to the banned list, along with their families.                  These bans violate Saudi domestic law, its own regional treaty obligations and international law. Saudi domestic law requires all bans to have “a specific period of time,” and the Arab Charter on Human Rights, to which Saudi Arabia is a party, forbids governments from “arbitrarily or illegally” depriving citizens of their right to leave the country. Moreover, customary international law, which binds all countries, requires any government issuing a travel ban to provide “precise criteria” for the ban and to afford the affected individual the opportunity to appeal it.      Related articleBiden is racing a ticking clock to fulfill this campaign promise             The Saudi government’s travel bans flout all of these domestic and international legal requirements, depriving citizens of the right to leave the country. Many of those placed on the banned list often only find out about it when they go to the airport or try to cross a border post, making it unclear exactly how many people have been affected. The ban also constitutes an integral part of the government’s apparatus of oppression, a first step along a continuum, which, depending on the whims of its unelected leaders, might well progress to detention or disappearance.     Sarah and Omar Aljabri, ages 21 and 22, the children of former intelligence official Saad Aljabri who fled the country to Canada, have made their way along that continuum, from travel ban to secret trial to detention in an undisclosed location. They are children being used as pawns to escalate pressure on their father, who last August filed a lawsuit in a Washington, DC district court alleging that MBS dispatched an assassination squad from Saudi Arabia to Canada to try to kill him just days after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed by members of the same group. (MBS has denied personal responsibility for Khashoggi’s killing and dismemberment in Turkey in 2018, but said he took “full responsibility” for the journalist’s murder because it was carried out by Saudi officials.)                  Others have been detained or disappeared altogether after being issued with a travel ban: Ahmed and Abdulmajeed Abdulaziz, two brothers of prominent Saudi activist Omar Abdulaziz, the rich and royals Faisal Bin Abdullah, Basma bint Saud and Mohammed bin Nayef, to name just a few that have been documented by Human Rights Watch. All of the travel-banned Saudis, along with exiled dissidents, live in a twilight of uncertainty and fear.                 The United States has an important stake in this clash between dissident and authoritarian forces in Saudi Arabia – a struggle that is also playing out on a larger scale across the Middle East and North Africa. Related articleThese are the women who crushed the Caliphate              At a minimum, the Biden administration – which says it wants to “recalibrate” its relationship with Saudi Arabia –  has an obligation to temper the worst excesses of a leader who has a penchant for sadistic abuses and wanton wars that have harmed and destabilized the region. MBS, is, after all, America’s liability as long as the US government provides him with billions in military weapons and political cover. Moreover, the US has a fundamental reason, both from a moral and self-interest standpoint, to provide support for the dissident and nascent democratic forces that are locked in an existential struggle with the forces of authoritarianism across the region, from Egypt to Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, UAE and Bahrain, Syria, Iraq and Turkey. Indeed, that struggle is taking place worldwide, and, as President Biden has declared, we are a party to it.                  To bolster the forces of democratic reform, the Biden administration should strike a blow against Saudi human rights violations not only in Yemen, but also in Saudi Arabia. The Biden administration has already put a temporary freeze on arms sales to Saudi Arabia; it should use this pause to implement targeted sanctions that would raise the costs of the travel ban to the Saudi government. Such a measure would signal to the Saudis and the world that the US stands firmly on the side of civil society and has turned the page on the Trump administration’s policy of embracing despots.                  The new administration could take a small but significant step by instituting a bar on entry into the US of Saudi leaders, a visa ban for those most responsible for the travel ban, starting with staff members at the Saudi Royal Court and the Interior Ministry.      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             Such a tailored sanction would raise the cost of the travel ban for the Saudis and might just convince MBS to back off and allow Saudis who want to leave to do so. A forceful US response to the Saudi ban would also help fortify the community of dissident Arab exiles who could well play a critical role in the future of the region, and it would position the US in the larger struggle exactly where we belong – on the side of dissidents, civil society and the rule of law.       © 2024 Cable News Network.

Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, hate crimes have been on the rise.","Feb 15, 2021",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Ian Kumamoto,International,"Editor’s Note: Ian Kumamoto is a Brooklyn-based writer who is working on a memoir about mixed-race identity. Follow him on Twitter @IanKumamoto. The views expressed here are the author’s. Read more opinion on CNN.              To me, the Lunar New Year before 2020 signified the abundance and joy that came with a sense of community. Growing up in Texas, we would go to a family friend’s house, alongside other immigrant families, where everyone brought their household specialties.                  Mom would make her salmon fried rice and would place it among an enormous banquet of wonton soups, pork buns and fish bathed in soy sauce and ginger. Afterward, we would lay on a couch or doze off on our chairs before the adults would try and stuff red envelopes filled with money into our hands. When I moved to New York for college, I continued the tradition, albeit among festive strangers in the family-owned restaurants on Pell Street in Chinatown.                  Now, such gatherings feel like a distant memory and the sense of safety we had in each other’s presence far off. Last spring, I was walking out of a Target in downtown Brooklyn when a middle-aged woman followed me and said I was a “disgusting, dog-eating chink,” got into a car and drove off. A few weeks later, my college-aged downstairs neighbors implored me to “go back to California.” In both cases I stood and said nothing – I was flustered.                  I can pinpoint the moment I could no longer ignore the urge to articulate my racial experiences to almost one year ago, when I began to feel in physical danger. At that time, the hateful rhetoric around Chinese people became more open. An Asian woman was set on fire in Brooklyn and President Donald Trump called Covid-19 the “China virus.”                  Then, on Chinese New Year, the streets of Chinatown were the first to be deserted. Many assumed the outbreak would begin in the immigrant-run markets of Canal Street, Flushing or Sunset Park; natural assumptions, considering that from the beginning the virus was framed as uniquely Chinese.                   When friends tried to comfort me, few seemed to have the language for how to deal with the vitriol directed against me, which I figured came from a notion that Asians didn’t have it so bad. I knew this because up until that point, I thought the same thing. As actor Steven Yeun recently said in an interview with the New York Times Magazine, “I wonder if the Asian-American experience is what it’s like when you’re thinking about everyone else, but nobody else is thinking about you.”  If not being thought about was the worst thing I would go through, I figured I would survive.                 Except now, hate crimes against Asian-Americans have increased, an epidemic that is aided by that silence. In the first three months of the pandemic, reported bias incidents against our communities jumped to 2,120, according to the database Stop AAPI Hate. This year, attacks against Asians have been particularly violent and unsettling: a Filipino man was slashed across the face in the New York City subway. An 84 year-old Thai-American was killed in California in broad daylight. Several elderly Asian people in the Bay Area were pushed to the ground, as if for sport. In Portland, more than a dozen Asian-owned businesses have been vandalized. Few national outlets have covered any of it, further cementing our invisibility.                  The cost of not being seen has been high. Even though I was born in Mexico to a Chinese mother and a Mexican father, I have always looked more Asian. Although I am incredibly proud of my Mexican heritage, I often felt like other Latinx people did not regard me as one of their own. Despite the fact that Spanish is my first language, I would still get incredulous looks from others who were mesmerized that a Chinito could speak that language so well, which often led to uncomfortable comments that discouraged me from speaking my native tongue in public altogether.                  Once I arrived in the US 17 years ago, I realized that my classmates assumed I was an Asian-American, the label I would eventually adopt out of convenience. Still, it wasn’t long before I understood that the identity came with its own baggage, namely that I was good at math and was quiet – “I don’t want to sit next to Ian, he doesn’t even talk,” I remember a third-grade classmate telling the teacher, even though she had never met me.                  Being regarded as a background character seemed harmless enough, but it was only much later that I realized how much it affected every aspect of my personality: it deterred me from joining more creative pursuits, from forming authentic friendships in grade school and it made me believe that I was not allowed to feel things and talk about them.                 In high school, I learned through the Internet about the myth Americans had been taught about people who looked like me – that we were the “model minority.” The term was coined in the 1960s by a White sociologist writing for The New York Times Magazine. He was trying to make the case that Asians were what Black people could be, if only they tried harder. Implicit in this generalization was that we were obedient and that we would not stir trouble, unlike what White America viewed as those other pesky minorities – which would grow to include Latinx and other minority groups.                 Because I was not expected to speak out, I mostly avoided talking about how much racism hurt me. Whenever a professor confused me with the other Asian kid in class or a classmate mocked me by pulling their eyes back, I laughed it off, albeit awkwardly. I learned from other Asian-Americans that making fun of ourselves was not only the norm, but it was cool – calling it out would have relegated us to “uptight” status. But being the minority that was not allowed to have self-regard took a toll. It was like being in a purgatory where no one would take me seriously, even when I was no longer joking.                  “Are you sure you heard her right?” a friend asked me after the incident outside of Target.                  Our status as “good” minorities has always been a burden. But it has never felt as heavy as it does now, when we need the support of others and discover that we are unsure of how to speak about our own marginalization. If the task of our immigrant parents was to find a way to survive in the United States, then it is ours to speak into existence the things they left unsaid.                  We need to acknowledge that the model minority status has silenced us, pitted us against other oppressed people and convinced us that we are no good when we are, for whatever the reason of the moment may be, no longer palatable. Unless we change the narrative, we will continue to be the biggest victims to the myth of our exceptionalism.                 Today, Asian Americans are the fastest growing minority group and I see an opportunity to forge a new identity free from the constraints of White supremacy. Although this will likely be a dark time for us, as we confront increasing anti-Asian rhetoric, it might also be what was necessary for a reckoning that was decades in the making.

The following day, as she ate breakfast, her phone flashed again. This time it was news of another friend, Lloyd, dead at 58. The next day, another call. Her friend Haydon, 51, was in the hospital. He died the following day. In the space of just five days, Lloyd-Jones lost three loved ones to Covid-19.                   One month on, the social care manager, who lives in London, has become a one-woman publicity machine for members of the Black community, encouraging everyone she knows to get vaccinated, so she won’t have to say goodbye to another friend or family member.                      “I have been agonizing about writing this message but have decided that this is what I have to do as a 59-year-old Black woman,” read the message she sent to everyone in her WhatsApp contact book. “I now believe we must do something to halt the devastation and loss.                 “I have decided to have the Covid-19 vaccine,” she wrote. “This was one of the hardest decisions I have made in my life.”                   Lloyd-Jones’s uncle died from coronavirus four days after the UK locked down last March, and the twin sister of her friend Annette, called Paulette, also lost her life in 2020. The twins are buried together. Yet Lloyd-Jones is far from being the only member of Britain’s Black community or other ethnic minorities to feel unsure about taking a Covid-19 shot.                 A report released by the UK Household Longitudinal Study earlier this year found that 72% of Black British respondents said they were unlikely or very unlikely to get a coronavirus vaccine.                  According to the same survey, those from Britain’s Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities were also hesitant, with 42% saying they were unlikely or very unlikely to get vaccinated.                       The data the report was based on was carried out in November, prior to any vaccines being approved, and those numbers are likely to have dipped in recent weeks, as the shots are rolled out with few, if any, reports of serious side effects.                      But Black people and those from minority groups are still thought to be less willing to get vaccinated than their White counterparts – a factor which concerns health authorities and community leaders alike.                   According to data from OpenSAFELY – an electronic platform from the UK’s National Health Service that documents coronavirus vaccine uptake – Black people over 80 were around half as likely to be vaccinated as their White counterparts, as of January 27.                  From the outset, it has been clear that people from ethnic minority backgrounds have been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19.                         According to the latest report from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), from October, Black men in England and Wales had the highest rate of death involving Covid-19, which was 2.7 times higher than White men. Women of Black Caribbean background had a death rate that was twice that of White women in England and Wales. Additionally, the ONS found that all ethnic minority groups, other than Chinese, were dying from Covid-19 at a disproportionately higher rate than the White population.                  Kamlesh Khunti, an expert in Black and minority healthcare at the UK’s University of Leicester, believes that – despite higher death rates – vaccine hesitancy in Black, Asian and other minority communities was predictable.                  “We should have prepared for this, since we have seen low uptakes in flu vaccinations among minority communities,” he told CNN. “People are concerned about the contents of the vaccine because of religious and cultural concerns.”                  Khunti said part of the problem was a lack of deliberate effort to reach out to people from minorities: “We don’t see the messaging coming down to the channels that most ethnic minorities listen to, especially in the languages they speak.”                    Other experts say skepticism around vaccines is down to a lack of trust in medical and governmental institutions – the roots of which can be traced back to colonialism and slavery.                     “People can’t disentangle where we are, in terms of medicine today, from the experimentation on colonized and indigenous people,” said Dr. Annabel Sowemimo, founder of the organization Decolonising Contraception, and author of the upcoming book “Decolonising Healthcare.”                   “People think that these behaviors in minority communities are irrational or erratic, but amongst the community it is well known that these things have happened,” Sowemimo said.                 For 40 years, from 1932 until 1972, the US Public Health Service conducted tests on hundreds of Black men with syphilis in Alabama. The men, many of whom were faculty and staff from Tuskegee Institute, were deliberately untreated to assess the progress of the disease.      Related articleNew data shows many Black Americans remain hesitant to get Covid-19 vaccine             According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the study became unethical in the 1940s when penicillin was recognized as the recommended drug for syphilis treatment. Penicillin was not offered to the subjects of the decades-long study.                 Ever since this incident researchers must get informed consent from all persons taking part in studies.                  In another case, the US-based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer paid compensation to the families of 11 children who died, and dozens more who were harmed, in Kano State, Nigeria, after some were given an experimental anti-meningitis drug, Trovan, during trials in 1996.                 The suit alleged that the drug company did not obtain parental consent and did not explain that the proposed treatment was experimental. The Nigerian government said the drug caused deaths and deformities among children and had been used without approval from Nigerian regulatory agencies. Pfizer maintained that the trial was conducted with the approval of the Nigerian government and consent of the participants’ parents or guardians.                    And there has been at least one suggestion to experiment on Black people during the current pandemic too.                   In April 2020, two French doctors – Dr. Jean-Paul Mira, head of ICU services at the Cochin hospital in Paris, and Camille Locht, research director at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research – suggested during a TV debate that Covid-19 vaccines should be tested in Africa. The pair later apologized after WHO’s Director-General condemned the remarks, calling them a “hangover from a colonial mentality.”                  These historical and modern injustices have fueled mistrust among some in Britain’s Black and minority communities.                     A lack of trust in public health providers was shown in a report by the UK’s Joint Committee on Human Rights, which found that more than 60% of Black people in the UK do not believe their health is as equally protected by the country’s National Health Service (NHS) compared to White people. Women (78%) are much more likely than men (47%) to feel that their health was not equally protected by the NHS compared to the White population, according to the research.                       “Health inequalities have been ignored for a significant amount of time and that breeds resentment,” Sowemimo said. “It appears to members of minority communities that the only reason they want to address it now is because a failure to take the vaccine impacts everyone.”        Related articleLatinos are navigating barriers to Covid-19 vaccinations and experts say it comes down to access             The speed of the vaccination’s development has also fueled misinformation about the coronavirus vaccine.                    “We need to counter misinformation with the facts as we know them in the various ways of communication at our disposal,” Dr. Tom Kenyon, chief health officer at the Project HOPE organization, told CNN. “Eventually, the facts will prevail and increased vaccination uptake will result.”      The British government has offered local councils in England more than £23 million ($31 million) to help fight misinformation around vaccines and encourage those from high-risk communities to take the shot.                 But many believe that vaccine hesitancy must be fought by empowering local and community voices.                  “I have people that I know who are suffering,” Lloyd-Jones told CNN. “The fact is, if we want things to move on in terms of how the vaccine is seen and received, the more people from Black and minority communities take the vaccine, the more it will spur others on to do it.”                  In more than 100 mosques across the UK, imams are delivering sermons aiming to reassure worshippers about the safety and legitimacy of Covid-19 vaccines, part of an initiative from the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (Minab).                  In his mosque in Leeds, northern England, imam and Minab chair Qari Asim told CNN he is working to spread the message because he doesn’t want to lose another community member to the virus.                  “We all have to play our part in this pandemic … I have attended so many funeral prayers and I see the trauma, pain [and] suffering that all of us have gone through. Now we see light in the darkest of moments and that light is the vaccine,” he said.                  Asim believes that the messenger is just as important as the message. He told CNN that due to a lack of trust in public institutions among the Muslim community, the information needs to come from trusted local experts, such as faith leaders or doctors.                  The imam says that misinformation is common and has found it is often younger generations that urge older relatives not to get a shot.                  “Among young people it’s a serious concern that they don’t trust the vaccine,” Asim explained. “With the elder generations, sometimes we feel there is a language or a culture barrier and the only source of information they have is their own family members.”                  The Minab initiative uses experts from varied scientific fields – from nanochip experts to fertility experts – from within the Muslim community. They address everything from common concerns, such as vaccine side-effects, to conspiracy theories around the shot.                  “In this pandemic, what has really come to the fore is love, compassion and being there for each other, so as an imam I feel I need to be there for my community to help them make the right choice,” Asim said.                  Vaccine hesitancy is not unique to minority communities in Britain.     A survey released on February 4 by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases found that more than half of Black adults in the United States remain hesitant to get a Covid-19 shot. The research found that only 49% of Black adults plan to get the vaccine with 19% of those people saying they will get it right away and 31% preferring to wait.                   The survey, which was conducted in December 2020, showed that older Black adults and men are more willing to get the Covid-19 vaccine than respondents in other groups.                  For example, 68% of adults age 60 and older said they planned to get the shot, while only 38% of Black adults age 18-44 planned to take it. Many of the younger respondents expressed distrust in the health care system saying it treats people unfairly based on race and ethnic background, according to the survey findings.                  On both sides of the Atlantic, experts say that authorities must work with community leaders to help build confidence in coronavirus vaccines.                 The Right Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, Britain’s first Black female bishop and an ambassador for the Your Neighbour campaign, a UK Church response to the pandemic, believes better representation is one of the best ways to encourage vaccine uptake in Black, Asian and other minority communities.                    “If they can begin showing Black people and Black people of note, Muslim people of note, taking the vaccine – as well as the ongoing message that we can keep one another safe – that would go a long way,” Hudson-Wilkin said.                      “There also has to be some recognition that in the past things have not been right and there has been a level of distrust,” she added.                      “But, as a people, if we are not showing any sense of care and responsibility for our own well-being, why should anyone else? We need to play our part, that is why it’s imperative we see people like us taking the vaccine.”       Salma Abdelaziz and Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Hathloul, 31, was arrested in a May 2018 sweep that targeted well-known opponents of the kingdom’s since-rescinded law barring women from driving. She told her family she had been tortured and sexually abused in prison – allegations Riyadh repeatedly denied – and her detention was condemned by the United Nations and global human rights groups.                  Last December, Riyadh’s Specialized Criminal Court – a terror tribunal – sentenced Hathloul to five years and eight months in prison, including a two-year and 10-month suspension, according to a statement released by her family. With the time she had already served, the sentencing paved the way for Hathloul’s release on Wednesday.                    Hathloul will remain on probation for three years following her release, during which time she could be arrested for any perceived illegal activity, the family said in a statement in December. She will also be banned from traveling for five years, they said.                  Hathloul’s release comes less than a week after the White House called on the kingdom to release political prisoners, including women’s rights activists. President Joe Biden has vowed to pressure Saudi Arabia into improving its rights record, marking a departure from former President Donald Trump’s reluctance to criticize the kingdom’s ramped up crackdown on dissent in recent years.                   “We’re excited (about her release), but the fight for justice is not over yet,” Hathloul’s brother, Walid al-Hathloul, told CNN before the announcement. “We would have to work very hard to secure justice for Loujain, but we’re very delighted for this news.”                 The family has urged people to refrain from saying that Hathloul has been “freed.”                 “Any release that does not include an independent investigation of the charges, does not include lifting the travel ban, does not include dropping the charges, is not freedom,” said Walid al-Hathloul. “Therefore we’re far away from justice.”      Loujain is at home !!!!!! تم الافراج عن لجين pic.twitter.com/fqug9VK6Mj             The terrorism court convicted Hathloul on charges of harming national security, seeking to change the Saudi political system, and using her relations with foreign governments and rights groups to “pressure the Kingdom to change its laws and systems,” according to a charge sheet her family published earlier in December.                 UN experts called the charges “spurious.” In a six-page charge sheet for Hathloul’s case, seen by CNN, a section entitled “crimes committed” includes activism against the kingdom’s restrictive male guardianship laws, along with contact with foreign journalists and diplomats.                  The charges also relied on a series of alleged confessions, according to the documents, which state that Hathloul admitted to applying for a job at the UN along with confessing to being in contact with the human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.                  For much of her imprisonment, Hathloul detailed her hardships to her parents during their prison visits. Those allegations were later made public by three of her siblings who live outside the kingdom, and were corroborated by the court testimony of other female activists.                   Hathloul said she was sexually assaulted and tortured while in detention, including waterboarding, flogging and electrocution, according to multiple statements released by her family and supporters.                  Saudi authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of torture and sexual abuse in their prisons.                 According to her family, Hathloul has twice gone on hunger strike – in protest at her prison conditions, and because she was denied communication with her relatives.       The @LoujainHathloul at home after 1001 days in prison pic.twitter.com/SIm274rAEw             A 2019 American Bar Association Center for Human Rights report said that although the Saudi terrorism court was created in 2008 to prosecute terrorism detainees, its “caseload was quickly expanded from alleged violent extremists to include political dissidents, religious minorities and human rights activists.” The report concluded that the court “routinely convicts individuals of terrorism charges without any meaningful evidence.”                  Earlier this week, a Saudi appeals court rejected Hathloul’s torture claims, the family said on Twitter.                  US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the release of Hathloul “would be a very welcome development.”                 Speaking at a State Department briefing, Price said the department had seen reports of her release from prison and noted that they “have watched this case very closely.” He declined to say whether Secretary of State Tony Blinken pressed the Saudis to release her during his call with the Saudi Foreign Minister last week.                 “In every relationship, whether it is one with our closest allies, our closest partners, and with our closest security partners, we will never check our values, we will never check our principles at the door,” he said.                 French President Emmanuel Macron added in a tweet: “I welcome the release of Loujain al-Hathloul and share the relief of her family.”                 During her detention, Hathloul received multiple awards, including the 2019 PEN America award. Two other women’s rights activists who were arrested alongside Hathloul – Nassima al-Sada and Maya’a al-Zahrani – remain in detention, according Amnesty International. Sada is also a PEN America award recipient.                 Hathloul’s siblings, who have been a driving force behind an international campaign for her release, posted a photo of their sister at home on Wednesday. “Oh mother, oh mother, this is the most beautiful day of my life.

Sign up for The Good Stuff, a newsletter for the good in life. It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.              The Harvard Law Review has elected Hassaan Shahawy, a Los Angeles born and bred Egyptian American, as the first Muslim president in its 134-year history.                 Jennifer Heath, the program administrator and information systems manager at the publication, confirmed that Shahawy is the first Muslim president.                  Founded in 1887 by future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, the Harvard Law Review is a student-edited law journal with the largest circulation of any law journal worldwide, according to Harvard University.                   A second-year law student at Harvard Law School, Shahawy first served as a general editor for the law review for six months before he decided to run for president this past January.       Related articleAmanda Gorman's journey to the inauguration and Super Bowl came with the help of a unique group of mentors             “It’s very humbling of course, to have a Muslim elected in a positive way,” Shahawy said. He noted that while he felt the change was symbolic that “doesn’t make a big difference to many people’s daily lives…[or] the bad policies or laws that make their lives challenging.                  “It can serve as a small start or indication of new direction that might be arising in American public discourse, and the increasing importance of diversity.”                 While Shahawy says he has the upmost respect for previous individuals who have held the position, such as former U.S. President Barack Obama, he says he is “almost equally impressed by the list of people who haven’t had this position.”                 He said his classmates who work with individuals in historically underserved communities to prevent evictions or to provide legal representation for incarcerated people are “more inspiring to [him] than the roster of past presidents.”                  Shahawy’s term began on January 30. When not serving as president, Shahawy says he tries to make sure he’s involved in the community, particularly in criminal justice reform.                 He currently works at the MacArthur Justice Center providinglegal representation to incarcerated individuals in criminal appeal cases. Shahawy’s passion for criminal justice reform stems from his experience as anundergraduate at Harvard, where he visited and worked with incarcerated individuals in local jails in Boston who were working to earn college credit.      Related articleMeet the man who created Black History Month             After graduating Harvardin 2016, Shahaway was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and majored in Oriental Studies and specialized in Islamic Law at Oxford University. He said his interest in law stems not only from his activism experience, but also from his passion for legal history.                  Shahawy says his background “informs [his] perspective on approaching debates with a big picture approach and looking at things broadly and how other nations around the world today and throughout history have answered questions.”                  He wants to bring that experience to his role as president and hopes people can “learn from each others’ diverse perspectives to have members and editors from different backgrounds (who can) represent their communities,” and to “maintain and enhance (our) vibrant community.”                   In the future, Shahawy says, “I can see myself being a law professor, one foot in academia and one foot in practice.”                   Shahawy’s election follows another historic election in 2017, when ImeIme Umana was named the law journal’s first Black woman president.

Insults were exchanged in the heat of the moment, he admits, but Farouq, a teenager, thought nothing of the exchange until he was summoned to the police station and charged with blasphemy against God.                 When word got out about the nature of his arrest, an angry mob descended on Farouq’s family home forcing his mother to flee to a neighboring village, his lawyer said.                 Farouq, who was then 16, was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labor by a Sharia court, in Kano, northern Nigeria.      Related articleThe WhatsApp voice note that led to a death sentence             However, his conviction was overturned on appeal by the Kano State High Court on January 22 because Farouq did not have legal representation at his first trial, his counsel Kola Alapinni told CNN.                  “I’m delighted, I’m in a joyous mood. And I’m grateful to all those who helped and lent support for this outcome with the grace of Allah,” Farouq, now 17, told CNN in his first interview following his release.                  Alapinni was instrumental in Farouq’s release from prison.                  His Foundation for Religious Freedom discovered and got involved in Farouq’s case while working on an appeal for Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, who was sentenced to death for blasphemy at the Kano Upper Sharia Court.             “We found out they were convicted on the same day, by the same judge, in the same court, for blasphemy and we found out no one was talking about Omar, so we had to move quickly to file an appeal for him,” he said.                 “Blasphemy is not recognized by Nigerian law. It is inconsistent with the constitution of Nigeria.”                 Kano’s High Court stated that Farouq’s conviction as a minor “was done in error and … is hereby set aside and the Defendant is hereby discharged and acquitted.”                  Farouq says he feels aggrieved as that the Sharia court was “unjust” to him.                  Officials for the Sharia court have not commented on Farouq’s case, and efforts to reach them have been unsuccessful. CNN also contacted Kano state government for comment but has yet to receive a response.                 In all, Farouq spent more than five months locked up without access to family or lawyers.                  His family said they were not informed about the details of his case and did not even know what date his court hearing was held.                 “They were not fair to us,” his uncle Umar Aliyu told CNN. “When they took this boy to court, they didn’t tell us the court they took him to… and they refused to tell us the date slated for the judgment. They kept chasing us away. I went to the Hisbah office pleading with the interrogator, but he told me to leave his office. I left hurt and close to tears, extremely sad.”      Related articleThe WhatsApp voice note that led to a death sentence             The family also found out from media reports that Farouq had been convicted and sentenced, Aliyu said.                  Aliyu recalls being “enveloped with sadness,” every time he thought about his nephew locked up with no contact with his family.                  “Everyone… was disturbed very much, we were really sad. We just had to console each other, counseling some to take it as something ordained by Allah… telling them to be patient. This provided some emotional relief.                 “For the period he was in prison every time I thought about him, I became worried. Every time I thought about him sadness would envelop me.”                 Now that Farouq has been freed, he says he is determined to finish his education and has ambitions to enter politics to fight against the kind of injustice he faced.                  “I pray Allah will bless me to become governor or President to reform the Sharia and to end the injustice on my fellow citizens and myself since in some court cases the offense doesn’t warrant the harsh judgment handed down. This is deprivation of your right, oppression, and abuse,” he said.                 Although his conviction was overturned, Farouq’s life remains in danger from some fanatics who see his release as an affront, according to his lawyer.                  Alapinni told CNN how terrified Farouq was when he turned up to meet him outside the prison when he was released.                 “He himself knows he is in danger because when we tried to pick him from prison…you could see the fear in his face, he didn’t even want to follow us…everybody had told him that if he steps out of the prison walls he will be killed,” Alapinni said.                 “We now need to arrange safe passage for him. His life is in danger in Kano – it will never be the same,” he said.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.              Extremism has a knack for metastasizing and coming back to wreak havoc upon its hosts. Once a cohort or society builds a hateful mindset, the hatred takes on a life of its own. Extremist ideology not only hurts a society’s enemies, but also eventually attacks from within and harms the society from which it originated. I first started observing this phenomenon abroad – and it saddens but does not surprise me that we are starting to see it haunt American democracy too.                 Consider how the kingdom of Saudi Arabia disseminated the Wahhabi sect’s fundamentalist attitudes against Jews and Christians at home and abroad. It helped to fund the madrassas that fostered the extreme perspectives that eventually contributed to the September 11th terror attacks on New York and Washington. Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden did not just seek to destroy Americans – he wanted to destroy all things Western. The great irony is that his unbridled hatred had also prompted him to attack the Saudi kingdom, too. Bin Laden’s extremist hunger was such that even the Saudi Wahhabis who helped inculcate his all-consuming intolerance could no longer prove pious enough in his eyes. His efforts to overthrow the Saudi monarchy launched an opposition movement that got him expelled from the country.                 In Israel too, the government has taken limited action to shut down the behavior of the so-called “hilltop youth,” extremist settlers who deem themselves highly religious despite not respecting the rabbis of the settlement. The lack of concerted effort to prevent and stop the group’s rock throwing and vandalism of Palestinian villages gave these fired-up youth permission to spiral out of control, eventually leading them to attack the Israeli army, too.                  Or take the Beitar Jerusalem Israeli football club, notorious for its long history of not putting Arab players on the field. The club’s most fanatical supporters finally became so extreme in their intolerance that Beitar Jerusalem’s 2013 signing of two Russian League players who happened to be Muslim led to protests and anti-Arab chants against the very club that fueled the fans’ racist fire. Arsonists set fire to the club’s offices two days after the signing. More recently,  some of the fans targeted a Christian player from Niger simply because his name, Ali Mohamed, sounded Muslim.     Related articleThe Capitol attack was White supremacy, plain and simple             I recall a time in Germany, riding in a car with a German woman who was an authentic supporter of the OneVoice Movement I founded to foster Arab-Israeli understanding. She made a point of vehemently – and sincerely – condemning racism against Jews, but minutes later cursed out another driver and justified her tirade by casting slurs on Polish immigrants. She had superficially learned that the Holocaust was bad but had not internalized the dangers of bigotry against any group. If Polish people were not immune to her racism, to what other target would her hatred attach next?                  While Germany has done a better job than many other nations to take concerted actions (like making Holocaust denial illegal) to discourage anti-Semitism, it is also experiencing a surge in neo-Nazism, particularly against Turkish immigrants. All nations are challenged to address the intolerant mindset at the root of racism; otherwise that intolerance eventually resurfaces and comes back to haunt us.                 Here in the United States, there are Republican legislators and anchors on Fox News who have willingly participated in race-baiting and birtherism for years, even before President Trump hijacked the Republican Party. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has looked the other way for close to five years as Trump incites violence and sows mistrust in our system. And Wednesday morning, rather than lead with truth, Senator Ted Cruz gave contorted explanations for why he – along with several other Republican senators and 121 House Representatives – would indulge Trump’s fabricated and fraudulent fantasies by objecting to certify the election results. Then came the insurrection. Mobs of Trump supporters, hopped up on Trump’s conspiracy theory of a stolen election and encouraged to go to the Capitol by the President himself, stormed and vandalized our nation’s Capitol building.      Related articleHow Americans can hold Trump accountable if Congress won't             It was the disturbing culmination of a months-long series of attempts by Trump to bully state officials into “finding” votes that would help him win the 2020 presidential election, as almost all Republican “leaders” stood by with stunning silence – though elections officials in Georgia, headed by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, stood up for truth against pressure from Trump. To his credit, earlier on Wednesday, Mitch McConnell had sought to affirm that “the voters, the courts, and the States have all spoken” and that it was time for Trump to concede. But it was too little too late. McConnell himself  stood by while the seeds of extremism were planted, leading to – in his words – “the unhinged crowd,” or, in other words, the domestic terrorists who came for him and his fellow legislators.                 When thinking turns extreme, there is little room for nuance or aberration from the narrow mindset deemed acceptable. People become programmed to hear what they want to hear and tortured by cognitive dissonance when their own dogma does not stand to reason. When groups become so extreme in their thinking that they fail to realize the merits of an opinion from outside their “tribe” or when partisan fealty fuses into one’s identity, one’s values ultimately suffer.                  Trump and a small subgroup of his most radicalized and violent supporters, who include White supremacists and Neo-Nazis, are responsible for this dark chapter. Nothing can justify their sedition. But beyond this specific situation, it would be simplistic to believe that extreme ways of thinking reside exclusively within the right. All extremes are bound together by their intolerance for “the other.” The far-left’s tendency to call others out and automatically cast judgment harms all of society by stifling the critical thinking, nuanced debate, and exchange of differing ideas that lead to progress – the very progress for which progressives advocate. If  people feel “cancelled” or too intimidated to speak up, their repressed feelings are more likely to fester under the surface and emerge later in a more extreme form. The gap between both sides grows, leaving a vacuum of misunderstanding and division.

For society at large, independent thinking and even avoiding partisan fanaticism can be antidotes to unruly tribalism in the future. Embracing the middle space characterized by critical thinking and nuance gives us a pathway for avoiding absolutist and hateful thinking that preys on societies from both the outside and within.

But at the conclusion of an internal review that took more than two months, the Times said the episodes about Chaudhry fell apart under scrutiny.                 The Times said it “found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the ‘Caliphate’ podcast,” according to an editor’s note that was appended on Friday to the podcast’s page on the Times’ website.                  The Times kicked off its investigation after Canadian police charged Chaudhry in September with “Hoax-Terrorist activity” in relation to interviews published by “multiple media outlets,” according to a police news release.                 Despite the misrepresentations and lack of corroboration, The Times is not removing “Caliphate” from its website or podcast apps. In addition to the editors’ note posted online, The Times is affixing audio corrections to the episodes and releasing an episode about the corrections. The paper also published a fuller account on Friday on what it learned about Chaudhry. The four-byline story described him as “a fabulist who spun jihadist tales about killing for the Islamic State in Syria, Canadian and American intelligence and law enforcement officials contend.”                  The editors’ note said the Times “discovered significant falsehoods and other discrepancies” in Chaudhry’s story during the course of reporting and took steps to confirm his account. The Times decided to “proceed with the project” but to include an episode dedicated to the fact checking process and highlighting what they called “major discrepancies.”                 The Times’ media critic Ben Smith reported in October that there had been concerns about the podcast before its publication.                  “Caliphate” won the 2018 Peabody in the radio/podcast category, a prestigious journalism award. It also was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. These were marks of success for The Times’ growing investment in audio, led by the team behind its daily news podcast, “The Daily.”             Rukmini Callimachi, a Times correspondent who hosted the podcast, will remain at the paper and but will be reassigned.                 “She’s going to take on a new beat, and she and I are discussing possibilities,” said Dean Baquet, executive editor of The Times. “I think it’s hard to continue covering terrorism after what happened with this story.

Writing for an 8-0 court, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed in 1993 to prohibit the federal government from imposing substantial burdens on religious exercise without a compelling interest, allows the suits against the individual agents.                 “The question here,” Thomas wrote, “is whether that includes claims for money damages against Government officials in their individual capacities. We hold that it does.”     Related articleSamuel Alito's viral speech signals where conservative Supreme Court is headed             The unusual case featured strange bedfellows, pitting the Trump administration against supporters of religious liberty.                 Unlike other recent cases before the high court, the Trump administration weighed in against claims of religious freedom arguing that the law at issue was never meant to allow government officials to be sued for damages in their individual capacity. But supporters of the men, including the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, sought to broaden the reach of the law. The case comes as the federal government has cracked down on mass protests, the President has emphasized the importance of law and order, and some critics say there is a need for greater accountability from law enforcement.                 The dispute arose in 2013, when Muhammad Tanzir, Jameel Algibhah and Naveed Shinwari said they were asked by the FBI to become informants for the government in terrorism-related investigations. The men claim they declined – citing their religious beliefs – and their reluctance to spy on their community. They allege that they were retaliated against and put on the watchlist for people who are prohibited from boarding aircraft that originate from, terminate in, or pass over the United States. Even after they were removed from the list, their lawyers sought to sue the individual agents for damages citing the federal law.                 “An individual whose religious exercise has been substantially burdened by a federal official,” lawyer Ramzi Kassem of the City University of New York School of Law argued, “may sue that person in their individual capacity for damages.”                 A lower court ruled in their favor allowing the law suit to move forward. The Justice Department appealed the case to the Supreme Court.                 The  Justice Department told the justices that a decision allowing damage awards against the federal employees could chill their ability to do their job and “raise sensitive separation of powers concerns”  potentially preventing government officials from “devoting the time and effort required for the proper discharge of duties.”                 “Even well-intentioned federal employees would thus be forced to navigate a minefield of liability that would be difficult to predict or avoid,” Deputy Solicitor General Edwin S. Kneedler, said in court papers.                 “We are thrilled that the Supreme Court justices were unanimous in their agreement that our clients can seek repair for the harms that they experienced at the hands of these agents for refusing to spy on their Muslim communities,” said Diala Shamas, an attorney for the three men. “I hope that this serves as a reminder that religious protections apply equally to Muslim communities, who are all too often targeted by law enforcement for surveillance and harassment.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

But will tourists want to visit?,Five years of social reform driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have drastically loosened the conservative grip on Saudi society. CNN’s Nic Robertson says it could yet prove to be a magnet for tourism.,"Dec 5, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Nic Robertson,International,"I’ve been visiting Saudi Arabia for close to two decades and in that time I’ve experienced some incredible things.                  I’ve climbed the scarily steep and staggeringly beautiful mountains of the south. I’ve scuba dived the immaculate Red Sea coral reefs off Saudi’s western coast. I’ve driven rally cars over the dunes in the north. I’ve visited ancient wells. Spent freezing winter nights in the desert cooking food with red hot fire embers buried in the sand. And I’ve walked barefoot along the kingdom’s eastern shores on sweltering summer evenings.                 I’ve flown in flimsy microlights, soaring serenely above rich farmland. I’ve ridden tactical combat helicopters missions, skimming the desert floor and banking hard around sand dunes.                 Yet none of these has affected me as much as the moment I felt Saudi change.     New subterranean resort to be built below the Al-Ula desert in Saudi Arabia             It’s no exaggeration to say that the recent social upheaval in the country has been profound and fast.                 In 2018, I was in downtown Riyadh, chatting to people at a near-empty outdoor cafe in the early evening.                  The religious police, once widely feared and respected, arrived by car, stopped at the roadside and started telling people to go to prayers.                  Previously, this would’ve prompted an immediate reaction, with people obeying their commands.                  This time, no one moved.                 It was in that moment I connected with what Saudis had been feeling in the months since Mohammed bin Salman or MBS, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, stripped these morality guardians of their power.                 It was a sense of lightness, a freedom to make choices.                 That was two years ago. These days the religious police have mostly been consigned to desk duties. Decades of oppressive psychological pressure to conform to the conservative strictures of Islam have fallen away.                 And today, freedom is blossoming, albeit still controlled by the invisible lines of most Gulf states: enjoy, have fun but don’t get ahead of the leadership.                  Outdoor cafes along new festive looking pavements are abuzz with men and women out for fun, to meet, to shop, to chat, to relax.                 Mounira Al-Qwait, a 20-year-old fashion designer wearing a traditional black abaya she styled herself, told me what this means for her.                  “We have more fun now.. going outside for movies, going outside for the restaurants and meeting with friends,” she says, her eyes sparkling above a face-covering niqab.                  Nearby, fashionably dressed without a headscarf (an omission enough to get her pulled off the street a few years ago), is Tutu, a 42-year-old kindergarten teacher. She told me she loved the sense of “freedom” and “more energy.”                 “Now our lives as Saudis completely changed,” she says. “Actually from all the decisions taken by Mohammed bin Salman. All Saudis now is happy about all these changes.”                 I was in town this time covering the global economic powers’ G20 summit. Saudis were the hosts of the November 21-22 meeting – a massive responsibility and challenge.                 After it wrapped, I watched Finance Minister Mohammed al Jadaan lavish praise on his youthful team. The “wealth of the nation,” he concluded later.                 His offices in the new Digital City district of Riyadh – a futuristic complex of buildings interwoven with cascading water fountains and open, airy pedestrian spaces – feels more like Dubai than the dusty Riyadh of old.                 Here change is abundant. Women work in offices side by side with men, something that was illegal until a few years ago.                 Talia, 27, is one of them.                  Raised in Riyadh by her single mom, she graduated from universities in both London and Beirut before returning in 2017 when the reforms began. “It was like weekly, almost daily, like there’s new announcements on the news coming and it was so exciting,” she told me.                 Since then she’s worked with female CEOs and sees no limit to what women can achieve.                 “We have a youthful crown prince and the country is youthful – like 70% of the population is under 30 – so I felt like the reforms were being made by us for us, so there’s no way that we’re going to go back.”                 One of the chief reasons for the social upheaval in Saudi Arabia is MBS’s decision to challenge the clerics who’d given rise to the generations of orthodoxy, producing Osama Bin Laden, al Qaeda, and almost all of the September 11, 2001 attack hijackers.                 MBS’s father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud is the latest in a long, ossifying line of leadership that passed from the nation’s founder King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman al Saud to his increasingly aged sons.                 It took Abdulaziz 30 years to conquer the country’s four geographically distinct regions – Asir in the south, Al-Ahsa in the east, Hejaz in the west, and Najd in the center – and establish the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on September 23, 1932.                 It’s taken MBS fewer than five years to shake up the kingdom in a way his predecessors dared not, along the way arresting and detaining more 200 princes and businessmen he accused of corruption.                 His vision of changing Saudi Arabia by 2030 demands a diversified economy and empowerment of the young.                 Ministers describe him as a tough taskmaster who will listen but won’t tolerate dissent once a decision is taken, or any failure to deliver on reforms he wants.                 At Masmak Fort in Riyadh’s old quarter where in 1902 Abdulaziz began his campaign to build a kingdom under his control, a metal spear tip protruding from the ancient wooden gates is testament to the forcefulness of his historic actions.                 MBS’s vision is no less robust. Human rights activists have been jailed, dissenters including journalist Jamal Khashoggi brutally murdered, yet MBS has such support for what he has done that so far the young seem OK with it.                 “It’s an important [topic] that has been discussed all over the world,” Mohammed al-Ajwi, a 26-year-old accountant told me, referring to the killing of Khashoggi, which was eventually blamed by Saudi authorities on rogue operators within MBS’s inner circle. The crown prince has denied personal involvement in the killing, while US and other foreign intelligence agencies have assessed that he ordered it.                   But al-Ajwi adds: “The government already said what they have and it was a clear answer for us the people of Saudi Arabia. So it was a mistake by a few people. That’s it for us.”                 From Masmak Fort, a busy six-lane highway now runs to Digital City and a financial district where new eye-catching buildings are appearing all the time. When I first came to the kingdom in 2003, Riyadh had only two towers. Now there are dozens.      Can Saudi Arabia rebrand itself as a tourism hotspot?             Yet leave the city and, in the harsh deserts of the Nejd region that surrounds it, you can still find the Saudi Arabia of the past.                  White royal camels are tended on old farms. Beautiful lush grassed oases add intense doses of color. On rocky outcrops, ancient natural water cisterns vital for generations of herders are still in use.                 I’ve been lucky to see all of this thanks to my job, but it’s about to get easier for everyone.                  Last year, as part of his vision to diversify Saudi Arabia’s oil-dependent economy by 2030, MBS announced opening the kingdom’s doors to tourism.                 Unexpectedly, it had a remarkable boom this year.                 When the kingdom shuttered its borders because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Saudis went on vacation in their backyard. The country’s regions are so diverse, and the country so big, that it’s possible even for locals to feel they’re taking a break a long way from home.                  Away from Nejd, there’s coastal Hejaz, home to Islam’s holiest sites of Mecca and Medina, which were already cosmopolitan and relaxed due to the influx of centuries of pilgrims.                  Here, windows on upper floors of old homes jut into the street allowing cooling sea breezes to waft through rooms and inner courtyards, circulating over cool, refreshing pools.                 To sit inside one of these modest houses is a treat I’ll never forget, a chance to relax away from cares and troubles outside.                 To the south, Asir’s mountain peaks get snow in the winter, giving them an Alpine feel. In the summer they still offer a little respite from scorching deserts.                  In the east where pan-flat desert meets the Persian Gulf, date orchards proliferate above an even more valuable commodity, the kingdom’s oil.                 But the best treat to lure tourists is one I’ve yet to see – Hegra.                 The site, sometimes known as Mada’in Salih, or Al-Ḥijr  in the western Hejaz region was settled in the first century CE by Nabateans who carved great buildings into the rocks and left rock writings. It’s a site to rival Petra in neighboring Jordan, which was also built by Nabateans.                   While Petra draws thousands upon thousands of tourists a year, Hegra is still uncrowded.                  That could all soon change though.                  And if MBS’s promises hold longer than a shimmering desert mirage, as the kingdom’s young population fervently believe, the world will find much worth discovering.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The 21-year-old student was arrested on Wednesday in Uttar Pradesh, only days after the state enacted the law targeting “love jihad” – a term used by radical Hindu groups who accuse Muslim men of attempting to convert women of other faiths to Islam.                 Uttar Pradesh enacted the anti-conversion law, which makes “forced” or “fraudulent” religious conversions a non-bailable offense with a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison, on Saturday.                 According to the law, a marriage will be declared “null and void” if the conversion of the woman is solely for that purpose. Those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to top district authorities.      Related article'Love jihad': Indian states want to pass laws to prevent interfaith marriages. The move is unconstitutional and misogynistic             The same day the law came into effect, a man named Tikaram Rathone filed a report to police, alleging the male student was trying to coerce his 20-year-old Hindu daughter, who is married, to convert to Islam and marry him.                  Rathore alleged the man had developed a friendship with his daughter at school, and wanted to “coerce, coax and allure” her into converting.                  “Despite constant disapproval from me and my family, he (the accused) is putting pressure on us through abuse and death threats,” Rathore said in his complaint.                  Police in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district confirmed via Facebook that the man was arrested on Wednesday.                 Critics have called the law Islamophobic, unconstitutional, and regressive. Many are concerned it will lead to misuse and harassment, and that the law will make it increasingly difficult for interfaith couples to marry in the country.                 Other states – including Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, and Assam – have announced plans to follow Uttar Pradesh and introduce similar laws.                  All five states are governed by the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has faced accusations of perpetuating anti-Muslim sentiment.     Related articleNetflix faces boycott calls in India over 'A Suitable Boy' kissing scene             The BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has come under fire for similar laws before. Last year, the BJP-ruled state of Himachal Pradesh amended its anti-conversion law, prohibiting conversion by misrepresentation, force, fraud, undue influence, coercion, allurement or marriage. It also introduced non-bailable jail sentences for the offense.                 Critics of the BJP say religious polarization has increased since Modi swept into power in 2014. Hindu-Muslim marriages have long attracted controversy in India – but tensions have ratcheted up lately, with the concept of “love jihad” dominating headlines in recent months.                 In October, the popular jewelry brand Tanishq ran an advertisement featuring an interfaith couple – a Hindu woman and a Muslim man. After right-wing Indians accused them of promoting “love jihad” and trolled them heavily online, the company pulled the ad, saying it feared for the “well being” of its employees.                 In November, authorities accused Netflix of doing the same, after its TV series “A Suitable Boy” featured a scene in which a Hindu woman and a Muslim man share a kiss in front of a Hindu temple. Narottam Mishra, BJP member and home minister of Madhya Pradesh state, said the scene hurt “religious sentiments” and directed officials to look into legal action against the series’ producer and director.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.             Daily, being a woman in India feels like an achievement. If friends and relatives don’t concern themselves with who my significant other is, it seems the state does.                 Currently, marriage laws between India’s majority Hindu population and minority Muslims are being drafted in five states, all of which are led by the right-wing, Hindu nationalist, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).                 All of them seek to ban something that doesn’t actually exist: “love jihad,” an Islamophobic term referring to a purported phenomenon in which Muslim men marry women of other faiths — especially Hindu women — to convert them to Islam. Some right-wing Hindus claim that this alleged “conversion” results in a threat to women’s safety, citing tragedies like the reported murder of a Hindu woman last month by a young Muslim man as proof of “love jihad.” (In addition to murder, authorities have charged the young man with attempting to abduct the young woman to seek to compel her to marry him, The Indian Express reported; they noted he abducted her once before, in 2018.)     Related articleNetflix faces boycott calls in India over 'A Suitable Boy' kissing scene             In Uttar Pradesh, authorities have just brought charges under one of these laws for the first time, accusing a male college student of threatening to kidnap a young woman and of trying to force her to convert to Islam, The Times of India reports. Despite this case, as the push for these new laws unfolded, the Hindu-nationalist BJP had admitted in Parliament that no case of “love jihad” had ever been identified.                 As troubling as it is that an ethnonationalist conspiracy theory seems to have taken hold, the motivation behind it also ignores women as individuals, painting them as naive and incapable of thinking for themselves or making their own decisions.                 Since its independence, India has seen religious animosity between its Hindu and Muslim communities. Starting with its partition from Pakistan, an Islamic republic, however, India has maintained, constitutionally, that it is a secular democracy. The topic of “love jihad” was revived in the national conversation on Oct. 9 after Tanishq, a jewelry company, was accused of “glorifying” Hindu-Muslim marriages, and subsequently “love jihad,” in an ad. The ad was heavily trolled on social media, with right-wing Hindu fundamentalists promising to “boycott” the company. Eventually, the company pulled the ad, saying it feared for the “well being” of its employees.                 Since then, BJP state leaders have chimed in, proposing laws that would ban the practice of “love jihad,” mandating government permission for recent religious converts to marry.                 The government will “work to curb ‘love-jihad,’” said Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, on Oct. 31, adding, “We’ll make a law.” BJP politicians in the states of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam followed suit, pushing similar proposals.     On Nov. 24, the Uttar Pradesh government cleared an ordinance to check “unlawful conversions,” saying that, in “cases of forced mass conversions,” it would enforce a jail term of three to 10 years with a penalty of up to Rs. 50,000 ($675) for mass conversions, The Hindu reported; where women converted just for the purpose of marriage, marriages would be invalidated. “If a person wants to perform marriage after converting into any other religion, they will need to take permission from the district magistrate two months before marriage,” said state Cabinet Minister Siddharth Nath Singh.                 I cannot help but see a double standard at play here, given the real issues that surround marriage in India. Arranged marriages, which still dominate, work to ensure that inter-caste unions are prevented. Child marriage is illegal in India, with the marriageable age being 18, but the country has the highest total number of child brides globally, according to the civil-society partnership Girls Not Brides. Nearly 27% of women ages 20 to 24 reported having been married before their 18th birthday, according to a 2015-16 survey by the Indian government.     Related articleIndian jewelry brand pulls commercial featuring interfaith couple following backlash             And yet, “love jihad” laws are being pushed by a government seen by some as striving toward a “Hindu rashtra,” or Hindu nation-state.                 The right to marry is a part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, as affirmed by India’s Supreme Court in 2018. The right to marriage is also stated under the United Nations’ Universal Declaration on Human Rights, of which India is a signatory and which calls for a “free and full choice” in decisions on when and whom to marry.                 It’s 2020, and rather than shedding our oppressive, archaic ideas about marriages based on caste, or progressing toward giving everyone — including the LGBTQIA+ community — the right to marry, we’re degenerating as a nation. This is a country in which victim blaming is prevalent in cases of sexual violence and assault, and in which one minister now keen to pass laws on “love jihad” alleged that conspirators were fomenting the riots that unfolded after the rape and murder in September of a 19-year-old Dalit woman.     In February this year, the BJP’s own junior home minister, G. Kishan Reddy, said in Parliament: “The term ‘love jihad’ is not defined under law. Article 25 of the Constitution provides for freedom to freely profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health.” And while Indians, and Indian women, can find comfort in court rulings like the recent Allahabad High Court’s quashing of a formal complaint that accused a Muslim man of abducting and forcibly marrying a Hindu woman after converting her to Islam (the ruling categorically stated that “two adults are free to choose their partner”), this law, like others, first and foremost serves those on a quest to build a Hindu nation-state. It ignores India’s constitution.                  Violent crimes against women are concerning. Yet, when we talk about “love jihad” laws, we’re not talking about women’s safety — rather, we’re talking about taking away a woman’s right to choose her spouse. We’re talking about communalizing a marriage, distilling it into the faiths of the respective parties, rather than looking at two adults as individuals.      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

The court instead referred the case to the Specialized Criminal Court for terrorism and national security cases, according to a statement from her family and supporters, sent to CNN.                 The case of another women’s rights activist, Samar Badawi, has also been referred to the special court. Three others – Nassima al-Sada, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahrani – remain in detention, according to human rights group Amnesty International.              “We remain deeply concerned by the continued detention of at least five women’s right activists in Saudi Arabia. We regret that the cases of Loujain Al-Hathloul and Samar Badawi have now been referred to the Special Criminal Court for terrorism and national security cases,” human rights ambassadors for the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Estonia, Luxembourg and Finland said in a statement.                 Hathloul, 31, was jailed in May 2018 during a sweep that targeted prominent opponents of the kingdom’s former law barring women from driving. The crackdown happened just weeks before the ban was lifted, casting doubt on a reform agenda put forward by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.                 The court she appeared in on Wednesday said it would investigate Hathloul’s allegations of torture in prison, according to the family’s statement. Saudi authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of torture and sexual abuse in their prisons. A new trial date hasn’t been announced yet.        Badawi had also campaigned against the driving ban and against the imprisonment of her former husband, rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair, as well as her brother, blogger Raif Badawi.                  “Peaceful activism, and advocating for women’s rights is not a crime. Human rights defenders can be a strong partner for governments in addressing concerns within society,” the ambassadors said.                 “We join the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Special Rapporteurs and Treaty Bodies in reiterating our call for the release of all political detainees, including the women’s rights activists.”                 CNN has reached out to the Saudi government for a response.      Related videoCNN reporter: Trump seemed like an outsider at G20 summit             In an interview with CNN’s Nic Robertson earlier this month, Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Jubeir said Hathloul’s case “was up to the courts” and that “she’s on trial for matters related to national security.”                 An Amnesty International representative for the Middle East, Lynn Maalouf, said the Specialized Criminal Court was “an institution used to silence dissent and notorious for issuing lengthy prison sentences following seriously flawed trials.”                 “This is yet another sign that Saudi Arabia’s claims of reform on human rights are a farce,” Maalouf said.              In a six-page charge sheet for Hathloul’s case, seen by CNN, a section entitled “crimes committed” included activism against the kingdom’s restrictive male guardianship laws, along with contact with foreign journalists and diplomats.                 Chairman of US House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff called on Saturday for Hathloul’s immediate release, saying on Twitter she had “endured torture and abuse for over 2 years while detained.”                  On Thursday, the US Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs said it was “concerned” by reports that the cases of Hathloul and Badawi had been transferred to the terrorism court.                  “Activism on behalf of (women’s) rights is not a crime. Also troubled by allegations of abuse against them & a lack of transparency/access to the trials,” the bureau’s press office wrote on Twitter.                  The statement from Hathloul’s family and supporters said she had started a second hunger strike on October 26 in protest of her prison conditions and because she was denied communication with her relatives.                 The statement said she was forced to halt her strike after two weeks as authorities woke her up multiple times during the night, causing her to feel exhausted.                 The statement said she looked “weak in court, that her body was shaking uncontrollably and that her voice was faint and shaky.”                  Her sister, Lina al-Hathloul, said that she and her family had received no updates on Hathloul since she began her hunger strike until Tuesday, the day before she was due to appear in court.                 “And during this time the Saudi government, instead of responding to our repeated inquiries on Loujain’s health, they have blocked our requests and denied us access to Loujain,” she said in the statement.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Aden, the first model to wear a hijab and burkini in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, posted a series of Instagram Stories describing the difficulties she has faced in the “toxic mess called fashion.” In the posts, she recounted skipping prayers, wearing clothes she wasn’t comfortable in and styling her hijab in ways she felt betrayed her values.     Halima Aden becomes first model to wear hijab and burkini in Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue             “They could call me tomorrow and not even for $10 million would I ever risk compromising my hijab ever again,” she wrote. Aden also pledged to never take part in runway shows or travel for fashion months again, adding that “that’s where all the bad energy came from.”                 Aden, who lived in a Kenyan refugee camp before moving to the United States, has broken numerous boundaries in her modeling career. She was the first hijab-wearing woman to appear on the cover of British Vogue and was part of Vogue Arabia’s first group hijabi cover.                 But her work, and the excitement of being labeled a trailblazer, caused her to lose sight of her beliefs, she said. Aden’s mother had long encouraged her to walk away – but it wasn’t until the Covid-19 pandemic, which prompted the model to stay home and take a break from the industry, that she “finally realized where I went wrong,” she wrote.                 Among the campaigns she expressed regret over was a photo shoot for American Eagle’s first-ever denim hijab. “Why did I allow them to put jeans on my head when at the time I had only ever worn skirts and long dresses?” she wrote, explaining that “I was just so desperate back then for any ‘representation’ that I lost touch with who I was.”     Halima Aden: Vogue hijabi cover star on growing up in a refugee camp             Aden also posted an image from a photo shoot for Glamour magazine in 2017 showing her with a green wrap under her hijab and feathers around her neck. “I went back to my hotel room and just sobbed after this shoot because deep down I knew this wasn’t it. But was too scared to speak up,” she wrote. “Also very common struggle when you are the FIRST to do something.”                 American Eagle and Glamour did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.                 She also pointed to numerous other photo shoots where, though her head was covered, the scarf didn’t cover her chest or was styled in a way that hid it from view. These photo shoots were “essentially erasing my hijab completely,” she said.                 Despite her regrets, Aden pointed to a number of photo shoots that she felt were carried out respectfully, like the Vogue Arabia cover shot alongside two other black hijab-wearing models, Ikram Abdi Omar and Amina Adan.                 And she isn’t walking away from fashion entirely, she said, but rather laying out conditions for those hoping to hire her.     Why mainstream brands are embracing modest fashion             “If my hijab can’t be this visible – I’m not showing up,” she wrote under a photo of her in a full unadorned hijab that covered her chest and shoulders. Under another photo, showing her full hijab, scarf and covered chest and shoulders, she wrote, “This is the standard moving forward if you want to work with me. Come correct or don’t come at all. Nothing less, nothing more.”                 “These spaces were always predominantly white,” she added. “So you are already at a disadvantage for simply being YOU in a workplace that never considered someone of your background. We can’t give up, but it’s good to remain mindful.”                 Her announcement was met with support and praise from celebrities including Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. “Proud of you for staying true to your integrity,” supermodel Naomi Campbell wrote under Aden’s most recent Instagram post. “You are true light and joy since knowing you. And I hope our paths will cross in another capacity, keep rising and shining.”                 Aden, who is Somali-American, was born and raised in Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp, before moving with her family to the US in 2004 at the age of 7. After a decade-long vetting process, her family resettled in St. Louis, Missouri.     Contestant Halima Aden wears hijab, burkini to inspire others             Until her family made its way to St. Cloud, Minnesota, Aden said she had difficulty adjusting to her new life in the US and longed for her home in Kakuma. However, her life changed in 2016 when she became the first contestant to wear a hijab and a burkini at the Miss Minnesota USA pageant. Aden went on to reach the semi-finals of the competition.                 “There are so many Muslim women that feel like they don’t fit society’s standard of beauty,” she told CNN in 2018. “I just wanted to tell them it’s OK to be different, being different is beautiful, too.”     Halima Aden did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/25/asia/china-foreign-religion-christianity-islam-intl-hnk/index.html,China mulls new rules on foreigners to ‘prohibit religious extremism’,Foreign religious groups and worshipers could be the latest targets of a growing crackdown on organized religion in China under President Xi Jinping.,"Nov 26, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,James Griffiths,International,"Foreign religious groups and worshipers could be the latest targets of a growing crackdown on organized religion in China under President Xi Jinping.                  Draft rules published this week by the Ministry of Justice call for new restrictions on how foreign worshipers operate in order to prevent the spreading of “religious extremism,” or use of religion “to undermine China’s national or ethnic unity.”                  The rules, currently open to public feedback but unlikely to change significantly from their current form, are just the latest move to control religious practice under Xi, who has repeatedly called for the “sinicization” of religion.                 Xi has overseen a major clampdown on Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the western region of Xinjiang, where some 2 million Uyghurs and other minorities have passed through “reeducation camps” according to rights groups, as well as campaigns targeting Christian groups and Tibetan Buddhists.                  Religion has always occupied a peculiar position in the People’s Republic of China. Officially an atheist state, the Communist government nonetheless licenses five official faiths, and effectively decides on matters such as the ordination of bishops and reincarnation.                  Those faiths – Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism – are supervised by official organizations such as the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement or the Buddhist Association of China, which are in turn overseen by the ruling Communist Party’s powerful United Front Work Department. Practice outside the bounds of these groups is strictly controlled, and underground churches, sects and even private religious study groups are periodically cracked down upon.                  For foreigners, there is generally more freedom, provided they avoid anything that smacks of proselytisation. Many faiths not officially recognized by the government – Mormonism, Judaism, Quakers – are able to operate in China, provided the only worshippers are foreign citizens.      Related articleThis US church with expansion in its DNA wants to open a temple in China              Sensitivity over foreign religious groups remains strong, however. In a 2018 white paper on religion, the Chinese government noted that certain faiths had “long been controlled and utilized by colonialists and imperialists.”                  Though the draft rules affirm China’s commitment to respecting “the freedom of religious belief of foreigners,” the list of potential new restrictions and requirements could make practicing that belief far more difficult.                  In particular, the draft rules include a list of activities that foreigners should not conduct within China, such as “interfering with or dominating the affairs of Chinese religious groups,” advocating “extremist religious thoughts,” using religion to conduct terrorist activities, or “interfering with the appointment or management of Chinese clergy members.”                  The last point appears aimed at the Vatican, with whom China has a longstanding dispute over the appointment of bishops by the official Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Beijing insists on having the final say on all bishop appointments in mainland China, while the Holy See maintains that only the Pope has such authority.                 The two sides struck a secretive and hugely controversial deal in 2018, which was extended for another two years this October, but talks on a more permanent arrangement appear to have stalled. In a book published this week, Pope Francis referred to Uyghurs as a “persecuted people” for the first time, a phrase that angered Beijing.                 “What Pope Francis said about the Uyghurs is totally groundless,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a regular briefing Tuesday. “There are 56 ethnic groups in China, and the Uyghur ethnic group is an equal member of the big family of the Chinese nation.”                 “The Chinese government has always treated the minority groups equally and protected their legitimate rights and interests,” Zhao added.                 Other parts of the draft rules seem to target Islamic groups, which have come under immense pressure in recent years, both in Xinjiang and across China, where there are an estimated 23 million known Muslims, according to the most recent census data.     In an article that explicitly linked the new rules with recent acts of Islamic extremism in Europe, the state-backed Global Times quoted a former top religious official as saying the proposed regulations show “China’s swift response to the growing global challenge – the threat of religious extremism to political stability, and the social panic and disorder caused by religious extremism.”                  Rian Thum, an expert on Islam in China at the University of Nottingham, said the rules reflect a “longstanding fear of foreign pollution, which has become more important in the current climate.”                  “I was struck by the repeated use of the phrase ‘China’s religious independence,’ which points to the nationalist desire to purify religions of ‘foreign’ influences,” he said. “The regulations look like an effort to seal off Chinese religious practitioners from their fellow believers outside the country. Even lectures by visiting religious figures would require a bureaucratic permissions process that would dissuade most visitors.”                  Under Xi’s push to “sinicize” religions in the country, places of worship have been stripped of overtly religious symbols and iconography, Muslim graveyards and mosques have been destroyed, and Xi’s image has been hung up in religious buildings. According to a recent analysis by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), around one in three mosques in Xinjiang have been demolished, mostly since 2017.      Speaking last week, a spokesman for the Xinjiang government said reports about the destruction of mosques and other religious sites were “completely untrue.”                  For all the government’s talk of sinicizing Islam, most Muslims in China practice a domestic version of the faith, said Alkan Akad, a China researcher at Amnesty International, in mosques that are often more Chinese in style than Islamic. Those Muslims who do have contact with groups overseas often face increased scrutiny over this, and some Uyghurs have ended up in reeducation camps after returning from Hajj or trips to Muslim countries.                  The flipside of sinicization is a move towards “de-Arabization” or “de-Saudification,” buzzwords that are used by Chinese officials in regard to fears of growing foreign influence over Islam in China.                  “The Chinese state has been quite concerned about the growing popularity of the Wahhabi ideology and close connections with Saudi Arabia, which has seemingly grown over the last decade or so,” Akad said.                  Darren Byler, a Xinjiang expert and post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Colorado, said that “Islam itself is already more or less criminalized in Xinjiang so I would guess that (the new rules are) more likely aimed at Hui practice in Eastern China. They have long had more direct association with Saudi and global piety movements like Tabligh Jama’at.”                  The Hui minority – most of whom are Chinese-speaking Muslims – have come under increasing pressure in recent months, as the government turns its attention to its largest Muslim group outside of Xinjiang.                  However, experts who spoke to CNN agreed that the main effect of the new rules will likely be on Christian groups, who, while never given free rein, have previously avoided the type of intense scrutiny Muslims are subjected to.                  “I believe it’s reasonable to assume that it mainly targets Christians, which have been regarded as a means of foreign infiltration particularly since the Opium War,” Akad said.      Related articleCan a religious group that wants to bring down China's Communist Party survive in Hong Kong?             Previously there has been broad tolerance for foreigners preaching to foreigners, provided they are officially licensed and ensure no Chinese citizens attend services. Some Christian groups are less scrupulous about this than others, and missionaries continue to operate illegally in China, Thum said.                  The new regulations could further tighten grey areas around foreign religious practice, issuing strict new requirements for applying to hold services, including describing the primary religious texts used, listing the nationality and visa status of all attendees, and obtaining a permit to use the building for such activities.                  After receiving such an application, the draft rules state, “the religious affairs department of the provincial people’s government shall solicit the religious affairs department of the county-level people’s government, the religious affairs department of the people’s government of the city divided into districts, and the province, autonomous region,” and shall make a decision “within 20 days.”                  Such red tape, and the potential punishments for avoiding it, could make it far more difficult for foreigners to hold services, and push them to use approved Bibles or Korans rather than foreign published texts.                  While specific punishments are not listed in the new proposal, there is a suggestion they could be severe, with talk of invoking “counter espionage” laws and other state security regulations against infractors.                  “The way the rules are written, and the way that Chinese laws tend to be interpreted by the security services, suggests that foreigners who engage in religious activities alongside Chinese citizens or even do research on those activities could be detained or harassed,” Thum said.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.             The killing of al Qaeda deputy leader Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, which multiple current and former U.S. officials have attributed to a team of Israeli agents, according to the Associated Press, was a big blow to the top tier of America’s decades-long terrorist enemy. A long-standing member of al Qaeda’s senior leadership who had been in Iran since 2003, his death was yet another victory in a US-led counterterrorism campaign that in recent months has killed the group’s purported media chief in Afghanistan, according to an AP report, and a string of senior leaders based in Syria. Meanwhile, rumors persist that al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri may also have recently died from natural causes.                 “It is now possible to see the contours of how the war against al Qaeda ends.” So said Christopher Miller on Sept. 10, while the director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Fast forward two months and Miller is now acting Secretary of Defense and signaling that the US is in a “critical phase” in which “all wars must end.” These statements should be seen within the context of the outgoing Trump administration seeking to drive a last-minute agenda, but they reflect a wider American trend – not just of pulling back from foreign engagements, but of believing the threat posed by jihadist terrorism is at an all-time low.                 That is a dangerous sentiment, and it could allow a new form of terrorism to grow in the coming years.                 Two impressions are driving the sense that jihadists pose less of a threat today: First, a belief that the US homeland is now safer than it has ever been from a 9/11-style attack; and second, faith in “leadership decapitation” – killing leaders in the field – as the key to defeating terrorism. The first assessment may be true, but it is also misleading. The second comprehensively misunderstands the forces now driving jihadists worldwide.     Related articleAl Qaeda loses one of its most experienced leaders in mysterious murder in Tehran             For years now, al Qaeda has been undergoing a process of decentralization, whereby its original generation of leaders has grown more and more distant from their affiliates across the globe. Some of this is due to the effect of sustained pressure exerted by US aircraft, special forces and allied nations – all of which has forced terrorist leaders into hiding, where they become increasingly disconnected. It is also the simple consequence of having a profoundly uncharismatic leader in Zawahiri, whose propaganda is like listening to someone read a Victorian encyclopedia.                 As a result, in the last few years, al Qaeda affiliates have gained a great deal of autonomy to pursue their own agendas within their respective local environments. In so doing, jihadist terrorism has changed: The global has given way to the local, as affiliates in North Africa, the Sahel, Yemen and South Asia embed increasingly deeply into local conflict dynamics, building alliances with non-ideological actors and engaging extensively in local politics.     Related articleISIS exploiting coronavirus security gaps to relaunch insurgency, UN report warns             The demands of local agendas are complex and fluid, making strategic decisions a constant necessity and something distant leaders like Zawahiri have little if any influence over. Over time, as more decisions are made, al Qaeda’s leadership has become less and less relevant. In Syria, al Qaeda’s longtime affiliate originally known as Jabhat al Nusra traveled so far down this road it is no longer considered al Qaeda and is now managing a semi-technocratic governing body and publicly expressing a desire to engage with foreign governments.                 Though its territorial caliphate in Syria and Iraq is no more, ISIS is already engaged in a slow but methodical resurgence, taking advantage of Syrian regime weakness, US withdrawal away from rural positions in Iraq, and more. Further afield, ISIS’s wilayat (or provinces) appear to be competing with al Qaeda’s affiliates, using the exact same local playbook: exploit pre-existing local strife to establish a presence, embed itself within a local community, and exacerbate conflict for its own interests. Nowhere is that reality more clear than in Africa, where ISIS branches are intensively active in Mozambique, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Chad, Somalia and the Congo.                 While this localizing trend suggests jihadists are probably less interested in plotting large-scale terror attacks in Europe or the US, it would be naïve to put our foot on the brakes.     Related articleFrench military kills north African al Qaeda leader with US help             Jihadists are growing deeper roots in more countries around the world than ever before, and that should raise very serious concerns. We are seeing the emergence of more and more ungoverned spaces ripe for jihadist exploitation, and in developing countries, governments’ capacity to pre-empt or respond to jihadist challenges is declining.                 If today’s trajectory continues, it is likely that we will be staring at multiple jihadist statelets across the world within a matter of years. The longer these ungoverned vacuums remain, the more deeply jihadist actors will embed themselves in local settings and the smarter and more flexible they will become in responding to external challenges. The world will become increasingly unstable as our allies weaken, riven by a plethora of local conflicts, all or many of which could provide the means for the jihad to once again go global – but with greater resources than ever before.                 This possibility represents a consequential threat to US national security interests and cannot be allowed to come to fruition.     Related articleCaught between roadblocks, they were sitting ducks for Boko Haram massacre             The time has come for a smarter and more holistic approach to countering terrorism, one focused as much on the long-term as on the immediate. The US must continue to utilize its unmatched means to target senior jihadist operatives and those actively committed to the global agenda, but more emphasis should be paid to building the capacity of allies and partners worldwide so that they can one day deal with their own respective local challenges alone.                 We must also finally recognize that ideology is rarely if ever the sole or primary driver of terrorism, and indeed, ideologies cannot be defeated. Ungoverned spaces, autocratic rule, corruption, economic decline, disenfranchisement, and ethnic, sectarian or communal strife are all the principal drivers that allow terrorists to become more than a marginal fringe.                 If the world is to face this global threat with a global strategy, it will have to involve addressing all those issues. If they’re left to fester, a movement in the process of localizing could once again become a worldwide problem.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The speech was particularly notable because it comes at a fraught time on the heels of a divisive election, when Chief Justice John Roberts has sought to keep the court out of the political fray. Alito, instead, took on the restrictions of in-person worship services during the pandemic – an issue that is currently before the court – as well as Obergefell v. Hodges, the opinion that cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide. He also returned to the issue of the Second Amendment and touched on the possibility that Democrats may seek to restructure the size of the court.     Related articleSupreme Court appears to signal Obamacare will survive latest GOP challenge              His comments on religious liberty at times echoed those of President Donald Trump who pledged from the White House Rose Garden in 2017 that he would prevent the federal government from “bullying and even punishing Americans for following their religious beliefs.”                 In addressing Covid-19, Alito pointedly noted that he was not trying to diminish the severity of the pandemic, which he said has taken a heavy human toll, leaving “thousands dead, many more hospitalized,” nor was he commenting on whether the restrictions represent good public policy. “I am a judge, not a policy maker,” he said.                 But he said that he wanted to emphasize the impact of the restrictions on the rule of law and individual rights as officials have moved to combat the virus.                  “We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged,” he said, and added that the pandemic has resulted in “previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty.”                 Alito said that the Covid crisis has served as a “sort of constitutional stress test” that has highlighted “disturbing trends” that were present before the virus appeared. He pointed to emergency orders over the summer where the court sided with officials who sought to restrict the number of people who could worship in person and he lambasted his colleagues for ruling in favor of state and local officials even when he thought churches were being treated differently from other entities that had fewer restrictions.                 Earlier Thursday the court received yet another emergency petition on the issue, this time from the Roman Catholic diocese of Brooklyn seeking relief from an executive order from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.                 Alito’s discussion turned to recent religious liberty cases concerning the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns who didn’t want their health plans to provide contraceptives to their employees, as well as 2018 case concerning a baker who refused to make a cake to celebrate a couple’s wedding out of religious objections to same sex marriage.                 Alito said that “a great many Americans disagree, sometimes quite strongly” with the religious beliefs of the Little Sisters and the cake baker, “and of course they have a perfect right to do so.” But, he said, the cases raised another question.                 “The question we face” is whether our “society will be inclusive enough to tolerate people with unpopular beliefs.” And he wondered about those who believe they may be winning the cultural wars by taking a hard line of “you lost, live with it.”                 Taking such a hard line, Alito suggested, “seemed to work reasonably well in Germany and Japan after 1945,” he said and asked rhetorically, “is our country going to follow that course?”                 Returning to last summer’s cases concerning restrictions to in person worship services in Nevada and California during the pandemic, he said the restrictions “blatantly discriminated against houses of worship.”                 “In both cases the court allowed the discrimination to stand,” he said giving a justification that the court should defer to the judgment of the governors because “they have the responsibility to safeguard the public health.”                 He lambasted the governor of Nevada who, he said, had allowed fewer restrictions to casinos than houses of worship.                 “If you want to worship and you are the 51st person in line, sorry you are out of luck,” he said.                 “The state’s message is this: forget about worship and head for the slot machines or maybe a Cirque de Soleil show.”                 Alito also reiterated what he had written in 2015, when he dissented from the court’s decision to clear the way for same-sex marriage nationwide.                  “I could see,” he said, where the decision would lead for those who “cling to traditional views on marriage.”                 He reiterated that opponents of the ruling would risk being “labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers and schools.”                 “That is just what has come to pass,” he said. “One of the great challenges for the Supreme Court going forward will be to protect freedom of speech.”     Related articleJoe Biden's new chief of staff knows how to get a Supreme Court justice confirmed             And he saved particular anger for a Second Amendment case the court heard last term. In the end, the court dismissed the case because the law in question was changed after the justices agreed to hear the case.                 On Thursday, as he did in his dissent, Alito took special aim at a brief filed by five Democratic senators who had urged the court to dismiss the case and had warned that if it did not, the public would believe the court was motivated by politics. The senators said the “Supreme Court is not well” and floated the possibility that it might need to be “restructured.”                 On Thursday night, Alito blasted the brief.                 “This little episode, I’m afraid, might provide a foretaste about what the court will face in the future, and therefore I don’t think it can simply be brushed aside,” he said.                 Alito’s speech comes after Justice Amy Coney Barrett completed her first sitting on the court. Her nomination was championed by supporters of religious liberty, who believe she will join the court’s right flank on the issue.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Until the government does so, American Muslims should exercise caution and avoid travel to France.”                 Three people were stabbed to death at a church in Nice on Oct. 29, a brutal attack authorities say was carried out by an Islamist terrorist.                  The killings followed the murder of high school teacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded last month during a terror attack in a northern suburb of Paris.

But after the incident, French President Emmanuel Macron said that the country was under attack by “Islamist and terrorist madness.”                 France is home to 5 million Muslims, many of whom live in poorer areas, are marginalized in political circles, and socially separate from other French residents.

Leaders in countries including Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey urged Muslims to boycott French products after condemning Macron’s comments on Islam.                 “In the days since the horrific murder of educator Samuel Patty (sic) the French government has expanded its embrace of anti-Muslim bigotry by arresting numerous French Muslims with no apparent connection to the crime and moving to shut down various French Muslim organizations, including the country’s largest anti-Islamophobia group,” Mitchell, with CAIR, said.                 “Just as France did not collectively punish all French secularists for last week’s racist stabbing attack on Muslim women near the Eiffel Tower, France must stop collectively punishing all French Muslims for the crimes of individual religious extremists,” Mitchell added, referring to reports of two veiled Muslim women who were stabbed last month in an allegedly racist attack.                 The vast majority of France’s Muslims do not support Islamic extremism, but often face unfair stereotypes, according to experts.                  French Muslims say they face discrimination with a ban on religious veils and the anti-Muslim rhetoric by some political leaders.                  “It’s also worth noting that the French government has a long history of transforming anti-Muslim bigotry into government policy: kicking students who wear hijabs out of public school, barring public servants from wearing such signs of their faith, criminalizing religious face veils while requiring medical face masks, and arresting Muslim women for wearing full-body swimsuits, among other irrational policies that should end,” Mitchell said.

It’s the latest in a series of significant “How we got here” documentaries from producer Alex Gibney (just out with “Agents of Chaos”), here teaming with author Lawrence Wright.                 Wright – who wrote “The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,” chronicling the failures prior to the Sept. 11 attacks – helpfully fills in some of that history, describing the Middle East as having been “A part of the world that we didn’t care about, except for the oil” for decades.                 That changed with the strategic interest in Afghanistan’s Cold War fight against the then-Soviet Union, prompting former National Security Council counterterrorism advisor Richard Clarke to observe, “If we had just left Afghanistan alone, in 20/20 hindsight, I think things might have been better in the long run.”                 All that background is useful in understanding Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who had interviewed Osama bin Laden when he was battling the Soviet invasion and who earnestly yearned for reforms and greater freedom in the region.                 The exultation that surrounded the Arab Spring, however, gave way to disappointment when democratic impulses were crushed, altering his views and turning him into an outspoken critic of the current Saudi leadership.                 Director Rick Rowley gives voice to Khashoggi’s writings by having an actor read them, and documents the way that the US business community embraced Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a reformer while “drooling” over his billions, instilling a “sense of impunity” that allowed Khashoggi’s death to happen.                 “Kingdom of Silence” also includes former diplomat David Rundell, a former US diplomat and expert on Saudi Arabia who maintains that the grisly killing of the Washington Post contributor by operatives dispatched to Turkey isn’t reason enough to imperil US interests there. It’s the perfect encapsulation of decades of American policy, where support for democratic impulses has frequently run afoul of financial incentives and pragmatism.                 “I do my best to just be a journalist, and not become a revolutionary,” Khashoggi said, providing the documentary’s title by saying of advocacy for change in Saudi Arabia, “We are the kingdom of silence no longer.”                 Several of the killers were recently sentenced to prison, although an independent investigator called the verdicts issued by the Saudis “a parody of justice.”                 As “Kingdom of Silence” makes clear, the aftermath of Khashoggi’s death reflects that in dealings with Saudi Arabia, the golden rule still appears to apply, as in he who has the gold, and the oil, gets to make the rules.     “Kingdom of Silence” premieres Oct. 2 at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. It wil also be available free Oct. 1 on the Washington Post’s website. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/30/americas/canada-isis-hoax-chaudhry-intl/index.html,His confession about being an ISIS executioner enraged Canadians. Now police say he made it up,"Shehroze Chaudhry is accused of lying about being a foreign fighter for ISIS and in so doing, perpetrating a terrorist “hoax.”","Sep 30, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Paula Newton,International,"The details were gory and vivid, the emotion was raw, but Canadian police say 25-year-old Shehroze Chaudhry lied about being a foreign fighter for ISIS and in so doing, perpetrated a terrorist “hoax.”                  Last week, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police charged Chaudhry, a Toronto-area man, with “Hoax-Terrorist activity” in relation to interviews that were published by “multiple media outlets,” according to a police news release.                  The RCMP did not provide further details about their allegations, noting only in the news release that Chaudhry “claimed he travelled to Syria in 2016 to join the terrorist group ISIS and committed acts of terrorism.”                    Chaudhry declined to comment to CNN.                   “Hoaxes can generate fear within our communities and create the illusion there is a potential threat to Canadians, while we have determined otherwise. As a result, the RCMP takes these allegations very seriously, particularly when individuals, by their actions, cause the police to enter into investigations in which human and financial resources are invested and diverted from other ongoing priorities,” said Superintendent Christopher deGale, of the RCMP’s Ontario Division of the Integrated National Security Enforcement Team.                 RCMP did not outline what investigators knew about Chaudhry’s trips to Syria or if they could confirm that he had ever traveled there. Police also did not disclose whether they believe Chaudhry fabricated the entire story about being an ISIS member or whether it was specific details that Chaudhry disclosed in media interviews that constituted the “hoax.”                 Leaving Canada to participate in the activities of a terrorist group is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of 10 years.                  In a series of media interviews, most notably with the award-winning New York Times 2018 podcast “Caliphate,” Chaudhry – portrayed under the name Abu Huzayfah in interviews – talked in graphic terms about ISIS killings and violence and pledged allegiance to the ISIS cause of creating an Islamic caliphate.                 After the debut of “Caliphate,” Chaudhry also spoke to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, but gave different details about his level of involvement with ISIS, according to CBC.                  In a statement to CNN, the RCMP says it “can confirm that Shehroze Chaudhry is the same person as Abu Huzayfah from the New York Times podcast Caliphate.                 “The information aired in the Caliphate Podcast series was investigated, as were other avenues of information available to us, with the result of our investigation being the basis for the charge laid against Mr. Chaudhry,” says Sgt. Lucie Lapointe.                   You could still hear the shock in Amarnath Amarasingam’s voice as he discussed the bombshell charges against Chaudhry, a man he says he has spoken to almost every week for nearly 4 years for research and community reintegration efforts.                 “From everything we’ve talked about I’m a little blown away by the charge so I’m waiting to see what the RCMP says about the case and see if it survives in court somehow,” said Amarasingam, an assistant professor in the School of Religion at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario in an interview with CNN.                 In his work as a researcher and lecturer in extremist ideology, Amarasingam says he has spoken to dozens of ISIS fighters and while he says he cannot rule out that Chaudhry lied, he is stunned at the allegations that he faked the whole story.                 “He was incredibly detailed, incredibly plausible, and then the emotional aspect of it added to it. When someone is telling you a story, when you’re describing a murder that you committed or that you saw, if you haven’t experienced anything like that it’s really hard,” said Amarasingam, adding that he spoke to Chaudhry in the last few days but did not discuss the charges against him.                  In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, VP for Communications Danielle Rhoades Ha said the New York Times was reviewing the way it presented Huzayfah in the series.                 “While the uncertainty about Abu Huzayfah’s story was explored directly in episodes of Caliphate that featured him, his arrest and the allegations surrounding it have raised new and important questions about him and his motivations. We’re undertaking a fresh examination of his history and the way we presented him in our series. We will have more to say when we complete that effort.”                 In an earlier statement, the Times said uncertainty about Abu Huzayfah’s story was “central to every episode of Caliphate that featured him.”                 “Huzayfah’s account was checked against several other sources and documents – including his family, his teachers in Pakistan, flight records, university transcripts, passports, multiple American intelligence officials, an interview with another former ISIS member, geolocation of images and more. The concerns being raised now are concerns that our team examined in the podcast,” Rhoades Ha said.                 In defending its airing of “Caliphate,” the New York Times sad the series was “responsible journalism that helped listeners understand the power and pull of extremism.”                 Chaudhry publicly denied being a murderer in subsequent interviews. In a May 2018 CBC interview, he said that when he spoke to the New York Times he was “being childish.” He added in the CBC interview: “I was describing what I saw and basically, I was close enough to think it was me.”                 New York Times correspondent Rukmini Callimachi interviewed Chaudhry for “Caliphate.” She told the CBC in 2018 that she suspected Chaudhry changed his story when he realized he was under investigation in Canada. Callimachi added that as the publication date approached he threatened to say he “made it all up” if they refused to pull the story.                 When CNN reached out to Callimachi for comment, she referred us to the New York Times statement.                 In that statement, the news organization also pointed out that when it discovered that Chaudhry had “misled them about some details,” it then aired Chapter 6 of the series which the New York Times says documented the process to uncover his inconsistencies.                   But Chaudhry’s claims sparked concern in Canada and opposition leaders demanded action from the Trudeau government.                   In a parliamentary session shortly after “Caliphate” debuted, Canada’s public safety minister Ralph Goodale responded, “I am charged with the responsibility of keeping Canadians safe,” adding, “Discussing operational matters on the floor of the House of Commons is exactly the opposite of keeping Canadians safe.”                 Conservative politician Candice Bergen shot back: “Canadians deserve more answers from this government. Why aren’t they doing something about this despicable animal?” Bergen said.                 The RCMP has said little on what role Chaudhry’s media interviews played in its “extensive” investigation, asserting only that they raised “public safety concerns amongst Canadians.”                 Chaudhry is scheduled to appear in court in mid-November and the charge, if proven, carries a maximum prison sentence of 5 years.                 Amarasingam says Chaudhry has been trying to move on with his life and that he was enrolled in university full time and also has a job. He says when the New York Times podcast was released, Chaudhry did seem uncomfortable that his interview was central to many episodes of the podcast.                 “For the podcast he burst into tears when talking about the killing, and so it would require a certain level of mental distress, mental health issues to arouse the kind of emotions in yourself when talking about an entirely made up story,” said Amarasingam.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

Shams,International,"Editor’s Note: Mansoor T. Shams is a Muslim American US Marine Veteran, the founder of MuslimMarine.org and a public speaker. He also serves as a Term Member on the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Follow him on Twitter: @mansoortshams. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.             Like many of us, I vividly remember where I was and what I was doing on 9/11. Nearly one year earlier, I had made one of the toughest decisions any young 18-year-old American could ever make – I raised my hand to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic” and became part of America’s finest. I became a United States Marine.                 As footage of the Twin Towers started to roll in, I, like any other American, sat horrified, confused and frustrated. None of us Marines could figure out what was going on. But as the minutes and hours continued to pass, our base leadership on Camp Johnson in North Carolina decided to go into lockdown mode. I even recall one of our NCOs (non-commissioned officers) being asked to report to the armory to get his M16 rifle and stand guard at the base entrance. All nonessential entrance into the base was halted. No Marine could leave the base either. I’d only been in the Marine Corps for a year, and I had never witnessed anything like this.                 As the days went on, we would come to find out the attacks originated from Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan, the country I was born in. It was heart wrenching, painful to say the least. Deep down I began wondering why did it have to be the people with whom I shared a heritage, and, worse, the same faith. Why not someone else? Why not some other group? Why did the terrorists have to be people who claimed to follow my beautiful Islam? In hindsight it probably wasn’t the right sort of thinking.                 Although the Marine Corps is a unique breed of brotherhood which prides itself on certain core values like honor, courage and commitment, I started to experience a level of discrimination I could never have imagined.                  I had heard of stories of discrimination taking place in civilian America, but in the Marines? I wouldn’t have imagined it happening among the group that had become in many ways my brothers.     Related articleWhat the war on terror teaches us about Covid-19             I remember certain Marines giving me weird looks while some others, half jokingly and openly, even called me things like Taliban, terrorist and Osama bin Laden. In the beginning, I’d either try to ignore it or just laugh it off – but as time went on, I could feel things starting to get to me. I made complaints to my leadership, but they did little to intervene. Sadly, sometimes they were part of the problem.                   I even remember the time when my warrant officer denied my request to hold off on a physical fitness test (which included a three mile timed run, pull ups and maximum crunches in two minutes) until the end of the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from sunup to sundown every day for a month. The armed forces does make reasonable accommodations as needed, so I felt that the denial was part of the discrimination I was facing. Luckily, I passed my physical fitness test successfully without passing out.                    Adjusting to the Marine Corps way of life up until that point had been hard enough. Now, I was dealing with a new  environment that was more intimidating. Months later, I was moved to a different unit on base and able to start over, earning a Marine of the Quarter award and later a meritorious promotion to Corporal.                   To be absolutely clear, I’m not saying the Marine Corps is full of racist and bigots. I’m just saying, unfortunately, racism and bigotry also exists within the armed forces.                  As all the chaos was going on, I still somehow managed to remain true to who I was and the oath I had taken as a US Marine. I reached out to my leadership to make them aware of my unique background: my ability to speak the languages of Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi, my familiarity with cultures and traditions in that part of the world, and even my Muslim faith since Afghanistan is a Muslim majority country.                  In short, I was asking my leadership to use me in any way that could be helpful, even if that meant sending me into the heat of battle. I was ready to die for my country. This was my mindset. This was the level of love and dedication I had for America. In many ways, what I was doing was Islam in action, because love and service to country of residence is part of my Islamic faith as taught by the founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammad.                  Fast forward to today, if you aren’t tanned skinned, don’t don a black beard like I do or wear a hijab as many of my sisters in the Muslim community do, you likely won’t understand the Muslim experience.                  Nineteen years have passed since 9/11 and yet every time we commemorate the victims of 9/11 through various programs, there are certain groups, organizations, people (including politicians) who intently and cleverly work to make 9/11  about the Muslim faith.                   As hashtags like #NeverForget trend, it not only serves as a reminder to keep the memory of those 3,000 lives that were so viciously taken, but I’ve seen how for some it’s also a way to remind Americans the terrorists were Muslim. Just go through your social media and read some of the comments. You’ll see exactly what I’m talking about.                  It’s gotten to the point that some of us Muslims have to almost go into hiding on this day for fear of association and undeserved repercussion. Some of us feel as if we aren’t even allowed to grieve or honor those innocent lives lost.                 And sometimes it feels like we aren’t allowed to talk about what happened at all. Last year during an event, Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar received heat because she said that for “Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second class citizen. And frankly, I’m tired of it. And every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.” Omar went on to talk about Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which she said “recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”                 Instead of looking at her comments from the lens of an American she was berated.                  Of course President Donald Trump wasted little time in taking Omar’s comments out of context, falsely claiming that she praised al Qaeda.              Remember this was the same man who in 2017 issued a travel ban on countries, most of which are predominately Muslim  and said “I think Islam hates us” on live television when he was a presidential candidate.                  To be absolutely clear, I not only agree with Congresswoman Omar’s full statement in context, I particularly agree with the part  that seemed to rile many people across America: “some people did something.”              For far too long (almost two decades now), Muslims have had to bear dreadful discrimination, persecution, hate and bigotry because of the actions of 19 terrorists who claimed the peaceful religion of Islam. So yes, “some people did something” and it’s unfair to associate all Muslims with the atrocity.     Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook             It’s the same sort of battle Black America faces today, if one black person does something wrong, thousands of African Americans are now automatically seen as criminal. And what about mass shootings in America? An overwhelming majority of mass shootings are conducted by young White men. Now imagine if I applied the same formula to all White Americans as some Americans apply to Muslims –  assuming every White person I saw was a mass shooter.                  I’m asking my fellow Americans who may still hold some sort of anti-Muslim discrimination in their hearts because of 9/11 to take a moment to think and to understand that Muslims were also among the victims of the attack.              Muslims have served and died for this nation since the days of George Washington.              In fact, there has never been an America without Muslims. So as you commemorate 9/11 this year, let’s honor those innocent lives lost, together, hand in hand, in solidarity as Americans. But whatever you do, please don’t bring our Muslim faith into it. Because if you do, you are not only disrespecting my honorable service to this nation but every Muslim American living or dead who has given their all (whether in uniform or without) to this America. I’m not asking for a special favor.  All I’m asking is see us Muslims as humans, as your fellow Americans without prejudice. That’s all.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Overall, Americans are now less likely than they were earlier this summer – when protests sparked by the death of George Floyd began – to say that racism is a big problem in society (67% said so then, 55% feel that way now). And while there has been some decline across party lines in that sentiment, the drop has come most sharply among Republicans. In June, 43% said racism was a big problem in society; now, just 22% say the same. Among Democrats, 84% feel that way, compared with 90% in June. Among independents, 57% say it’s a big problem vs. 63% in June.                  The partisan dynamic is similar in the poll’s findings about peaceful protests in response to incidents where African Americans have been harmed or killed by police. Overall, 72% call those protests justified, down from 84% in June, and the shift has again been steepest among Republicans (from 79% saying they were justified in June to 60% now).                  Fewer overall (24%) say that violent protests are justified in this situation, but that number holds largely steady compared with June (27%).                  The results come following a summer of President Donald Trump contending that Black Lives Matter is a “symbol of hate” and arguing that the protests are a portent of a violent future should Democratic nominee Joe Biden win the presidency.                  A majority, though, hold favorable views of the Black Lives Matter movement, 51% favorable vs. 38% unfavorable. That favorability rating far outpaces Trump’s own; an earlier release from the same poll showed 40% hold a favorable view of Trump, 56% unfavorable. Democrats largely view the Black Lives Matter movement favorably (83%), about half of independents agree (50%), and among Republicans, just 17% say they have a favorable view.                  Most Americans continue to say the President’s response to the protests has been harmful, and people are divided over whether federal government intervention is warranted when protests do turn violent.                  Overall, 58% call Trump’s response to the protests harmful, down from 65% who said the same in June. Again, the shift is largely among Republicans. Now, 72% of the President’s partisans say his response to the protests has been helpful, up from 62% in June. Among independents and Democrats those numbers are steady.                  Trump has repeatedly called for federal intervention in cities where protests have turned violent, and the poll finds an even split over that idea: 48% support it, 47% oppose it. Views on this are also sharply partisan (81% of Republicans support it, just 21% of Democrats agree), and split by race: most Whites support it (51%), while most people of color oppose it (53%).                 The President’s approval rating for handling race relations has improved somewhat, according to the poll, but that too is the result of a partisan shift. Among Republicans, approval has climbed from 73% to 83% since June. Among Democrats (1% now vs. 2% in June) and independents (26% approval now vs. 29% then), it hasn’t changed significantly.                  More generally, amid the coronavirus pandemic, racial strife and an economic struggle, Americans’ perceptions of how things are going in the country has shifted deeply negative (64% say things are going badly in the country, compared with 43% who felt that way in January). There’s still a broad partisan gap on this question, as there was in January, with 90% of Democrats saying things are going badly and 69% of Republicans saying they’re going well.                 But despite the overall negative sense of how things are going, the poll finds one optimistic note. Six in 10 Americans feel this summer’s protests will lead to real changes in the treatment of Blacks and other racial and ethnic minorities in America, with surprising agreement across demographic groups. 62% of Whites feel that way, as do 61% of people of color. Majorities of women (65%), men (56%), young people (57%), and seniors (64%) all see change as likely.                 The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS August 28 through September 1 among a random national sample of 1,106 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

MPower Change, in collaboration with grassroots organizations, launched the #MyMuslimVote campaign to promote a nationwide virtual registration drive. The group bills itself as the largest Muslim digital advocacy organization in the US, with more than 250,000 members.                 “The stakes in 2020 elections couldn’t be higher for our community,” MPower says on its website. “Join the #MyMuslimVote movement to engage, motivate, and mobilize tens of thousands of Muslim voters.”                  The group aims to register American Muslim voters through its website, which also provides resources for local activists to organize within their communities.                 Participating organizations have already reached out to nearly half a million registered Muslim voters, and are sending email and text message reminders to encourage American Muslims to vote in person or by mail, they said.                 American Muslims, along with other minority communities, could help vote President Donald Trump out of the White House and usher in Democratic contender Joe Biden, MPower Change Executive Director Linda Sarsour told CNN.      Related articleTrump's history of anti-Muslim rhetoric hits dangerous new low             “We must do everything we can as Muslims to alleviate harm,” Sarsour said. “I hope Muslims join me in voting this election because we can’t allow this administration to appoint more Supreme Court Justices or federal judges who can negatively impact our lives for generations to come.”                 The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) will also host virtual phone and text banks to assist in the effort.                 “If there was the full participation of Muslim voters in this election, we’d have the ability to tip the vote in Florida, Virginia, Ohio, Michigan and Connecticut. We need to make sure Muslims are inspired to vote for the candidates in front of us,” Robert McCaw, CAIR’s director of government affairs, told CNN.                 The Trump campaign in mid-August launched Muslim Voices for Trump. Also introduced at that time were similar coalitions for voters who identify as Indian, Hindu and Sikh.                  A Trump campaign site targeted to Muslim supporters includes a sign-up form, but no policy initiatives are listed.                  “Muslim Voices for Trump will energize and mobilize the Muslim community in re-electing President Donald J. Trump by sharing the many successes of the Trump Administration,” the site states. “Re-electing President Trump will ensure the protection of religious liberties, economic prosperity, and educational opportunities for Muslims in America.”                 Following Trump’s 2016 election, American Muslims experienced a spike in hate crimes, according to data from the FBI.                 More than 6,100 hate crimes were reported to the FBI in 2016, with anti-Islamic or anti-Muslim crimes increasing more than 19% over the previous year, an FBI report found. It was the biggest categorical rise overall.     Related articleHate crimes rose in 2016 - especially against Muslims and whites             Many American Muslim leaders attributed the spike to anti-Muslim rhetoric espoused by Trump and some of his close associates.                 Leaders point to Trump’s controversial comments on Syrian refugees and travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, among other statements and policies, as evidence of his anti-Muslim bias.                 “There is a fire in the stomach of every Muslim voter to make sure that their voices are heard, because we are very concerned about the rise in Islamophobia in America,” McCaw said.                 “In the face of rising anti-Muslim political rhetoric, it inspires Muslim communities to get out and make sure we are getting the candidates in office that best respect our votes and our concerns.”                 Biden’s election may not change the situation for American Muslims, but it is a step in a better direction, Sarsour said.                 “I don’t believe that the lives of our communities will drastically change under a Biden administration, but we can at least alleviate some of Trump’s harm and continue to build power and movements for the future,” she said.                 To that end, the #MyMuslimVote website allows for American Muslims to check their voter registration, register to vote, request a vote-by-mail ballot or find an in-person polling station.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

The groups allege that Muslim detainees at the Krome detention facility in Miami have been forced to accept pork because the “religiously compliant or halal meals that ICE has served have been persistently rotten and expired.”                 Expired halal meals have been an issue for over two years, but the situation for the detainees at the facility was exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Muslim Advocates and Americans for Immigration Justice.     Related articleAmid Covid-19 pandemic, immigrant children and parents must be released from detention -- together             In one instance, the chaplain at Krome’s dismissed requests from the Muslim detainees for help, saying, “It is what it is,” Nimra Azmi, a staff attorney for Muslim Advocates, told CNN.                 There are approximately several dozen Muslim detainees at Krome who believe that it is religiously impermissible to consume pork, the groups said in a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement leadership and federal oversight agencies.                  In the past, detainees would choose their own meals in the cafeteria, and were therefore able to avoid pork if the halal meals were spoiled. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the facility has been serving pre-portioned and pre-plated meals. This change has meant that detainees either had to choose between a spoiled halal meal or a meal with pork, according to the letter.                  At least two to three times a week, the pre-plated meals include pork, the groups said.                  “The detainees are frustrated, rightfully so, that something as simple as being able to get meals that are edible for them and religiously compliant for them are not being attended to,” Azmi said. “I think that they particularly feel that they’re just being ignored, that ICE is being dismissive, that nobody cares.”                 Azmi said that she reviewed notes and letters from the detainees describing the conditions inside the facility.                 ICE is investigating the specific allegations raised in the letter, according to an agency official.                  A spokesperson for the agency told CNN that “ICE’s Performance Based National Detention Standards cover all aspects of detention, to include reasonable accommodation of religious dietary practices. Any claim that ICE denies reasonable and equitable opportunity for persons to observe their religious dietary practices is false.”                 ICE has previously been accused of infringing on religious liberties of its detainees.                  A lawsuit filed last year by the same groups, alleged that Muslim detainees at the Glades County Detention Center in Florida had prayers interfered with, were deprived religiously-compliant meals and were denied religious articles.                 “This sort of treatment is not just morally reprehensible, it’s against the law. Federal statutes provide heightened protections for religious exercise. This extends to immigrants and incarcerated individuals, who are especially vulnerable to neglect, mistreatment, and other abuses,” wrote Aleksandr Sverdlik of the Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief for the American Civil Liberties Union last year.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

The assailant made his motives very clear and the NYPD needs to open a hate crime investigation.”                 CAIR-NY identified the victim as Tarek Elsayed, an 18-year-old Egyptian-American.                 The teen was attacked in Staten Island by a neighbor over a parking dispute, a police source told CNN.                 The man punctured Elsayed’s rear passenger tire and struck him with a baseball bat when he got out of his car to check the damage, CAIR-NY said in a statement.                 According to the organization, the attacker also threatened to kill Elsayed and his friends while they waited for the police, using several anti-Arab slurs and telling them to “go back to your country.”                  New York Police Department Det. Hubert Reyes told CNN there is no mention of racial epithets in the police report.                  Elsayed told CNN that he believes he told police about the epithets.                  “It hurt,” Elsayed said about the racial epithets. “It hurt hearing where I come from being used against me because he doesn’t like it.”                 Elsayed broke his arm and suffered injuries to the head, according to CAIR-NY.                  Police arrived and arrested the neighbor, Emilio Lopez. The 41-year-old man is charged with assault in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree and harassment, the NYPD said.                 CNN has reached out to Lopez’ attorney, Lance Lazzaro, for comment. Lopez’s next court appearance will be on November 16, in Richmond Criminal Court, according to court documents.                  CAIR-NY says it wants the attack investigated as a hate crime.                 “The NYPD and District Attorney have an obligation to consider all evidence during an investigation and when charging a suspect,” Mohamed told CNN. “Investigations and charges do not end once a suspect is arrested, and it is routine for prosecutors to add charges once more evidence becomes available to them. There is a plethora of evidence to support a hate crime investigation.” Clarification: This piece has been updated to clarify Elsayed is Arab-American.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Loomer is one of the most high-profile figures of this movement – and one of its most controversial. She has described Islam as a “cancer on humanity” and said that Muslim candidates should not be allowed to hold office in America. She has called herself a “proud Islamophobe.”             That behavior has led to Loomer being banned from Twitter, Facebook and Instagram – not to mention ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft. (She tweeted in 2018 that “someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver.”)                 And as of Wednesday morning, Loomer is the Republican nominee in Florida’s 21st District, which happens to include President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.                 She won a six-way primary for the right to face Rep. Lois Frankel (D) in the general election, raising more than $1 million thanks to support from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, pardoned Trump ally Roger Stone and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Loomer campaigned as the Trumpiest candidate in the field, touting her belief in the President’s “law and order” message. (Loomer is very unlikely to come to Congress; the 21st District is strongly Democrat.)                 Trump rewarded that support with a tweet touting Loomer’s win on Tuesday night.                  “Great going Laura,” he wrote. “You have a great chance against a Pelosi puppet!” He also retweeted several accounts congratulating Loomer on her victory, including that of Marjorie Taylor Greene, the GOP nominee in Georgia’s 14th district who has publicly supported the QAnon conspiracy theory and expressed a number of anti-Islamic views.                 CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski noted just how stunning a presidential endorsement for Loomer should be.                 “Remarkable to see a president endorse a candidate who said Muslims shouldn’t have be allowed to hold public office and called Islam ‘a cancer on humanity,’” he tweeted. “In a normal administration this would be a huge story but it will barely get mentioned.”                 Totally agree.                 But the story is about more than just a) Loomer winning or b) Trump embracing her.                 Loomer’s primary victory comes hard on Greene’s win in Georgia earlier this month – as well as victories in Oregon and Colorado by far-right candidates, many of whom embrace QAnon or similar unfounded conspiracy theories. Loomer’s win isn’t an anomaly. It’s part of the leading edge of the Republican Party’s transformation – or at least evolution – into an organization that includes provocateurs and conspiracy theorists among its ranks.     THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!             None of that should be surprising, given that the leader of the party is himself both a provocateur and a conspiracy theorist. Remember that the origins of Trump’s 2016 presidential candidacy were in his support for and promotion of a disproven conspiracy theory about Barack Obama not being born in the United States.                 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday that Trump hadn’t done a “deep dive” into the views Loomer and Greene hold before congratulating them.                 “The President routinely congratulates people who officially get the Republican nomination for Congress, so he does that as a matter of course,” McEnany said. “He hasn’t done a deep dive into the statements by these two particular women. I don’t know if he’s even seen that. But he supports the Muslim community, he supports the community of faith more broadly in this country.”                 Last week, Trump declined to answer whether he endorses QAnon. When McEnany was asked about that on Wednesday, she said she’d never heard it mentioned at the White House.                 “I’ve never heard of that. There’s a lot of media focus on that but certainly never heard of that from the President,” she said.                 Here’s the thing – Trump has not only given cover to the Loomers and Greenes of the world. He has, and continues to, actively encourage their candidacies and their views.                    Which, yes, is an existential threat to the identity of the broader Republican Party forged over a century and a half. Because if the GOP is willing to not just have Laura Loomer in its ranks but to embrace her – and her radical views – then what, exactly, differentiates it from the conspiracy theorists and anti-Islamic voices of the internet fever swamps?     © 2024 Cable News Network.

In England the latest wave of vitriol criticizes Muslims, blaming them for spreading Covid-19.","Aug 6, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Zamira Rahim,International,"Coronavirus conspiracy theorists have spread baseless rumors online – frequently targeting minorities – since the beginning of the pandemic. In England the latest wave of vitriol criticizes Muslims, blaming them for spreading Covid-19.                 Muslims were caught off guard last week, when the UK government suddenly announced local lockdowns in a slew of areas in northern England where cases have spiked. The announcement came just hours before Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest festivals in Islam.                  The affected areas included Greater Manchester, Burnley, Blackburn with Darwen, Bradford and Leicester – all places with a significant Islamic population according to the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB).                  The restrictions – published late last Thursday evening – banned people in the named areas from mixing with other households.                 Local politicians and Muslim leaders criticized the timing of the announcement.                 “The timing … it focused people’s minds [on Muslims],” Rabnawaz Akbar, a Labour Party councilor in Manchester, told CNN.                 The government “have done it on the eve of Eid,” leading people to think “it must be the Muslim community’s fault,” Akbar said. “You see how people would have come to the assumption. [The government] have done it without thinking but of course, they’re highlighting a particular demographic. And people are angry and now that anger is focused on a particular community.”                 A Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement to CNN: “Decisions on lockdowns are based solely on scientific advice and the latest data. Where there are local outbreaks, our priority will remain taking whatever steps are necessary to protect people.”                 Akbar also criticized Craig Whittaker, a Conservative MP who suggested that England’s ethnic minorities were not adhering to pandemic guidelines.                 “What I have seen in my constituency is that we have areas of our community … that are just not taking the pandemic seriously enough,” Whittaker said Friday, when asked about the local lockdowns during an interview with LBC radio.                 When asked if he was talking about the Muslim population, Whittaker replied: “Of course.”                 “If you look at the areas where we’ve seen rises and cases the vast majority – not, by any stretch of the imagination, all areas – but it is the BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] communities that are not taking it seriously enough,” he added.                 Whittaker’s comments were met with an outcry and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about them at a press briefing on Friday.                 The British leader did not condemn the MP, and said: “Well, I think it’s up to all of us in government to make sure that the message is being heard loud and clear by everybody across the country, and to make sure that everybody is complying with the guidance.”     Related articleThe UK's troubled coronavirus response becomes more complicated             This week, the Downing Street spokesperson told CNN: “At Friday’s press conference the Prime Minister apologized to all those who could not celebrate Eid in the way they had wished, and thanked the work of mosques and imams in getting the message out about the importance of following safety guidance.                 “And he set out in his Eid message that he is hugely grateful to the Muslim community for their efforts and sacrifices throughout this pandemic.”     Tell MAMA, a group which monitors anti-Muslim incidents in the UK, has called on Whittaker to apologize for his comments.                 “To single out one community this way is wholly wrong, stigmatizing and unbecoming of an MP,” the group said in a statement.                 Following the controversy, Whittaker said his evidence was based on data from local officials at Calderdale Council in West Yorkshire.                 “Calderdale Council has not only identified a causal correlation between the locations of a high concentration of our ethnic Asian residents and that of COVID 19 infections, but has also formed the opinion that behaviour in these areas needs to be addressed through engagement in order to reduce the infection rate in these communities,” Whittaker said in a statement on his website.                 “In an age where authenticity is a behaviour scarcely exhibited by public figures, I am glad that I have chosen open, honest and frank discussion over political expediency and … I make no apology for my comments,” he added.                 Tell MAMA director Iman Atta told CNN that far-right extremists had been blaming Muslims for the pandemic since the beginning of the UK’s lockdown in March.                 “In March, April, May, we saw a lot of conspiracy theories floating around,” she said. “The far right were sharing photos of Muslims congregating and flouting the rules at mosques which were, in reality, shut down and not functioning. The photos were from last year,” she said.                 “And they have spread rumors online about how BAME communities are the ones spreading the virus, so [people] should not be interacting with them.”                 Atta’s findings are echoed by those of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which represents several UK mosques and Muslim organizations.                 Earlier in the lockdown “there were theories spreading that Muslims would gather secretly during Ramadan, that mosques were secretly open – none of that was true and there was no evidence,” Zainab Gulamali, a spokesperson for the organization, told CNN.                 Gulamali added that she was disappointed that Johnson and his Conservative Party colleagues had failed to condemn Whittaker’s comments on BAME people.     Related articleThe UK has an Islamophobia problem. Muslims want to know what Boris Johnson is going to do about it             Johnson himself has repeatedly been accused of Islamophobia. He drew sharp rebukes from Muslim communities in 2018 over an article he wrote about Muslim women wearing burqas. The politician said women who wore the veil resembled “letter boxes” and “bank robbers.”                 He later offered a partial apology, saying: “In so far as my words have given offense over the last twenty or thirty years when I’ve been a journalist and people have taken those words out of my articles and escalated them, of course, I am sorry for the offense they have caused.”                 Crime figures suggest that the UK has become a more hostile place for Muslims in recent years. Despite accounting for less than 5% of the UK’s 66 million-strong population, 52% of religious hate crime offenses committed in England and Wales between 2017 and 2018 targeted Muslims.                 Much of the recent blame placed on Muslims appears to be driven by the fact that Covid-19 has hit the country’s ethnic minorities hard.                  According to Public Health England (PHE), those of Bangladeshi heritage who tested positive for coronavirus were twice as likely to die as their white counterparts. PHE found that the discrepancy was caused by a complex of range of factors, including the fact that BAME people were more likely to live in overcrowded and urban areas, and to work in jobs that put them at risk of catching Covid-19.                 In June, an academic paper considered by the government’s scientific advisers warned that an earlier local lockdown in the city of Leicester had caused a rise in racial tension. The city has a large British Asian population.                 “There is extensive racist commentary on social media,” the researchers wrote. “Videos have also been circulated on social media showing the South Asian community flouting social distancing in an attempt to stir conflict.”                 “We don’t want to sweep under the carpet the issues that [Muslim communities] do face,” Rabnawaz Akbar said.                 “A lot of people live in densely-populated terraced housing,” he said, explaining that many Muslims “live with their parents or their grandparents, so you have multigenerational households. A lot of people work in low income and frontline jobs – they’re taxi drivers or health care [workers] … they’re inevitably going to be at risk of catching the virus.”                 “But rather than blame them, the solution is that local and central government should work with the communities to take extra precautions,” he said.                  Muslims are far from alone in shouldering increased racial resentment during the Covid-19 crisis.                  Coronavirus has fueled xenophobia against those of East Asian descent worldwide, and lockdown measures have triggered an explosion of online anti-Semitic hate incidents.                  For many minorities the new threat of the pandemic has only intensified the age-old danger of bigotry.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

My quick answer: Never.,"Jul 18, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,John Blake,International,"I was talking to a Black friend this week about a recent string of anti-Semitic tweets from Black celebrities when he hit me with a question that caught me by surprise.                 “When did Jews become the enemy of Black people?”                 My quick answer: Never.                 You might not know that, however, if you’ve seen a string of anti-Semitic comments from entertainer Nick Cannon, NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson and former NBA player Stephen Jackson. All three later offered apologies for their comments, which evoked the anti-Semitic pronouncements of Minister Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam. The Southern Poverty Law Center has condemned both Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, calling their rhetoric “deeply racist” and “anti-Semitic.”                 The comments by Cannon and the two Jacksons caused a stir and puzzled some who wondered how people who have presumably been victims of racism could voice prejudice towards another minority group. Luminaries such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar wrote a column asking why there wasn’t more outrage over the remarks.                 These stories about supposed Black-Jewish tensions fit a pattern. They hibernate and then re-emerge every couple of years to feed a perception that there is pervasive anti-Semitism in the Black community or some historical “tension” between Black people and Jews.     Related videoStephen Jackson says he used the 'wrong words' in defending DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic posts             But that perception is bogus. No one should let the uninformed musings of a few Black celebrities convince us otherwise. Talk to many people who know the history of both groups and they will tell you the same.                 Ravi Perry, an activist and chairman of the political science department at Howard University, rejects the notion that there is a rising tide of anti-Semitism among Black people or some new tension between the two groups.                 “There is no more prejudice in the Black community around people of the Jewish faith or ethnicity than any other groups,” Perry says. “Just like Black people don’t commit more crimes than White people. Just like Black people aren’t more homophobic than Whites. Black people are not more anti-Semitic than other groups.”                  Here’s some history you won’t hear in any of those misinformed tweets.                  Blacks and Jews share a common history of oppression, said Edward Shapiro, a historian, in an essay, “Blacks and Jews Entangled.”                  “Jews have supposed that they, more than any other group, could and did empathize with the plight of blacks, and that blacks recognized this,” he wrote. “Jewish newspapers early in the twentieth century compared the black movement out of the South to the exodus from Egypt, noted that both blacks and Jews lived in ghettos, and described anti-black riots in the South as pogroms.”                 Contemporary polls suggest that some of that bond remains.     A 2018 survey by the PRRI polling firm said that while 28% of White mainline Protestant and 20% of White evangelical Protestants believe Jewish Americans experience a lot of discrimination, 44% of Black Protestants say Jewish people face a lot of discrimination.

But the survey also found that “a significant number (of African Americans) also draw comparisons to their overcoming struggles as a people and that of the ancient Israelites.”                 Why is this shared history so easily forgotten, even by educated folks?                 Part of the answer can be summed up in one name: Louis Farrakhan.                 You might assume Farrakhan has a large following in the Black community based on the attention he gets. But Farrakhan’s following has long been misunderstood or distorted. No matter how he portrays himself, he has not been widely accepted like an MLK or a Barack Obama. Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to con you.                 I covered Farrakhan at his peak popularity and attended rallies when he could fill a stadium. I sat in on an intimate, two-hour interview with him. And I wrote about the epic 1996 Million Man March.                  But here’s what some people forget. His anti-Semitism was never a huge part of his appeal to Black people. For some, sure. But for most it was his message about self-empowerment, and the way he denounced White racism.                 The media often misses this nuance when talking about the Nation and Farrakhan. There were churches that wouldn’t or couldn’t reach Black men in prison, or didn’t know how to reach young men. But the Nation did – and still does.                  Perry, the political scientist, says a lot of Black people tune out parts of Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, much like they do with other religious leaders.                 “To assume that every Black church member believes everything that their pastor says out of his mouth is ridiculous,” he says, “but that doesn’t mean they’re going to stop going to church.”                 That reasoning is not enough for some Jewish leaders.                 Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, says there is no rising tide of anti-Semitism in the Black community. He talks passionately about the history of Blacks and Jews working together for justice.                 “I have no doubt that there are some people who tune out the anti-Semitism and hatred and focus on other elements of what the Nation of Islam portends to speak about,” he said. “But picking and choosing is easy for people who are not impacted by the hate.”                 He says Jews need more Black people to stand up to Farrakhan.                  “Some folks in the Jewish community are asking themselves when do we know an apology is sincere after somebody makes an anti-Semitic statement?” he says. “It’s when individuals hold Farrakhan accountable for his hate. That will be a sign of progress.”                 Here might be another sign of progress.                 When people think about relations between Blacks and Jews, I hope one day more will think not of Nick Cannon or DeSean Jackson but of these three names: James Earl Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman.                 They were young men – one Black and two Jewish – who were murdered together in Mississippi in the summer of 1964 while trying to register Black people to vote.                 There is a soul-crushing photograph of their three bodies, twisted and tangled together where they were buried in a deserted earthen dam. They died for one another, and with one another.                 That photo may no longer command the news cycle, but no ill-considered comments on social media should ever eclipse what it represents.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Aishah, who asked to be identified only by her first name out of fear for her safety, is being represented by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MN), which filed a charge to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights on Monday.                 The 19-year-old, who wears a hijab, a headscarf worn by Muslim women, told CNN she felt singled out for her religious beliefs after seeing “ISIS” – the acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a terrorist group known for its radical beliefs and violence – on her cup. It’s unclear if ISIS was written in all caps on the cup.                 “The moment I saw it, I was overwhelmed with a lot of emotions,” Aishah said. “I felt belittled and so humiliated. This is a word that shatters the Muslim reputation all over the world. I cannot believe that in this day and age, something like this can be considered acceptable. It isn’t okay.”                 The incident occurred on July 1, at the St. Paul-Midway Target Starbucks, Aishah said. She said she also was wearing a face mask, because of the ongoing pandemic, but said she repeated her name to the barista. She didn’t spell it out.                 “When she asked for my name, I slowly repeated it multiple times,” she said. “There is absolutely no way she could have heard it as ISIS. Aishah is not an unknown name and I repeated it multiple times.”                 The employee claimed to Aishah at the time that she had not heard the name correctly, according to the discrimination charge, a copy of which was obtained by CNN.     Related articleA Muslim woman says her headscarf was forcibly removed from her head for a booking photo after being arrested at a Black Lives Matter protest             After requesting to speak to the barista’s supervisor, Aishah told CNN her “concerns were dismissed” and that she was given a new drink and a $25 Starbucks gift card before being escorted from the premises by security officers, according to the charge.                 The supervisor told Aishah that mistakes sometimes happen with customers’ names, the charge states.                 CAIR-MN is calling for the firing of the two Target Starbucks employees involved in the incident.                 Aishah said she immediately filed a formal complaint to Target and has yet to receive a response. Target did not immediately respond to CNN’s request regarding Aishah’s formal complaint.                 However, in an email statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Target said the retailer wants “everyone who shops with us to feel welcomed, valued and respected and we strictly prohibit discrimination and harassment in any form. We are very sorry for this guest’s experience at our store and immediately apologized to her when she made our store leaders aware of the situation.”                 “We have investigated the matter and believe that it was not a deliberate act but an unfortunate mistake that could have been avoided with a simple clarification,” the spokesperson said. “We’re taking appropriate actions with the team member, including additional training, to ensure this does not occur again.”                 Starbucks declined to comment on the incident. A spokesperson for Starbucks told CNN by phone that this Starbucks is located inside a Target, meaning it is entirely run and operated by Target.                 Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-MN, said labeling someone who is Muslim as “ISIS” is “perhaps the most Islamophobic statement you can make towards a Muslim.”                  “The statement that came out from Target is just unfortunate,” Hussein told CNN. “Now we know this is a bigger issue than a simple misunderstanding, because the entire corporation is apologizing for Islamophobia without taking action.”                 Hussein said CAIR-MN has also asked Target “to launch another thorough investigation that involves Aishah and to train their employees on Islamophobia and bigotry.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Hisham al-Hashimi, 47, appeared frequently on local and foreign media outlets as an analyst, especially during Iraq’s battle against ISIS.                 He was also an expert voice on Iraqi politics and Shiite extremist groups and had served as an adviser to previous Iraqi governments                 Al-Hashimi died in Ibn Al-Nafees Hospital in Baghdad after he was seriously wounded during the attack, Maan said.                 The motive behind his assassination is so far unclear, but similar targeted killings were frequent during the height of Iraq’s sectarian war.                 Al-Hashimi was a vocal critic of Iraq’s political elite and discussed corruption in the country on his social media accounts. He appeared to have tweeted moments before he was killed, in a post about the sectarian and ethnic divisions in Iraqi politics.                 News of his death shocked many in the Middle East and beyond.                 The European Union’s Ambassador to Iraq Martin Huth tweeted: “Together with his family and friends, we mourn the death of Dr Husham Al-Hashimi. The perpetrators of this heinous crime must be brought to justice!”                 The UK’s Ambassador to Iraq Stephen Hickey tweeted “Devastated and deeply saddened by the news of the killing of Husham Al Hashimi. Iraq has lost one of its very best- a thoughtful and brave man. These attacks cannot continue. The government – supported by the international community – must hold the perpetrators to account.”     Devastated and deeply saddened by the news of the killing of Husham Al Hashimi.

Islamophobia is a pernicious disease. It does not belong in the halls of government,” Biden’s statement reads. “As President, I will appoint individuals who represent the values of our nation and respect all racial, ethnic and religious communities.”                 Retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, who was nominated to become the under secretary of defense for policy, has a history of making Islamophobic and inflammatory remarks against prominent Democratic politicians, CNN’s KFile reported in June. Tata is a frequent guest on Fox News and ardent defender of President Donald Trump.      Related articleTop Pentagon nominee pushed conspiracy theories that former CIA director tried to overthrow Trump and even have him assassinated             In several tweets from 2018, Tata said that Islam was the “most oppressive violent religion I know of” and claimed former President Barack Obama was a “terrorist leader” who did more to harm the US “and help Islamic countries than any president in history.” Following the publication of KFile’s initial story, Tata deleted several of his tweets, screenshots of which were captured by KFile. In one radio appearance, Tata also speculated that the Iran deal was born out of Obama’s “Islamic roots” in an attempt “to help Iranians and the greater Islamic state crush Israel.”                 Tata also spread conspiracy theories that former CIA director John Brennan tried to overthrow Trump and even have him assassinated.                 If confirmed by the Senate, Tata would become the third highest official in the Pentagon overseeing the Defense Department’s policy shop, including its national security and defense strategy, nuclear deterrence and missile defense policy, and security cooperation plans and policies.                  CNN obtained a letter Tata sent to the top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee apologizing for his past Islamophobic tweets.                   “I deeply regret comments I made on social media several years ago,” he wrote, adding that his “tweets were completely out of character.”                 The White House has stood by Tata.                 “Anthony Tata, the President’s exceptionally qualified nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, is a distinguished public servant whose career has provided him with planning, policy, and operational experience both at home and abroad,” White House spokesman Judd Deere told CNN in an email. “His education, background, and record has earned him bi-partisan praise, and this attempt by the media to slander his reputation is disgusting. The White House stands by the President’s qualified nominee.”                 Mark Kevin Lloyd, who was appointed to be a religious freedom adviser to USAID, shared a post in June 2016 calling Islam “a barbaric cult,” according to a 2016 Associated Press report. Lloyd also perpetuated a conspiracy theory and said Obama was aiding the Iranian nuclear program as part of his ” ‘final solution’ to the Israel problem,” a phrase that evoked the Holocaust, AP reported. Lloyd declined to talk to AP at the time, citing his nondisclosure agreement with the Trump campaign. He was working as a Virginia field director for the Trump presidential campaign at the time.                  On Monday, several Democrats in the House of Representatives sent a letter to USAID urging the agency to rescind its appointment of Lloyd.                  “Far from an isolated incident of poor judgement, Mr. Lloyd’s behavior openly and frequently displays his contempt for a religion that counts nearly two billion followers, and constitutes the second largest religion in the world,” the letter reads. It was signed by the first two Muslim women in Congress, Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, as well as Reps. Joaquin Castro of Texas, Adriano Espaillat of New York, David Trone of Maryland and Al Green of Texas.                  “He does not represent the values of our country, and he should not be in a position to betray our nation’s constitutional promise of religious freedom,” the letter reads.

As demonstrations and debates about Britain’s colonial legacy sweep the country, 58% of Black Britons said they think Johnson’s party is “institutionally racist.” A substantial minority of White people, 39%, said they believed the same.                 The findings highlight a major challenge for Johnson, who has been accused of making racist comments in past newspaper articles, as he battles to retain public confidence in his administration amid the coronavirus pandemic and burgeoning Black Lives Matter protests.                 Ministers have repeatedly urged people not to attend public protests, citing a ban on large gatherings enacted to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and have also condemned the forced removal of a statue of a slave trader in the southwest of England city of Bristol. Johnson also said through his spokesperson earlier this month that he “does not agree that this is a racist country,” leading to allegations that he does not grasp the scale of racism in Britain.                 The results of CNN’s poll are released on the third national Windrush Day, which was established to commemorate the men and women from the Caribbean who arrived in Britain to help rebuild the country in the years that followed World War II.                  Some members of this Windrush generation – named after the ship that brought one of the earliest groups of Caribbean migrants to the UK in 1948 – were wrongly deported from the UK when they could not provide paperwork that proved their right to remain, resulting in a political scandal in 2018. The then Prime Minister, Theresa May, when she was Home Secretary between 2010 and 2016, described the measures as designed to create a “hostile environment” for people who were in the UK illegally.                 In CNN’s poll, 55% of Black people said they did not have faith in the UK government to prevent a similar scandal from occurring again, while 38% said they did. The figures were virtually reversed for White Britons – 55% trusted the government to avoid another scandal, while 39% did not.                 A Home Office spokesperson told CNN that the department is “considering the findings of the Windrush Lessons Learned review because we want to begin a new chapter.”  Home Secretary Priti Patel is likely to give a formal response to that review before the summer.                 “The Home Secretary has been clear that the mistreatment of the Windrush generation by successive governments was completely unacceptable and she will right those wrongs,” the Home Office added. “12,000 people now have documentation proving their statements and we are making more compensation payments week on week.”                 The Conservative Party has long battled allegations of racism, which have flared up on several occasions in its postwar history. A deeply anti-immigrant polemic known as the “Rivers of Blood” speech by the Conservative MP Enoch Powell in 1968, race riots in the 1980s under the prime ministership of Margaret Thatcher, and the more recent Windrush fiasco have all dented the party’s image among Black and minority ethnic groups.                  A spokesperson for the party told CNN: “We’re proud to be a party that champions and supports opportunity for all, of all races, religions and backgrounds. Prejudice and discrimination have no place in the Conservative Party and we will never stand by when it comes to abuse of any kind.”     Related articleTens of thousands of Britons have died from coronavirus. But Boris Johnson is stoking a culture war.             Last week, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a commission to examine racial inequalities in the UK. But the reported involvement of a Downing Street aide in setting up the commission has too proved controversial; critics say Munira Mirza is unsuited to the task because she has previously denied that widespread racism exists in the UK, writing in 2017 that she believed institutional racism was “a myth.” Downing Street has said the membership of the commission had yet to be decided.                 Johnson’s own views on race and religion have also dogged him. In a newspaper column in 2018, he described Muslim women who wear face veils as resembling “letterboxes” and “bankrobbers.” In 2002 he called people from the British Commonwealth “flag-waving piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles.” Johnson has said the quotes have been taken out of context.                  Savanta ComRes surveyed 1,535 British adults for CNN earlier this month about their views towards race relations in the UK. The findings, which laid bare public perceptions towards racism in several aspects of British life, make difficult reading for both of the country’s major parties.                 Around a third of both Black and White respondents said they believed the opposition Labour Party to be institutionally racist. The party has been dogged by frequent allegations of anti-Semitism within its ranks, which peaked during the period under its previous leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Labour’s new leader, Keir Starmer, has pledged to stamp out anti-Semitism in the party.                 Although the poll did not ask specifically about anti-Semitism, the broader findings on racism demonstrates the scale of the challenge Starmer faces. A Labour spokesperson said Starmer had “set out steps to rebuild trust and confidence in Labour on the issue of racism,” including “a number of internal measures aimed at ensuring the party embodies the values it stands for.”                 Thousands have protested against racial inequality in the UK throughout June, in a wave of activism prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in the United States on May 25.                  The demonstrations have sparked a national conversation about Britain’s colonial legacy, much of which has centered around the question of whether statues of slave traders should remain standing in British cities. © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/white-christians-racism-robert-jones/index.html,This is a moment of reckoning on race for White Christians,"In a new book, Robert P. Jones says the theology developed in many churches in America blinds White Christians to racial injustice.","Jun 20, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Daniel Burke,International,"Growing up in the South, Robert P. Jones attended Southern Baptist churches, Sunday schools, even a Southern Baptist college.                  But it was only in seminary, in his mid-20s, that Jones says he learned the full truth about Southern Baptists’ white supremacist roots. The denomination was founded to defend slavery and did not formally rebuke its past until 1995, when Southern Baptists voted to apologize for their history of racism.                 Jones was a social scientist before he realized how stubbornly racist ideas can persist in White churches.                  “White Christian churches have not just been complacent; they have not only been complicit,” he writes in his book, “White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity,” publishing next month.                 “Rather, as the dominant cultural power in America, they have been responsible for constructing and sustaining a project to protect White supremacy and resist Black equality,” he writes. “This project has framed the entire American story.”                 In the book Jones, CEO and founder of Public Religion Research Institute, blends church history, memoir and contemporary public opinion surveys. Together, they make a clear and compelling case for why White American Christians need to reckon with their past.                   But American Christianity’s past is only part of the problem.                  In survey after survey, said Jones, contemporary white Christians repeatedly deny that structural racism is a problem, that shootings of unarmed Blacks are not isolated incidents, or even that African Americans still face racism and discrimination.                  White non-Christians, on the other hand, more often agree with Blacks about racial discrimination, according to public opinion surveys.                   So what gives? Why would White Christians be more reluctant to see racism than their non-Christian counterparts?                  If that’s the question that animates “White Too Long,” the answer will be challenging, if not deeply unsettling for many White Christians.                  CNN spoke to Jones recently about why so many White Christians turn a blind eye to racism, how white supremacy took hold of American culture and what Christians can do now to make amends.     What prompted you to write this book?              Whenever we asked questions about race or African Americans there was a huge gap between Whites who are Christian and those who are not. Whites who are not Christian were always closer to the attitudes of African Americans.                  Seeing that pattern over and over made me realize that something deeper is going on. And coupled with my own experience of growing up in the South and this current moment, I realized that these issues are not being dealt with well. Most White Christians try to ignore them.      To that point, it seems like more White evangelicals than we’ve seen in the past are speaking out against the recent killings of Black Americans by the police and vigilantes. Joel Osteen, who is often studiously apolitical, marched in a Black Lives Matter protest. Some evangelicals are even mentioning systemic racism, which they’ve been slow to acknowledge in the past. What do you make of their responses?              One measure of authenticity for White Christians is whether they link reconciliation with justice and repair. It’s easy for a White Christain leader to jump in a march and put his arm around an African-American pastor. But will we see Joel Osteen preach a sermon calling for White Christians to reflect on the ugly parts of our history? Are pastors going to help White Christians free their faith from privileged claims of whiteness?                  One of the challenges, historically, has been that the Christian theology developed in White churches intentionally blinds White Christians to racial injustice. White Christians are nearly twice as likely as non-religious Americans to say police shootings of unarmed black men are isolated incidents. That is a moral and theological problem.     We’ve heard some Christian leaders denounce racism in clear moral terms, but that doesn’t seem to filter down to the pews, according to surveys. And that’s a problem not only for White evangelicals but Catholics and others, right?              Yes, that’s true not only for evangelicals but Catholics and the more liberal mainline Protestant leaders. They’ve put out a number of statements and press releases, but historically they have not landed at the parish or congregational level. And that’s where theology gets built: at the local level.                  The hymns sung, the scripture passages preached, how people understand salvation, none of that has been deconstructed. It was all built for a world in which White Christians needed to shield their institutions and beliefs from claims of injustice by African Americans.                  You can see that in the way Black Catholics were forced to sit in the back of the church and receive Communion last, and in the way the Southern and Northern branches of Methodism realigned after the Civil War but still didn’t admit Black churches as equal members.      Why have so many White Christians been so slow to recognize the racism in their past, as well as the racism that continues in America?              As long as White supremacy has a hold on our culture, it’s pretty comfortable for White Christian churches to say their theology is about personal salvation and personal lives. Theology has been constricted to be only about personal piety, disconnected from claims of social justice. Everything outside of salvation has been labeled “politics.”                  It’s a self-protective move. If you read sermons in Mississippi in the 1950s and 1960s you would have no idea that there was a Civil Rights movement. It was a lulling of white consciences to sleep.      But what about now, this moment?              I see the last four years as a moment of reckoning for White Christians. The election of President Trump, who has put White supremacy front and center, has brought these issues from just barely below the surface into plain view. Charlottesville changed things. Charleston changed things. Dylan Roof was a confirmed Lutheran, who, in his journal while imprisoned has been drawing crosses and white Jesus and is completely unrepentant.                 White Christians have inherited a worldview that has Christians on top of other religions, men over women, Whites over Blacks. There is a top-down authoritarian structure to it.      What, if anything, can change that?             In the book, I write about two Baptist churches in Macon, Georgia, one White and one Black, who have built trust and a partnership in a way that allowed White Christians to be challenged about their assumptions.

Retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, a frequent guest on Fox News and ardent defender of President Donald Trump, was nominated to become the under secretary of defense for policy.                  If confirmed by the Senate, Tata would become the third highest official in the Pentagon overseeing the Defense Department’s policy shop, including its national security and defense strategy, nuclear deterrence and missile defense policy, and security cooperation plans and policies. The policy chief also closely advises the secretary of defense on national security and supports the Department of Defense’s program and budget decisions.                  In several tweets from 2018, Tata said that Islam was the “most oppressive violent religion I know of” and claimed Obama was a “terrorist leader” who did more to harm the US “and help Islamic countries than any president in history.” Following the publication of this story, Tata deleted several of his tweets, screenshots of which were captured by CNN’s KFile.                 Tata, in one radio appearance, speculated the Iran deal was born out of Obama’s “Islamic roots” in an attempt “to help Iranians and the greater Islamic state crush Israel.”                 Tata also lashed out at prominent Democratic politicians and the media on Twitter, such as California Reps. Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, who he said “have always been the same violent extremists.” In another tweet, Tata called Waters a “vicious race baiting racist.” He used a hashtag in a different tweet that insinuated CNN anchor Don Lemon was on “the liberal plantation.”                  The White House’s nomination of Tata on Thursday comes after the February ouster of Pentagon policy chief John Rood, who warned against withholding military aid to Ukraine last year, as the White House moves to install loyalists and prominent Trump defenders across the administration.                  Tata is a regular defender of the President and his policy decisions, including Trump’s intervention in the war crimes case of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher that forced Navy Secretary Richard Spencer to resign.                  Tata did not respond to a request for comment. A Pentagon spokeswoman referred questions about Tata to the White House. Spokespeople for the White House did not respond to requests for comment.                  The retired general currently works as a senior adviser in the Department of Defense, and previously served for 28 years in the Army before retiring in 2009. An Army investigation conducted in 2007 found he committed adultery with at least two women – a crime under military law – and falsified a legal document, according to The News and Observer. The Army declined to penalize Tata, and Tata provided his military records to the News and Observer, which showed glowing reviews from his tenure.                  After his tenure in the Army, Tata worked as the chief operating officer for District of Columbia Public School district from 2009 to 2011 and later as the superintendent of Wake County’s public schools in North Carolina from 2011 to 2012. Later, he served as North Carolina’s transportation secretary. Tata is also the author of a dozen military adventure books and is best known for his “Threat” series.                  In 2018, Tata falsely said Obama was a “Muslim” and a “terrorist” while on Twitter, writing “Obama normalized Islam for America.”                  After a Twitter user wrote to him that “Obama was not a terrorist sympathizer,” Tata replied, “No he was just a terrorist leader,” adding in another tweet, “He gave $150B to #1 state sponsor of terror so they could destroy Israel.”                 The Obama administration did not give $150 billion to Iran. The deal, which was approved by six countries and the European Union, gave Iran access to its own frozen assets and it’s unclear how much those assets were worth.                  In another Twitter engagement, Tata reiterated that Obama was a terrorist because of his dealings with Iran, noting that the only joke was that it was considered a conspiracy theory.                  “I was joking! Of course it’s not a conspiracy theory. He did more to harm US vital interests and help Islamic countries than any president in history. The Iran deal alone is more than enough evidence of his drive to subvert US national interests to Islam and a globalist agenda,” Tata wrote.                  In a follow-up tweet, Tata wrote Obama “is a Muslim who got other countries involved via corporate greed to support a regime (Mullahs) that sponsors anti West hatred and violence using money US unfroze or gave. He made no secret of his belief that a weaker America made for a stronger world.” After a user said there was no evidence that Obama was a Muslim, Tata replied, “Other than him saying he is, no.”                 Obama has written extensively about his Christian faith and has never claimed to be a Muslim.                 Tata made similar comments about Obama while appearing on radio programs in 2017 and 2018.                 During a radio appearance from 2018, Tata called Obama an anti-Semite who wanted to give Iran money so the country could fund terrorist organizations, and that unlike Obama, Trump wanted to defeat ISIS.                  “The reason Obama did that was he wanted nothing to impact his Iran nuclear deal because what he wanted was Iran to be flushed with cash so that they could support Hezbollah and Hamas and their fight against Israel because Obama is an anti-Semite,” said Tata. “That was all of the machinations of the Obama administration and he gave birth to ISIS and he also allowed what weapons of mass destruction to use in the Middle East. And so President Trump is simply allowing us to defeat ISIS now which Obama did not want to happen.”                 In a radio appearance from March 2017, Tata said Obama “really disliked Israel” and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and speculated that the Iran deal was born “sorta from [Obama’s] Islamic roots to help Iranians and the greater Islamic state crush Israel.”                 “I think President Obama really disliked Israel and [I] know he disliked Netanyahu. I think this was in part, you know, sorta from his Islamic roots to help the Iranians and the greater Islamic state crush Israel,” said Tata on the radio show. “If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s probably a duck. And so that was what Obama did. He propped up our enemies and the Islamic world, and he undercut Netanyahu in Israel.”                  In addition to disparaging Obama, Tata also criticized Democratic politicians who have vocally criticized Trump, including Waters and Pelosi in June 2018, after Waters called for people to confront and harass Trump Cabinet members in response to families being separated at the southern border.                 Tata wrote that Waters and Pelosi, the Financial Services Committee chairwoman and House speaker, respectively, “have always been the same violent extremists” and that Trump threatened their election prospects.                  In another tweet from June 2018, Tata called Waters a “vicious race baiting racist who made her chops by fanning the flames of LA Riots after the Rodney King incident. Doubtful she’ll change from what has always worked for her and made her a multimillionaire. Media is scared to touch that third rail so she’ll keep on going.”                  Tata also used a racist hashtag against CNN’s Lemon. In April 2018, Tata tweeted his support for then-Fox News personalities Diamond and Silk as they demanded a retraction from Lemon after he played clips of the duo testifying in front of Congress.                  “Have to love #northcarolina ladies @DiamondandSilk calling out @donlemon #liberalplantation #MAGA,” tweeted Tata.     This story has been updated to reflect that Tata deleted several of his tweets after the publication of this report.   CNN’s Ryan Browne contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/health/vicarious-racism-wellness/index.html,Vicarious racism: You don’t have to be the target to be harmed,"Police brutality on video, flame and riots on our smartphones. You don’t have to be the victim of racism to be harmed by it, experts say.","May 31, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Sandee LaMotte,International,"Watching the unsettling video of George Floyd crying out for his mother while gasping for air made Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, “relive her son’s death.”             Put in a choke hold by a New York City police officer in 2014, Garner’s cry of “I can’t breathe,” became a symbol of the Black Lives Matter protest movement.                 Six years later, flame and smoke fill the night skies in cities across America as protestors demand justice for Floyd, the unarmed and handcuffed black man in Minneapolis who died after gasping “I can’t breathe” as a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck.     More recent video shows as many as three officers may have held him down.                 “No matter what he did, he wasn’t doing anything to threaten them, so why would they kill that young man? Just like they killed my son,” Carr told CNN on Wednesday.                 “I don’t condone violence, but I understand it,” said Carr days later, speaking out about the fires, looting and destruction happening in cities like Atlanta, Denver, Milwaukee and Minneapolis. Protests, some peaceful, others violent, have spread to at least 30 cities nationwide.                 “When something like this happens you just combust, everything just comes out,” Carr said.                 Angry demonstrators point to Floyd’s death as yet another example of brutal, systemic racism that has led to the recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home, and Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February.                  Witnessing acts of racism via video, radio or social media can produce fear, anger and outrage, but even those who don’t take to the streets can experience significant emotional distress.                 Experts call it “vicarious racism.” You don’t have to be the victim to be harmed.                 “I think of it as like a secondhand racism, similar to secondhand smoke,” said Chicago pediatrician Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the minority health, equity and inclusion committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics.                  “Even though you’re not the one to smoke or in this case to directly experience racism, you still might experience the negative health impacts,” she said.     Studies show that race-related stress is a significantly more powerful risk factor for poor mental health than stressful life events. It can contribute to anxiety disorders and depression. It can also impact heart rate, raise blood pressure and create chronically elevated levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, which can in turn lead to cardiovascular disorders and diseases.                 “Some people think only black and brown folks who see themselves as potential victims will identify and experience health impacts,” Heard-Garris said.                  “But we have data that shows despite color, if a person is exposed to racism, it hurts them too. It really actually hurts all of us.”                 There’s no doubt that African American and Latino families carry the biggest burden from systemic racism and police brutality.                  Black Americans are nearly three times more likely than are white Americans to be killed by police and five times more likely than white Americans to be killed unarmed, according to the Mapping Police Violence database, which has tracked police killings in the USA since 2013.     A study last year found nearly 40,000 of 103,710 black Americans – more than one-third –had been exposed to one or more police killings of unarmed black Americans in their state of residence in a three-month period prior to the survey. Feelings of stress, depression and problems with emotions increasedwith each additional killing.                 A 2018 Pew Research Center report found nearly four in 10 Latinos say they have been called offensive names or experienced discrimination or unfair treatment because they are Hispanic. Feelings of racial discrimination can lead to higher levels of psychological distress, suicidal thoughts, anxiety and depression, according to the American Psychological Association.                  Heard-Garris studies the impact of vicarious racism on health, especially children’s health. She says observing racism in the media or hearing about it from friends may transmit trauma to children as they imagine their parents, siblings or even themselves in place of the target.                 She published a systematic analysis of some 1,300 studies and found kids that experienced vicarious racism were more likely to have low self-esteem, use illicit substances, and suffer with anxiety and depressive symptoms.     Related articleHow do I make sure I'm not raising a white racist child?             “The biggest kind of health impacts are the behavioral health issues,” Heard-Garris said. “Some kids will show aggression and other negative behaviors. Others will go within and be socially withdrawn, be distant from others and not seek help when they really need it.”                 Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP’s statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health, points to images on social media that show young children at the protests happening around the country holding up signs “fearing they may be next.”                 “It’s going to have an impact on any child’s physical and emotion health,” Dougé said. “So we need to turn it off and really engage with our kids and make sure that they’re okay.”                 The same applies to adults who’ve seen agonizing images such as George Floyd’s arrest and death, and now feel fear, frustration or rage.                 “We also need to tune in to our own emotions as adults and check that we’re OK,” Dougé said. “And if we’re not OK, then we got to ask for help. We’ve got to get help to deal with the trauma and emotional impact of these images.”                 But adults also have a responsibility to stop the cycle of racism and violence, said Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website “Raising Equity” provides videos and resources on how people can cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids.                 “Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,” Banks said. “And if a person hasn’t done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.”                 It’s time to speak up and call racism what it is, Dougé said.                 “If as a human being, you understand that another human being debased, dehumanized and not treated like you are just because of the color of their skin, I think it’s important to feel something. I think is important to acknowledge privilege,” Dougé said.                 “I think it’s important to ask what am I not doing by being silent that perpetuates this? How do we open the door so that everyone sits at the table? That’s only done when each of us understands that we have the power to do that.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/world/religion-medicine-coronavirus-wellness-levin/index.html,When religion is dangerous for your health,"Scholar Jeff Levin says religion can heal and harm people, and we’re seeing both aspects play out during the pandemic.","May 1, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Daniel Burke,International,"The coronavirus pandemic has brought out the best and worst aspects of religion.                  Faith has inspired countless acts of generosity and goodwill while helping believers get through an extraordinarily scary and difficult time.                  But some believers, from Christians to Hasidic Jews, have flouted social-distancing guidelines, insisting that God will protect their congregation. And as in previous pandemics, some have gone looking for scapegoats to explain why God would allow such immense suffering.                 Jeff Levin, an epidemiologist and observant Jew who comes from a long line of esteemed rabbis, has studied – and lived at – the intersection of medicine and religion for decades.                  The Baylor University professor’s new book, “Religion and Medicine: A History of the Encounter Between Humanity’s Two Greatest Institutions,” is a comprehensive and fascinating look at the complex relationship between spirituality and healing.                  CNN spoke to Levin this week about how religion can both heal and harm, and how we’re seeing both aspects play out during the pandemic.      CNN: The way you write about the relationship between religion and medicine – how close they were at first and how far apart they seem now – made me think of a bitter divorce.             Levin: That’s a really good analogy. You can’t really tell the history of medicine without the history of religion and vice versa. Concerns about the healing of people go back to the origins of religion, and religions have been involved in the training of healers of both body and mind. As this relationship has evolved, we’ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly.      How are we seeing that relationship play out during this pandemic?              Faith is a positive force when it motivates people to think outside of themselves and be of service. When it makes people strike out at others and look for demons to blame, it’s doing a great disservice. Honestly, we have seen both. There are terrible messages from the pulpit warning about Chinese immigrants and, on the other side, some people are acting incredibly compassionately and ethically.      You point out that Jews were scapegoated during the Black Plague in Europe. We’re seeing some of that happen now with Asian Americans. Why is this idea so persistent?             People need to lash out, to have someone to blame when they feel that God has abandoned them. They think it must be someone else’s fault. I’m disappointed that more clergy and pastors aren’t speaking out about what’s going on. Some are making statements, but this to me is a social-justice teaching moment for people of faith. In any community where this kind of bigotry is going on it’s incumbent on the pastors to say something. If some of their congregants don’t like it, tough sh*t. At a certain point, you have to be bold.      At the same time, surveys point to an uptick in people’s reliance on their religion. It seems like faith is playing some sort of therapeutic role for many of us right now.             Yes, people are shut in their homes and looking for something to do, to feel better and not be in a reactive state all the time. And religion, in the broadest sense, can help people attain positive states of well-being. Religion is having this applied function that maybe is not always at the forefront of how people engage spirituality. The usual way is to think about it once a week and try to be a good person. Now it seems more vital, more personal, more urgent.      I wonder how long that will last. With past pandemics, did people’s reliance on religion wane as the contagion was contained?              I’ve read stuff saying that this pandemic will lead to a religious renaissance or another great awakening. On the other hand, I am cynical that there will be some scandal or a naked selfie and people will leave all this behind and be back to the same old mindlessness. Looking at past pandemics, like the Spanish Flu outbreak in 1918, once it was over it was really out of sight, out of mind. It wasn’t really talked about. And 100 million people lost their lives!      How did religious people respond to the Spanish Flu? Was there a surge in spirituality?             Absolutely. I think you could draw a direct line between that outbreak, combined with World War I, and the rebirth of modern millennialism. That is, an obsession with the Tribulation and Rapture that was not very visible before that. The beginning of End Times ministries came out of that outbreak and has remained in the public consciousness.      Some governors have labeled houses of worship essential services, others have not. Are they essential, in your opinion?             Well, on the one hand, I do believe that religious services are “essential,” in an existential sense. But this is an exceptional time that we are in and there are life-and-death considerations involved. So it seems prudent to be extra careful, lest our religious gatherings become vectors to propagate transmission of a pathogenic and virulent virus. Zoom and other platforms can work just fine for now in keeping communities of faith linked together virtually. Pastors who are violating restriction orders are possibly endangering the most vulnerable of their congregants. Do they really think that a loving God wants them to do something so foolish?     You write about Jesus’ healing ministry in your book. I wonder if some of the conservative resistance to medicine might be rooted in the idea that Jesus will heal them, too, so they don’t need vaccinations or doctors?             It’s fascinating to me that people would think that seeking medical care is somehow disobedient to God. Almost like it’s blasphemous. It’s bizarre. For Jews, one of the ways that God heals is by providing men and women of science who can help keep us well. I don’t think there’s anything implicit within Christianity to not seek medical care because of Jesus. I have heard during this outbreak some people say, “Jesus is my vaccine.” Well, OK, I can be respectful of that, but at the same time you need to not congregate with hundreds of people in a room.      What do you make of the Pew Center study that showed pretty wide gaps between Christians and atheists/agnostics in their approach to triage – specifically, who should get ventilators?             The Pew findings are provocative and ring true to me. I find them unsurprising, but as a religious believer I also find them troubling. (In the study, most religious people said ventilators in short supply should go to patients who need them most in the moment; while most non-religious people said they should go to patients with the highest chance of recovery.)                  In my opinion, utilitarian calculus doesn’t have a place in this kind of decision-making. We are morally beholden to respond to people in need when they present themselves to us, without attempting to parse which life is more or less valuable or worthy. There’s a very slippery slope from there to the totalitarian impulse to value some lives over others for reasons of political calculation.      Who has a bigger role determining morality in the medical field right now, religion or science?             I think it’s the goal of many secular scientists and organizations to push religious considerations completely out of the picture when it comes to determining what is or isn’t morally acceptable. This is a dangerous gambit. Without a gold standard of behavior, in the end anything goes. Sanctity of life can give way to political expediency or some other fashion.                  This isn’t a right-vs.-left thing; it’s about how we go about deciding what we should do and why and whether there are any eternal values that should govern these decisions. This conflict especially presents itself to us now in bioethics, where harsh and impersonal technological advances are driving the bus and leaving humanity and compassion out of the doctor-patient relationship.      Religion can heal, as the studies in your book show. It seems equally evident, though, that religion can kill, too.              Of course. Throughout history, personal faith and religious institutions have been a great force for good, motivating selfless behavior and compassion and magnificent works of service to others. At the same time, religious institutions and leaders have been sources of divisiveness and hate, and religious movements have existed throughout history which have targeted outsiders for destruction. Thousands of studies by now have shown that expressions of religious faith or spirituality are associated, on average, with all kinds of benefits for our well-being — less depression, less anxiety, even longevity in some studies. And sociologists and psychologists and economists and political scientists have documented the other ways that religion or faith has impacted humanity for the good.                  But at the same time, so many people have been harmed by religion. Emotionally abused, disfellowshipped or rejected, unfairly judged, left feeling diminished rather than uplifted. It’s hard to convince some people that religion is intrinsically a positive force when they experience themselves or their loved ones being abused or tortured or even killed in the name of religion. Honestly, religion isn’t a single unitary thing, and it’s not all good or all bad. It’s better thought of as a domain or dimension of life – a vessel that can be filled up with goodness that can nurture and comfort and even heal but can also be filled with sludge and sickness that can do vile things to people and ruin lives.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Naseerudin, 44, had gone to pick up some vegetables from his friend’s house in Humnabad, in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, when he says an officer stopped him on his scooter.                  Other vehicles were on the road, Naseerudin says – he believes he was stopped because of his religion.                 “I am an Imam, so I look and dress very Muslim. I also have a long beard,” he says. “The cop started hitting me and saying that it is because of me and my community that this disease is spreading.”                 Nagesh D L, police superintendent of Bidar district where Humnabad is located, says the officer has been suspended while an inquiry was conducted into the incident. Naseerudin says he called the police from hospital to make a statement, but Nagesh claims they did not receive any complaint.     Related article'They brought batons inside the mosque': Victims recount Delhi's worst sectarian violence in decades             Naseerudin is not alone. As fears of a widespread coronavirus outbreak mount in India, some of the country’s Muslims, who make up roughly 200 million of the country’s 1.3 billion population, have been targeted in Islamophobic attacks on the streets and online, and accused of spreading the virus.                 In the capital, New Delhi, for example, volunteers distributing ration kits to Muslim families say they face harassment from police and are scared to go out. In Punjab, Muslim milk producers say they have been threatened by villagers, their houses have been raided by police, and people are scared to buy their produce.                 At the center of the recent Islamophobia is a gathering of a conservative Muslim missionary group in New Delhi in mid-March, and led to a large, highly publicized cluster of coronavirus cases.                 While these incidents have been mostly isolated, the virus fears are only amplifying existing prejudices, playing into growing Hindu nationalism which in recent years has seen India’s Muslim societies increasingly marginalized.                 Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was reelected in a landslide victory last year, many Indian Muslims say his emphasis on empowering India’s Hindu majority has left them feeling like second-class citizens in their own country.                  Under Modi, the majority-Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir has been stripped of its autonomous status, nearly two million people in India’s northeast Assam state, which shares a long border with Muslim-majority Bangladesh, were left off a controversial new National Register of Citizens, which critics feared could be used to justify religious discrimination against Muslims there, and a divisive new law has been enacted which gives Indian citizenship to asylum seekers from three neighboring countries – but not if they are Muslim.                 In February, that same law, which critics say is an example of the government’s Hindu nationalist agenda, sparked deadly clashes in the capital.                  It was in that environment that a Muslim group’s gathering became a focus of India’s coronavirus outbreak.                 Between March 13 and 15, the group called Tablighi Jamaat, which focuses on encouraging Muslims to return to practicing the religion as the Prophet Muhammad did, met in New Delhi.                 Thousands of members had traveled from across India and abroad to the event at the Nizamuddin Markaz mosque – the group’s global headquarters – in central Delhi.                 After the event, delegates – who had dispersed – began to fall sick with Covid-19 and Indian officials embarked on a widespread effort to trace, identify and test attendees and their families. As of Saturday, 4,291 cases had been linked to the gathering, across 23 states and union territories, according to health authorities. That amounted, as of April 20, to nearly a quarter of all Covid-19 cases reported so far in India.                 While the meeting was held before the official nationwide lockdown on March 25, the Indian Ministry of Health had advised all states on March 6 to avoid mass gatherings.                  A day after Modi announced a citizens’ curfew on March 22, Tablighi Jamaat followers were still in their headquarters. Event organizers said in a statement that when the curfew was put in place, the event was “discontinued immediately.”                 “Due to the sudden cancelation of rail services across the country on March 21, a large group of visitors who had to depart by way of rail got stuck in the Markaz premises,” organizers said.                   The Delhi police are even weighing criminal charges against the group, which has denied it broke any law. The event organizers also say that they acted within medical guidelines by not allowing its stranded visitors to roam the streets.                 Other gatherings had also gone ahead in this time period – both sessions of Parliament, for example, were on until March 23.                 Even after the lockdown was announced, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath traveled to Ayodhya and participated in a Hindu ritual, reportedly surrounded by at least 20 people. Speaking to local media, Adityanath’s media advisor Mrityunjay Kumar said the meeting was held early in the morning when most people were asleep and that there were around 10 people present.                 After the cluster of coronavirus cases from the Tablighi Jamaat meeting emerged, some members of Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) officials began equating the meeting to terrorism.                 On Twitter, the head of the BJP’s information and technology unit, Amit Malviya, called the gathering part of an “Islamic insurrection.” Sangeet Som, a state-level BJP lawmaker, reportedly said the meeting was “corona terrorism,” and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, BJP minister for minority affairs accused the event organizers on Twitter and local television of a“Talibani crime.”                 The lawyer for the head of the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi, Maulana Mohd. Saad, declined to comment on the issue.                 Sanjay Kapoor, political commentator and editor of independent political magazine Hardnews said questions should be asked about why the attendees were not checked at the airports when arriving for the event, despite the government saying it was screening those coming from countries affected by coronavirus.                 “I think there was a certain amount of laziness or complicity through the state. All these people came through immigration and surely if they were infected, why weren’t they checked especially when the government has been saying it’s been tracking people coming into India from early March,” he said.                 In the days after the Delhi mosque cluster was reported by the Indian media, a series of Islamophobic hashtags gained traction on social media, including #CoronaJihad, #CrushTablighiSpitters and #BioJihad.                 Rumors, misinformation and videos claiming Muslims were deliberately spreading Covid-19 were widely shared, fanning already inflamed religious tensions in the country.     Related articleUnder India's caste system, Dalits are considered untouchable. The coronavirus is intensifying that slur             “We have observed a deliberate pattern to delegitimize the community,” Alt News, an Indian nonprofit fact-checking website, said. “All these videos have been used to call for a boycott of the community, especially the lower economic sections of the society such as vegetable and fruit vendors. This act of communalizing a pandemic is disturbing as well as dangerous.”                 Wajahat Habibullah, former chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities who remains a vocal leader on minority rights, said: “It is shameful that the safety of the Muslim community has been compromised during Covid-19.                  “We should all work together to combat the disease, instead we are targeting a certain community,” he said.                  Offline, Muslims across India with no connection to the gathering in New Delhi say they were targeted as India’s response to the virus ramped up.                 Mohammed Shukrdeen, a milk producer belonging to the Gujjar community in the state of Punjab, almost 200 miles from where the event took place, said that his entire community was impacted by rumors following the Tablighi Jamaat event, in two ways.                 “First, no one wanted to buy milk from us, and second, local authorities would raid our houses to see if anyone of us had either visited the Jamaat in Delhi or if we were hiding others who had come,” Shukrdeen, who says he had no connection to the gathering, said. “The villagers threatened the dairy where we sell milk and the dairy stopped buying our milk. This meant a huge loss for us.”                 Shukrdeen couldn’t take the emotional and financial stress and says he went to speak to the village heads about the ostracization of his community. A video he recorded of the meeting was picked up online and police then intervened to help. Shukrdeen said they reached an agreement that the milk sold by the Muslim community would be bought by the dairy and that they will be allowed to continue their business.                 Still, the damage to their finances and reputation was done.

Mohammed Sakeb, 28, organizes a campaign that distributes ration kits to Muslim families, especially those affected by recent inter-communal riots in north-east New Delhi.                  Sakeb said he and his volunteers often face harassment when they go out despite having passes allowing them to travel, deliver food and serve marginalized communities during the lockdown.                 “The other day a 25-year-old volunteer was distributing rations to the worst affected Muslim families. The police stopped him, didn’t ask any questions and then started hitting him. He had to run away,” he said.                 CNN was unable to reach the police for comment.                 Sakeb said most of his volunteers areafraid to go out now. “Those of us who dress with our skull caps and have long beards, we instantly get targeted,” he said.                  Experiences from people like those interviewed by CNN have been widely reported in Indian media.                  The Organization of Islamic Cooperation in a statement expressed “deep concern” about “rising anti-Muslim sentiments and Islamophobia within political and media circles and on mainstream and social media platforms.”                 The Minority Affairs Minister Naqvi said that everybody’s “cultural, social, religious” rights were “completely safe and secure.”                 “As far as India is concerned and the Indian government or Indian Constitution is concerned, we are completely committed for the socio-economic, educational and religious rights and upliftment for every section of society including minorities and Muslims,” he said.                 Naqvi called the harassment and attacks isolated cases and said, “the people who are doing all these things is not correct.”                 Responding to whether calling the Jamaat gathering a “Talibani crime” would inflame tensions, Naqvi said: “Talibani crimes means it’s a serious criminal negligence and the peoples who … like the Talibanis, who never follow the rules.”                 In a post on LinkedIn on Sunday, Modi said Covid-19 presented a “common challenge.”                 “Covid-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking,” he said. “Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together.”                 Several Indian state leaders have condemned the spread of misinformation that’s targeting the Muslim community though many have stopped short of condemning the violence.

The two later met, and Dillon said Rashid’s act of kindness has forced him to examine his biases.","Mar 18, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Scottie Andrew,International,"Qasim Rashid has spent much of his life fighting for and defending human rights, first as a lawyer, then as a spokesman for the the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA.                  Oscar “Oz” Dillon held anti-Muslim views and often targeted his ire at Rashid, who’s running for Congress in Dillon’s district.                  The two were never supposed to find common ground, let alone form a friendship.                  But a small act of kindness led the two to meet – and forced Dillon to examine his bias.                  “He has opened my eyes to a whole new world about Islam,” Dillon told CNN.                  Rashid is running for Virginia’s District 1 seat in Congress as a Democrat, a public position that’s opened him up to heaps of Islamophobia.     Related articleA man is accused of sending a Twitter threat to lynch a Muslim state senate candidate. He's now been charged             At times, the comments have been dangerous: In December, a man was convicted for threatening to lynch Rashid when he was a candidate for state senate.                  But he’s still active on social media, defending his policy positions and engaging with hundreds of thousands of followers. He criticizes President Donald Trump and his conservative opponents.                  It’s where he met Dillon. Dillon had tweeted critical, often offensive comments at Rashid since his first campaign for state senate.                  In response to a recent tweet from Rashid about education funding, the 66-year-old sent a tweet with an offensive meme about Islam.                 Rashid told CNN the meme was “highly offensive, deeply hurtful and frankly dangerous.”                 He doesn’t usually indulge offensive comments on Twitter, but Dillon’s tweet stung. He was about to reply with links to teach Dillon why his misconceptions about Islam were incorrect.                  But when he clicked on Dillon’s profile and saw a GoFundMe link in his bio, he took a different approach.                 “Idk who [Dillon] is but he tweeted a deeply hurtful & false attack on me for my faith,” Rashid tweeted. “My faith instead teaches me to serve all humanity—so Ive [sic] donated $55 to his GoFundMe to help him & his family cover crushing medical debt.”                 He asked his 290,000 followers to do the same.                  Dillon told CNN that he’s held anti-Muslim views since the 9/11 attacks, so he was shocked that the Muslim candidate had treated him with such kindness.                  “The vitriol I put against him during his campaign last year … that he would research me and reach out to me, it absolutely flabbergasted me,” he said.                  Dillon started the GoFundMe to cover his wife’s medical bills. She had a double pulmonary embolism in 2018, and while he said she’s improved, she still uses a walker to get around the house and isn’t a candidate for surgery because of her condition.                 Dillon sent the GoFundMe link to his conservative delegates and none of them donated.                  “Not a one came back to me,” he said. “But Qasim, who I derided, poked fun at and was horribly humiliated and humbled by, is reaching out. He took the time to look into why I was doing this and who I am.”                 After Rashid shared Dillon’s GoFundMe page, hundreds of his supporters poured donations into relieving Dillon’s medical debt.                  It stunned him.                  He immediately emailed Rashid apologizing for his comments and thanking the candidate for his donation. He asked if Rashid would meet him at his home so he could plant a campaign sign in his yard.                  So they met, first at Dillon’s home, then over coffee. Dillon admitted how little he understood about Islam and how much of what he believed was incorrect.                  “We’ve come to understand each other, speaking with a sense of stability,” Rashid said. “He wanted to be supportive however he could.”                  With Rashid’s help, Dillon raised over $22,000 on GoFundMe, more than his goal. He’ll use the funds for a new wheelchair for his wife and donate the rest to St. Jude and the American Heart Association.                 Dillon still tweets his political opinions loudly. But he’s stopped sending anti-Muslim tweets. He’s considering voting for Rashid, something unthinkable just last month.                  “I think of Qasim as a patriot,” Dillon said. “What is a patriot? Someone who does for the good of the community.”                  Rashid said Dillon is committed to improving and learning more about his biases. He never expected his digital act of good would lead them to meet and discuss their differences.                  “You can’t expect marginalized communities or people of color to educate all the time,” he said. “It’s exhausting. But I don’t see it as additional work. I see it as the work I signed up to do.”      © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The Gender Social Norms Index, which measures how social beliefs affect gender equality, was released by the United Nations Development Programme on Thursday.

It also found that 28 percent of men and women believe that men are justified to beat their wives.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/politics/fact-check-bloomberg-nypd-muslim-surveillance/index.html,Fact check: Bloomberg falsely claims NYPD only entered mosques when invited in,"Facts First: Mosques and other Islamic organizations were surveilled without consent during the Bloomberg mayoralty that began in 2002, including with secret informants and undercover officers.","Feb 25, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Daniel Dale,International,"Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg was challenged late last year about the New York Police Department’s widespread surveillance of Muslims when he was mayor of New York City.                  He responded dishonestly.                 In an exchange filmed in December but tweeted out only last week, Bloomberg told Sarah Pearson, a Milwaukee activist and organizer who is also a supporter of rival candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, that he is a strong supporter of the Muslim community and its rights. He also claimed: “We only went into mosques when they asked us to come in.”                 When Pearson pressed him further on the surveillance, Bloomberg said the police “only went in when the mosque or the imam asked … period. End of story.”     Facts First: Mosques and other Islamic organizations were surveilled without being asked or notified during the Bloomberg mayoralty that began in 2002, including with secret informants and undercover officers. Muslim leaders in New York City and in New Jersey, where the NYPD also conducted surveillance, say Bloomberg’s claim that the police went into mosques only when invited in is categorically false. Adam Goldman, a journalist who won the Pulitzer Prize as part of an Associated Press team that exposed the surveillance program, says the same. At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN’s home for Facts First.             “That statement is totally false. The NYPD surveillance of the Muslim community was warrantless and it was covert in nature,” said Imam Al-Hajj Talib Abdur-Rashid of New York’s Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood, who is a former president of the Islamic Leadership Council of New York.                 “The statement that the former mayor is making is completely untrue,” said Imam W. Deen Shareef, convener of the Council of Imams in New Jersey. “None of the mosques and none of the organizations, for that matter – none of the schools that were placed under the surveillance – were contacted, and none of the leaders within the Muslim community here in New Jersey had any knowledge whatsoever of the New York Police Department having any interest in looking for or investigating or questioning anyone about whatever it is they were looking for.”                 Bloomberg’s campaign did not respond to requests for an explanation of his remarks. The NYPD declined to comment.                 As the Associated Press reported in its series of Pulitzer-winning articles in 2011, the Bloomberg-era NYPD surveilled mosques in various uninvited ways for years after 9/11 – from creating a network of mosque informants to sending in undercover officers to mounting surveillance cameras on nearby light poles to shooting photos of people arriving to pray and collecting their license plate numbers.                  Bloomberg’s claim “is so plainly, demonstrably untrue that it would be almost laughable had it not been for the devastating effects that unwarranted NYPD surveillance had on American Muslim communities in New York City and beyond,” said Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at the City University of New York who directs the CLEAR (Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility) project that represented the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits against the surveillance program.                 It is possible that Bloomberg, who took office about three-and-a-half months after 9/11, was referring to occasions on which police leaders and officers were invited into mosques for meetings or gatherings. Before the Associated Press broke the news about the surveillance program in 2011, “imams and mosques throughout the city were really very open and welcoming to NYPD,” said Abdur-Rashid.                 But Bloomberg had been asked specifically about surveillance. Though loud music was playing in the background as he spoke with Pearson at the opening of a campaign office in Milwaukee, he made clear that he heard that this is what she was talking about.                 And the NYPD secretly surveilled even mosques and imams who had invited the NYPD in for other reasons. For example, the Associated Press reported, Sheikh Reda Shata, formerly of a mosque in Brooklyn, invited NYPD officers for breakfast, threw parties for officers leaving the precinct and dined with Bloomberg at the mayor’s official mansion. But Shata, who had no criminal past, was being watched by an undercover officer and informant, and his mosque was being watched too.                   “The book details an extensive clandestine effort to monitor many mosques across the city using informants and undercover officers,” said Goldman, now a reporter with The New York Times, who co-authored the book “Enemies Within”about the surveillance program.                  Pearson said her exchange with Bloomberg took place on December 21, 2019. She said she tweeted the two video clips of the exchange last Wednesday because of a hashtag that has been circulating, #AskBloomberg, which encouraged the moderators at Bloomberg’s first Democratic debate to ask him tough questions.                 “I had held back because I didn’t want my questioning of his record to be viewed as something I was doing simply because I support another candidate,” she said.                 Goldman said the surveillance program began in 2002, the year Bloomberg took office, after the NYPD hired a veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency as its first deputy commissioner for intelligence.                 The surveillance extended far beyond mosques, touching thousands of innocent Muslim residents in other locations. According to the Associated Press reporting, the NYPD eavesdropped in cafes, sending plainclothes officers to query people about their views on political and international issues. The NYPD placed undercover officers at Muslim student associations. And the NYPD recorded mundane details of the daily lives of Muslims, such as where they played chess or where they shopped for groceries.                 It is possible that there is a case in which an imam did make some sort of private request to the NYPD. But Bloomberg’s suggestion that surveillance happened exclusively with the permission of imams is clearly inaccurate.                 Under Bloomberg’s successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York City settled three lawsuits over the surveillance program. The city agreed to tighten guidelines for investigations related to political or religious activity protected by the First Amendment, which a judge had weakened in 2003. It also agreed to significantly greater oversight of such investigations through the appointment of a “civilian representative,” who is empowered to tell the court at any time if police are violating the guidelines.                  The New York City Council also took action against Bloomberg’s wishes during the final months of his mayoralty in 2013. In response to complaints about both the surveillance of Muslims and the policy of “stop and frisk,” which disproportionately targeted black and Latino residents, the council voted to appoint an inspector general to serve as a watchdog over NYPD activities – overriding Bloomberg’s veto.                  As with stop and frisk, Bloomberg defended the surveillance of Muslims as mayor; he said in 2012, “We have to keep this country safe.” But while he has been apologizing for stop and frisk since November 2019, the month he launched his presidential campaign, he has not issued apologies for the surveillance program.                 Bloomberg’s campaign did not respond when asked if he would apologize or has any regrets over the program.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The wide-ranging report, compiled by the UN Monitoring Team that tracks the global jihadi terror threat, refers to the group by its alternate name stating the “Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), following its loss of territory, has begun to reassert itself in both the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, mounting increasingly bold insurgent attacks, calling and planning for the breakout of ISIL fighters in detention facilities and exploiting weaknesses in the security environment of both countries.”                  It has been clear for some time that one reason for ISIS’s resilience is its deep pockets, with overheads reduced now the group no longer administers a large state. The report said that according to one of the more conservative assessments by UN member states, ISIS still has $100 million in reserves.      Related articlePentagon report says ISIS is 're-surging in Syria' following Trump's troop withdrawal             “The period from July to September 2019 saw an acceleration of the reconstitution of ISIS as a covert network in the Syrian Arab Republic, mirroring what had happened in Iraq since 2017. Freed of the responsibility of defending territory, there was a notable increase in attacks in previously quiet areas held by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic around the country,” the report stated.                  The report noted: “The borders between Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic remain inadequately secured, allowing some movement of fighters between both jurisdictions. Recent developments east of the Euphrates have led to an increase of ISIL activity in Dayr al-Zawr and Hasakah Governorates and a spike in attacks targeting the United States led coalition and local non-State armed groups.”                  The report, which is based on information from UN member states, revealed that several of those states assess the new leader of ISIS is Amir Muhammad Said Abdal Rahman al-Mawla, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s deputy. It cautions the information has not yet been confirmed.                  For months mystery surrounded the real identity of ISIS’s new leader. A few days after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a US raid in Syria in October, ISIS named its new ‘caliph’ as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, a jihadi alias not then known among counter-terrorism analysts. In its announcement the terrorist group provided no meaningful detail that might provide clues about his real identity.                  After Baghdadi was killed and before ISIS named its new leader, CNN reported that some analysts believed al-Mawla would likely take over the leadership of the group.     Related articleInside the dramatic US military raid that killed ISIS leader Baghdadi              The finding that ISIS is regenerating under a new leader challenges the narrative emanating from the White House. Earlier this month President Donald Trump stated, “Three months ago, after destroying 100% of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims and all who stood in his way.”                 But the UN findings parallel the assessment of senior US counter-terrorism officials. “No one thinks that just with the demise of the physical caliphate that Daesh is finished, ” Jim Jeffrey, the US Special Representative for Syria and the Coalition to Defeat ISIS stated in a press conference last week, using an alternative name for ISIS. Jeffrey added that there were somewhere between 14,000-18,000 ISIS fighters “active between Syria and Iraq.”                   “They have shown in the past some reconstitution in Iraq, particularly in the area of Diyala and Kirkuk provinces. And to the south of the Euphrates, in areas where the Syrian regime should be responsible but largely is not, they’ve been quite active. So we are concerned,” he stated.                 The coalition’s ability to maintain pressure on ISIS has been complicated by the fallout from the January 3 US drone strike at Baghdad international airport which killed the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani and a leading Tehran-backed Iraqi militia commander. In his news conference last week, Ambassador Jeffrey stated that “Coalition operations have been primarily on pause in Iraq as we focus on force protection.” because of concern over potential reprisal attacks by pro-Tehran militias.      Related articleBaghdadi's successor likely to be Iraqi religious scholar             “Over time, obviously, there is a possibility of a degradation of the effort against Daesh if we’re not able to do the things that we were doing so effectively up until a few weeks ago,” Jeffrey added.                    The UN report makes clear Trump’s decision last autumn to draw down forces in Syria has created a greater risk of jail breaks by the thousands of ISIS fighters currently detained by Kurdish forces in northern Syria.                   “The reduction of forces of the United States of America has raised concerns among Member States regarding the ability of security forces currently active in the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic to maintain adequate control over a restive population of detained ISIL fighters, as well as family members.”                  The report estimated 10,000 male fighters remain in these facilities, including 2,000 foreign terrorist fighters and warns female detainees are playing a leading role in radicalizing those detained in the facilities. The report stated “the current improvised holding arrangement are a recipe for radicalization and despair, especially in the case of minors.”                 On October 22, during the tumultuous period which followed the Turkish incursion into Kurdish controlled areas of northern Syria and the US announcing it was drawing down troops in the area, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told CNN, “Of the 11,000 or so detainees that were in prisons in northeast Syria, we’ve only had reports of a little bit more than a hundred that have escaped.”                  According to the UN report, the number of escapees ended up being higher. “Member States estimate that several hundred individuals associated with ISIL, including fighters, escaped from their accommodations in October, although it is not clear how many were redetained, how many remained at large and whether there was any significant change to the associated threat.”                 If al-Mawla is one and the same as “al-Qurashi” and is the new leader of ISIS, he is likely to become one of the world’s most wanted men. In August the US State Department’s Rewards for Justice program offered a reward of up to $5 million for al-Mawla’s capture, describing him as a “potential successor” to Baghdadi, while listing an alias as “Hajji Abdallah.”                 This assessment persisted after Baghdadi’s demise. The day before ISIS announced their new leader in late October, Russell Travers, the acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center, testified that Hajji Abdallah was a potential successor.                  The State Department listing further stated that Mawla/Hajji Abdallah, “was a religious scholar in ISIS’s predecessor organization, al-Qa’ida in Iraq (AQI), and steadily rose through the ranks to assume a senior leadership role for ISIS. As one of ISIS’s most senior ideologues, Hajji Abdallah helped drive and justify the abduction, slaughter, and trafficking of the Yazidi religious minority in northwest Iraq and is believed to oversee some of the group’s global terrorist operations.”                 Much of the Yazidi community lived in Sinjar which is close to what some analysts believe was Mawla’s hometown of Tal Afar in northern Iraq. In 2014, after ISIS had taken Tal Afar and Mosul, the group enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and children and murdered thousands of Yazidi men, in what the United Nations has called a genocide.     Related articleHow Trump's decision unfolded to kill a top Iranian general             The 2019 “testimony” of a former ISIS operative which was archived by the researcher Aymenn al-Tamimi points to Mawla/Hajji Abdallah’s involvement in ISIS’s oppression of the Yazidis.                  “The attack was carried out on the city of Sinjar and it was conquered … and the Yezidis were brought together and it was said to them: ‘All the men who convert to Islam will be spared from killing, and the women will spared from being taken captive’ … And the one who gave them the pact is al-Hajj Abdullah.”                  The former ISIS operative even included a footnote making clear “al-Hajj Abdullah” was Baghdadi’s deputy. Tamimi also points to an internal ISIS document from 2018 in which a member of the group writes to Mawla about an ideological dispute. The letter (which for the record used the alias al-Hajj Abdullah) repeatedly described him as “the deputy” to Baghdadi.                 As CNN has previously reported, there are suggestions Mawla is of Turkmen origin. If he is, that may have complicated his path to the top job. Iraqi Arabs have for the most part dominated ISIS’s leadership ranks. There were also other hurdles Mawla faced. It is widely believed among jihadis that any “Caliph” must have certain credentials.                 One is that he must be descended from the Prophet Mohammed’s Quraysh tribe. Another is the requirement to have significant knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence. His track record as a “religious scholar” within the terrorist group may allow Mawla to persuade jihadis of his theological pedigree – but it’s unclear that he has Quraysh lineage.                 According to the UN report, Mawla’s “Turkmen ethnicity led some Member States to assess that he might only be a temporary choice until the group finds a more legitimate “emir,” a direct descendant from the Quraysh Hashemite tribe who could therefore command the full support of the remote provinces.”     Related articlePompeo stonewalls as evidence emerges of possible surveillance of ex-Ukraine ambassador             This brings up the possibility that ISIS are deliberately keeping Mawla’s elevation to the top position secret out of concern he may not be seen by jihadis around the world as a legitimate caliph.                 But it is not clear how sustainable this will be for the terrorist group. Although pledges of allegiance have flowed into the new leader from fighters purporting to belong to ISIS satellites around the world, ISIS could risk losing support if they do not provide more biographical detail about their new leader.                  “ISIL will face a challenge over the longer term to enthuse its supporters, especially those in more remote locations, about the new leader without putting him in danger by having him communicate more directly and confirm his identity,”  the UN report states.                  The picture the report paints of the global terror threat picture is that it has reduced overall since 2015-2017 when ISIS still controlled significant swaths of Syria and Iraq and launched and instigated a wave of attacks around the world. But there is also significant concern over the resilience of ISIS and its worldwide satellites, as well as the potential threat posed by the al-Qaeda network.                  The report stated that “Al -Qaida affiliates are stronger than ISIL in many conflict zones, especially the Sahel, Somalia, Yemen and the north-west of the Syrian Arab Republic.”                  It warned that in West Africa, the combined efforts of al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates “are threatening the stability of fragile Member States in the region.”                 The report stated that “ISIL appears not to have regenerated its external operational planning capability, although documents have emerged in the Syrian Arab Republic concerning a plan within ISIL to reconstitute its office to assist operatives in Europe with planning and executing attacks. Despite weaknesses in the current structure, the threat of a planned complex attack in Europe, especially by former expert operatives who have the ability to operate independently, is assessed to persist.”                  It reported that ISIS “suffered a setback to its ability to inspire attacks in November 2019, with the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) operation with several Internet companies that resulted in the removal of large quantities of ISIL online material, especially from Telegram’s instant messaging platform.”      Related articleIran drives another stake into the heart of the nuclear deal             In assessing the al-Qaeda threat, the report focused particular attention on Hurras al-Deen (HAD), a group of 3,500 to 5,000 al-Qaeda loyalists currently based in the Idlib province of Syria. “One Member State in the region assessed that HAD, given its size, ideology and the capabilities of its veterans, presented a growing threat to peace and security regionally and globally, and that its leadership plans to revive external operations targeting Western and United States interests wherever possible.”                 The report noted that “one Member State, however, highlighted Al-Qaida’s conservative approach to expenditure and its consistent prioritization of administrative costs and salaries over operations. The ambitions of Al-Qaida affiliated elements in Idlib Province to plan and execute international attacks are assessed to be curtailed both by the military pressure they are under and by Al-Qaida’s reluctance to resource such activity.”                 The report said that “Afghanistan continues to be the conflict zone of greatest concern to Member States outside the ISIL core area and suffers by some measures the heaviest toll from terrorism of any country in the world. Al-Qaida and foreign terrorist fighters aligned with it, under the protection and influence of the Taliban, pose a long -term global threat.”                 According to the UN relations between al-Qaeda (whose fighters are estimated between 400 and 600 in Afghanistan) and the Taliban “continue to be close and mutually beneficial, with Al-Qaida supplying resources and training in exchange for protection.” The UN Monitors identified a pressing priority for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan: do everything possible to spoil a potential peace deal in the country. It noted that “Al-Qaida is concerned about the current focus of the Taliban leadership on peace talks. Al-Qaida representatives undertook shuttle diplomacy, persuading various factions of the Taliban and field commanders not to support negotiations with the Government of Afghanistan and promising to increase financial support.”                 The terrorist attack in the vicinity of London Bridge in November 2019 by a convicted terrorist the year after his release underlined the threat posed by the many terrorist convicts and radicalized inmates who are due to be released from European prisons in the coming years. According to the report, “many of the foreign terrorist fighters who received relatively short sentences upon their return to Europe prior to 2015 are expected to be released in the coming period. Some are still assessed to be dangerous. One member state reported that approximately 1,000 returnees were due for release in Europe in 2020.”                  The UN report warned that “the issue of foreign terrorist fighters remains acute, with Member States continuing to assess that between one half and two thirds of the more than 40,000 who joined the ‘caliphate’ are still alive. This is expected to aggravate the global threat posed by ISIL, and possibly Al-Qaida, for years to come.”                 It has long been clear that identifying and interdicting ISIS veterans should be a key priority for the international community. But the report warns that the “timely detection and identification of foreign terrorist fighters returning to Europe is complicated by their various travel routes and measures taken to avoid detection.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Follow her on Twitter and Instagram. The views expressed are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. President Donald Trump has often shown his deeply anti-Muslim bigotry and Islamophobia. But just when you think he couldn’t make already vulnerable Muslim-Americans — especially our fellow Iranian-Americans — any more vulnerable than we already are, Trump one-ups himself.                 On Monday, the President retweeted a blatantly doctored, fake image of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer in Middle Eastern garb together in front of an Iranian flag. In the image, Pelosi is wearing a hijab and Schumer has a turban on his head with “Democrats 2020” written on the bottom of the image. The tweet accompanying the photo reads “the corrupted Dems trying their best to come to the Ayatollah’s rescue.”                  Trump retweeted the image from an anonymous account with the alias “D0wn_Under,” which has previously tweeted out other conspiracy theories around Pelosi and Iran.                  Trump didn’t stop with just one deeply offensive, anti-Muslim tweet. Other tweets he sent included one showing a graphic picture of what appeared to be a man’s mutilated body, along with the claim that Pelosi “supports this mullahs’ crime.” The tweet was later removed and replaced, according to the Washington Post, with a note saying it “violated the Twitter Rules.”                 All of this is a new low, even for the impeached president who is infamous for making low blows, and it’s a new low for the people who work for him. Trump’s tweeting the racist pictures show that this president apparently believes portraying someone as Muslim and as sympathetic to a Muslim country is a good way to insult them. Making fun of Islamic clothing, reducing the world’s roughly 1.6 billion Muslim population to turbans and veils is offensive and incorrect, especially considering not all Muslims choose to cover or wear religious headgear.      Related articleWhy Trump's photoshopped Pelosi tweet reveals his true nature             Instead of trying to apologize for her boss’s tweets, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham went on Fox News and defended Trump’s decision to amplify the tweet, stating he did what he did to make a point.                   “I think the president is making clear that the Democrats have been parroting Iranian talking points and almost taking the side of terrorists and those who were out to kill the Americans,” she said. “I think the president was making the point that the Democrats seem to hate him so much that they’re willing to be on the side of countries and leadership of countries who want to kill Americans.”                  Even if we were to seriously consider Grisham’s point on Trump just lashing out at fellow US government officials for opposing his foreign policy, is it ever OK to insult your opponents using Islamophobic slurs?                  No matter what point Grisham claims Trump is making, his tweets make it clear to the world that the president of the United States thinks that what millions of Americans believe in and how they dress are slurs. This is absolutely unacceptable, and Congress needs to demand that Trump apologize to Muslims at home and abroad.      Related articleAnthropologist: Why Trump's threat is unthinkable             Furthermore, during such a sensitive period of renewed and heightened tensions with Iran, Trump is showing that he has no issue proffering anti-Muslim sentiments that put the lives of American Muslims and Iranian-Americans at risk. Recent studies have found Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise in the US. One study has even found that Trump’s tweets about Islam are correlated with anti-Muslim hate crimes.                   “It is unconscionable that an American president would mock Islam and Muslims in such a derogatory manner,” Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, told Newsweek in an emailed statement. “This type of bigoted message promoted by the President of the United States will serve to further endanger American Muslims, Sikhs and members of other faiths who wear recognizable religious attire.”                 Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League condemned as “outrageous” the tweet’s “repulsive anti-Muslim bigotry,” insisting that “an apology is in order ASAP.”                  Trump’s hateful and shameful tweets must be condemned by congressional lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Americans, Muslim and non-Muslims alike, are owed an apology for this filthy language coming from the highest level of our government.

But perhaps more important than pointing out and establishing Trump’s Islamophobic pattern is how we collectively as Americans respond to it.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/05/world/trump-iran-cultural-sites-war-crime/index.html,Trump’s threatened attack on Iranian cultural sites could be a war crime if carried out,"After an al-Qaeda affiliated group destroyed ancient religious monuments in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012, the International Criminal Court took on a unique criminal case: prosecuting cultural destruction.","Jan 6, 2020",2024-10-15,Islamophobia,Eric Levenson,International,"After an al-Qaeda affiliated group destroyed ancient religious monuments in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012, the International Criminal Court took on a unique criminal case: prosecuting cultural destruction.                 Though it generally focuses on human rights violations, the ICC charged the leader of the jihadist group, Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, with a war crime for destroying cultural artifacts in Timbuktu.                 The case was the first criminal charge of its kind. It “breaks new ground for the protection of humanity’s shared cultural heritage and values,” UNESCO Secretary-General Irina Bokova said at the time. Al-Mahdi eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine years in prison.                 That case has renewed relevance amid the standoff between the United States and Iran days after the United States killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in a targeted drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq, on Friday.                 In a tweet Saturday night, Trump said that if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets, the United States has targeted 52 Iranian sites – a reference to the number of Americans taken hostage in the 1979 revolution – “some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture,” he wrote.     Related articleIraqi Parliament votes for government to work on plan to end US troop presence in Iraq after Soleimani killing             “They attacked us, & we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!” Trump wrote.                 Sunday, he reiterated that threat in a conversation with reporters aboard Air Force One.                  “They’re allowed to kill our people, they’re allowed to torture and maim our people, they’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people, and we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way,” Trump said, according to a pool report.                 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” avoided directly answering whether or not the United States was actually targeting cultural sites and defended Trump’s tweeted threat.                 “We will be bold in protecting American interests and we’ll do so in a way that is consistent with the rule of law. We’ve always done that, Jake, and President Trump’s tweet doesn’t deviate from that one iota,” he said.                 “So cultural centers are theoretically fair targets, in your view?” Tapper asked.                 “We’re going to do the things that are right and the things that are consistent with American law,” Pompeo said.                 However, an attack on a cultural site would violate several international treaties and would likely be considered a war crime.                  In 2017, for example, a United Nations Security Council resolution “condemns the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artifacts.” That resolution came as a response to the Islamic State’s destruction of a number of major historic and cultural sites in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and 2015.                 The UN was clear then that actions targeting cultural locations constituted a war crime.                 “The deliberate destruction of our common cultural heritage constitutes a war crime and represents an attack on humanity as a whole,” said the spokesman for then-UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2015.                 Nicholas Burns, former undersecretary of state for political affairs and ambassador to NATO, noted the Trump administration supported the 2017 UN resolution condemning destruction of cultural sites.                 “His threat is immoral and Un-American,” Burns wrote on Twitter.                 Hossein Dehghan, the main military adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, said Trump’s tweets are “ridiculous and absurd.” He told CNN that Iran’s response “will be military and against military sites.”                 If the United States does carry out Trump’s threat to strike any of Iran’s cultural sites, then “for sure no American military staff, no American political center, no American military base, no American vessel will be safe,” Dehghan said. “If he says 52, we say 300, and they are accessible to us.”                 In a tweet, Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said an attack on a cultural site is a war crime.                  “Having committed grave breaches of (international) law in Friday’s cowardly assassinations, (Trump) threatens to commit again new breaches of JUS COGENS,” he said, referring to the phrase for international law norms. “Targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME”                 “Those masquerading as diplomats and those who shamelessly sat to identify Iranian cultural & civilian targets should not even bother to open a law dictionary,” he continued. “Jus cogens refers to peremptory norms of international law, i.e. international red lines. That is, a big(ly) ‘no no.’”                 Two senior US officials on Sunday described to CNN’s Jim Sciutto widespread opposition within the Trump administration to targeting cultural sites in Iran.                 “Nothing rallies people like the deliberate destruction of beloved cultural sites. Whether ISIS’s destruction of religious monuments or the burning of the Leuven Library in WWI, history shows targeting locations giving civilization meaning is not only immoral but self-defeating,” one of the officials told CNN.     Related articleSenior US officials say there is widespread opposition within the Trump administration to targeting cultural sites in Iran              Another official who formerly worked in both the Trump and Obama administrations told CNN: “As a matter of principle, we as a nation and as a military do not attack the culture sites of any adversary.”                 Additionally, several sources told CNN there are no indications – aside, perhaps, from Trump’s tweet – that the United States would actually strike cultural sites in Iran.                 Colin Kahl, former deputy assistant to President Barack Obama and national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, expressed skepticism that there are actually cultural sites on the list of possible retaliatory sites.                 “For what it’s worth, I find it hard to believe the Pentagon would provide Trump targeting options that include Iranian cultural sites,” he tweeted. “Trump may not care about the laws of war, but (Department of Defense) planners and lawyers do…and targeting cultural sites is (a) war crime.”                 Iran has 22 UNESCO World Heritage cultural sites, including the ancient ruins of Persepolis, the historic Masjed-e Jameh mosque in Esfahan and the lavish Golestan Palace in Tehran.

The recent wave of nine violent anti-Semitic attacks in the New York area since mid-December, comes as hate crimes against the Jewish community and attacks on synagogues have increased in the US, the UK and elsewhere. Many politicians and media personalities have fanned the flames of hatred by mainstreaming antisemitism, promulgating conspiracy theorizing tropes about Jewish people and legitimizing hate groups who target racial and religious minorities and promote acts of violence against them.                 Some of the recent incidents include the killing of six people at a Jersey City, New Jersey kosher market by two assailants, one of whom allegedly expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, and a number of stabbings allegedly by a black man with a long history of mental illness at the home of a Monsey, New York rabbi on the last night of Hanukah.                 Responding to the sentiment that it is open season on the Jewish community in America and that lives are in danger, some have sought group punishment for the black community at large, blaming African Americans and even Jews of color for violence against white Jews. Others have blamed the attacks on all Black Israelites, including Rabbi Capers Funnye, a member of the Chicago Board of Rabbis and the chief rabbi of the International Israelite Board of Rabbis, who recently received a social justice award from the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs for his work against racism and antisemitism.     Morton Klein of the pro-Trump, MAGA-friendly Zionist Organization of America,  tweeted urging “all Rabbis and Pastors to use their podiums this weekend to preach against the vile frightening attacks/murders of African Americans against innocent Jewish women, children and men. Never Again!”                  Others have advocated for more policing of multiracial neighborhoods. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to beef up police patrols in Brooklyn neighborhoods of Boro Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg, noting that “Hate doesn’t have a home in our city” and that “Anyone who terrorizes our Jewish community WILL face justice.”                  Others still sought a return of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a group the Southern Poverty Law Center identifies as a racist-right terrorist organization, whose members have been responsible for attacks in the US and elsewhere.                 Indeed, these approaches are wrong: more policing, guns and violence to fight anti-Semitic hate crimes will not make people safer. It will endanger the lives of already marginalized groups who bear the brunt of discrimination and injustice.

After the anti-Semitic, white supremacist attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, many Jewish places of worship across the nation sought greater security measures and a greater police presence.                  While an understandable response, such plans do not take into consideration the specific dangers faced by black people, who are viewed with suspicion and treated as potential criminals by the police. Increased security also fails to consider black Jews, who have been regarded as impostors, or potential criminals, who are not really Jewish and who do not belong in a synagogue.                  Take for example Yehudah Webster, a black man and a Jewish educator who, while walking in November 2018 with a Torah scroll outside his Crown Heights, Brooklyn apartment was reportedly surrounded and accosted by a mob of Hasidic men and security personnel. Or Jared Jackson, a black, multiheritage Jew and founder and executive director of Jews in All Hues, who notes that, when approaching synagogues, “I have had people call the police and observed mothers running away as I come near the building. Occasionally people stare and others try to educate me about how to read a siddur or explain the Hebrew.”                 Their experiences aren’t unique: Other black Jews have experienced being called schvartze – a derogatory Yiddish term for black – have been racially harassed by white Jews and treated like outsiders and interrogated to prove they are actually Jewish.

Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, an advocacy group in New York City, tweeted, “This is what dividing vulnerable communities looks like,” adding that “Instead of investing in restorative solutions that prioritize the safety of all communities, [de Blasio] is implementing a plan that treats abuse of Black and Brown communities as the answer to antisemitic violence. It isn’t.”      Jewish Voice for Peace, another advocacy group, emphasized the need for Jews to seek equality and freedom with allies, but said more cops are not the answer. “We know we have to address rising white nationalist violence – against Jews, Muslims, Black people and all people of color – while not relying on the very forces detaining and locking up and killing our friends, family & neighbors,” the group tweeted.                 And, as @TheHipsterRebbe, a Jewish man of color, noted, the police or the National Guard “may offer some minimal safety to Jews while inflicting worse damage to other ethnic minorities who at the same time have no such sympathy or respite from their own violence.”                 Rather than increased policing, the best way to fight these religious hate crimes is what Yousef Munayyer of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights calls “a broad, unified front of solidarity between all.”     Related articleTrump is trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes. It must stop             As black Jewish filmmaker and writer Rebecca Pierce noted, “There are people and orgs who are experts in community relationships and violence prevention” who are doing the work that “can be duplicated and amplified if we focus on building stronger communities rather than walls.”                 People must work together to solve hate with the knowledge that their suffering is interconnected. Visibly identifiable members of all religious groups, including Muslims and Orthodox Jews, have much in common in that they are easily targeted for violence. In the years since the election of Donald Trump, violent hate crimes have reached a 16-year high, and many communities feel it is open season on them.                 My children’s ancestors include black refugees who fled the South Carolina slave plantation police state during the Civil War, and Jewish refugees who fled the Russian pogroms in the 1880s. However different their circumstances, they bear similarities to the present-day Latinx, Caribbean and African refugees languishing at the border in ICE detention camps, or Muslims facing oppression in China or India – or America.

We must take lessons from interfaith organizations such as POWER, a Philadelphia-area coalition of congregants and faith leaders who organize to fight injustice and solve problems of common concern in their communities. Ultimately, people must take power from those who would divide us, and tackle the problem of hate and violence against others head-on as if it is their own, because it is.     © 2024 Cable News Network.
