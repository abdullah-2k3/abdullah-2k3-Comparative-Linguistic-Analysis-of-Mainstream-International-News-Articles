Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris's continued support for Israel's war in Gaza.,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris’s continued support for Israel’s war in Gaza.With the United Statespresidential electionless than four weeks away, analysts caution that Israel’sexpanding military campaignsacross the Middle East could bruise the chances of the Democratic candidate, Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Foreign policy is rarely a top priority for US voters. But Israel’s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign inLebanon, have spurred questions about the US’s role in the conflict.The administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters — particularly Arab Americans — turning against the party.With Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.“This is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,” Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Now party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.”Much of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, which has erasedentire neighbourhoodsand killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.That campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in USweapons assistance.“It’s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they’ve allowed to happen,” said Zogby.“There’s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don’t matter.”ASeptember pollby the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.That figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, hissupportamong Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.Biden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.When Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old’s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.But Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series ofescalatory strikesby Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.In a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”The Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August’sDemocratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.“People are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won’t give it to them,” said Zogby. “They’re making a mistake that will cost them votes.”While US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.Many of those voters are concentrated in a small number ofswing statesthat play an outsized role in deciding the country’s presidential elections.The Midwestern battleground state ofMichigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.Polling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.And her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.“The situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,” said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.“Since we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state’s Arab community stays home on election day,” he added.But Michigan’s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.Some believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.Others view a second term for Trump, apro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should “finish the job” in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.One group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is theUncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.During primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote “uncommitted”, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.Now, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris — but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.“As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,” a spokesperson said in a video released this week.“But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”The final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.In early October, for instance, Iran launched aballistic missile attackagainst Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehin Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.On that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.Analysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.ASeptember pollby the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.Respondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel’s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.Laura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.“Republican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they’re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,” Silver said.She pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza — and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.A February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.But Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such asyoung peopleand communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.“The pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,” he said. “The Democratic Party hasn’t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren’t listening, and they’ll pay a price for that.”"

With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into ...",13 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Where do the candidates stand in the polls? We’ll break it down, along with major updates from the campaign trail.With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into overdrive, with last-minute appeals to voters.Need a quick breakdown of the week’s biggest political news? Look no further.We’ll get you up to speed with five key takeaways from the past seven days and an overview of where the candidates stand in the polls.There are 23 days left before the November 5 election.As of October 11, the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows Vice President Kamala Harris up by 2.5 points, with 48.5 percent support compared to former President Donald Trump’s 46 percent.Another polling average, from the website 270toWin, shows Harris again with a marginal lead, with 49.3 percent support. Trump, meanwhile, is at 46.5 percent.Harris, the Democrat, could be poised to flip one of Trump’s key demographics: suburban voters.On October 10, the news agency Reuters and the market research poll Ipsos released a poll that showed Harris led her Republican rival 47 percent to 41 among suburbanites.But two days later, The New York Times and Siena College released a poll that indicated Harris could be slipping among Black voters. She pulled in 78 percent support — a drop from the estimated 90 percent support her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, earned in 2020.Within three days of forming in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Milton had billowed into a powerful Category 5 storm, earning the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Such rapid development had rarely been seen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton “one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin”.And it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.But as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.Swaths of the US South were still recovering from September’sHurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas”.On the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Bidenslapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.“Over the last few weeks, there’s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what’s going on,” Biden said, calling the distortions “un-American”.“Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,” he added.Harris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. “This is not a time for people to play politics,” she said, in reference to the Republican.Once criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of arecent media blitz.It was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.And even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.But in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.And her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.That last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.But host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing “shifting explanations”, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.The friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to “make her look better”.He also called on the Federal Communications Commission to “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE”. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission’s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.Through much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large — even dooming one candidate’s run.After a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a “weak” and “sleepy” old man.But at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.Those questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump’s “rambling” and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.And then, on Saturday, the White House released amemotouting hisDemocratic rival’s health.The 59-year-old Harris, it read, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency”.Trump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with astatement, arguing that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung wrote of Trump.On the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.Immigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump’s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.But critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.On Monday, Trumprecorded an audio interviewwith the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump said. “Now a murderer, I believe this: It’s in their genes. And we’ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”The Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.Speaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to “expedite the removal” of “savage gangs” from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.He also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.Despite Trump’s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.Reporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.In 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician’s eventual resignation.Since then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse ofTrump’s alleged relationshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.In its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.News outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book’s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump’s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an “angry, little man”.“None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,” Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.But the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley — once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.He tells Woodward in the book that Trump is “fascist to the core”."

The Democrat led 52 percent to 46 percent in the same poll last month.The latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51 percent to 48 percent among likely voters, compared with a four-point advantage last month.Following the latest figures, Harris holds a 1.4 percent point lead in Real Clear Polling’s aggregate of major polls, slipping from 2.2 percent on Saturday.The tightening poll numbers come amid concerns among Democrats that Harris is failing to shore up support among Hispanics and African Americans, two of the party’s key constituencies.While Harris is leading among women of all races, she has struggled to drum up enthusiasm among men, including African Americans and Hispanics, who have increasingly gravitated towards Trump in recent years.In The New York Times/Siena College polls released on Saturday and Sunday, Harris attracted the support of 78 percent of Black voters and 56 percent of Hispanic voters – significantly lower shares than won by the Democratic nominees in the 2020 and 2016 elections.On Thursday, former President Barack Obama admonished Black men for not showing as much enthusiasm for Harris’s candidacy as he had received during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012.“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama said at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of seven key battleground states expected to decide the election.“Because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”Harris and Trump on Sunday continued to focus their campaigns on the battleground states, holding events in North Carolina and Arizona, respectively.At a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris took aim at Trump for spreading misinformation about the government’s response to recent hurricanes.“The problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it’s making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they’re led to believe they cannot trust,” Harris said.“And that’s the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.”Trump, meanwhile, used a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona to call for the hiring of 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents.“After I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10 percent raise – they haven’t had one in a long time – for all agents and a $10,000 each retention and signing bonus,” Trump said. “We’re going to retain them.”"

All the results are within the margin of error with the exception of Nevada, where Trump is led by 5 percent in the WSJ poll.The newspaper said it surveyed 600 registered voters per state between September 28 and October 8.US elections are not won by popular vote nationwide. Rather, candidates compete in individual states to winelectoral college votes.It’s akin to a point system, where each state is worth a number of points proportionate to the size of its population. In all but two states – Maine and Nebraska – the winner takes all the electoral college votes.Most states are almost certain to go to one party. For example, a Democratic win in California and Vermont is often projected as soon as the polls close, while states like Oklahoma and Alabama are Republican strongholds.That leaves a handful of states where there are close, competitive elections. These are known asswing states. In this round, all eyes are on the seven states polled by WSJ.In 2016, Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote because he defeated the Democratic candidateHillary Clintonin most battleground states.According to a Pew Research Centersurveyreleased on Friday, Harris is leading the race nationally by one point – 48 percent to Trump’s 47 percent.US election poll results have fluctuated in recent months. While Trump enjoyed a solid lead overJoe Bidenearlier this year in almost all polls, the Democrats received a boost after the US president stepped aside and was replaced by Harris as the party’s nominee.A Morning Consult poll in September had Harris beating Trump 51 percent to 46 percent. But the former president appeared to claw back some support amid concerns about the economy and the turmoil inthe Middle East.US election polls have also been wide off the mark in the past. For example, many surveys had indicated that Clinton was set for a comfortable win when she lost toTrump in 2016.Still, this year various polls appear to agree that the US is heading to a close presidential election next month.Control of the Senate and House of Representatives will also be up for grabs on November 5.A New York Times poll on Friday predicted bad news for Democrats’ hopes of protecting their narrow majority in the Senate.The Democrats currently control the 100-member chamber with 51 seats, including four independents who caucus with the party.But the Times survey found that Democrats are likely to lose a potentially decisive seat in a Republican-leaning state.Republicans were already expected to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia – where conservative Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.But the Times poll indicated Democratic Senator Jon Tester is trailing his Republican opponent by eight percentage points in rural Montana, where Trump won with ease in 2016 and 2020.Democrats will also have a fight on their hands to keep Senate seats in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and Nevada, but they will be hoping to challenge Republican incumbents in Texas and Florida.A Republican-controlled Senate can prove to be a major hurdle for Harris should she win in November.Beyond its legislative powers, the Senate is tasked with confirmingjudicial appointmentsand cabinet members, which would allow Republicans to pressure Harris, should she be elected, on who she chooses for her governing team."

Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier ...",28 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier under Biden.Mumbai, India –Parneesh Mehta’s diamond jewellery business may be performing much better than many other companies around the world suffering from the crushing force of lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.But the entrepreneur based in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, says that is little consolation for the revenue he has lost because of tariff hikes on the gems and jewellery sector in his biggest export market – the United States.In April 2019, the US withdrew India and Turkey from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), an import duty exemption on certain goods – including Mehta’s jewels – that require a lot of manpower to make, from developing countries.“That really hurt us,” Mehta told Al Jazeera. “We had to adjust our prices for some of our clients. For others, we dropped the quality of the gems.”With both exporters and importers feeling the pinch, Mehta says the added tax will prevent businesses from growing. “Everyone’s getting squeezed,” he said. “If the GSP was restored, there’s no doubt it would help the sector as a whole”.Mehta’s experience is one example of how the India-US economic relationship has changed under the administration of US President Donald Trump. And why many Indian entrepreneurs like him have a keen interest in who occupies the White House after the November 3 US elections.Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the US’s trade deficit with India, which stood at $28.8bn in 2019, nearly three times the $10.6bn figure in 2008. In March 2019, he called India “a very high-tariff nation” and has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to redress the gap. India later retaliated, raising duties on 28 US products.Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have famously enjoyed afriendly rapport, but analysts say Trump’s punitive policies have made the economic environment more contentious. The two sides have repeatedlyfailed to signeven a “mini trade deal” that had initially been expected in September 2019.“There’s been a lot of positive engagement, but in reality, we are far from getting anything ratified,” Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi told Al Jazeera.This could change if Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, becomes the next US president and brings with him a more measured policymaking machine.“A Biden administration would not necessarily back down on big-ticket requests,” says Dhar, referring to the US’s push for greater access to India’s agriculture, medical device and e-commerce markets, and even for lower import tariffs on Harley Davidson motorbikes.“But we’d be unlikely to see the same aggression towards trade partners. This could lead to a better outcome for Indian negotiators”.Trump’s trade policies and negotiating stance may be based on populist impulses, but India is also taking an increasingly protectionist line.India’s incoming data protection bill has become one of the thorniest issues in negations.The bill threatens to prevent Indian data from leaving its shores, making life difficult for global technology giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google that rely on the free-flow of data.It also threatens to tax digital companies in a way that would also disproportionately affect US technology firms. The US has called this type of taxation “unfair” and “discriminatory” and has said it will “begin investigations” into how its trading partners are implementing such laws.After its economy suffered a historic shock (gross domestic product shrank by a record 23.9 percent in the April-June quarter), exacerbating an urgent need to create more blue- and white-collar jobs, analysts say India cannot afford to close itself off from negotiating a more favourable US trading relationship.“India needs to recognise that a trade relationship with the US is extremely beneficial for economic growth,” Anupam Manur, a research fellow at the Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately though, we may see nationalistic jingo and political point-scoring continue to take the upper hand”.However, recent investments by Facebook and Google in Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, could drive a change of mindset.Reliance is India’s largest and most influential company. With two major US tech giants taking a seat each on its board, analysts say this could strengthen the hand of US companies lobbying the Indian government to liberalise a wide range of issues governing India’s digital platforms.For this reason “I wouldn’t rule out a policy U-turn,” said JNU’s Dhar.But, regardless of the outcome of the US election, analysts believe progress on a trade agreement will hinge on the US securing greater access to India’s huge, yet fragmented, agricultural markets.India, however, is reluctant to endanger its mostly small-scale, independent producers by forcing them to compete with giant US agribusinesses. And with the global economic downturn set to drag on, as well as a strong farming lobby to placate at home, observers say a future Biden administration would likely take a hard line similar to Trump’s.September’shistoric changes to India’s farm laws, which will open up produce markets to private players, could also complicate matters. “Farmers already have apprehensions about these ordinances,” said Dhar. “Allowing American access on top of that means the situation could become very problematic”.With US unemployment at a high 8.4 percent and the country experiencing the toughest economic conditions since the Great Depression, analysts say there may be little political room for either of the two contenders to deviate from the US’s existing – and increasingly nativist – trade policies.“Let’s remember that Biden also has a ‘Made in America’ plan and has made an effort to appear tough on China,” explained Takshashila Institution’s Manur. “His talk of subsidising industry, which is against the World Trade Organisation rules, tells me he will also be protectionist”.The White House’s recent announcement of plans to reduce the number of visas awarded to skilled workers by a third is one such area where Biden’s hands may be tied.Last year, 74.5 percent of so-called H1-B visas were claimed by Indians, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, plugging a shortage of highly skilled labour in the US’s technology industries. High-profile Indian CEOs such as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Google’s parent Alphabet have also played an outsized role in contributing to Silicon Valley’s success.Despite this, Indians look set to miss out on future opportunities.“Like with the 2008 global financial crisis, the immigration issue has become mixed up in the feelings surrounding the downturn,” says Dhar. “[Biden] will eventually re-look at visa policies once the economy rebounds, but not before that”.But a change of US leadership could mean a return to more nuanced, rules-based decision-making. Consequently, there are hopes in India that the Iran nuclear deal, originally signed under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and abandoned by Trump, will be back on the table.This would help India, which lost an important export market, a valuable source of cheap oil and a potential stake in a key port by complying with US sanctions. “Iran has always been a strategic ally in the region,” says Dhar. “I hope this situation would improve if a new administration comes in”.India is likely to remain a key ally for the US as geopolitical tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific region. In a speech during his visit to India earlier this year, Trump clubbed the two nations together as “powerful defenders of peace and liberty”, drawing a blunt contrast with China – the other great regional power. Biden too has said he would “stand with India”, promising to tackle terror threats in the region together.As the US decouples itself from China’s economy, India is trying to take its place. Modi has pitched India as a “trusted partner” and welcomed foreign direct investment. In reality, US businesses are reluctant to leave China or disrupt their supply chains; and for the few that do, India is unlikely to be their preferred destination.“At most, US companies are hedging, perhaps moving 30 percent of their operations to Vietnam or Laos – India is not attractive to companies yet,” said Takshashila Institution’s Manur. But the current reforms to labour and land laws, which would make it easier for foreign businesses to set up shop in India, could change that, he added.India’s attempts to supplant undemocratic China and take advantage of the US’s boycotts and bans of Chinese technology firms may also invite increased scrutiny of its own human rights record.US Democrats have indicated they will call out human rights abuses around the world. After India withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir – the region it administers in part while Pakistan administers the other – and imposed a military lockdown on its residents, Biden’s vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, reminded observers: “We are watching”, suggesting a potential sore spot in India-US relations.Harris has repeatedly shown that despite her being part Indian, she may not be an easy ally for the Modi government. After India’s external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar cancelled a meeting last year when the US House Affairs Committee refused to exclude Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal – a critic of India’s Kashmir policy – Harris actively defended Jayapal’s presence, ruffling diplomatic feathers in the process.But not everyone believes that such conversations would harm the India-US economic relationship. A trade policy expert wishing to remain anonymous told Al Jazeera: “Modi has a thick skin about these things.

The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to the presidential election on ...,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"The move comes as Republicans increasingly emphasise the chance of noncitizen voting, despite little evidence of any significant risk posed.The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to thepresidential electionon November 5.The lawsuit, filed on Friday, comes in response to an executive order issued in August by Virginia’s Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin.It initiated the removal of individuals from voter registration rolls if officials are “unable to verify that they are citizens” through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.But the Justice Department says the executive order was issued with too little time before election day, violating a 90-day “quiet period” outlined in The National Voter Registration Act.That period requires official systematic removals at least three months ahead of a federal vote.“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Assistant US Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.“The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.”Youngkin had issued his order on August 7, which marked 90 days until the election. In a statement on Friday, the governor argued the executive order fell within the law.“Virginians – and Americans – will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy,” Youngkin said.He pledged state authorities “will defend these common-sense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us”.“Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period,” Youngkin said.Republicans and allies of former President Donald Trump – the current Republican candidate for the presidency – have increasingly pushedunfounded claimsof possible election malfeasance ahead of this year’s vote.Those claims echo falsehoods spread about the 2020 election, which Trump has continued to falsely say was “stolen” through fraud.Some Republican officials have also advanced baseless claims that noncitizens are voting in large enough numbers to affect the outcome. In the US, only citizens can vote.Most voter administration is determined by state officials and legislatures, with only broad parameters from the federal government. Nearly all US states require some form of voter registration to cast a ballot, although many allow the registration to be done on election day.Ahead of the 2024 elections, several states – including Texas, Tennessee, Ohio and Alabama – have passed measures requiring higher burdens of proof to show a voter’s citizenship. Democracy monitors said those efforts may disenfranchise US citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote.The Brennan Center for Justice – a non-partisan policy organisation – found that noncitizen voting in the US is exceedingly rare. There is no evidence it had any bearing on recent elections.In 2017, the centre releaseda studylooking at 23.5 million votes cast in the 2016 general election.Only 30 votes were flagged for suspected noncitizen voting. Data was not available on how many of those votes proved to have been cast by noncitizens."

All to know in 500 ...,"Sep 21, 2024 ... Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.",Last update 22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.Election day in the United States may still be several weeks away, but Americans in several parts of the country are getting a chance to cast their ballots already.In-person, advanced voting became possible in the US states of Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia this week while several other states opened up their mail-in voting processes earlier this month.Both are forms of “early voting”, a mainstay of US elections that in recent years has become a target offalse voter fraud accusations.Rights advocates say robust early voting opportunities help ensure more people can cast a ballot regardless of disability, time constraints, work, travel or other factors that could hamper them on election day, which this year is on November 5.Early voting also offers an opportunity to build enthusiasm: When Taylor Swift, who recentlyendorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, announced she would perform in Florida just before early voting begins there in October, local Democrats quickly seized on the moment.“Taylor is bringing the Eras Tour to Miami in the weekend leading up to early voting, and I look forward to seeing that energy play out in Florida!!!” the Miami-Dade Democratic Party said.Voting in US presidential elections is only broadly steered by the federal government. US states determine much of how the logistics of the vote plays out in their respective jurisdictions.Currently, every state in the country allows some form of early voting, with mail-in voting the most prevalent option.At least eight of the 50 states send all registered voters a ballot in the mail while 14 still require voters to provide a reason for why they need to cast their ballot – sometimes known as an “absentee ballot” – by mail.Most states also provide in-person voting before election day. Only three states do not.That depends on the year.In the 2020 election, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100 million voters cast their ballots before election day — representing about two-thirds of all Americans who voted that year, a record.Americans living abroad, members of the US military and people with disabilities are among the many who have traditionally chosen to vote early.A 2001 Supreme Court ruling upheld that voters did not need to provide a reason to cast an early ballot, as long as their state allows it.Early voting — in particular, mail-in voting — was at the centre of unfounded election fraud claims in 2020.That’s because Democrats have historically cast more votes by mail than Republicans, who are more likely to vote on election day. Many jurisdictions count votes cast in person before they begin counting mail-in votes although the process varies.That can create a “blue shift” or “red mirage”, in which early results in key states appear to initially show the Republican candidate leading, only to shift to the Democratic candidate as the mail-in votes are counted.In 2020, then-President Donald Trump falsely said the mail-in votingsystem was rife with fraud. The Republican ultimately lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, but he has continued to claim the vote was stolen from him.Many state legislaturesenactednew restrictions on early voting after the 2020 contest, including higher scrutiny for ballots cast by mail.But the Republican Party has more fully embraced early voting this year as Trump runs again against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris."

Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris's continued support for Israel's war in Gaza.,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris’s continued support for Israel’s war in Gaza.With the United Statespresidential electionless than four weeks away, analysts caution that Israel’sexpanding military campaignsacross the Middle East could bruise the chances of the Democratic candidate, Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Foreign policy is rarely a top priority for US voters. But Israel’s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign inLebanon, have spurred questions about the US’s role in the conflict.The administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters — particularly Arab Americans — turning against the party.With Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.“This is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,” Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Now party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.”Much of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, which has erasedentire neighbourhoodsand killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.That campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in USweapons assistance.“It’s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they’ve allowed to happen,” said Zogby.“There’s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don’t matter.”ASeptember pollby the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.That figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, hissupportamong Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.Biden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.When Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old’s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.But Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series ofescalatory strikesby Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.In a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”The Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August’sDemocratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.“People are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won’t give it to them,” said Zogby. “They’re making a mistake that will cost them votes.”While US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.Many of those voters are concentrated in a small number ofswing statesthat play an outsized role in deciding the country’s presidential elections.The Midwestern battleground state ofMichigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.Polling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.And her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.“The situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,” said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.“Since we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state’s Arab community stays home on election day,” he added.But Michigan’s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.Some believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.Others view a second term for Trump, apro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should “finish the job” in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.One group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is theUncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.During primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote “uncommitted”, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.Now, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris — but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.“As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,” a spokesperson said in a video released this week.“But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”The final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.In early October, for instance, Iran launched aballistic missile attackagainst Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehin Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.On that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.Analysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.ASeptember pollby the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.Respondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel’s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.Laura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.“Republican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they’re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,” Silver said.She pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza — and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.A February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.But Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such asyoung peopleand communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.“The pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,” he said. “The Democratic Party hasn’t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren’t listening, and they’ll pay a price for that.”"

We’ll break it down, along with major updates from the campaign trail.With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into overdrive, with last-minute appeals to voters.Need a quick breakdown of the week’s biggest political news? Look no further.We’ll get you up to speed with five key takeaways from the past seven days and an overview of where the candidates stand in the polls.There are 23 days left before the November 5 election.As of October 11, the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows Vice President Kamala Harris up by 2.5 points, with 48.5 percent support compared to former President Donald Trump’s 46 percent.Another polling average, from the website 270toWin, shows Harris again with a marginal lead, with 49.3 percent support. Trump, meanwhile, is at 46.5 percent.Harris, the Democrat, could be poised to flip one of Trump’s key demographics: suburban voters.On October 10, the news agency Reuters and the market research poll Ipsos released a poll that showed Harris led her Republican rival 47 percent to 41 among suburbanites.But two days later, The New York Times and Siena College released a poll that indicated Harris could be slipping among Black voters. She pulled in 78 percent support — a drop from the estimated 90 percent support her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, earned in 2020.Within three days of forming in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Milton had billowed into a powerful Category 5 storm, earning the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Such rapid development had rarely been seen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton “one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin”.And it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.But as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.Swaths of the US South were still recovering from September’sHurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas”.On the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Bidenslapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.“Over the last few weeks, there’s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what’s going on,” Biden said, calling the distortions “un-American”.“Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,” he added.Harris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. “This is not a time for people to play politics,” she said, in reference to the Republican.Once criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of arecent media blitz.It was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.And even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.But in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.And her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.That last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.But host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing “shifting explanations”, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.The friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to “make her look better”.He also called on the Federal Communications Commission to “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE”. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission’s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.Through much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large — even dooming one candidate’s run.After a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a “weak” and “sleepy” old man.But at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.Those questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump’s “rambling” and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.And then, on Saturday, the White House released amemotouting hisDemocratic rival’s health.The 59-year-old Harris, it read, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency”.Trump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with astatement, arguing that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung wrote of Trump.On the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.Immigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump’s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.But critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.On Monday, Trumprecorded an audio interviewwith the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump said. “Now a murderer, I believe this: It’s in their genes. And we’ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”The Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.Speaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to “expedite the removal” of “savage gangs” from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.He also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.Despite Trump’s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.Reporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.In 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician’s eventual resignation.Since then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse ofTrump’s alleged relationshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.In its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.News outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book’s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump’s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an “angry, little man”.“None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,” Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.But the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley — once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.He tells Woodward in the book that Trump is “fascist to the core”."

The Democrat led 52 percent to 46 percent in the same poll last month.The latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51 percent to 48 percent among likely voters, compared with a four-point advantage last month.Following the latest figures, Harris holds a 1.4 percent point lead in Real Clear Polling’s aggregate of major polls, slipping from 2.2 percent on Saturday.The tightening poll numbers come amid concerns among Democrats that Harris is failing to shore up support among Hispanics and African Americans, two of the party’s key constituencies.While Harris is leading among women of all races, she has struggled to drum up enthusiasm among men, including African Americans and Hispanics, who have increasingly gravitated towards Trump in recent years.In The New York Times/Siena College polls released on Saturday and Sunday, Harris attracted the support of 78 percent of Black voters and 56 percent of Hispanic voters – significantly lower shares than won by the Democratic nominees in the 2020 and 2016 elections.On Thursday, former President Barack Obama admonished Black men for not showing as much enthusiasm for Harris’s candidacy as he had received during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012.“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama said at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of seven key battleground states expected to decide the election.“Because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”Harris and Trump on Sunday continued to focus their campaigns on the battleground states, holding events in North Carolina and Arizona, respectively.At a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris took aim at Trump for spreading misinformation about the government’s response to recent hurricanes.“The problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it’s making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they’re led to believe they cannot trust,” Harris said.“And that’s the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.”Trump, meanwhile, used a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona to call for the hiring of 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents.“After I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10 percent raise – they haven’t had one in a long time – for all agents and a $10,000 each retention and signing bonus,” Trump said. “We’re going to retain them.”"

All the results are within the margin of error with the exception of Nevada, where Trump is led by 5 percent in the WSJ poll.The newspaper said it surveyed 600 registered voters per state between September 28 and October 8.US elections are not won by popular vote nationwide. Rather, candidates compete in individual states to winelectoral college votes.It’s akin to a point system, where each state is worth a number of points proportionate to the size of its population. In all but two states – Maine and Nebraska – the winner takes all the electoral college votes.Most states are almost certain to go to one party. For example, a Democratic win in California and Vermont is often projected as soon as the polls close, while states like Oklahoma and Alabama are Republican strongholds.That leaves a handful of states where there are close, competitive elections. These are known asswing states. In this round, all eyes are on the seven states polled by WSJ.In 2016, Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote because he defeated the Democratic candidateHillary Clintonin most battleground states.According to a Pew Research Centersurveyreleased on Friday, Harris is leading the race nationally by one point – 48 percent to Trump’s 47 percent.US election poll results have fluctuated in recent months. While Trump enjoyed a solid lead overJoe Bidenearlier this year in almost all polls, the Democrats received a boost after the US president stepped aside and was replaced by Harris as the party’s nominee.A Morning Consult poll in September had Harris beating Trump 51 percent to 46 percent. But the former president appeared to claw back some support amid concerns about the economy and the turmoil inthe Middle East.US election polls have also been wide off the mark in the past. For example, many surveys had indicated that Clinton was set for a comfortable win when she lost toTrump in 2016.Still, this year various polls appear to agree that the US is heading to a close presidential election next month.Control of the Senate and House of Representatives will also be up for grabs on November 5.A New York Times poll on Friday predicted bad news for Democrats’ hopes of protecting their narrow majority in the Senate.The Democrats currently control the 100-member chamber with 51 seats, including four independents who caucus with the party.But the Times survey found that Democrats are likely to lose a potentially decisive seat in a Republican-leaning state.Republicans were already expected to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia – where conservative Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.But the Times poll indicated Democratic Senator Jon Tester is trailing his Republican opponent by eight percentage points in rural Montana, where Trump won with ease in 2016 and 2020.Democrats will also have a fight on their hands to keep Senate seats in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and Nevada, but they will be hoping to challenge Republican incumbents in Texas and Florida.A Republican-controlled Senate can prove to be a major hurdle for Harris should she win in November.Beyond its legislative powers, the Senate is tasked with confirmingjudicial appointmentsand cabinet members, which would allow Republicans to pressure Harris, should she be elected, on who she chooses for her governing team."

Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier ...",28 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier under Biden.Mumbai, India –Parneesh Mehta’s diamond jewellery business may be performing much better than many other companies around the world suffering from the crushing force of lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.But the entrepreneur based in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, says that is little consolation for the revenue he has lost because of tariff hikes on the gems and jewellery sector in his biggest export market – the United States.In April 2019, the US withdrew India and Turkey from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), an import duty exemption on certain goods – including Mehta’s jewels – that require a lot of manpower to make, from developing countries.“That really hurt us,” Mehta told Al Jazeera. “We had to adjust our prices for some of our clients. For others, we dropped the quality of the gems.”With both exporters and importers feeling the pinch, Mehta says the added tax will prevent businesses from growing. “Everyone’s getting squeezed,” he said. “If the GSP was restored, there’s no doubt it would help the sector as a whole”.Mehta’s experience is one example of how the India-US economic relationship has changed under the administration of US President Donald Trump. And why many Indian entrepreneurs like him have a keen interest in who occupies the White House after the November 3 US elections.Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the US’s trade deficit with India, which stood at $28.8bn in 2019, nearly three times the $10.6bn figure in 2008. In March 2019, he called India “a very high-tariff nation” and has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to redress the gap. India later retaliated, raising duties on 28 US products.Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have famously enjoyed afriendly rapport, but analysts say Trump’s punitive policies have made the economic environment more contentious. The two sides have repeatedlyfailed to signeven a “mini trade deal” that had initially been expected in September 2019.“There’s been a lot of positive engagement, but in reality, we are far from getting anything ratified,” Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi told Al Jazeera.This could change if Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, becomes the next US president and brings with him a more measured policymaking machine.“A Biden administration would not necessarily back down on big-ticket requests,” says Dhar, referring to the US’s push for greater access to India’s agriculture, medical device and e-commerce markets, and even for lower import tariffs on Harley Davidson motorbikes.“But we’d be unlikely to see the same aggression towards trade partners. This could lead to a better outcome for Indian negotiators”.Trump’s trade policies and negotiating stance may be based on populist impulses, but India is also taking an increasingly protectionist line.India’s incoming data protection bill has become one of the thorniest issues in negations.The bill threatens to prevent Indian data from leaving its shores, making life difficult for global technology giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google that rely on the free-flow of data.It also threatens to tax digital companies in a way that would also disproportionately affect US technology firms. The US has called this type of taxation “unfair” and “discriminatory” and has said it will “begin investigations” into how its trading partners are implementing such laws.After its economy suffered a historic shock (gross domestic product shrank by a record 23.9 percent in the April-June quarter), exacerbating an urgent need to create more blue- and white-collar jobs, analysts say India cannot afford to close itself off from negotiating a more favourable US trading relationship.“India needs to recognise that a trade relationship with the US is extremely beneficial for economic growth,” Anupam Manur, a research fellow at the Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately though, we may see nationalistic jingo and political point-scoring continue to take the upper hand”.However, recent investments by Facebook and Google in Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, could drive a change of mindset.Reliance is India’s largest and most influential company. With two major US tech giants taking a seat each on its board, analysts say this could strengthen the hand of US companies lobbying the Indian government to liberalise a wide range of issues governing India’s digital platforms.For this reason “I wouldn’t rule out a policy U-turn,” said JNU’s Dhar.But, regardless of the outcome of the US election, analysts believe progress on a trade agreement will hinge on the US securing greater access to India’s huge, yet fragmented, agricultural markets.India, however, is reluctant to endanger its mostly small-scale, independent producers by forcing them to compete with giant US agribusinesses. And with the global economic downturn set to drag on, as well as a strong farming lobby to placate at home, observers say a future Biden administration would likely take a hard line similar to Trump’s.September’shistoric changes to India’s farm laws, which will open up produce markets to private players, could also complicate matters. “Farmers already have apprehensions about these ordinances,” said Dhar. “Allowing American access on top of that means the situation could become very problematic”.With US unemployment at a high 8.4 percent and the country experiencing the toughest economic conditions since the Great Depression, analysts say there may be little political room for either of the two contenders to deviate from the US’s existing – and increasingly nativist – trade policies.“Let’s remember that Biden also has a ‘Made in America’ plan and has made an effort to appear tough on China,” explained Takshashila Institution’s Manur. “His talk of subsidising industry, which is against the World Trade Organisation rules, tells me he will also be protectionist”.The White House’s recent announcement of plans to reduce the number of visas awarded to skilled workers by a third is one such area where Biden’s hands may be tied.Last year, 74.5 percent of so-called H1-B visas were claimed by Indians, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, plugging a shortage of highly skilled labour in the US’s technology industries. High-profile Indian CEOs such as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Google’s parent Alphabet have also played an outsized role in contributing to Silicon Valley’s success.Despite this, Indians look set to miss out on future opportunities.“Like with the 2008 global financial crisis, the immigration issue has become mixed up in the feelings surrounding the downturn,” says Dhar. “[Biden] will eventually re-look at visa policies once the economy rebounds, but not before that”.But a change of US leadership could mean a return to more nuanced, rules-based decision-making. Consequently, there are hopes in India that the Iran nuclear deal, originally signed under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and abandoned by Trump, will be back on the table.This would help India, which lost an important export market, a valuable source of cheap oil and a potential stake in a key port by complying with US sanctions. “Iran has always been a strategic ally in the region,” says Dhar. “I hope this situation would improve if a new administration comes in”.India is likely to remain a key ally for the US as geopolitical tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific region. In a speech during his visit to India earlier this year, Trump clubbed the two nations together as “powerful defenders of peace and liberty”, drawing a blunt contrast with China – the other great regional power. Biden too has said he would “stand with India”, promising to tackle terror threats in the region together.As the US decouples itself from China’s economy, India is trying to take its place. Modi has pitched India as a “trusted partner” and welcomed foreign direct investment. In reality, US businesses are reluctant to leave China or disrupt their supply chains; and for the few that do, India is unlikely to be their preferred destination.“At most, US companies are hedging, perhaps moving 30 percent of their operations to Vietnam or Laos – India is not attractive to companies yet,” said Takshashila Institution’s Manur. But the current reforms to labour and land laws, which would make it easier for foreign businesses to set up shop in India, could change that, he added.India’s attempts to supplant undemocratic China and take advantage of the US’s boycotts and bans of Chinese technology firms may also invite increased scrutiny of its own human rights record.US Democrats have indicated they will call out human rights abuses around the world. After India withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir – the region it administers in part while Pakistan administers the other – and imposed a military lockdown on its residents, Biden’s vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, reminded observers: “We are watching”, suggesting a potential sore spot in India-US relations.Harris has repeatedly shown that despite her being part Indian, she may not be an easy ally for the Modi government. After India’s external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar cancelled a meeting last year when the US House Affairs Committee refused to exclude Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal – a critic of India’s Kashmir policy – Harris actively defended Jayapal’s presence, ruffling diplomatic feathers in the process.But not everyone believes that such conversations would harm the India-US economic relationship. A trade policy expert wishing to remain anonymous told Al Jazeera: “Modi has a thick skin about these things. Any criticism of human rights will wash off his back”.Tish Sanghera is a journalist based in Mumbai, where she writes about economic, political and social issues. Twitter: @TishSanghera"

The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to the presidential election on ...,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"The move comes as Republicans increasingly emphasise the chance of noncitizen voting, despite little evidence of any significant risk posed.The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to thepresidential electionon November 5.The lawsuit, filed on Friday, comes in response to an executive order issued in August by Virginia’s Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin.It initiated the removal of individuals from voter registration rolls if officials are “unable to verify that they are citizens” through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.But the Justice Department says the executive order was issued with too little time before election day, violating a 90-day “quiet period” outlined in The National Voter Registration Act.That period requires official systematic removals at least three months ahead of a federal vote.“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Assistant US Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.“The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.”Youngkin had issued his order on August 7, which marked 90 days until the election. In a statement on Friday, the governor argued the executive order fell within the law.“Virginians – and Americans – will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy,” Youngkin said.He pledged state authorities “will defend these common-sense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us”.“Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period,” Youngkin said.Republicans and allies of former President Donald Trump – the current Republican candidate for the presidency – have increasingly pushedunfounded claimsof possible election malfeasance ahead of this year’s vote.Those claims echo falsehoods spread about the 2020 election, which Trump has continued to falsely say was “stolen” through fraud.Some Republican officials have also advanced baseless claims that noncitizens are voting in large enough numbers to affect the outcome. In the US, only citizens can vote.Most voter administration is determined by state officials and legislatures, with only broad parameters from the federal government. Nearly all US states require some form of voter registration to cast a ballot, although many allow the registration to be done on election day.Ahead of the 2024 elections, several states – including Texas, Tennessee, Ohio and Alabama – have passed measures requiring higher burdens of proof to show a voter’s citizenship. Democracy monitors said those efforts may disenfranchise US citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote.The Brennan Center for Justice – a non-partisan policy organisation – found that noncitizen voting in the US is exceedingly rare. There is no evidence it had any bearing on recent elections.In 2017, the centre releaseda studylooking at 23.5 million votes cast in the 2016 general election.Only 30 votes were flagged for suspected noncitizen voting. Data was not available on how many of those votes proved to have been cast by noncitizens."

All to know in 500 ...,"Sep 21, 2024 ... Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.",Last update 22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.Election day in the United States may still be several weeks away, but Americans in several parts of the country are getting a chance to cast their ballots already.In-person, advanced voting became possible in the US states of Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia this week while several other states opened up their mail-in voting processes earlier this month.Both are forms of “early voting”, a mainstay of US elections that in recent years has become a target offalse voter fraud accusations.Rights advocates say robust early voting opportunities help ensure more people can cast a ballot regardless of disability, time constraints, work, travel or other factors that could hamper them on election day, which this year is on November 5.Early voting also offers an opportunity to build enthusiasm: When Taylor Swift, who recentlyendorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, announced she would perform in Florida just before early voting begins there in October, local Democrats quickly seized on the moment.“Taylor is bringing the Eras Tour to Miami in the weekend leading up to early voting, and I look forward to seeing that energy play out in Florida!!!” the Miami-Dade Democratic Party said.Voting in US presidential elections is only broadly steered by the federal government. US states determine much of how the logistics of the vote plays out in their respective jurisdictions.Currently, every state in the country allows some form of early voting, with mail-in voting the most prevalent option.At least eight of the 50 states send all registered voters a ballot in the mail while 14 still require voters to provide a reason for why they need to cast their ballot – sometimes known as an “absentee ballot” – by mail.Most states also provide in-person voting before election day. Only three states do not.That depends on the year.In the 2020 election, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100 million voters cast their ballots before election day — representing about two-thirds of all Americans who voted that year, a record.Americans living abroad, members of the US military and people with disabilities are among the many who have traditionally chosen to vote early.A 2001 Supreme Court ruling upheld that voters did not need to provide a reason to cast an early ballot, as long as their state allows it.Early voting — in particular, mail-in voting — was at the centre of unfounded election fraud claims in 2020.That’s because Democrats have historically cast more votes by mail than Republicans, who are more likely to vote on election day. Many jurisdictions count votes cast in person before they begin counting mail-in votes although the process varies.That can create a “blue shift” or “red mirage”, in which early results in key states appear to initially show the Republican candidate leading, only to shift to the Democratic candidate as the mail-in votes are counted.In 2020, then-President Donald Trump falsely said the mail-in votingsystem was rife with fraud. The Republican ultimately lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, but he has continued to claim the vote was stolen from him.Many state legislaturesenactednew restrictions on early voting after the 2020 contest, including higher scrutiny for ballots cast by mail.But the Republican Party has more fully embraced early voting this year as Trump runs again against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris."

Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris's continued support for Israel's war in Gaza.,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris’s continued support for Israel’s war in Gaza.With the United Statespresidential electionless than four weeks away, analysts caution that Israel’sexpanding military campaignsacross the Middle East could bruise the chances of the Democratic candidate, Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Foreign policy is rarely a top priority for US voters. But Israel’s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign inLebanon, have spurred questions about the US’s role in the conflict.The administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters — particularly Arab Americans — turning against the party.With Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.“This is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,” Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Now party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.”Much of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, which has erasedentire neighbourhoodsand killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.That campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in USweapons assistance.“It’s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they’ve allowed to happen,” said Zogby.“There’s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don’t matter.”ASeptember pollby the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.That figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, hissupportamong Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.Biden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.When Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old’s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.But Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series ofescalatory strikesby Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.In a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”The Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August’sDemocratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.“People are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won’t give it to them,” said Zogby. “They’re making a mistake that will cost them votes.”While US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.Many of those voters are concentrated in a small number ofswing statesthat play an outsized role in deciding the country’s presidential elections.The Midwestern battleground state ofMichigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.Polling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.And her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.“The situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,” said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.“Since we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state’s Arab community stays home on election day,” he added.But Michigan’s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.Some believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.Others view a second term for Trump, apro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should “finish the job” in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.One group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is theUncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.During primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote “uncommitted”, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.Now, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris — but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.“As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,” a spokesperson said in a video released this week.“But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”The final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.In early October, for instance, Iran launched aballistic missile attackagainst Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehin Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.On that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.Analysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.ASeptember pollby the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.Respondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel’s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.Laura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.“Republican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they’re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,” Silver said.She pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza — and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.A February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.But Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such asyoung peopleand communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.“The pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,” he said. “The Democratic Party hasn’t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren’t listening, and they’ll pay a price for that.”"

We’ll break it down, along with major updates from the campaign trail.With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into overdrive, with last-minute appeals to voters.Need a quick breakdown of the week’s biggest political news? Look no further.We’ll get you up to speed with five key takeaways from the past seven days and an overview of where the candidates stand in the polls.There are 23 days left before the November 5 election.As of October 11, the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows Vice President Kamala Harris up by 2.5 points, with 48.5 percent support compared to former President Donald Trump’s 46 percent.Another polling average, from the website 270toWin, shows Harris again with a marginal lead, with 49.3 percent support. Trump, meanwhile, is at 46.5 percent.Harris, the Democrat, could be poised to flip one of Trump’s key demographics: suburban voters.On October 10, the news agency Reuters and the market research poll Ipsos released a poll that showed Harris led her Republican rival 47 percent to 41 among suburbanites.But two days later, The New York Times and Siena College released a poll that indicated Harris could be slipping among Black voters. She pulled in 78 percent support — a drop from the estimated 90 percent support her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, earned in 2020.Within three days of forming in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Milton had billowed into a powerful Category 5 storm, earning the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Such rapid development had rarely been seen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton “one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin”.And it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.But as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.Swaths of the US South were still recovering from September’sHurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas”.On the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Bidenslapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.“Over the last few weeks, there’s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what’s going on,” Biden said, calling the distortions “un-American”.“Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,” he added.Harris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. “This is not a time for people to play politics,” she said, in reference to the Republican.Once criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of arecent media blitz.It was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.And even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.But in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.And her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.That last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.But host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing “shifting explanations”, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.The friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to “make her look better”.He also called on the Federal Communications Commission to “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE”. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission’s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.Through much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large — even dooming one candidate’s run.After a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a “weak” and “sleepy” old man.But at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.Those questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump’s “rambling” and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.And then, on Saturday, the White House released amemotouting hisDemocratic rival’s health.The 59-year-old Harris, it read, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency”.Trump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with astatement, arguing that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung wrote of Trump.On the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.Immigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump’s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.But critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.On Monday, Trumprecorded an audio interviewwith the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump said. “Now a murderer, I believe this: It’s in their genes. And we’ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”The Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.Speaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to “expedite the removal” of “savage gangs” from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.He also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.Despite Trump’s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.Reporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.In 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician’s eventual resignation.Since then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse ofTrump’s alleged relationshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.In its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.News outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book’s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump’s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an “angry, little man”.“None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,” Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.But the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley — once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.He tells Woodward in the book that Trump is “fascist to the core”."

The Democrat led 52 percent to 46 percent in the same poll last month.The latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51 percent to 48 percent among likely voters, compared with a four-point advantage last month.Following the latest figures, Harris holds a 1.4 percent point lead in Real Clear Polling’s aggregate of major polls, slipping from 2.2 percent on Saturday.The tightening poll numbers come amid concerns among Democrats that Harris is failing to shore up support among Hispanics and African Americans, two of the party’s key constituencies.While Harris is leading among women of all races, she has struggled to drum up enthusiasm among men, including African Americans and Hispanics, who have increasingly gravitated towards Trump in recent years.In The New York Times/Siena College polls released on Saturday and Sunday, Harris attracted the support of 78 percent of Black voters and 56 percent of Hispanic voters – significantly lower shares than won by the Democratic nominees in the 2020 and 2016 elections.On Thursday, former President Barack Obama admonished Black men for not showing as much enthusiasm for Harris’s candidacy as he had received during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012.“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama said at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of seven key battleground states expected to decide the election.“Because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”Harris and Trump on Sunday continued to focus their campaigns on the battleground states, holding events in North Carolina and Arizona, respectively.At a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris took aim at Trump for spreading misinformation about the government’s response to recent hurricanes.“The problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it’s making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they’re led to believe they cannot trust,” Harris said.“And that’s the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.”Trump, meanwhile, used a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona to call for the hiring of 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents.“After I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10 percent raise – they haven’t had one in a long time – for all agents and a $10,000 each retention and signing bonus,” Trump said. “We’re going to retain them.”"

All the results are within the margin of error with the exception of Nevada, where Trump is led by 5 percent in the WSJ poll.The newspaper said it surveyed 600 registered voters per state between September 28 and October 8.US elections are not won by popular vote nationwide. Rather, candidates compete in individual states to winelectoral college votes.It’s akin to a point system, where each state is worth a number of points proportionate to the size of its population. In all but two states – Maine and Nebraska – the winner takes all the electoral college votes.Most states are almost certain to go to one party. For example, a Democratic win in California and Vermont is often projected as soon as the polls close, while states like Oklahoma and Alabama are Republican strongholds.That leaves a handful of states where there are close, competitive elections. These are known asswing states. In this round, all eyes are on the seven states polled by WSJ.In 2016, Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote because he defeated the Democratic candidateHillary Clintonin most battleground states.According to a Pew Research Centersurveyreleased on Friday, Harris is leading the race nationally by one point – 48 percent to Trump’s 47 percent.US election poll results have fluctuated in recent months. While Trump enjoyed a solid lead overJoe Bidenearlier this year in almost all polls, the Democrats received a boost after the US president stepped aside and was replaced by Harris as the party’s nominee.A Morning Consult poll in September had Harris beating Trump 51 percent to 46 percent. But the former president appeared to claw back some support amid concerns about the economy and the turmoil inthe Middle East.US election polls have also been wide off the mark in the past. For example, many surveys had indicated that Clinton was set for a comfortable win when she lost toTrump in 2016.Still, this year various polls appear to agree that the US is heading to a close presidential election next month.Control of the Senate and House of Representatives will also be up for grabs on November 5.A New York Times poll on Friday predicted bad news for Democrats’ hopes of protecting their narrow majority in the Senate.The Democrats currently control the 100-member chamber with 51 seats, including four independents who caucus with the party.But the Times survey found that Democrats are likely to lose a potentially decisive seat in a Republican-leaning state.Republicans were already expected to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia – where conservative Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.But the Times poll indicated Democratic Senator Jon Tester is trailing his Republican opponent by eight percentage points in rural Montana, where Trump won with ease in 2016 and 2020.Democrats will also have a fight on their hands to keep Senate seats in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and Nevada, but they will be hoping to challenge Republican incumbents in Texas and Florida.A Republican-controlled Senate can prove to be a major hurdle for Harris should she win in November.Beyond its legislative powers, the Senate is tasked with confirmingjudicial appointmentsand cabinet members, which would allow Republicans to pressure Harris, should she be elected, on who she chooses for her governing team."

Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier ...",28 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier under Biden.Mumbai, India –Parneesh Mehta’s diamond jewellery business may be performing much better than many other companies around the world suffering from the crushing force of lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.But the entrepreneur based in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, says that is little consolation for the revenue he has lost because of tariff hikes on the gems and jewellery sector in his biggest export market – the United States.In April 2019, the US withdrew India and Turkey from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), an import duty exemption on certain goods – including Mehta’s jewels – that require a lot of manpower to make, from developing countries.“That really hurt us,” Mehta told Al Jazeera. “We had to adjust our prices for some of our clients. For others, we dropped the quality of the gems.”With both exporters and importers feeling the pinch, Mehta says the added tax will prevent businesses from growing. “Everyone’s getting squeezed,” he said. “If the GSP was restored, there’s no doubt it would help the sector as a whole”.Mehta’s experience is one example of how the India-US economic relationship has changed under the administration of US President Donald Trump. And why many Indian entrepreneurs like him have a keen interest in who occupies the White House after the November 3 US elections.Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the US’s trade deficit with India, which stood at $28.8bn in 2019, nearly three times the $10.6bn figure in 2008. In March 2019, he called India “a very high-tariff nation” and has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to redress the gap. India later retaliated, raising duties on 28 US products.Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have famously enjoyed afriendly rapport, but analysts say Trump’s punitive policies have made the economic environment more contentious. The two sides have repeatedlyfailed to signeven a “mini trade deal” that had initially been expected in September 2019.“There’s been a lot of positive engagement, but in reality, we are far from getting anything ratified,” Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi told Al Jazeera.This could change if Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, becomes the next US president and brings with him a more measured policymaking machine.“A Biden administration would not necessarily back down on big-ticket requests,” says Dhar, referring to the US’s push for greater access to India’s agriculture, medical device and e-commerce markets, and even for lower import tariffs on Harley Davidson motorbikes.“But we’d be unlikely to see the same aggression towards trade partners. This could lead to a better outcome for Indian negotiators”.Trump’s trade policies and negotiating stance may be based on populist impulses, but India is also taking an increasingly protectionist line.India’s incoming data protection bill has become one of the thorniest issues in negations.The bill threatens to prevent Indian data from leaving its shores, making life difficult for global technology giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google that rely on the free-flow of data.It also threatens to tax digital companies in a way that would also disproportionately affect US technology firms. The US has called this type of taxation “unfair” and “discriminatory” and has said it will “begin investigations” into how its trading partners are implementing such laws.After its economy suffered a historic shock (gross domestic product shrank by a record 23.9 percent in the April-June quarter), exacerbating an urgent need to create more blue- and white-collar jobs, analysts say India cannot afford to close itself off from negotiating a more favourable US trading relationship.“India needs to recognise that a trade relationship with the US is extremely beneficial for economic growth,” Anupam Manur, a research fellow at the Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately though, we may see nationalistic jingo and political point-scoring continue to take the upper hand”.However, recent investments by Facebook and Google in Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, could drive a change of mindset.Reliance is India’s largest and most influential company. With two major US tech giants taking a seat each on its board, analysts say this could strengthen the hand of US companies lobbying the Indian government to liberalise a wide range of issues governing India’s digital platforms.For this reason “I wouldn’t rule out a policy U-turn,” said JNU’s Dhar.But, regardless of the outcome of the US election, analysts believe progress on a trade agreement will hinge on the US securing greater access to India’s huge, yet fragmented, agricultural markets.India, however, is reluctant to endanger its mostly small-scale, independent producers by forcing them to compete with giant US agribusinesses. And with the global economic downturn set to drag on, as well as a strong farming lobby to placate at home, observers say a future Biden administration would likely take a hard line similar to Trump’s.September’shistoric changes to India’s farm laws, which will open up produce markets to private players, could also complicate matters. “Farmers already have apprehensions about these ordinances,” said Dhar. “Allowing American access on top of that means the situation could become very problematic”.With US unemployment at a high 8.4 percent and the country experiencing the toughest economic conditions since the Great Depression, analysts say there may be little political room for either of the two contenders to deviate from the US’s existing – and increasingly nativist – trade policies.“Let’s remember that Biden also has a ‘Made in America’ plan and has made an effort to appear tough on China,” explained Takshashila Institution’s Manur. “His talk of subsidising industry, which is against the World Trade Organisation rules, tells me he will also be protectionist”.The White House’s recent announcement of plans to reduce the number of visas awarded to skilled workers by a third is one such area where Biden’s hands may be tied.Last year, 74.5 percent of so-called H1-B visas were claimed by Indians, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, plugging a shortage of highly skilled labour in the US’s technology industries. High-profile Indian CEOs such as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Google’s parent Alphabet have also played an outsized role in contributing to Silicon Valley’s success.Despite this, Indians look set to miss out on future opportunities.“Like with the 2008 global financial crisis, the immigration issue has become mixed up in the feelings surrounding the downturn,” says Dhar. “[Biden] will eventually re-look at visa policies once the economy rebounds, but not before that”.But a change of US leadership could mean a return to more nuanced, rules-based decision-making. Consequently, there are hopes in India that the Iran nuclear deal, originally signed under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and abandoned by Trump, will be back on the table.This would help India, which lost an important export market, a valuable source of cheap oil and a potential stake in a key port by complying with US sanctions. “Iran has always been a strategic ally in the region,” says Dhar. “I hope this situation would improve if a new administration comes in”.India is likely to remain a key ally for the US as geopolitical tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific region. In a speech during his visit to India earlier this year, Trump clubbed the two nations together as “powerful defenders of peace and liberty”, drawing a blunt contrast with China – the other great regional power. Biden too has said he would “stand with India”, promising to tackle terror threats in the region together.As the US decouples itself from China’s economy, India is trying to take its place. Modi has pitched India as a “trusted partner” and welcomed foreign direct investment. In reality, US businesses are reluctant to leave China or disrupt their supply chains; and for the few that do, India is unlikely to be their preferred destination.“At most, US companies are hedging, perhaps moving 30 percent of their operations to Vietnam or Laos – India is not attractive to companies yet,” said Takshashila Institution’s Manur. But the current reforms to labour and land laws, which would make it easier for foreign businesses to set up shop in India, could change that, he added.India’s attempts to supplant undemocratic China and take advantage of the US’s boycotts and bans of Chinese technology firms may also invite increased scrutiny of its own human rights record.US Democrats have indicated they will call out human rights abuses around the world. After India withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir – the region it administers in part while Pakistan administers the other – and imposed a military lockdown on its residents, Biden’s vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, reminded observers: “We are watching”, suggesting a potential sore spot in India-US relations.Harris has repeatedly shown that despite her being part Indian, she may not be an easy ally for the Modi government. After India’s external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar cancelled a meeting last year when the US House Affairs Committee refused to exclude Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal – a critic of India’s Kashmir policy – Harris actively defended Jayapal’s presence, ruffling diplomatic feathers in the process.But not everyone believes that such conversations would harm the India-US economic relationship. A trade policy expert wishing to remain anonymous told Al Jazeera: “Modi has a thick skin about these things. Any criticism of human rights will wash off his back”.Tish Sanghera is a journalist based in Mumbai, where she writes about economic, political and social issues. Twitter: @TishSanghera"

The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to the presidential election on ...,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"The move comes as Republicans increasingly emphasise the chance of noncitizen voting, despite little evidence of any significant risk posed.The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to thepresidential electionon November 5.The lawsuit, filed on Friday, comes in response to an executive order issued in August by Virginia’s Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin.It initiated the removal of individuals from voter registration rolls if officials are “unable to verify that they are citizens” through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.But the Justice Department says the executive order was issued with too little time before election day, violating a 90-day “quiet period” outlined in The National Voter Registration Act.That period requires official systematic removals at least three months ahead of a federal vote.“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Assistant US Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.“The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.”Youngkin had issued his order on August 7, which marked 90 days until the election. In a statement on Friday, the governor argued the executive order fell within the law.“Virginians – and Americans – will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy,” Youngkin said.He pledged state authorities “will defend these common-sense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us”.“Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period,” Youngkin said.Republicans and allies of former President Donald Trump – the current Republican candidate for the presidency – have increasingly pushedunfounded claimsof possible election malfeasance ahead of this year’s vote.Those claims echo falsehoods spread about the 2020 election, which Trump has continued to falsely say was “stolen” through fraud.Some Republican officials have also advanced baseless claims that noncitizens are voting in large enough numbers to affect the outcome. In the US, only citizens can vote.Most voter administration is determined by state officials and legislatures, with only broad parameters from the federal government. Nearly all US states require some form of voter registration to cast a ballot, although many allow the registration to be done on election day.Ahead of the 2024 elections, several states – including Texas, Tennessee, Ohio and Alabama – have passed measures requiring higher burdens of proof to show a voter’s citizenship. Democracy monitors said those efforts may disenfranchise US citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote.The Brennan Center for Justice – a non-partisan policy organisation – found that noncitizen voting in the US is exceedingly rare. There is no evidence it had any bearing on recent elections.In 2017, the centre releaseda studylooking at 23.5 million votes cast in the 2016 general election.Only 30 votes were flagged for suspected noncitizen voting. Data was not available on how many of those votes proved to have been cast by noncitizens."

Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.",Last update 22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.Election day in the United States may still be several weeks away, but Americans in several parts of the country are getting a chance to cast their ballots already.In-person, advanced voting became possible in the US states of Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia this week while several other states opened up their mail-in voting processes earlier this month.Both are forms of “early voting”, a mainstay of US elections that in recent years has become a target offalse voter fraud accusations.Rights advocates say robust early voting opportunities help ensure more people can cast a ballot regardless of disability, time constraints, work, travel or other factors that could hamper them on election day, which this year is on November 5.Early voting also offers an opportunity to build enthusiasm: When Taylor Swift, who recentlyendorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, announced she would perform in Florida just before early voting begins there in October, local Democrats quickly seized on the moment.“Taylor is bringing the Eras Tour to Miami in the weekend leading up to early voting, and I look forward to seeing that energy play out in Florida!!!” the Miami-Dade Democratic Party said.Voting in US presidential elections is only broadly steered by the federal government. US states determine much of how the logistics of the vote plays out in their respective jurisdictions.Currently, every state in the country allows some form of early voting, with mail-in voting the most prevalent option.At least eight of the 50 states send all registered voters a ballot in the mail while 14 still require voters to provide a reason for why they need to cast their ballot – sometimes known as an “absentee ballot” – by mail.Most states also provide in-person voting before election day. Only three states do not.That depends on the year.In the 2020 election, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100 million voters cast their ballots before election day — representing about two-thirds of all Americans who voted that year, a record.Americans living abroad, members of the US military and people with disabilities are among the many who have traditionally chosen to vote early.A 2001 Supreme Court ruling upheld that voters did not need to provide a reason to cast an early ballot, as long as their state allows it.Early voting — in particular, mail-in voting — was at the centre of unfounded election fraud claims in 2020.That’s because Democrats have historically cast more votes by mail than Republicans, who are more likely to vote on election day. Many jurisdictions count votes cast in person before they begin counting mail-in votes although the process varies.That can create a “blue shift” or “red mirage”, in which early results in key states appear to initially show the Republican candidate leading, only to shift to the Democratic candidate as the mail-in votes are counted.In 2020, then-President Donald Trump falsely said the mail-in votingsystem was rife with fraud. The Republican ultimately lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, but he has continued to claim the vote was stolen from him.Many state legislaturesenactednew restrictions on early voting after the 2020 contest, including higher scrutiny for ballots cast by mail.But the Republican Party has more fully embraced early voting this year as Trump runs again against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris."

Despite you, I and the political class, the vast majority of Americans are not paying attention to the election,” said Erik Nisbet, a professor of policy analysis and communications at Northwestern University.“People don’t tune in until September,” he told Al Jazeera. “At this point though, it’s important to get your narratives out. It’s important to get your base solidified and mobilised.”Most polls show a tight race between Biden and Trump as the election nears, with experts saying the contest will likely come down to how the candidates fare in critical swing states like Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.But there is also widespread frustration that the choice this election cycle is the same as in 2020, when Biden defeated Trump to win the White House.A recentPew Research Center pollfound that nearly half of all registered voters said they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot if they could.About two-thirds of respondents said they had little to no confidence that Biden is physically fit enough to be president, the poll said, while a similar number said they did not believe Trump would act ethically in office.“It is Election 2.0,” said Jan Leighley, a political science professor at American University in Washington, DC.“I think that creates a disincentive for voting, which again comes back on the campaigns to convince people that, even though it’s the same choice, there’s still a reason to vote.”For the Biden camp, the message so far has been that a vote for the Democratic incumbent is avote for democratic ideals. “Democracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot,” Biden said in January.But that message is failing to resonate among key segments of the Democratic base who are angered by the Biden administration’s unequivocal support for Israel amid its war in Gaza.The recent wave of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses has highlighted a generational divide over the US’s relationship with Israel, and that, in turn, couldpose a serious problemfor Biden as he seeks the youth vote in November.In 2020, Biden won about 60 percent support among voters aged 18 to 29.But arecent CNN pollshowed Biden trailing Trump — 51 percent to 40 percent — among voters under age 35, and experts say a lack of enthusiasm among young voters could spell trouble.“We know how college students are feeling,” said Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairperson for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party.“And I can tell you for sure that there are too many who would stay home” on November 5 if Biden does not change his Middle East policy, Pyarali added. “I doubt that people would switch over to Trump, but they would certainly not vote.”According to Nisbet at Northwestern University, Biden’s campaign needs to focus in the coming months on “getting the Democratic house in order” before it tries to appeal to the relatively small number of undecided voters in the country.Any protests at the Democratic National Convention, for example, could hurt him. Democrats will gather in Chicago in August to formally confirm Biden as their 2024 nominee.“The Democratic Party, or at least the Biden campaign, does not want any dissension within the [party] because it’s a bad visual,” said Nisbet.Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Trump’s campaign has unfolded against unprecedented legal turmoil.The former president faces four separate criminal cases, includingan ongoing trialin New York over allegations he falsified business records related to a hush-money payment made to an adult film star.While the indictments have done little so far to dent Trump’s support among Republican voters, somepolling suggeststhat a chunk of the US electorate would not vote for him if he were convicted in any of the cases.Trump is expected to be confirmed as the Republican Party’s 2024 nominee at the party’s convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.“The conventions go on over the summer, but there’s usually not a whole lot of activity campaign-wise,” said Leighley at American University.But this year might be different, given Trump’s court hearings and the pressure on Biden over the Gaza war. “Those could be unusual bumps, if you will, that provide campaigns opportunities to do more in terms of ads,” she said.Both Leighley and Nisbet saidthe US economyis always an important election issue, and it will continue to be a focus over the next few months of campaigning.Despite positive economic indicators, many Americans believe they are worse off now than when Trump was in the White House, recent polls have suggested.“There is a big gap where people, for whatever reason — it could be because of the economics, it could be a bias of memory — they look more favourably at Trump’s then-presidency than Biden’s current one overall,” said Nisbet.He added that the economy is hurting Biden among Latino and Black voters, as well as young people, all of whom are key segments of the Democratic base.“Trump will want to talk about how bad the economy is,” said Nisbet, while Biden’s team instead will “try to change the conversation” and pivot to other issues.That includes access to abortion. Biden has made defending access to reproductive healthcare a central plank of his re-election campaign, repeatedlycondemning Trumpand Republican Party lawmakers for supporting abortion restrictions.In 2022, under Trump, the US Supreme Court formed a conservative “supermajority”, allowing it tooverturn Roe v Wade, a landmark 1973 ruling that established abortion access as a constitutional right.Eliminating Roe had been a conservative priority for decades, and several Republican-led states have since enacted strict limits on abortion.According to Leighley, “there will be an emphasis on the issue of abortion and Trump’s role in that and the Republican Party and its plans” as the presidential campaigns inch closer to the fall months of September and October.That is also when the first debate between Biden and Trump could take place.The Commission on Presidential Debatesreiteratedon Wednesday that the first televised face-off between the candidates would take place on September 16, confirming dates announced late last year.The announcement came after Trump’s team had urged the commission to move the schedule forward.There has been uncertainty around the 2024 debates, particularly as Trump eschewed participating in any during the Republican primary process. But last week, both Biden and Trump said they were up for it.“I honestly don’t know if either one wants them, but it is an American tradition — and I think it really would hurt American democracy if we did not have presidential debates,” said Nesbit.“It’s a major aspect of our tradition in the United States. And having presidential debates, even if they don’t change anyone’s minds — and they rarely do — I think it’s important for Americans to hear their two candidates at least air their perspectives.”"

For two decades, President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.",Last update 6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"For two decades, Russian President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Moscow wouldbackUS Vice PresidentKamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s nominee, in presidentialelectionsin November.The nature of Putin’s comments suggests he was joking, or trolling the Harris campaign, at a time when the US government under the Joe Biden administration has levelled new allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in the November vote, to favour former President Donald Trump.Yet whatever Putin’s motivations for the comments on Harris, they are the latest iteration of the Russian leader’s attempts to inject Moscow into the US electoral process.This is not the first time Putin has thrown his support behind a US presidential candidate.Putinhimself has been in Russia’s top job since 2012. He was also president between 2000 and 2008.Al Jazeera recaps two decades of the Russian president’s tongue-in-cheek meddling in US elections.At an economic forum in the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, Putin wryly said that current President Joe Biden was his “favourite”.Since Biden has dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, she was Putin’s next best bet, the Russian leader teased.He added that Harris has an “expressive and infectious laugh”, which indicates “she’s doing well”. The audience broke into scatted laughter as he said that if Harris is doing well, maybe she would not impose sanctions on Russia.“I don’t know if I’m insulted or he did me a favour,” Republican challengerTrumpresponded at a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.Putin’s comments came a day after the US Department of Justice accused Russian-owned state broadcaster RT of campaigning to sway the US vote, indicting two Russian journalists.But this isn’t the first time that Putin has stirred the pot of US domestic politics.In October 2004, Putin endorsed Republican incumbent President George W Bush. He said that if Bush lost it would lead to the “spread of terrorism” globally.Bush had been facing criticism from Democratic challenger John Kerry for not adequately tackling “terrorism”.This was amid thewar on Iraqwhich started in 2003 after the US under Bush invaded the country.Bush defeated Kerry in the 2004 race and was re-elected as president.While Putin did not make a clear endorsement in the 2008 US presidential race, experts were clear that a win for DemocratBarack Obamaover Republican John McCain was Russia’s preferred outcome.While both Obama and McCain held a harsh stance on Russia, Kremlin officials believed that under Obama, a newcomer at the time, US-Russia relations could start with a clean slate unlike under Cold War veteran McCain.After being in office for two terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin was constitutionally barred from assuming the role of president for a third consecutive term.Hence, Dmitry Medvedev rose to the top job with Putin as his premier. However, it was widely believed in Russia and globally at the time that Putin continued to hold real power in Russia. It was said that Putin and Medvedev ruled in “tandemocracy”.Obama won the 2008 election.Ahead of the 2012 US presidential race, in which Obama was taking on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Putin told Russian state media that Obama was “an honest person who really wants to change much for the better”.Romney had deemed Russia the top “geopolitical foe” of the US, something Putin said Romney was “mistaken” about, during the same interview.Obama defeated Romney in the 2012 election.Ahead of the 2016 US election, Putin spoke highly of Trump during an annual news conference with reporters.“He is a bright and talented person without any doubt,” he said, adding that Trump is “outstanding and talented”.Trump was up against Democratic challengerHilary Clintonin the election.After Trump’s election victory, Putin said Trump was a “clever man” who would “quickly understand” his role in office.In July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC)emails were hackedand leaked, showing preferential treatment to Clinton, angering supporters of her primary Democatic opponent Bernie Sanders.The US government formally placed the blame for the hack on Russia in a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Putin denied Russia’s role in the DNC hack but said the leaks themselves were important. “The important thing is the content that was given to the public,” he said.The US also accused Russia of a larger election interference programme aimed at defeating Clinton and helping Trump come to power, involving troll farms that amplified messaging tailored against the Democrats.In October 2019, on a panel at Russian Energy Week, Putin was asked if he would interfere with the2020 US election.“I’ll tell you a secret: Yes, we’ll definitely do it. Just don’t tell anyone,” the Russian president joked in a fake whisper.He then said hisworking relationshipwith Trump did not mean that he had any influence on the domestic politics in the US. He insisted that he did not interfere in the 2016 US election and that he was dealing with issues in his own country.“We have our own problems,” he said."

The media's obsession with US elections. Instead of speculating on future campaigns, we should concentrate on what the president will do next.",13 Nov 2012,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Instead of speculating on future campaigns, we should concentrate on what the president will do next.I have to tell you I came very close to throwing a good amount of money for damages at the Hyatt Hotel in McCormick Place, Chicago, this morning. I almost threw a shoe at the television in my hotel room. I also pondered throwing a lamp and hairbrush for good measure.I’m not usually prone to uncontrollable outbursts of anger, but this time, it was almost justified. Why? Not even a few hours had passed since the election was called for US President Barack Obama, and the television commentators and pundits couldn’t stop talking about who might run for president in 2016. I’m not joking.  Apparently, it’s a burning issue, who will try to be president in four years.This country and many in its media have become almost obsessed with covering campaigns. It’s become like a sporting event for politically inclined people. It’s easy to follow and often exciting, but for now it is over. Let me stress that. President Barack Obama has secured another four-year term, and it seems we should be talking about what he does with that time.I was lucky enough to be in the hall at McCormick Place as the results trickled in. I waited on my media riser (my perch from which I talk into the camera), as thousands of Obama supporters waited for Governor Mitt Romney to publicly acknowledge his defeat, and for the president to address the crowd, the country and the world.After what seemed like a longer than usual wait, the concession happened. The president took the stage and laid out a few items on his agenda tax reform, the national debt and immigration. That was about as detailed as he got, but then again, you wouldn’t expect Obama to give a detailed policy speech at an election night party. I can’t help but wonder what he is going to try to do in his second term.And it is during those second terms that presidents often focus more on their long-term legacies. That probably explains why they usually wait so long to try and tackle the tough foreign policy issues – such as the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. So what does the president want the historians to write of his legacy?From his first term, it’s pretty obvious that he likes the big accomplishments. The healthcare reform law was – to use the vice president’s phrase, “a big … deal” (yes, I left a word out because of our younger readers). So, will Obama go big in his second term and stake more political capital in the process?It seems that his most pressing issue is bringing the country’s annual deficits and the broader national debt under control. The smart folks who understand the complexity of macroeconomics say he has to focus on that. The question is: “How he can come up with a trillion dollars a year?” A trillion, actually a little bit more than that. That is the difference between what the government takes in and what it spends. That is the amount of red ink the country has created during each of the president’s first four years. He took office in 2008 promising to cut the deficit in half, and he has fallen far short.I don’t care what anyone in the media says about it, now that the campaign season is over. It seems to me the politicians are going to have to do the things they hate the most, take away services or raise taxes, probably both.That will make the president very unpopular now, but history may look kindly on a leader who actually puts the country on a sustainable fiscal path. The question is what matters more to the president. We can’t answer that yet, the election, after all, just happened.It did happen. I was there. It’s over, now it is time for the country and its media to focus on where he tries to take everyone next.Follow Patty Culhane on Twitter:@PattyCulhane"

In the US, presidential elections are decided by a state-based vote allocation system. Here's what you need to know.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"In the US, presidential elections are decided by a state-based vote allocation system. Here’s what you need to know.It’s at the heart of how presidential elections in the United States are decided. But for many,the Electoral Collegeis a mystery, wrapped in a riddle, shrouded in an enigma.It doesn’t have to be confusing, though.To understand the Electoral College system, you first have to know that US presidents are not elected by the national popular vote: the total number of votes each candidate receives.Instead, a group of 538 so-called “electors” select the president. These electors make up the Electoral College.So who are these electors?Before the election, the political parties in each state choose aslate of electors: real people who ultimately cast a vote for the president. Very often, the electors are party officials or supporters.Each state gets the same number of electors as it has representatives in the US House of Representatives and the US Senate.For example, Michigan gets 15 Electoral College votes. That corresponds to the two senators and 13 House members that represent the state in Congress.Now that we know who these electors are and how many represent each state, how are their votes allocated? Here’s where it gets fun.In nearly all the states across the US, the presidential candidate who gets the most votes wins all that state’s electors: It’s a winner-takes-all system. Even if a candidate wins a state narrowly, they still get all the electors.The outliers are Maine and Nebraska, which allocate their electors based on a more complicated system that reflects the popular vote on the state and congressional district levels.The District of Columbia — which is not a state but encompasses the country’s capital — also gets three Electoral College votes.But here is the most important part: To win the White House, a presidential candidate must win the support of a majority of the electors.So out of a total of 538 Electoral College votes, they needat least 270to win.The electors ultimately cast their votes in December, about a month after the election.Their votes are then certified by Congress in early January, when the president is confirmed and takes office.So what does this all mean?Effectively, to win the US presidency, a candidate has to win support in enough key states to reach that magic Electoral College number of 270.Under this system, a candidate who wins the popular vote — the most votes in total across the US — may not actually win the White House.Onerecent examplecame in 2016, when Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump. His victory was buoyed by wins in states like Florida and Pennsylvania, each of which offered at least 20 Electoral College votes.The Electoral College system was designed, in effect, to ensure the political power of the states.Some Americans say the Electoral College should be scrapped in favour of the popular vote. Others argue the system ensures highly populated states do not overshadow smaller ones, thereby encouraging minority representation in US democracy."

So what are the facts behind the claim?Trump invoked the “60-day rule” while responding to anupdated indictmentfiled last month in the federal election case in Washington, DC.“It is DOJ policy that the Department of Justice should not take any action that will influence an election within 60 days of that election – but they just have taken such action,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Others have since echoed that criticism. Last week, Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, questioned federal prosecutors in the Florida case about whether holding a trial before the election would violate the rule.Legal experts, however, have rejected that position. And Jay Bratt, a federal prosecutor in the Florida case, told Cannon that, since Trump had already been charged, no rule or norm would be violated.Trump was referring to an unwritten — and admittedly vague — guideline that Justice Department officials have adopted over the years.A 2018 report from the Justice Department’s inspector general clearly states: “No Department policy contains a specific prohibition on overt investigative steps within a particular period before an election.”Still, it noted that many officials have adhered to “a longstanding unwritten practice to avoid overt law enforcement and prosecutorial activities close to an election, typically within 60 or 90 days of Election Day”.The report probed the decision by former FBI director James Comey to reopen an investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails just 11 days before the 2016 election.Comey later said avoiding actions that could impact the election was a “very important norm”.No. Because the guideline is unwritten, it is a best practice rather than a legal requirement. When and how the guideline applies is up to department officials.Legal scholars have further argued that Trump cannot claim he was being treated unfairly because the guideline only applies to major actions, like the filing of brand-new indictments.Because Trump had been indicted long before the 60-day window, the guideline would theoretically not apply to the ongoing federal proceedings in Washington, DC, and Florida.The guideline is also not valid for Trump’supcoming sentencingin New York or the pending trial in Georgia: Both of which are state-level proceedings, whereas the guideline is strictly federal.Finally, Trump may need to check his math. Even if he were correct about the rule, Special Counsel Jack Smith filed the updated indictment on August 27. That is 70 days out from the November 5 vote."

It took another 16 days to determine that Biden was the winner in the state of Georgia.All states allow votes to be cast in some form either in thelead-up to election dayor on election day itself.In some states, mail-in ballots can be verified ahead of time and then rapidly tabulated on election day, often through automated systems.But others prohibit any processing until election day itself, which can lead to a time-consuming backlog.States then have varying periods of time to self-audit the results. A recount can also be requested in most states depending on the vote margin, while others give voters time to correct a mistake – or “cure” a ballot.Ultimately, state executives must issue so-called Certificates of Ascertainment showing the official, final vote tally by a specific date. This year, the deadline is December 11.The president-elect’s victory then is officially certified by Congress in January.Tight races in key battleground states in 2020 – as well as an increase in mail-in voting amid the COVID pandemic – saw particularly slow vote counts.That helped fuel unfounded claims of election malfeasance pushed by Trump and his allies.Those false claims were furthered aided by the fact that Democrats typically vote more by mail-in ballots than Republicans.As a result, in states where there are delays in counting those mail-in ballots, people can get the impression that there has been a late surge in Democratic votes – also known as a “blue shift”.To counter misinformation, election experts have called on states to shore up their vote-counting processes.While some key battleground states have done so, others – such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia – have done little to assure a speedier process this year.Georgia’s election board has even moved to require hand counts of votes on election day, which experts warn could cause even more significant delays."

And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote.pic.twitter.com/RMIRvlSOYw— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden)July 21, 2024His initial statement did not include an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with anexpression of support.Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run at the top of a major party ticket in the country’s history.Biden’s historic move – the first sitting president to give up his party’s nomination for re-electionsince President Lyndon Johnsonin March 1968 – leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.The Democratic backlash against Biden came after he delivered anunsteady performanceat the first presidential debate of the 2024 election season as he lost his train of thought and struggled to articulate basic talking points.Biden’s failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump’s performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden’s fitness for another term.Days later, he raised fresh concerns in an interview, shrugging off Democrats’ worries and a widening gap in opinion polls, and saying he would be fine losing to Trump if he knew he would “gave it my all”.His gaffes at a NATO summit – invoking Russian President Vladimir Putin’s name when he meant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and calling Harris “Vice President Trump” – further stoked anxieties.Only four days before Sunday’s announcement, Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 for a third time, forcing him to cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas. More than one in 10 congressional Democrats had called publicly for him to quit the race.The 46th US president’s departure from the race leaves the Democratic Party in an unprecedented situation, with only a month until the Democratic National Convention and less than four months until the November 5 election.It was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party’s nomination – she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials – or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, said Biden had been under a lot of pressure recently.“It is very difficult to say what made him make the decision now,” he said.“What we do know is that he has been repeatedly insistent that he would not step down … So it comes as a bit of a surprise and a bit of a shock that Biden is saying he will step down after weeks of saying he won’t.”"

The message reached nearly 5,000 New Hampshire voters just days beforethe state’s primary.“This could be bad for people that aren’t so informed about what’s going on with the Democrats,” said Gingrich, who is the chair of the Barrington Democratic Committee in Burlington, New Hampshire.“If they really thought they shouldn’t vote for something and Joe Biden was telling them not to, then maybe they wouldn’t attend that vote.”The Biden call wasn’t the only deepfake so far this election cycle. Beforecalling offhis presidential bid, Florida GovernorRon DeSantis’s campaign shared a video that contained AI-generated images of Donald Trump hugging immunologistAnthony Fauci— two figures whoclashedpublicly during the COVID-19 pandemic.And in September, a different robocall went out to 300 voters expected to participate inSouth Carolina’s Republican primary. This time, recipients heard an AI-generated voice that imitated SenatorLindsey Graham, asking whom they were voting for.The practice of altering or faking content — especially for political gain — has existed since the dawn of US politics. Even the country’s first president, George Washington, had to contend with a series of “spurious letters” that appeared to show him questioning the cause of US independence.But AI tools are now advanced enough to convincingly mimic people quickly and cheaply, heightening the risk of disinformation.Astudypublished earlier this year by researchers at George Washington University predicted that, by mid-2024, daily “AI attacks” would escalate, posing a threat to the November general election.The study’s lead author Neil Johnson told Al Jazeera that the highest risk doesn’t come from the recent, obviously fake robocalls — which contained eyebrow-raising messages — but rather from more convincing deepfakes.“It’s going to be nuanced images, changed images, not entirely fake information because fake information attracts the attention of disinformation checkers,” Johnson said.The study found that online communities are linked in a way that allows bad actors to send large quantities of manipulated media directly into the mainstream.Communities inswing statescould be especially vulnerable, as couldparenting groupson platforms like Facebook.“The role of parenting communities is going to be big one,” Johnson said, pointing to the rapid spread of vaccine misinformation during the pandemic as an example.“I do think that we’re going to be suddenly faced with a wave of [disinformation] — lots of things that are not fake, they’re not untrue, but they stretch the truth.”Voters themselves, however, are not the only targets of deepfakes. Larry Norden, senior director of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, has been working withelection officialsto help them spot fake content.For instance, Norden said bad actors could use AI tools to instruct election workers to close a polling location prematurely, by manipulating the sound of their boss’s voice or by sending a message seemingly through a supervisor’s account.He is teaching poll workers to protect themselves by verifying the messages they receive.Norden emphasised that bad actors can create misleading content without AI. “The thing about AI is that it just makes it easier to do at scale,” he said.Just last year, Norden illustrated the capabilities of AI by creating a deepfake videoof himselffor a presentation on the risks the technology poses.“It didn’t take long at all,” Norden said, explaining that all he had to do was feed his previous TV interviews into an app.His avatar wasn’t perfect — his face was a little blurry, his voice a little choppy — but Norden noted the AI tools are rapidly improving. “Since we recorded that, the technology has gotten more sophisticated, and I think it’s more and more difficult to tell.”The technology alone is not the problem. As deepfakes become more common, the public will become more aware of them and more sceptical of the content they consume.That could erode public trust, with voters more likely to reject true information. Political figures could also abuse that scepticism for their own ends.Legal scholars have termed this phenomenon the “liar’s dividend”: Concern about deepfakes could make it easier for the subjects of legitimate audio or video footage to claim the recordings are fake.Norden pointed to theAccess Hollywood audiothat emerged before the 2016 election as an example. In the clip, then-candidate Trump is heard talking about his interactions with women: “You can do anything. Grab ‘em by the pussy.”The tape — which was very real — was considered damaging to Trump’s prospects among female voters. But if similar audio leaked today, Norden said a candidate could easily call it fake. “It would be easier for the public to dismiss that kind of thing than it would have been a few years ago.”Norden added, “One of the problems that we have right now in the US is that there’s a lack of trust, and this may only make things worse.”While deepfakes are a growing concern in US elections, relatively few federal laws restrict their use. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has yet to restrict deepfakes in elections, and bills in Congress remain stalled.Individual states are scrambling to fill the void. According to alegislation trackerpublished by the consumer advocacy organisation Public Citizen, 20 state laws have been enacted so far to regulate deepfakes in elections.Several more bills — in Hawaii, Louisiana and New Hampshire — have passed and are awaiting a governor’s signature.Norden said he was not surprised to see individual states act before Congress. “States are supposed to be the laboratories of democracy, so it’s proving true again: The states are acting first. We all know it’s really hard to get anything passed in Congress,” he said.Voters and political organisations are taking action, too. After Gingrich received the fake Biden call in New Hampshire, she joined a lawsuit — led by the League of Women Voters — seeking accountability for the alleged deception.The source of the call turned out to be Steve Kramer, a political consultant who claimed his intention was to draw attention to the need to regulate AI in politics. Kramer also admitted to being behind the robocall in South Carolina, mimicking Senator Graham.Kramer came forward after NBC News revealed he had commissioned a magician to use publicly available software to generate the deepfake of Biden’s voice.According to the lawsuit, the deepfake took less than 20 minutes to create and cost only $1.Kramer, however, told CBS News that he received “$5m worth of exposure” for his efforts, which he hoped would allow AI regulations to “play themselves out or at least begin to pay themselves out”.“My intention was to make a difference,” he said.But Kramer’s case shows existing laws can be used to curtail deepfakes.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), for instance, ruled (PDF) earlier this year that voice-mimicking software falls under the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act — and is therefore illegal in most circumstances.The commission ultimatelyproposeda $6m penalty against Kramer for the illegal robocall.The New Hampshire Department of Justice alsochargedKramer with felony voter suppression and impersonating a candidate, which could result in up to seven years in prison. Kramer has pleaded not guilty. He did not respond to a request for comment from Al Jazeera.Norden said it is significant that none of the laws Kramer is accused of breaking are specifically tailored to deepfakes. “The criminal charges against him have nothing to do with AI,” he said. “Those laws exist independently of the technology that is used.”However, those laws are not as easy to apply to bad actors who are not identifiable or who are located outside of the US.“We know from the intelligence agencies that they’re already seeing China and Russia experimenting with these tools. And they expect them to be used,” Norden said. “In that sense, you’re not going to legislate your way out of this problem.”Both Norden and Johnson believe the lack of regulation makes it more important for voters to inform themselves about deepfakes — and learn how to find accurate information.As for Gingrich, she said she knows that manipulative deepfakes will only grow more ubiquitous. She too feels voters need to inform themselves about the risk.Her message to voters? “I would tell people to make sure that they know they can vote.”"

As he campaigned for his progressive allies, Congress members Andy Levin and Rashida Tlaib, the senator raged against the influence of money in politics.",Last update 30 Jul 2022,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Left-wing US senator implicitly hits out at the pro-Israel group AIPAC at a rally for Rashida Tlaib and Andy Levin.Pontiac, Michigan, US –More than two years after ending hissecond campaignfor the Democratic nomination for president, Bernie Sanders can still get large crowds to cheer widely and mobilise for his message against income and wealth inequality.In Pontiac, Michigan – a town north of Detroit – on Friday, Sanders had a new angle to discuss beyond his usual anger about the cost of healthcare and the growing gap between the poor and the ultra-rich.As he campaigned for his progressive allies, Congress members Andy Levin and Rashida Tlaib, the senator raged against the influence of money in politics, implicitly hitting out against the American Israel Public Affairs Committee(AIPAC), a lobbying group which has been spending millions of dollars to defeat progressives.“This election is particularly important. It’s important because Andy, based on his work, deserves to be reelected; Rashida deserves to be reelected,” Sanders said. “But it’s equally important in saying that the people of Michigan have got to tell these billionaires in their corporate PACs [political action committees], they cannot buy our democracy.”The rally in Pontiac, where Levin is running, came days before the Michigan Democratic primary on August 2, where pro-Israel groups – spearheaded by AIPAC – have been spending millions on campaign ads to get their favoured candidates elected.Levin, a former labour organiser who hails from a renowned Jewish-American political family, has been aprimary targetof AIPAC this cycle.“One group has spent $4.2m to try to defeat me because I stand for a simple proposition: The only way to have a secure peaceful homeland for the Jewish people – for my people – is to fully achieve the political and human rights of the Palestinian people. I Will. Not. Back. Down,” Levin told the crowd, stopping between the words to emphasise that he is undeterred by AIPAC’s attacks.The pro-Israel lobby has made it a quest to defeat left-wing candidates in Democratic primaries this year through its super PAC, United Democracy Project — which uses donor funds to run ads against or in support of candidates without coordinating with their campaigns.And so far, ithas succeededin several contests across the country.AIPAC has not intervened directly against Tlaib, but another newly formed pro-Israel group has pledged to spend $1m to help defeat the Palestinian-American congresswoman. Still, with the advantage of incumbency, Tlaib is a favourite in the race that includes several opponents.Levin, however, is at serious risk of losing his seat; he is running against fellow sitting Congress member Haley Stevens, a staunch Israel advocate. Parts of the two lawmakers’ old districts were merged after redistricting following the2020 Census, and they are running against each other in a newly drawn constituency.AIPAC and Stevens’ campaign have not returned Al Jazeera’s request for comment this week.On Friday, Tlaib said negative ads run by “out-of-town millionaires and billionaires” make her want to “work harder” and double down on her progressive advocacy.“We are not going to let anyone come into our communities and tell us how to vote and try to pit us against each other,” Tlaib said.For his part, Sanders stressedthat AIPACspending against left-wing candidates is about sinking the priorities of progressives on behalf of its billionaire mega-donors.“It has nothing to do – in my view –with Israel,” Sanders said. “It is simply trying to defeat candidates and members of Congress who stand for working families and are prepared to demand that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes.”Sanders called Levin’s campaign “historic”.“The billionaire class is saying, ‘We own this country; we own the political system, and we will not tolerate dissent. Either you work for us, or get out of here.’ And Andy has chosen not to work for them,” he added.In an audience of a few hundred attendees, dozens came with shirts and signs featuring Sanders’s image and slogans on Friday.Lorenzo Sollena, a 29-year-old substitute teacher, said the senator from Vermont and a few of his progressive allies are the only ones challenging the political status quo in the United States.“Bernie is the last person fighting … The country has come to a standstill. People say they care about universal healthcare, and they care aboutabortion rights, but nobody’s fighting back,” said Sollena, who was wearing a t-shirt featuring photos of Sanders throughout the decades with the caption: “We will never stop fighting for what is right.”"

Harris may be the lesser of two evils when it comes to Donald Trump, but the lesser of two evils is still evil. If she wants to win in November, ...",19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"My red line is genocide, and no ‘good vibes’ campaigning will move it.I registered to vote in 1998, and I have voted Democrat ever since. I have not always felt good about the candidates on the Democratic ticket. In fact, I have usually felt angry, disillusioned, disappointed and dirty after casting my vote. Still, it felt like part of the job of being a citizen of a pseudo-democracy. It was not the only work to be done, but it was something.This November, however, I plan not to vote for the Democrats in the election. If the party’s presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, does not change her policy on Israel, I will not be casting a ballot for her.And I will not be the only one. More than 700,000 Americans have cast an “uncommitted” vote in the Democratic primaries, demonstrating their rejection of the Democratic Party’s “ironclad” support for Israel.If Harris wants the progressive vote, she has to support an arms embargo on Israel and stop funding the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. This is a red line for many of us who have not bought into her liberal cult of personality.When President Joe Biden finally dropped out as the 2024 Democratic nominee on July 21, I was not one of the many people celebrating his endorsement of the vice president. Harris was on the wrong side of history as San Francisco’s district attorney when she opposed criminal justice reform, and she has been on the wrong side of history in regards to Israel, which she is a staunch supporter of.Still, a small part of me hoped she would be savvy enough to understand the power of the “uncommitted” movement – which is conditioning voting on support for an embargo on Israel and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza – and the level of outrage felt by those opposed to the ongoing genocide, funded these past 10 months by US aid. I was wrong.Ata rally in Detroit on August 7, Harris was met by a group of anti-genocide, pro-Palestine protesters chanting, “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide! We won’t vote for genocide!” In a democracy, this is a perfectly reasonable and acceptable (if not necessary) action. Politicians serve the people, and the people have the right (and the responsibility) to make demands on their political leaders, especially when the latter are asking for their votes and campaign donations.Yet Harris decided to respond: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”What purpose does this attitude serve? The protesters were merely expressing their demand that Harris pledge to stop arming Israel amid its genocidal war on Gaza. A war that has brought the official death toll in Gaza to more than 40,000; some estimates project that number to reach186,000or even higher. A war that has put one million children at risk of famine, according to the international nonprofit organisation Save the Children. A war that has decimated Gaza’s health sector, bringing back polio infections for the first time in 25 years.Many of us spend our days scrolling through the most horrific images imaginable – toddlers beheaded by Israeli air strikes,people burned alive in their tents, emaciated children who die of starvation, political prisoners brutally raped by Israeli soldiers. The atrocities go on and on. My days and nights are haunted by these images, and none of this would be possible without US aid, without our tax dollars.But Harris doesn’t want to engage these very reasonable demands – to stop funding this slaughter, this genocide, this horrific violence. Instead, she wants to be celebrated for being charismatic, for her affect, for her vibes.This politics-as-vibes is not new. It is nothing more than celebrity culture bleeding into politics. Another word for it is fascism.I am reminded of Erik Larson’s 2011 book In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler’s Berlin, which tells the story of William Dodd, the US ambassador to Germany from 1933 to 1937 and his family. Over the years since the book was published, I have thought occasionally of Dodd and often of his daughter, Martha, who accompanied him to Berlin.The ambassador was chairman of the history department at the University of Chicago at the time of his appointment, and he just wanted to be left alone to finish his book about the antebellum American South. He was somewhat concerned but not too alarmed about what was happening in Germany, telling President Franklin Roosevelt, “Give men a chance to try their schemes” as the Nazi Party prepared to deny Jews citizenship.Martha, on the other hand, was swept up by the “glamour” of the Nazi Party and its social scene, dating and sleeping with Nazi officers.So many liberals I know are a form of William or Martha Dodd. Like William, they are either too consumed with their own comfort to care too much about the daily atrocities experienced and endured by Palestinians, or, like Martha, they approach politics through the frame of celebrity culture and good feelings, happy to fangirl Harris, whose charisma and Beyonce-scored inspire-ads overwhelm the pesky reality of genocide.This is, after all, about feeling good. “Don’t spoil our fun!” they scream at me (and so many others) on social media. This anti-outrage is deafening. But you cannot just live off vibes.In a memoir written a few years after she left Nazi Germany, Martha admitted to just not really liking Jews all that much. This casual anti-Semitism foreshadows today’s liberal attitudes towards Palestinians, a disregard rooted in Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism, which is driving a genocide.This is a make-or-break moment – we must pressure the Democrats to change their position on Gaza before the elections in November. While we should all be doing absolutely everything we can to stop the genocide, the bare minimum right now is demanding that a presidential hopeful, in need of our votes, commits to ending US funds to Israel. It is not that complicated.Harris may be the lesser of two evils when it comes to Donald Trump, but the lesser of two evils is still evil. If she wants to win in November, she needs to give us more than vibes and celebrity culture – she needs to make a real commitment to ending the genocide in Gaza, first and foremost by not funding it. Anything less than this will lose her the progressive vote and, quite possibly, the presidency. If this happens, the liberals across the country will likely blame a nebulous “leftist-progressive” block, but in the end, this loss will be on Harris herself.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

When will we know who will be called as America's next president? The earliest we could know whether a presidential candidate is projected to ...",3 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Millions of Americans are voting, but when exactly will we know whether Trump or Biden won the election?Polls begin closing in the United States at 18:00 Eastern Standard Time (23:00 GMT) and poll closing times vary by state. Results in each state will not begin coming in until polls close in each particular state.Projections of winners will not be made until all of the polls close in a state. The first projections of states that Donald Trump and Joe Biden have won will not begin until 19:00 EST (00:00 GMT), when all of the polls have closed in nine states.The earliest we could know whether a presidential candidate is projected to have won 270 electoral votes, the number of electoral votes needed for victory, is likely to be 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT). That is when polls close in California, which has the most electoral votes of any state – 55 – and that could put a candidate over the 270 threshold.However, 23:00 EST is considered early, at least in recent history. Of the past five presidential elections, only 2008 was called at that time, when California’s projected win for Barack Obama put him past the 270 electoral vote threshold. In 2012 and 2016, the winners were projected in the overnight EST hours.Twice in the past five elections, projections of winners were not even made on election night. In 2004, George W Bush was not called the winner until midday the day after the election.And in 2000, the media outlets making projections erroneously called Florida for Al Gore before rescinding that projection. The close nature of the results of that race led to neither Gore nor George W Bush having enough electoral votes without Florida’s results, leading to weeks of recounts and legal battles. Florida was not called until December 12, when the US Supreme Court ordered the state’s recount halted. Bush had a 537-vote lead at that point and was declared the winner, delivering him the state’s electoral votes and an Electoral College victory.It is worth noting that the process of “calling” winners and losers in each state is not necessarily based on exact vote tallies but is based on projections made by analysts who look at polling and how vote counts are shaping up in key precincts or counties.If it is a state where one candidate is expected to win from the get-go – and potentially 30 states fall into that category this year – then those states can be projected as soon as polls close or shortly thereafter.If it is a closely-contested state or it is not obvious who the winner is at a state’s poll closing time, then projections of winners will be delayed as analysts watch the vote tallies come in. The closer the count – or any vote-counting problems – can slow down the timing of a projection.The US media. US media outlets have a long history of trying to speed up the process of informing Americans of the winners and losers of presidential races, and it has not always run smoothly.In addition to the 2000 election projection problem, there were some other infamous incorrect projections. In 1916, the New York Times prematurely and erroneously declared Charles Evans Hughes the winner over Woodrow Wilson. In 1948, election analysts at the Chicago Daily Tribune famously – and incorrectly – concluded that Thomas Dewey defeated Harry Truman.The system that is used for election projections today has its roots in the early 1960s, when the major US wire services and television networks pooled their resources to place thousands of people all over the country to gather precinct returns, which were fed into computers to help make calls. In 1990, the Associated Press and US broadcasters created a new system that combined exit polling with vote results, which is generally the method still in use today.Currently, the Associated Press and Fox News share one set of exit polls and come up with their own separate projections. ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC are the remaining members of the system that was formed in 1990, and they use that data to reach their own projections.No. Counting every single vote will take several days and, in some cases, several weeks. States have different methods and procedures for counting in-person and mail-in ballots and when their counts are completed, each state will certify its results. If all goes as planned, each state’s certified results will be formally presented when the state meets to certify its electors, prior to the Electoral College meeting on December 14.The vote count has never been certified on election night and 2020 is no different. What potentially complicates things this year is that most states will be counting more mail-in ballots than ever, and their procedures have not been tested at this scale. It is expected there will be vote-counting issues in some states. Three states  – all tightly contested –  Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are not allowed to begin counting mail-in votes until November 3, which could prolong an announcement.If neither candidate has been projected as the Electoral College winner and projections for some states are on hold because there is a wait for a vote count, that could create long delays in knowing who the winner will be.And that scenario has some worried about potential political mischief and protracted legal battles, prolonging the declaration of a final outcome."

Many,including me, have said this before.White supremacy – the implicit acceptance of the superiority of white people and culture – is slowly being pushed aside as people (themselves slowly) accept the reality that “white culture” is nothing more than one stop on the global tour of humanity.The fact that, in the US, white is the default definition of “normal” is a historical accident, and that pillar of history is falling. That makes this a very dangerous time.The death of white supremacy is dangerous because of the depths of fear into which some white people have fallen.This is unfortunate because white supremacy’s demise in no way implies a dying white race. It does not even imply the actual death of white supremacy itself.That venomous serpent, as we’ve seen in the 1800s and the 1960s, suffers only a metaphorical death, shedding its skin and returning in a different guise.What a dying white supremacy does mean is a death of the acceptance that white lives are any more valuable than others.That higher value of white life is all that some people have to hold onto, and the loss of that value is so difficult for them to accept that it amounts to an attack.We are on the cusp of a historic decision in the US. We can make history and transition from the first black to the first female president. The alternative is to make history by electing our first fascist demagogue.byThus we see the rise of radical white supremacists like David Duke,currently seekinga Senate seat in Louisiana on the platform that there is “massive racist and racial discrimination against European-Americans”, which is what radical white supremacists call it when you suggest that Black Lives Matter as much as theirs do.White supremacists are so afraid of being treated the same as everyone else that they feel like they are backed into a corner, accompanied by only their fear and their guns.And they have a lot of guns.This is, of course, a fact that their ideological leader Donald Trump knows quite well. This is why he has called on them to follow him, why he has chosen to legitimise their use of violence.He knows the history of white America; he knows that violence is a valid option for white radicals.This is not a joke.We are long past the time when laughing at Donald Trump was acceptable. In fact, it was never acceptable.David Cornnoted thisin Mother Jones immediatelyfollowing the Huffington Post decision to report him as entertainment.Still we laughed. Even after Arianna Huffingtonlater stated“we are no longer entertained”, laughter and disbelief – or worse, resolved acceptance – were our response to his rise.While we follow news outlets, read bloggers, and laugh with comedians like John Oliver, we find Trump’s increasing power distasteful, sure, but still an entirely consumable media diet.Our demand has only justified the supply. Our laughter and consumption have fuelled his fire, and now people will really start getting burned.OPINION: How Donald Trump could win – and whyThis last call by Trump to theunhinged radical wingof his followers, openly legitimising violence against hispolitical opponents, is a warning sign we never should have needed.But having come this far, one thing should now be crystal clear: If we are still laughing, or silent, or anything other than actively engaged in the disruption of this man’s rise to power, then we are doing little more that fuelling the fires of fascism.And if you are in the media, whether a professional or an amateur, whether a journalist, blogger or comedian – whatever your role – you have a grave and serious responsibility to help quench this fire.We are on the cusp of a historic decision in the US. We can make history and transition from the first black to the first female president – a noble and glorious step even accepting the great struggle still required for our equality. The alternative is to make history by electing our first fascist demagogue.The US was founded on the principle of equality, liberty and justice for all. Yes, we have a great deal of work ahead of us to make that a reality.OPINION: Immigrants and Donald Trump – It’s a complicated storyBut if you believe in America, if you love this country, then that founding ideal is what you should be fighting for.Because if you love this country, “for all” means for all. It is not limited by religion, or skin colour, or gender, or physical ability.Either “for all” means for all, or it doesn’t, and “it doesn’t” means “patriarchal white supremacy”. There is no middle ground on this.That is why Black Lives Matter is a patriotic movement. That is why the fight for indigenous rights is a patriotic movement.That is why the fight for the rights of Latino and Chicano people is a patriotic movement. Because America means “for all”, or it means absolutely nothing.And that is why Trump is not someone to laugh about, but someone to fight. Because if we do not stand up for what America means, if we do not stand up “for all”, then what we have to fear is Trump and his army of white radicals rising up and making us all kneel.John Metta has worked as a cook, groundskeeper, store clerk, park ranger, Navy submariner, Army wartime medic, hydrologist, school teacher, software developer, mathematical modeller, and underwater archaeologist.

There are 435 seats in total and each seat is up for election every two years.This year’s legislative elections are even more important than usual because they are the last before a new round of redistricting based on the results of the 2020 Census. Each state’s allocated number of House members is determined by its population, so if a state loses or gains residents in the new Census, they stand to lose or gain seats in the House.There also 35 Senate seats up for grabs this year, roughly one-third of the 100-seat body. Around a dozen of those 35 are competitive seats and each is extremely important as Republican control of the chamber is at stake. Currently, the Republicans have a 53-47 advantage. If the Democrats can gain four seats, they will guarantee a takeover of the Senate majority.The most important non-federal elections this year will choose governors who run the executive branches of each individual state government.Voters in 11 states and two territories, Puerto Rico and American Samoa, will elect governors this Election Day.In the US, the president and vice president are not directly elected by voters, as laid out in the US Constitution. When voters make their presidential choice on their ballot, they are really voting for a slate of “electors”, who, after the votes are counted and certified, are pledged to vote for a presidential and vice-presidential candidate.These electors actually cast the deciding votes for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates during a meeting of the Electoral College.In 48 states, these electors “pledge” to vote for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates that receive the most votes in their respective state.Two states – Maine and Nebraska – have slightly different systems: Two electors “pledge” to vote for the candidate that wins the state’s overall popular vote, while the remaining electors are allocated to the winner in each congressional district.While the presidential election is on November 3, the Electoral College will vote on December 14.The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of its House representatives plus two, the number of US Senators in each state. There are a total of 538 electors: 535 from the 50 states and three from the District of Columbia, which is the federal capital and not a state, per the constitution.Prior to 1961, when a constitutional amendment allotted Washington, DC, three electoral votes, residents of the district did not have a say in presidential elections.Because certain states regularly vote Democratic or Republican, those states are given much less attention by presidential candidates than the states where polling is very close.Those so-called “battleground” states, also known as “swing states” or “toss-up” states, of which there are about a dozen every four years, hold disproportionate sway in US presidential elections.Election analysts consider states battlegrounds where the margin of victory is expected to be fewer than five percentage points.By November 2, more than 94 million Americans had already cast their ballots either by in-person early voting or by mail – a process expanded in many areas amid the COVID-19 pandemic.That number represents more than 68 percent of the total number of votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. Nearly 60 percent of voting-eligible Americans have participated in recent presidential elections, though some are predicting the number will rise this year.Early voting numbers in both Hawaii and Texas are higher than their total overall voter turnout in 2016.Here is what the electoral map looks like at the moment:Voter turnout for US presidential elections has hovered around 60 percent of the voting-eligible population in recent elections. In 2016, 60.1 percent of eligible voters turned out, which was up from 58.6 percent in 2012, but down from 61.6 percent in 2008.A shift in recent voting patterns due to states allowing more opportunities for voters to cast early ballots has been accelerated this year because of the pandemic."

It meant a lot to the president. He was with our heroes for about an hour, just having casual conversation, taking their questions, just talking to them and then he ended the visit by paying his respects to the special forces memorial,” Kayleigh McEnany told reporters travelling with the president on Air Force One.About 100 Army special forces troops including Delta Force and Rangers had participated in the raid. Two soldiers and a military dog were injured when al-Baghdadi, cornered in a tunnel, detonated a suicide vest.30 Oct 2020 - 00:18 GMTFormer Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris spoke with workers about the economic inequality they face.“We’re living in crazy times,” Sanders said. “You know, we’re in the midst of this terrible pandemic. So many of our people have lost their jobs and their income but are worried about climate change, worried about systemic racism.”“But tonight we are going to be asking questions like: ‘How does it happen that in the richest country in the history of the world, half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck’,” he said.Harris talked about the Biden campaign’s plans to expand sick leave for workers, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, improve availability of childcare for workers and put in place universal pre-kindergarten education for three- and four-year-olds.“These are things that we have to do. And everyone benefits,” Harris said.29 Oct 2020 - 23:56 GMTThe entertainer Lil Wayne met with Trump in Miami in the morning to talk about criminal justice reform and Trump’s so-called “Platinum Plan” to promote economic investment in Black communities.

Trump would eliminate health care coverage for millions of Americans. And the president has demonstrated disrespect for US military service people, calling them ‘losers’.Biden cut his speech short because of rain. He was speaking at a drive-in rally in Tampa, Florida.“Time’s running out. This country can’t afford four more years of Trump,” Biden said.Two people who attended Trump’s rally last week in Gastonia, North Carolina, have tested positive for the coronavirus.“These cases are not thought to be an indication of spread from the rally at this time, but rather two independent cases among individuals who were in attendance,” The Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.The department recommended anyone who attended the president’s October 21 rally assess their own risk, monitor for symptoms and get tested, if necessary.Trump’s campaign says it is postponing their Thursday night rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for a few days as Tropical Storm Zeta bears down on the Northeast.“Because of a wind advisory issued with gusts reaching 50 miles per hour and other weather conditions, the outdoor Fayetteville, NC rally has been postponed until Monday,” the campaign said in a statement.Several North Carolina counties were under tropical storm watch Thursday afternoon. North Carolina is a battleground state that Trump won in 2016 but that Democrat Joe Biden is pushing for in 2020.Several people attending Trump’s Tampa rally have reportedly required medical attention after suffering from intense heat.A number of folks here in the Tampa heat are suffering under the sun.  86 degrees. Couple of calls for medics here.— Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO)October 29, 2020The US Supreme Court rejected another bid by North Carolina Republicans to block the extension of a deadline for receiving mail-in ballots.The justices denied a request by Republican legislators in the state to put on hold an agreement made by state election officials allowing the extension that a North Carolina state court had approved.Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court on Tuesday as Trump’s third appointee, did not participate in the case. Barrett did not have time to fully review the case filings, a court spokeswoman said in a statement.More than 80 million Americans have already cast ballots in the presidential election, according to a tally from the US Elections Project – setting the stage for the highest participation rate in over a century.The record-breaking pace, more than 58 percent of total 2016 turnout, reflects intense interest in the vote.Huge numbers of people have voted by mail or at early in-person polling sites amid concerns the coronavirus could spread at busy Election Day voting places.Speaking at a drive-in rally in in Broward county, Florida Biden addressed supporters and blasted Trump for his coronavirus response and handling of protests, calling for racial justice in the country.He said Trump will not even say the phrase “Black lives matter.”He also encouraged residents of the key battleground state to vote.“This election is the most important one you’ve ever voted in …The heart and soul of this country’s at stake,” he said.Biden also made a direct pitch to Florida’s Latino voters by saying Trump is “the worst possible standard-bearer for democracy” in places like Cuba and Venezuela.Florida’s sizable and diverse Latino population could be key to Biden’s chances in Florida, a state that remains a must-win for Trump. While the state’s Cuban population has traditionally trended Republican, Democrats believe they have an opening with Florida’s Cubans because of Trump’s move to freeze relations with the nation and the changing demographics of the population.Trump addressed a large rally in Tampa, and vowed to keep the US economy open, even as cases of coronavirus continue to surge in Florida and dozens of other states.He then touted newly released data from the Commerce Department showing that the economy grew by an annualised rate of 33.1 percent in the third quarter, beating expectations, but leaving the economy 3.5 percent below where it was at the end of 2019.“I mean how many times can I say it? I’ll say it five or six times during the speech, 33.1,” Trump said.Two polls of likely voters in Florida out today show Biden with small leads, which normally would be cause for celebration in a state known for its razor-thin presidential contests. However, both polls continue to show Biden lagging among Latino voters, a significant part of Florida’s electorate.In a Monmouth poll released this afternoon, Biden leads Trump 50-45 percent overall and has a 24-point lead among Latinos. Another poll, NBC/Marist, has Biden up 51-47 percent statewide but he only holds a 5-point lead among Latino voters.There has been concern among Democrats about Biden’s lower than expected support among Florida Latinos. Clinton won Latinos there by 27 points in 2016, according to exit polls. Trump won Florida by 1.2 percentage points in 2016.Both Biden and Trump are campaigning in Florida today.Trump is also heading to North Carolina today (Biden has not been there since September 23, though his full schedule through Election Day has yet to be announced). Two polls show an extremely tight race there as well.A New York Times/Siena College poll released today shows Biden with a slim 48-45 percent lead over Trump among likely voters. A UMass Lowell poll has them knotted up at 48 percent apiece. Trump won North Carolina by 3.7 percentage points in 2016.The Monmouth poll has a +/-4.4 percent margin of error; NBC/Marist, +/-4.4 percent; New York Times/Siena, +/-3.7 percent; and UMass Lowell, +/-4.2 percent.In a new video advertisement, Biden pledged to issue an executive order creating a task force to unite migrant families who were separated under Trump’s administration.Despite a federal judge’s order that the government reunite families who had been separated at the United States-Mexico border under Trump “zero tolerance” migration policy, the parents of 545 children still have not been found.Read morehere.Biden issued a statement reminding voters that the economy is still in a “deep hole” and that the recovery, which benefited mostly “those at the top”, is slowing.The data from the Commerce Department showed that the economy grew by an annualized rate of 33.1 percent in the third quarter, beating expectations, but leaving the economy 3.5 percent below where it was at the end of 2019.Success in a Biden-Harris Administration will not be measured just by the stock market or GDP growth, but by the extent to which growth is raising the pay, dignity, and economic security of our working families—especially those who have been left behind.https://t.co/HQZ8UbUb3f— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden)October 29, 2020“Yes, GDP rose last quarter, but visits to food banks haven’t slowed, and poverty has grown. African Americans and Latinos still face double-digit unemployment rates,” Biden said. “I will fight side-by-side with the American people to rein in the virus and provide needed economic relief.”Trump meanwhile promised voters they would keep the growth going if given another term.“GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close,” Trump tweeted. “So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.”GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close. Next year will be FANTASTIC!!! However, Sleepy Joe Biden and his proposed record setting tax increase, would kill it all. So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)October 29, 2020Voters say the economy is one of the most important issues they are weighing during this presidential election. Roughly half of the 22 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered, but new hiring is slowing.The US economy grew at a record pace in the third quarter as the government injected more than $3 trillion worth of pandemic relief – which fueled consumer spending.According to a report by the Commerce Department, gross domestic product rebounded at a 33.1 percent annualised rate last quarter -that was the fastest pace since the government started keeping records in 1947 and followed a historic shrinkage rate of 31.4 percent in the second quarter.Trump will likely seize on the stunning rebound in GDP as a sign of recovery, but output remains below its level in the fourth quarter of 2019, a fact  Biden is almost certain to highlight along with signs that the growth spurt is fast petering out.Read morehere.In the final leg of campaign, Biden, will head to three states Trump won in 2016: Iowa, Wisconsin and then Michigan, where he will hold a joint Saturday rally with former President Barack Obama.Trump meanwhile plans to return to the Midwest on Friday, campaigning in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In all, he plans to visit 10 states in the last week of the campaign and will host 11 rallies in the final 48 hours, according to his campaign.In a significant setback for Republicans in two battleground states, the US Supreme Court allowed absentee ballots in North Carolina and Pennsylvania to be received and counted up to nine days after Election Day.Trump has made unfounded claims that voting by mail, a common practice in US elections, leads to widespread fraud.But Trump and his allies have also notched important wins, including a ruling that the Republican governor of Texas may limit drop-off sites for election ballots.Hackers stole $2.3 million from the Wisconsin Republican Party’s account, The Associated Press reported.Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt said officials noticed the suspicious activity on October 22 and contacted the FBI.President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will hold competing rallies in Florida, an essential state, especially for the president.Opinion polls suggest Biden has a significant edge nationally, but his lead is tighter in battleground states. With its 29 electoral votes, the state is a major prize in next Tuesday’s election.Trump will stage an outdoor rally in Tampa while Biden, in contrast, will hold a drive-in rally later in Tampa where attendees will remain in their cars. He will host a similar event earlier in the day in Broward County in South Florida.Read more about Florida’s role in in the electionhere.Three of four voters express concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll has found.Only one in four say they are “very confident” the nation will have a peaceful transfer of power if Biden defeats Trump.Legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus said he has cast his vote for Trump and urged Americans who have not made up their minds to vote for him too.Nicklaus, an 18-time major winner, said Trump has already delivered on his promises in the past three and a half years while being “more diverse than any other President” before.“You might not like the way our President says or tweets some things – and trust me, I have told him that! – but I have learned to look past that and focus on what he’s tried to accomplish,” Nicklaus, 80, said in a statement on Twitter.Jack, this is a Great Honor.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/17/long-lines-for-us-early-voting-underscore-hidden-barriers,US elections: Long lines underscore multiple barriers to voting | US ...,"Oct 17, 2020 ... Residents report hours-long waits as early voting for the presidential election began in states across the US.",17 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Residents report hours-long waits as early voting for the presidential election began in states across the US.Early voting has started in more than 20 states ahead of the November 3 United States presidential election and already, the turnout has far surpassed past contests, leading some experts to project record-breaking participation this year.More than 25 million ballots have been cast through in-person early ballots and mail-in voting as of Saturday, the United States Election Project said, which corresponds to more than 18 percent of all the votes counted in the 2016 presidential race.But that early voter engagement, in part fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, has also led to new challenges, as long lines and hours-long waits were reported at polling sites in Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana and Ohio, among other states.The time-consuming process has been attributed to enthusiasm in a charged political climate, eagerness to avoid the polls on election day because of the novel coronavirus, and, in some cases, glitches with the voting infrastructure.But it is also evidence of barriers that many US voters face, according to voting rights advocates, who said that those barriers, which can make casting a ballot a day-long affair, often disproportionately affect minority communities.Critics also said that some voting systems, which are overseen by and differ between each respective US state, even in national elections, are inherently designed to help one party over the other.“The long lines are happening not by accident but design,” the National Election Defence Coalition, a group of election-monitoring organisations,tweetedon October 15. “Voters must stand up to defend our system of government.”In Georgia, where polls opened on Monday, some voters waited more than eight hours to cast their votes, according to local media.The first day of voting in the state saw 128,000 residents go to the polls, smashing 2016’s first-day turnout of 91,000, The Associated Press news agency reported.State officials said the turnout was “extreme and tremendous” and, therefore, lines were to be expected. “There’s a lot of enthusiasm around this election, and you’re going to see high turnout. Because of that, we’re going to see lines,” Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper.During Georgia primary voters in predominantly white areas waited 6 minutes to vote while voters in predominantly minority areas waited 51 minutes to voteVoter suppression in Georgia direct result of SCOTUS gutting Voting Rights Act & would be even worse if Barrett confirmedhttps://t.co/Twb5F7rvVo— Ari Berman (@AriBerman)October 12, 2020The delays were partially fuelled by problems with voter check-in computers at polling sites in the Atlanta area, according to local media.But ananalysisby Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica, published Saturday in coordination with National Public Radio, indicated a more insidious problem: A shrinking number of polling sites in the state.The news outlets reported that while the reduction of polling places has taken place “across racial lines”, it has had an outsized effect on nonwhite communities that have seen spikes in voter registration and where residents are more likely to cast ballots in person.Another day of early voting and another long line in NC. This one in Durham. Polls open right nowpic.twitter.com/6PDD9fn2Ha— Leigh Ann Caldwell (@LACaldwellDC)October 17, 2020That’s particularly noteworthy, as Georgia is one of several places in the US with a history of voter discrimination. Under the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, the state had been required to get federal preclearance before making changes to its voting systems and infrastructure.However, a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 eliminated that requirement, allowing state officials and legislators to make changes to how voting is carried out without oversight by the federal government. Individuals and groups can still challenge state voting practices in court.Since then, the number of registered voters in Georgia has grown by nearly two million people, while the number of polling locations has been cut statewide by 10 percent, according to the Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica analysis.Nine counties in the city of Atlanta have been hit particularly hard, accounting for half of the state’s voters, but only 38 percent of its polling places, the report found, although some have sought to make last-minute polling site additions before the election.It also said the average number of voters per polling place increased by 40 percent in those counties from 2012 to October 9. Across Georgia, about 90 percent of precincts do not adhere to a state law that caps the number of voters allowed to cast their ballots at a single polling site that has previously experienced voter delays at 2,000 people.The high number of voters using a single polling site extends beyond Georgia, a June voting analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy institute at New York University Law School, found.The average number of voters assigned to polling places also increased during the last five years in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, all states that previously required preclearance under the Voting Rights Act.Other US states, including those that did not have special requirements under the Voting Rights Act, have also been accused of using long waits at polling sites to suppress voters.In Ohio, where early voting began on October 6, the number of people who cast ballots in person during the first week of early voting nearly tripled compared with 2016, with 193,021 voters going to the polls compared with 64,312 four years ago.The surge led to hours-long waits at polling stations, including a line of voters in the city of Columbus that stretched about 0.4 kilometres (0.25 miles) on the first day the polls opened, the AP reported.Ohio state officials have blamed the long lines on the first day of early voting on high “enthusiasm” among the electorate.But a 2006 state law that limits early, in-person polling sites to one per county also contributed to the long line-ups, former President Barack Obama’s speechwriter, David Litt,notedthis week in The Guardian newspaper.Litt said the set-up means that residents of Vinton County, a Republican bastion with a population of 13,500, have access to the same number of early voting sites as the 1.3 million residents of Franklin County, which encompasses Columbus, the state capital.This line is for early voting in Columbus – yay#Ohio#VOTE👊🏽pic.twitter.com/0ZY0QArZ02— Ashley Koff RD (@ashleykoff)October 12, 2020“Blaming voters for the long lines they endure ignores the massive, intentional disparity in resources between the more and less populous parts of the state,” Litt wrote. “Ohio’s politicians have made voting far easier for Republicans and far more difficult for Democrats.”"

If it holds, it would flip the historically Republican state.A win for Biden in Pennsylvania give him more than 270 votes in the Electoral College –  enough for the presidency.With counts of mail ballots nearing an end, Americans and the world may know on Friday who the apparent winner is. But it will not end there.Recounts appear inevitable as President Donald Trump is planning court challenges in several key states. He has already attacked the entire process as rigged on Twitter and in aWhite House appearanceon Thursday night.Biden’s campaign is also assembling lawyers to protect his electoral lead in the courts and is asking online donors for money, saying “the fight is not over”.The heavily Democratic city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania is emerging as a hotspot in the dispute as mail ballot counts sliced President Trump’s early lead from in-person voting.Biden still leads continuing counts in Arizona and Nevada, two southwest states that combined, could also give Biden an overall win. Trump leads in North Carolina.In statements from the White House and on Twitter, Trump attacked the integrity of the election process in which in-person votes gave him an early lead which was later clipped by mail ballots.Trump tweeted at 2:22 am EST [07:22GMT] the votes still being counted are “illegal”. Twitter flagged the president’s tweet as “disputed” and potentially “misleading”.I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST. The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes accepted during this period must be determined to be ILLEGAL VOTES. U.S. Supreme Court should decide!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 6, 2020Some US television networkscut away from live coverageof Trump’s remarks from the White House on Thursday night in which he claimed the vote counting was illegal.Republicans have been divided by Trump’s rhetoric. In a message picked up by other House Republicans, Representative Adam Kinzinger tweeted Trump’s claims were “getting insane”.We want every vote counted, yes every legal vote (of course). But, if you have legit concerns about fraud present EVIDENCE and take it to court.  STOP Spreading debunked misinformation… This is getting insane.— Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger)November 6, 2020Trump’s allies joined the president’s accusations that Democrats were trying to “steal” the election.Senator Lindsey Graham announced on Fox News on Thursday night he will donate USD $500,000 to Trump’s legal fund to challenge the ballot counting and urged Fox viewers to contribute.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called this moment a “genuine, deep crisis” of the American system and called Democrats in Philadelphia “corrupt”.A federal judge in Philadelphia dismissed a lawsuit by Trump’s campaign over how many observers it could allow in the room during counting after an agreement was reached.Philadelphia police detained two people driving a military-style Hummer vehicle with QAnon symbols and a weapon who were suspected of planning to attack the building where election workers were counting votes.In a federal court filing on Friday in Washington, DC, the US Postal Service said it had found 1,700 ballots in Pennsylvania not yet delivered to election officials."

Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris's continued support for Israel's war in Gaza.,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris’s continued support for Israel’s war in Gaza.With the United Statespresidential electionless than four weeks away, analysts caution that Israel’sexpanding military campaignsacross the Middle East could bruise the chances of the Democratic candidate, Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Foreign policy is rarely a top priority for US voters. But Israel’s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign inLebanon, have spurred questions about the US’s role in the conflict.The administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters — particularly Arab Americans — turning against the party.With Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.“This is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,” Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Now party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.”Much of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, which has erasedentire neighbourhoodsand killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.That campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in USweapons assistance.“It’s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they’ve allowed to happen,” said Zogby.“There’s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don’t matter.”ASeptember pollby the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.That figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, hissupportamong Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.Biden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.When Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old’s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.But Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series ofescalatory strikesby Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.In a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”The Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August’sDemocratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.“People are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won’t give it to them,” said Zogby. “They’re making a mistake that will cost them votes.”While US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.Many of those voters are concentrated in a small number ofswing statesthat play an outsized role in deciding the country’s presidential elections.The Midwestern battleground state ofMichigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.Polling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.And her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.“The situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,” said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.“Since we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state’s Arab community stays home on election day,” he added.But Michigan’s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.Some believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.Others view a second term for Trump, apro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should “finish the job” in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.One group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is theUncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.During primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote “uncommitted”, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.Now, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris — but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.“As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,” a spokesperson said in a video released this week.“But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”The final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.In early October, for instance, Iran launched aballistic missile attackagainst Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehin Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.On that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.Analysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.ASeptember pollby the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.Respondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel’s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.Laura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.“Republican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they’re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,” Silver said.She pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza — and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.A February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.But Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such asyoung peopleand communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.“The pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,” he said. “The Democratic Party hasn’t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren’t listening, and they’ll pay a price for that.”"

With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into ...",13 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Where do the candidates stand in the polls? We’ll break it down, along with major updates from the campaign trail.With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into overdrive, with last-minute appeals to voters.Need a quick breakdown of the week’s biggest political news? Look no further.We’ll get you up to speed with five key takeaways from the past seven days and an overview of where the candidates stand in the polls.There are 23 days left before the November 5 election.As of October 11, the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows Vice President Kamala Harris up by 2.5 points, with 48.5 percent support compared to former President Donald Trump’s 46 percent.Another polling average, from the website 270toWin, shows Harris again with a marginal lead, with 49.3 percent support. Trump, meanwhile, is at 46.5 percent.Harris, the Democrat, could be poised to flip one of Trump’s key demographics: suburban voters.On October 10, the news agency Reuters and the market research poll Ipsos released a poll that showed Harris led her Republican rival 47 percent to 41 among suburbanites.But two days later, The New York Times and Siena College released a poll that indicated Harris could be slipping among Black voters. She pulled in 78 percent support — a drop from the estimated 90 percent support her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, earned in 2020.Within three days of forming in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Milton had billowed into a powerful Category 5 storm, earning the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Such rapid development had rarely been seen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton “one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin”.And it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.But as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.Swaths of the US South were still recovering from September’sHurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas”.On the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Bidenslapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.“Over the last few weeks, there’s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what’s going on,” Biden said, calling the distortions “un-American”.“Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,” he added.Harris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. “This is not a time for people to play politics,” she said, in reference to the Republican.Once criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of arecent media blitz.It was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.And even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.But in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.And her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.That last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.But host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing “shifting explanations”, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.The friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to “make her look better”.He also called on the Federal Communications Commission to “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE”. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission’s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.Through much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large — even dooming one candidate’s run.After a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a “weak” and “sleepy” old man.But at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.Those questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump’s “rambling” and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.And then, on Saturday, the White House released amemotouting hisDemocratic rival’s health.The 59-year-old Harris, it read, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency”.Trump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with astatement, arguing that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung wrote of Trump.On the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.Immigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump’s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.But critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.On Monday, Trumprecorded an audio interviewwith the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump said. “Now a murderer, I believe this: It’s in their genes. And we’ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”The Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.Speaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to “expedite the removal” of “savage gangs” from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.He also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.Despite Trump’s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.Reporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.In 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician’s eventual resignation.Since then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse ofTrump’s alleged relationshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.In its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.News outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book’s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump’s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an “angry, little man”.“None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,” Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.But the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley — once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.He tells Woodward in the book that Trump is “fascist to the core”."

The Democrat led 52 percent to 46 percent in the same poll last month.The latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51 percent to 48 percent among likely voters, compared with a four-point advantage last month.Following the latest figures, Harris holds a 1.4 percent point lead in Real Clear Polling’s aggregate of major polls, slipping from 2.2 percent on Saturday.The tightening poll numbers come amid concerns among Democrats that Harris is failing to shore up support among Hispanics and African Americans, two of the party’s key constituencies.While Harris is leading among women of all races, she has struggled to drum up enthusiasm among men, including African Americans and Hispanics, who have increasingly gravitated towards Trump in recent years.In The New York Times/Siena College polls released on Saturday and Sunday, Harris attracted the support of 78 percent of Black voters and 56 percent of Hispanic voters – significantly lower shares than won by the Democratic nominees in the 2020 and 2016 elections.On Thursday, former President Barack Obama admonished Black men for not showing as much enthusiasm for Harris’s candidacy as he had received during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012.“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama said at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of seven key battleground states expected to decide the election.“Because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”Harris and Trump on Sunday continued to focus their campaigns on the battleground states, holding events in North Carolina and Arizona, respectively.At a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris took aim at Trump for spreading misinformation about the government’s response to recent hurricanes.“The problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it’s making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they’re led to believe they cannot trust,” Harris said.“And that’s the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.”Trump, meanwhile, used a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona to call for the hiring of 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents.“After I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10 percent raise – they haven’t had one in a long time – for all agents and a $10,000 each retention and signing bonus,” Trump said. “We’re going to retain them.”"

All the results are within the margin of error with the exception of Nevada, where Trump is led by 5 percent in the WSJ poll.The newspaper said it surveyed 600 registered voters per state between September 28 and October 8.US elections are not won by popular vote nationwide. Rather, candidates compete in individual states to winelectoral college votes.It’s akin to a point system, where each state is worth a number of points proportionate to the size of its population. In all but two states – Maine and Nebraska – the winner takes all the electoral college votes.Most states are almost certain to go to one party. For example, a Democratic win in California and Vermont is often projected as soon as the polls close, while states like Oklahoma and Alabama are Republican strongholds.That leaves a handful of states where there are close, competitive elections. These are known asswing states. In this round, all eyes are on the seven states polled by WSJ.In 2016, Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote because he defeated the Democratic candidateHillary Clintonin most battleground states.According to a Pew Research Centersurveyreleased on Friday, Harris is leading the race nationally by one point – 48 percent to Trump’s 47 percent.US election poll results have fluctuated in recent months. While Trump enjoyed a solid lead overJoe Bidenearlier this year in almost all polls, the Democrats received a boost after the US president stepped aside and was replaced by Harris as the party’s nominee.A Morning Consult poll in September had Harris beating Trump 51 percent to 46 percent. But the former president appeared to claw back some support amid concerns about the economy and the turmoil inthe Middle East.US election polls have also been wide off the mark in the past. For example, many surveys had indicated that Clinton was set for a comfortable win when she lost toTrump in 2016.Still, this year various polls appear to agree that the US is heading to a close presidential election next month.Control of the Senate and House of Representatives will also be up for grabs on November 5.A New York Times poll on Friday predicted bad news for Democrats’ hopes of protecting their narrow majority in the Senate.The Democrats currently control the 100-member chamber with 51 seats, including four independents who caucus with the party.But the Times survey found that Democrats are likely to lose a potentially decisive seat in a Republican-leaning state.Republicans were already expected to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia – where conservative Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.But the Times poll indicated Democratic Senator Jon Tester is trailing his Republican opponent by eight percentage points in rural Montana, where Trump won with ease in 2016 and 2020.Democrats will also have a fight on their hands to keep Senate seats in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and Nevada, but they will be hoping to challenge Republican incumbents in Texas and Florida.A Republican-controlled Senate can prove to be a major hurdle for Harris should she win in November.Beyond its legislative powers, the Senate is tasked with confirmingjudicial appointmentsand cabinet members, which would allow Republicans to pressure Harris, should she be elected, on who she chooses for her governing team."

Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier ...",28 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier under Biden.Mumbai, India –Parneesh Mehta’s diamond jewellery business may be performing much better than many other companies around the world suffering from the crushing force of lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.But the entrepreneur based in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, says that is little consolation for the revenue he has lost because of tariff hikes on the gems and jewellery sector in his biggest export market – the United States.In April 2019, the US withdrew India and Turkey from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), an import duty exemption on certain goods – including Mehta’s jewels – that require a lot of manpower to make, from developing countries.“That really hurt us,” Mehta told Al Jazeera. “We had to adjust our prices for some of our clients. For others, we dropped the quality of the gems.”With both exporters and importers feeling the pinch, Mehta says the added tax will prevent businesses from growing. “Everyone’s getting squeezed,” he said. “If the GSP was restored, there’s no doubt it would help the sector as a whole”.Mehta’s experience is one example of how the India-US economic relationship has changed under the administration of US President Donald Trump. And why many Indian entrepreneurs like him have a keen interest in who occupies the White House after the November 3 US elections.Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the US’s trade deficit with India, which stood at $28.8bn in 2019, nearly three times the $10.6bn figure in 2008. In March 2019, he called India “a very high-tariff nation” and has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to redress the gap. India later retaliated, raising duties on 28 US products.Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have famously enjoyed afriendly rapport, but analysts say Trump’s punitive policies have made the economic environment more contentious. The two sides have repeatedlyfailed to signeven a “mini trade deal” that had initially been expected in September 2019.“There’s been a lot of positive engagement, but in reality, we are far from getting anything ratified,” Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi told Al Jazeera.This could change if Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, becomes the next US president and brings with him a more measured policymaking machine.“A Biden administration would not necessarily back down on big-ticket requests,” says Dhar, referring to the US’s push for greater access to India’s agriculture, medical device and e-commerce markets, and even for lower import tariffs on Harley Davidson motorbikes.“But we’d be unlikely to see the same aggression towards trade partners. This could lead to a better outcome for Indian negotiators”.Trump’s trade policies and negotiating stance may be based on populist impulses, but India is also taking an increasingly protectionist line.India’s incoming data protection bill has become one of the thorniest issues in negations.The bill threatens to prevent Indian data from leaving its shores, making life difficult for global technology giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google that rely on the free-flow of data.It also threatens to tax digital companies in a way that would also disproportionately affect US technology firms. The US has called this type of taxation “unfair” and “discriminatory” and has said it will “begin investigations” into how its trading partners are implementing such laws.After its economy suffered a historic shock (gross domestic product shrank by a record 23.9 percent in the April-June quarter), exacerbating an urgent need to create more blue- and white-collar jobs, analysts say India cannot afford to close itself off from negotiating a more favourable US trading relationship.“India needs to recognise that a trade relationship with the US is extremely beneficial for economic growth,” Anupam Manur, a research fellow at the Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately though, we may see nationalistic jingo and political point-scoring continue to take the upper hand”.However, recent investments by Facebook and Google in Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, could drive a change of mindset.Reliance is India’s largest and most influential company. With two major US tech giants taking a seat each on its board, analysts say this could strengthen the hand of US companies lobbying the Indian government to liberalise a wide range of issues governing India’s digital platforms.For this reason “I wouldn’t rule out a policy U-turn,” said JNU’s Dhar.But, regardless of the outcome of the US election, analysts believe progress on a trade agreement will hinge on the US securing greater access to India’s huge, yet fragmented, agricultural markets.India, however, is reluctant to endanger its mostly small-scale, independent producers by forcing them to compete with giant US agribusinesses. And with the global economic downturn set to drag on, as well as a strong farming lobby to placate at home, observers say a future Biden administration would likely take a hard line similar to Trump’s.September’shistoric changes to India’s farm laws, which will open up produce markets to private players, could also complicate matters. “Farmers already have apprehensions about these ordinances,” said Dhar. “Allowing American access on top of that means the situation could become very problematic”.With US unemployment at a high 8.4 percent and the country experiencing the toughest economic conditions since the Great Depression, analysts say there may be little political room for either of the two contenders to deviate from the US’s existing – and increasingly nativist – trade policies.“Let’s remember that Biden also has a ‘Made in America’ plan and has made an effort to appear tough on China,” explained Takshashila Institution’s Manur. “His talk of subsidising industry, which is against the World Trade Organisation rules, tells me he will also be protectionist”.The White House’s recent announcement of plans to reduce the number of visas awarded to skilled workers by a third is one such area where Biden’s hands may be tied.Last year, 74.5 percent of so-called H1-B visas were claimed by Indians, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, plugging a shortage of highly skilled labour in the US’s technology industries. High-profile Indian CEOs such as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Google’s parent Alphabet have also played an outsized role in contributing to Silicon Valley’s success.Despite this, Indians look set to miss out on future opportunities.“Like with the 2008 global financial crisis, the immigration issue has become mixed up in the feelings surrounding the downturn,” says Dhar. “[Biden] will eventually re-look at visa policies once the economy rebounds, but not before that”.But a change of US leadership could mean a return to more nuanced, rules-based decision-making. Consequently, there are hopes in India that the Iran nuclear deal, originally signed under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and abandoned by Trump, will be back on the table.This would help India, which lost an important export market, a valuable source of cheap oil and a potential stake in a key port by complying with US sanctions. “Iran has always been a strategic ally in the region,” says Dhar. “I hope this situation would improve if a new administration comes in”.India is likely to remain a key ally for the US as geopolitical tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific region. In a speech during his visit to India earlier this year, Trump clubbed the two nations together as “powerful defenders of peace and liberty”, drawing a blunt contrast with China – the other great regional power. Biden too has said he would “stand with India”, promising to tackle terror threats in the region together.As the US decouples itself from China’s economy, India is trying to take its place. Modi has pitched India as a “trusted partner” and welcomed foreign direct investment. In reality, US businesses are reluctant to leave China or disrupt their supply chains; and for the few that do, India is unlikely to be their preferred destination.“At most, US companies are hedging, perhaps moving 30 percent of their operations to Vietnam or Laos – India is not attractive to companies yet,” said Takshashila Institution’s Manur. But the current reforms to labour and land laws, which would make it easier for foreign businesses to set up shop in India, could change that, he added.India’s attempts to supplant undemocratic China and take advantage of the US’s boycotts and bans of Chinese technology firms may also invite increased scrutiny of its own human rights record.US Democrats have indicated they will call out human rights abuses around the world. After India withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir – the region it administers in part while Pakistan administers the other – and imposed a military lockdown on its residents, Biden’s vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, reminded observers: “We are watching”, suggesting a potential sore spot in India-US relations.Harris has repeatedly shown that despite her being part Indian, she may not be an easy ally for the Modi government. After India’s external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar cancelled a meeting last year when the US House Affairs Committee refused to exclude Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal – a critic of India’s Kashmir policy – Harris actively defended Jayapal’s presence, ruffling diplomatic feathers in the process.But not everyone believes that such conversations would harm the India-US economic relationship. A trade policy expert wishing to remain anonymous told Al Jazeera: “Modi has a thick skin about these things. Any criticism of human rights will wash off his back”.Tish Sanghera is a journalist based in Mumbai, where she writes about economic, political and social issues. Twitter: @TishSanghera"

The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to the presidential election on ...,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"The move comes as Republicans increasingly emphasise the chance of noncitizen voting, despite little evidence of any significant risk posed.The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to thepresidential electionon November 5.The lawsuit, filed on Friday, comes in response to an executive order issued in August by Virginia’s Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin.It initiated the removal of individuals from voter registration rolls if officials are “unable to verify that they are citizens” through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.But the Justice Department says the executive order was issued with too little time before election day, violating a 90-day “quiet period” outlined in The National Voter Registration Act.That period requires official systematic removals at least three months ahead of a federal vote.“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Assistant US Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.“The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.”Youngkin had issued his order on August 7, which marked 90 days until the election. In a statement on Friday, the governor argued the executive order fell within the law.“Virginians – and Americans – will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy,” Youngkin said.He pledged state authorities “will defend these common-sense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us”.“Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period,” Youngkin said.Republicans and allies of former President Donald Trump – the current Republican candidate for the presidency – have increasingly pushedunfounded claimsof possible election malfeasance ahead of this year’s vote.Those claims echo falsehoods spread about the 2020 election, which Trump has continued to falsely say was “stolen” through fraud.Some Republican officials have also advanced baseless claims that noncitizens are voting in large enough numbers to affect the outcome. In the US, only citizens can vote.Most voter administration is determined by state officials and legislatures, with only broad parameters from the federal government. Nearly all US states require some form of voter registration to cast a ballot, although many allow the registration to be done on election day.Ahead of the 2024 elections, several states – including Texas, Tennessee, Ohio and Alabama – have passed measures requiring higher burdens of proof to show a voter’s citizenship. Democracy monitors said those efforts may disenfranchise US citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote.The Brennan Center for Justice – a non-partisan policy organisation – found that noncitizen voting in the US is exceedingly rare. There is no evidence it had any bearing on recent elections.In 2017, the centre releaseda studylooking at 23.5 million votes cast in the 2016 general election.Only 30 votes were flagged for suspected noncitizen voting. Data was not available on how many of those votes proved to have been cast by noncitizens."

All to know in 500 ...,"Sep 21, 2024 ... Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.",Last update 22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.Election day in the United States may still be several weeks away, but Americans in several parts of the country are getting a chance to cast their ballots already.In-person, advanced voting became possible in the US states of Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia this week while several other states opened up their mail-in voting processes earlier this month.Both are forms of “early voting”, a mainstay of US elections that in recent years has become a target offalse voter fraud accusations.Rights advocates say robust early voting opportunities help ensure more people can cast a ballot regardless of disability, time constraints, work, travel or other factors that could hamper them on election day, which this year is on November 5.Early voting also offers an opportunity to build enthusiasm: When Taylor Swift, who recentlyendorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, announced she would perform in Florida just before early voting begins there in October, local Democrats quickly seized on the moment.“Taylor is bringing the Eras Tour to Miami in the weekend leading up to early voting, and I look forward to seeing that energy play out in Florida!!!” the Miami-Dade Democratic Party said.Voting in US presidential elections is only broadly steered by the federal government. US states determine much of how the logistics of the vote plays out in their respective jurisdictions.Currently, every state in the country allows some form of early voting, with mail-in voting the most prevalent option.At least eight of the 50 states send all registered voters a ballot in the mail while 14 still require voters to provide a reason for why they need to cast their ballot – sometimes known as an “absentee ballot” – by mail.Most states also provide in-person voting before election day. Only three states do not.That depends on the year.In the 2020 election, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100 million voters cast their ballots before election day — representing about two-thirds of all Americans who voted that year, a record.Americans living abroad, members of the US military and people with disabilities are among the many who have traditionally chosen to vote early.A 2001 Supreme Court ruling upheld that voters did not need to provide a reason to cast an early ballot, as long as their state allows it.Early voting — in particular, mail-in voting — was at the centre of unfounded election fraud claims in 2020.That’s because Democrats have historically cast more votes by mail than Republicans, who are more likely to vote on election day. Many jurisdictions count votes cast in person before they begin counting mail-in votes although the process varies.That can create a “blue shift” or “red mirage”, in which early results in key states appear to initially show the Republican candidate leading, only to shift to the Democratic candidate as the mail-in votes are counted.In 2020, then-President Donald Trump falsely said the mail-in votingsystem was rife with fraud. The Republican ultimately lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, but he has continued to claim the vote was stolen from him.Many state legislaturesenactednew restrictions on early voting after the 2020 contest, including higher scrutiny for ballots cast by mail.But the Republican Party has more fully embraced early voting this year as Trump runs again against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris."

Homeless Americans face challenges in voting during the 2016 US elections, but many still exercise their right.",Last update 17 Sep 2016,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Homeless Americans face challenges in voting during the 2016 US elections, but many still exercise their right.Washington, DC –Inside the wide, sunlit foyer of the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library, Eric Sheptock points to an expansive mural of the late civil rights activist.“I wish that the poor people of today were as willing to fight for justice as those who marched with Martin Luther King,” he says. “It seems that the poor have lost heart and are less willing to stand up for themselves.”Sheptock, who has been intermittently homeless since 1994, has become an activist for Washington DC’s homeless community, which he hopes will vote in the forthcoming elections when Americans head to the polls to choose their 45th president.“There is no reason for a homeless person not to vote,” he tells Al Jazeera. “You can’t be denied the right to vote because you’re homeless.”While it is difficult to register to vote without a permanent address, it is not impossible.Many states nowallow individuals to list the placethey generally occupy as their residence, which can include a shelter or even a park bench. However, the requirement for official identification when voting can cause challenges for the homeless – obtaining a state-issued ID can be both complicated and costly.But, as political discussions take place in living rooms across the United States, Washington DC’s homeless community also engages in its own political discourse – equally as captivated by the ongoing presidential campaign as the wider public, according to Sheptock. “I do hear a lot of homeless people talking about politics … We’ve had some pretty energetic conversations about Trump versus Clinton.”He explains that free newspapers, televisions in homeless shelters and internet access in public libraries are invaluable sources of information on the presidential campaign.READ MORE: New York’s homeless left out in the coldFifty-one-year-old Tony Leonard has been living on the streets of DC since losing his job and subsequently his home in 2011. He says that the city’s homeless community is very politically active. “A lot of us [who are] homeless in DC are educated people who had lives before but lost everything.”Come November, Leonard will be voting for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, citing her political experience as his motive. As for her opponent, Republican candidate Donald Trump, “He’s a joke,” Leonard says. “I don’t think anyone thinks he’d make a good president.”Sheptock says he won’t be voting for Trump either. He tells Al Jazeera that he is torn between Green Party Leader Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton. “All I can say right now is that I plan to vote for a woman”.Yet, while the majority of homeless interviewed for this article expressed their support for Clinton, not all were averse to Trump’s message.Jeffrey McNeill claims to have worked as a doorman at Trump’s Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City for three years before he lost everything to gambling.He subsequently moved to Washington DC in 2007, where he would spend the next three years of his life sleeping on the pavement and in shelters. McNeill bought Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal, which he said changed his life forever.“It was the greatest book ever; it taught me about the economy, how to make deals, how to make money and how to get a job.” The book taught him to be a good businessman, he says.Ultimately, however, McNeill explains he feels let down by the Democratic administration. “I was a lifelong Democrat; I voted for Obama twice … but there are more homeless people in the city now than when I arrived. I did better under Republican presidents than I have done under Obama.”America’s hidden homeless: Life in the Starlight MotelMore than 500,000 people in the United States were without housing on any given night last year, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 2015 annualreport.In Washington DC,the number of homeless reached 7,298 in 2015.Experts say a lack of formal data on homeless voters means it is difficult to measure their electoral participation. However,statistically, people from lower-income backgrounds have been less likely to vote than those with higher incomes.“There are a good number of people experiencing homelessness who care about voting. It’s no different to the population at large,” said David Pirtle, a public education coordinator for the National Homeless Coalition, who has himself experienced homelessness.But, there are variations. People living in shelters or transitional housing are far more likely to vote than those with no form of accommodation at all, said Pirtle. “People who are literally living on the street probably have the lowest turnout because a lot of those folks are dealing with other serious issues apart from being homeless, for example, mental health [or] substance abuse.”Pirtle added that many of these individuals “may not be capable or interested in the process”.WATCH – Voters’ Rights: What’s Happening to American Democracy?David Lee Norris, 59, and his wife, Naomi Macmillan, 53, are among this group. Home for them is an underpass next to Washington DC’s Union Railway Station. Having both suffered from drug-addiction, they moved from their home in South Carolina in January in the hope of receiving better healthcare for Naomi, who is HIV-positive.Any assistance they receive comes from NGOs, not the government, according to Norris.“The government is doing nothing … they are the reason we are here,” he says. “That’s why I’m not voting.”Obtaining information on voting procedures is very much down to the individual, which can be an extra challenge for those experiencing homelessness, said Julian Johannesen, director of research and training at Nonprofit Vote.“The government does not help anyone to vote here; you don’t even know where the registration form is,” Johannesen tells Al Jazeera. “People who are already under enormous stress and … have bigger priorities that occupy their attention can benefit from having some help getting over the administrative hurdles.”Ken Martin, has been homeless in Washington DC since 2012, and while he will be voting in November, he agrees that for many homeless, it is a challenge.“When you are worrying about whether or not you’re going to have a roof over your head or a place to eat or a place to get a shower, you’re not thinking about who’s going to be in the Oval Office – you’re thinking about just making it through the day,” says the 62-year-old.For the women at Washington DC’s N Street Village, a shelter and recovery centre for homeless and low-income women, lively discussions on the elections are commonplace. Hillary Clinton’s healthcare policies feature particularly high on the agenda during such conversations.“She’s interested in women’s care, mental health … She’s determined to make sure that women are well-taken care of when she gets to the White House,” says Mary, who lost everything after health problems led to costly and unmanageable medical bills and asked to be identified using a pseudonym.Cheryl Barnes, meanwhile, who has previously been homeless for 30 years, after suffering from substance and alcohol abuse, says the N Street Village saved her, and come November, she’ll also be voting for Hillary Clinton.Another resident at the N Street Village, Julia Miller, says she doesn’t align with any particular party. “I like Trump,’ says Miller who has been living at the shelter for five years. “[He] has an economic plan for the country, and I think … he’ll bring more jobs to the United States.”When it came to voting, Miller said that people should not be stereotyped because of their economic situation. “Everyone should be allowed to vote, that’s how homeless people get legislative action to …change the situation and access more resources.”She said that no matter which candidate becomes president, she wants them to provide more resources for the homeless.In the future, there needs to be a more focused campaign about voting, according to Pirtle.“We spend a lot of money in this country to get the general population to vote,” he says. “We shouldn’t leave our homeless neighbours aside.”Voting can also have a very positive emotional effect, he adds. “The general feeling [people] can get living on the street is that they are isolated, that they don’t have a voice, but getting people to participate in the electoral process … can have a very beneficial effect on their morale.”Sitting in the cool foyer of the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library, Sheptock emphasises that the space has become a sanctuary for many of the homeless community wanting to escape the city’s blistering summer heat. Ultimately, he wants people to vote no matter what their circumstance.“If you don’t vote, then you can’t fuss and nag about what the politicians do,” he says. “If you do vote, that earns you the right to complain about what government does.”Follow Jessica Sarhan on Twitter@JessicaSarhan"

The counting will not stop. It will continue until every duly cast vote is counted.”The AP news agency issued a bulletin saying it is not calling the presidential race yet, despite Trump’s claims of victory, because neither candidate has secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win.Speaking from the White House at 02:30 ET, Trump said: “Frankly, we did win this election.”The president said he would go to the Supreme Court to stop the counting of mail ballots.“His assertion of victory does not match the results and information currently available to the AP,” the news service reported.Several key states are too early to call, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan the agency said.Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland has sent this report from Tucson, Arizona.Democrat Mark Kelly has won a US Senate seat for Arizona, beating Republican Martha McSally for the seat once held by Senator John McCain, who died in August 2018.“Tonight is not about celebrating, tonight is about getting to work,” Kelly told a small crowd in Tucson earlier in the evening.He spoke about the hardships Arizonans have faced owing to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying many small businesses are in peril in the southwest state.The Democrat leader said he would strive for policies to set back Trump’s crackdown on immigration, lowering healthcare costs and the need to “rebuild the economy – and it’s going to be a massive undertaking”.A centrist Democrat and former astronaut, Kelly first opened a large lead over McSally as the vote counting got under way in the southwest state.4 Nov 2020 - 08:05 GMTAl Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this report from Raleigh, North Carolina.At 2:30am (07:30 GMT), the presidential race in North Carolina was still too close to call.Trump was leading Biden by about 76,700 votes, with 95 percent of expected votes counted.According to the State Board of Elections, roughly 117,000 absentee ballots have not yet been returned.Those ballots, if postmarked by Election Day, can still be counted if they arrive by November 12.The close race did not stop Trump from prematurely declaring “a big win in North Carolina” during televised remarks early on Wednesday morning.Democrat Mark Kelly defeats Republican Senator Martha McSally in Arizona’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency.Democratic presidential Biden and senate candidate Kelly have been declared the winners in Arizona, according to the AP news agency.The win gives Biden 11 votes in the Electoral College that Trump had won in 2016.🇺🇸 Biden wins Arizona 🗳️ Live results 👉 https://aje.io/c33haPosted byAl Jazeera EnglishonTuesday, November 3, 2020Cindy McCain, the widow of late Senator John McCain, a Republican, had endorsed Biden.Biden got strong support from voters in the Phoenix area, Maricopa County, where the majority of the state’s population resides.Read morehere4 Nov 2020 - 07:46 GMTPresident Trump prematurely claims victory in the presidential election, before vote counting has ended, and suggested Democrats were engaged in fraud as key states continued to count hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots.“This is a fraud on the American public.

He also predicted a “big” win for himself.We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 4, 2020Twitter labelled his tweet as making a “potentially misleading claim about an election”.Trump’s tweets came immediately after a statement from Biden, who said he was optimistic about his prospects of winning.Biden spoke from Delaware shortly after midnight, saying he is optimistic he is going to win the US presidential election.“We knew this was going to go long … but look, we feel good about where we are. We believe we are on track to win this election,” Biden said.“It ain’t over ‘til every vote is counted, every ballot is counted.“We are confident about Arizona … We’re also just calling for Minnesota and we are still in the game in Georgia … And we are feeling really good about Wisconsin and Michigan … We are going to win in Pennsylvania. Keep the faith guys, we are going to win this.”Shortly after Biden gave an election night speech, Trump tweeted he would speak tonight.Florida and its 29 electoral votes were a must-win for Trump. If he wound up losing there, it would have significantly narrowed his path to 270 electoral votes.Early indications are that Trump, although losing Miami-Dade, the most populous county in Florida, improved his vote total there, from 2016. Florida political experts are crediting Trump’s improvement with Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade with helping him to victory.At the beginning of the evening, we listed Florida as one of the “super seven” states that if Biden flipped early on, it would have signalled a potentially clear path for him. The other six states on that list – Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and Iowa – are still too close to call. Biden’s clear path is much muddier now after Florida lands in Trump’s column.Our analysis still holds true: If Biden can win two of those six, especially two large states, it makes it that much more difficult for Trump to hit 270. But given the close counts in those other states, as well as the other Trump 2016 states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – we are in for an extremely long night or, perhaps, another long day tomorrow waiting for final results.Read morehereThe AP has called Montana and Iowa for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump 9 more electoral votes.The AP has called Ohio for the Republican Party, giving Trump 18 electoral votes.Biden is set to speak at 00:30 ET from Wilmington, Delaware, according to his campaign.While key Democratic-leaning cities like Detroit, Michigan and Philadelphia have halted counting, Trump’s team “have started to feel optimistic given the fact that they went into this knowing that Joe Biden had a substantial lead”.Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont filed this report from PennsylvaniaOn Election Night, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said counting the state’s millions of ballots will take time and asked voters to be patient. Voters returned a record-breaking 2.5 million mail ballots across the state, but by law, it could not start counting them until the morning of Election Day.“Counting that tremendous number of ballots will, again, take longer than we’re used to, but the extra time is just there because we want to make sure our election system is working and that each and every vote is counted,” Wolf said.“We may not know the results today, as a result, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath and, as I’ve been saying, just be patient. What’s most important is that we have accurate results and that every vote is counted, even if that takes a little longer.”By midnight local time, about 50 percent of Pennsylvania’s votes had been counted and Trump was ahead in the race.The AP news agency has called Minnesota for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 10 more electoral votes.The AP news agency has called Hawaii for the Democratic Party, giving Biden four more electoral votes.4 Nov 2020 - 04:44 GMTReynolds, reporting from Los Angeles, says Arizona could be one of the surprises of the night.“It has not been called yet, but it’s looking good for Joe Biden,” Reynolds said. “And this is extraordinary because Arizona is formerly a rock-ribbed Republican state … it hasn’t gone for a Democratic President since … 1996.”Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer filed this report from Kenosha, WisconsinAs polls close in Wisconsin, a local pizzeria is ground zero for Kenosha’s Republicans.Complete with Fox News streaming across two televisions and a cardboard cutout of the president at the door, a long table filled with various pies bisects the mask-less crowd watching the earliest results roll in.Sheila Dissmore, 57, opted to vote in person on Tuesday.“Being a full-blown patriot, I feel like it’s just extra special voting on [election] day,” she says. “Just seeing how raw and unedited the president I think is refreshing.”Living on Kenosha’s south side with her 92-year-old father through the pandemic, this summer’s civil unrest caused Dissmore to double down on her Republican beliefs.“For the first time in my life, having to lock my door, close the shutters, close everything, turn the drapes and having my father there – I’m not a gun owner, but I wish I was.”Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith has defeated Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi’s Senate race, according to the AP news agency.Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock will advance to a runoff in Georgia’s special US Senate election, the AP projects.Since no candidate in the 21-candidate field received 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off on January 5, with the winner being sworn in immediately thereafter.It is projected Loeffler edged out Republican US Representative Doug Collins to land in the top two.This is significant in that the Republicans’ Senate majority may hang in the balance until January if neither is able to claim a majority after the rest of tonight’s races are projected.Worth noting as we wait for the final projection on too-close-to-call North Carolina: Biden had not visited the state since October 18, making it one of the few key battlegrounds where he did not campaign in the final sprint.His running mate Kamala Harris did make four stops over two days in that period.For his part, Trump made five visits to North Carolina between October 21 and Election Day.Republican Roger Marshall has defeated Democrat Barbara Bollier in Kansas’s Senate race.Republican Senator James Risch has defeated Democrat Paulette Jordan in Idaho’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley has defeated Republican Jo Rae Perkins in Oregon’s Senate race.The AP has called Utah for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump six more electoral votes.4 Nov 2020 - 04:05 GMTAP has called New Hampshire for the Democratic Party, giving Joe Biden four more electoral votes.The AP calls Idaho for the Republican Party, giving Trump four more electoral votes.The AP has called California, Oregon and Washington state for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 74 more electoral votes.It is 23:00 ET (04:00 GMT) and the last polls have closed in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this reportThe Pennsylvania Commonwealth Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said there have been no serious voting issues in the state.“I’m happy to report that today’s election in the Commonwealth went remarkably smoothly,” she told reporters. “We have no major or widespread events to report … No reports of violence at any polling places today,” Boockvar added. “There were a few reports of voters feeling intimidated that were resolved by calls to the counties.”Overall, Boockvar said her team at the voter information hotline answered 5,000 calls, mostly standard issues such as late-opening polls and lines at some polling stations.Other reported issues included: an individual accidentally shooting himself in Northampton County and then driving himself to the hospital; a volunteer with the Pennsylvania Democrats being shot with a paintball gun from a moving vehicle. Boockvar said this happened right before the polls closed, without elaborating. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit on behalf of Spanish-speaking voters who were not provided language access in York, Pennsylvania.Texas “is still pretty close”, Zhou-Castro reported from Houston, Texas.“Normally by this time of night on election night pundits would have called Texas already for the Republican candidate,” She said “[But the fact that] votes are coming in and Joe Biden is still within reach of overtaking Trump … is making headlines in the state.”The AP has called Missouri for the Republican Party, giving Trump 10 more electoral votes.“This state plays a huge role in presidential elections … Donald Trump looks like he is forging ahead in this state potentially with an even wider lead than he had over Hillary Clinton,” Gallacher reported from Miami Florida.“Donald Trump really does need to win this, the largest of all the battleground states, with 29 electoral college votes.”He added that Biden “has other options to the White House including places like Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, but at the moment we are getting pretty close to this state being called.”“There is some pressure now from the Trump campaign for officials to call it, and they already tweeted out ‘Trump has won Florida’, but that is not official yet … [but] it does look like Donald Trump may take Florida which is what he actually needs to do,” he said.Not unexpectedly, Republican Tommy Tuberville has been projected as the winner of the US Senate race in Alabama, defeating Doug Jones.Tuberville, a former college football coach, was significantly outraised by Jones, but Alabama is a deeply Republican state and the outcome wasn’t in question.Jones won a special election in 2017 to replace Republican Jeff Sessions, who resigned his seat to become Trump’s attorney general. Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore, who had faced allegations of sexual misconduct.Moore ran against Tuberville and others in the Republican primary this year, but to the relief of Republicans, Tuberville won the nomination setting them on the path to reclaim the seat.4 Nov 2020 - 03:15 GMTRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been re-elected for a second term in the US House of Representatives.The rising star in the Democratic Party was easily re-elected in New York’s 14th congressional district. Ocasio-Cortezmade historyin 2018 as the youngest woman elected to Congress in US history at the age of 28, championing her working-class and Puerto Rican roots. She is the daughter of a cleaner and a father who died in his 40s.Serving NY-14 and fighting for working class families in Congress has been the greatest honor, privilege, & responsibility of my life.Thank you to the Bronx & Queens for re-electing me to the House despite the millions spent against us, & trusting me to represent you once more.https://t.co/MXG2Z2DV2F— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)November 4, 2020Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the so-called “Squad” of four freshman progressive Democratic congresswomen that includes Rashida Tlaib from Detroit, Ilhan Omar from Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley from Boston.The four represent a new emerging faction of young, progressive politicians who are pushing the established House leadership of the Democratic Party.South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham survived a re-election scare defeating well-funded Democrat Jaime Harrison.Democrats were extremely encouraged by the polls last month showing Harrison making the race much more competitive than expected in deeply Republican South Carolina.But pro-Trump Graham, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee shepherded Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, was able to pull out a victory tonight.The AP has called Kansas for the Republican Party giving Trump six more electoral votes.It is 22:00 ET (03:00GMT) and the polls have closed in Montana, Utah, Nevada and Iowa.Democrat John Hickenlooper defeated Republican Senator Cory Gardner in Colorado’s US Senate race, according to a projection from the Associated Press news agency.This is the first Republican Senate seat picked up by the Democrats tonight in their quest to take control of the Senate.Currently, Republicans have a 53-47 majority. Democrats need to net three seats to take over the Senate if Joe Biden wins the presidency, or four if Trump wins. The vice president is the tie-breaking vote and if Biden wins, Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaker in a 50-50 Senate.If Trump wins, Mike Pence would be the tie-breaking vote if the Senate ends up 50-50.“There is silence out of the Biden camp at the moment,” said Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna from Wilmington, Delaware. “All are simply watching the results and the ongoing analysis of what is happening, but nobody is breaking cover at the moment, the situation is so close, so absolutely tense in a number of states, that nobody wants to come up and make any calls at this particular point in time.”“Joe Biden said it very clearly early on in the afternoon that when he got something to say, he will come out and he will say it and very clearly this instruction has gone down to his staff, we heard very little from the Biden campaign headquarters… We understand that Joe Biden himself is still at his home here in Wilmington, Delaware in a few hours time he will come to the convention centre with his vice president nominee Kamala Harris,” he said.The AP has called Colorado for the Democratic Party, giving Biden nine more electoral votes.Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey, reporting from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania said the state is in for a long count.“The polls have only just closed in Pennsylvania and in addition to all of the ballots that were cast today, the state now has to count some two and a half million mail-in ballots, and that is only just beginning that process … which can only begin on election day by Pennsylvania law,” she said.“So this could take a while, officials are predicting it might be before the end of the week before we have really clear results, but it’s interesting to point out that Democrats returned nearly three times as many mail-in ballots as Republicans did that’s maybe why President Trump has been very worried about those mail-in ballots,” she said. “He has been attempting to discredit or delegitimise those mail-in ballots, so we had an issue earlier in the day where a judge expressed concern about some missing mail-in ballots and has ordered about two dozens mail processing centres to be searched for possible missing ballots.”People across the United States have voted in one of the most polarising presidential elections in the country’s history – and the race is also playing out on social media.The #Vote2020 and #ElectionDay hashtags are trending in most countries on Twitter, as the world closely follows the hard-fought matchup between Trump and Biden on Tuesday.Read morehere.Trying to balance out all that#ElectionDaystress eating…pic.twitter.com/zU9wlM30kg— Sierra Club (@SierraClub)November 3, 2020The AP has called the District of Columbia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three more electoral votes.The governor of Pennsylvania has confirmed the vote count in the battleground state will take longer than expected, amid a surge in mail-in voting.Pennsylvania does not start counting mail voting until Election Day and will accept ballots postmarked by November 3 for three days after. Some districts have said they will not start counting mail votes until Wednesday morning.PA Governor Tom Wolf says vote count will take longer than normal (this was anticipated due to the high volume of mail ballots)“We may not know the results today, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath.""

Lawyers for Democrats then requested that eight additional sites also stay open later.The judge granted both requests and said anyone in line at 8pm local time (04:00 GMT) would be allowed to cast a ballot.The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada shared a list of the Clark County polling sites that will stay open later.🗳️🗳️ TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO VOTE 🗳️🗳️Some Clark County polling locations have added an hour of voting tonight.

Trump won all but New Hampshire in 2016. And there are some signs in the exit polls and the vote count that show some early positive signs for Trump and Biden in different states.In Florida, Trump is keeping Biden’s margin of victory down in Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county.In North Carolina and Ohio, exit polls suggest Biden is receiving more support among suburban voters than Trump did in 2016.The Associated Press, which is one of several US media organization making calls, waits until a significant number of votes have been counted, while also analysing exit polling data, in competitive states before they make projections.Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from New Hanover CountyTrump supporters in North Carolina were energised at polling stations across the beach town of Wilmington. They were confident New Hanover County, where Wilmington is located, and the state will go red.“Trump has done a lot,” Char Marker said. “He’s done a lot of things to tackle our child sex trafficking problem that we have, which is huge to me.“I am a pro-life voter. And, you know, Trump has been one of the most pro-life presidents we’ve had yet. They say Trump is kind of like a party of his own. And if that’s the case, I’m in that party.”Across town, 22-year-old Brandon Panameno said he voted for Trump because he is not the “typical politician”.“The economy has been doing well” under Trump, he said. “I think he has a pretty good chance of winning again.”Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from rural Kenosha county, WisconsinIn rural Kenosha, Trump signs abound but not everyone is on board. In the village of Bristol, in central Kenosha county, a short line of voters are waiting to enter Bristol Village Hall where voting booths are delineated by yellow and orange traffic cones strung together with yellow rope.Tony Chacon, who moved to Bristol nine years ago from Kenosha, had just completed voting. “It’s better over here on this side of the Interstate. I feel a lot safer,” the 26-year-old said.“I’m in trade work so I’m big on keeping work in the United States,” he told Al Jazeera of his decision to vote for Trump. “He’s a businessman … someone who knows how money moves and how to move it,” said Chacon.For him, when Biden was vice president, “things were getting rough when it comes to prices of fuel.” He added that ultimately “our choices aren’t really the best” before turning to greet fellow Bristol resident, Brian Chwaszczewski, 33, who had also just voted.While he was reluctant to name the candidate he voted for, Chwaszczewski did say that “being out here in more of a rural area, I’m sure there [are] plenty of Trump supporters. I just wanted to kind of not support that.” He feels like something of an outlier in his community. “It’s Trump signs everywhere,” he said, as darkness set in.Democratic Senator Chris Coons defeated Republican Lauren Witzke in Delaware’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Dick Durbin defeated Republican Mark Curran in Illinois’ Senate race.Democratic Senator Ed Markey defeated Republican Kevin O’Connor in Massachusetts’ Senate race.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated Republican Corky Messner in New Hampshire’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Cory Booker defeated Republican Rik Mehta in New Jersey’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Jack Reed defeats Republican Allen Waters in Rhode Island’s Senate race.Republican Senator Mitch McConnell has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath in Kentucky’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency.The AP has called for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 69 electoral votes.The AP calls Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee for the Republican Party, giving Trump 33 electoral votes.It is 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Washington, DC.The AP calls South Carolina for the Republican Party, giving Trump 9 electoral votes.Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from Wilmington, North CarolinaPolls started to close in North Carolina where voters from both parties expressed optimism all day.Michael Master said he was hopeful Trump would pull out another victory in the state.“As a person, Trump puts Americans first,” Master said at a polling location in Wilmington. “And he puts especially the average American worker first.”Across the parking lot, Biden supporter Nick Rhodes said he was confident Biden would win.“We need to bring our country back together in terms of getting rid of division, and start embracing science and start bringing people together because we cannot have another four years of this,” he said.A handful of precincts in the state will stay open later because of delayed openings. We are expecting to see results from early and absentee voting to start rolling in within the next hour. In-person results will follow later this evening.The Trump campaign and Nevada Republicans are asking a state court judge to extend voting by one hour at 22 Las Vegas-area polling locations, according to the Associated Press news agency and Nevada Independent newspaperAn Election Day lawsuit filed in Clark County claims the 22 voting locations did not open on time. It was getting an immediate hearing before Judge Joe Hardy.“If immediate action is not taken, appellants will never have the opportunity to vindicate their rights,” attorneys for the two groups wrote in the filing. “More troubling, Nevadans – and the rest of the country – will be left wondering whether the results of the election are legitimate.”Election officials keep sites open until the last person in line at closing time can vote. Polling places in Nevada are scheduled to close at 22:00 ET (02:00 GMT).All polls will close in the battleground state of Florida at 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT)Here is why the state is so significant.The AP news agency calls Virginia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 13 electoral votes.A helpful road map, if you want to figure out how election night is going to shape up, is to keep an eye on seven states’ results, which we will dub the “super” seven.If Biden can win early on any of the following states that Trump won in 2016, it could indicate a positive evening for him. If Trump holds them, that will likely delay a projection of an overall winner.Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas are the states that are expected to count votes fairly efficiently and, if there’s a clear winner, are expected to be projected for one of the two candidates.If Biden picks up one, assuming he also wins all of the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he will be well on his way to 270 votes, as it will be a state flipped from Republican to Democrat. If he picks up two, that makes things even clearer and puts Biden well down the path to a potential win.Note that other key Trump states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – are not part of that list. Those states are expected to count their votes much more slowly and if Trump holds onto the other seven, will factor into many more hours, if not days, of waiting for a winner to be projected.Republican Moore has defeated Democrat Paula Jean Swearengin in West Virginia’s US Senate race.The AP calls West Virginia for the Republican Party, giving Trump five electoral votes.It is 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT) and polls have closed in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.Biden is outperforming Hillary Clinton among key voters in Georgia, according to exit polls from The Associated Press news agency.Suburban voters, who Trump won by five points in 2016, are backing Biden by double digits in this year’s exit polls. Among suburban women, Biden has the support of six in 10 of them.Turnout among Black voters has kept pace with 2016, as they make up approximately three in 10 voters this year. Biden has also kept pace with Hillary Clinton, with nine in 10 Black voters saying they support Biden.If Biden is to flip Georgia to the Democrats for the first time since 1992, he will need robust turnout from Black voters and a strong showing among suburban voters.Georgia’s polls closed at 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT), but The Associated Press news agency has not called the race as of yet.The AP exit poll surveyed more than 106,000 voters over eight days, including Election Day. The margin of error is +/-0.4 percent.Despite the US witnessing a record number of early votes in the presidential election, tens of millions of American voters headed to polling stations across the country on Tuesday.Polls began closing in the United States at 18:00 Eastern Standard Time (23:00 GMT) and closing times vary by state.Find out when the polls close in each statehere.Democratic US Senator Mark Warner defeats Republican Daniel Gade in Virginia’s US Senate race, according to AP.The AP calls Vermont for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three electoral votes.The AP calls Kentucky for the Republican Party, giving Trump eight electoral votes.It is 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Virginia and Vermont.Swing states, also known as battleground states, will have an outsize influencing in deciding the next president of the US.Watch our one-minute explainer on why.Racial justice is one of several big issues on the minds of US voters today, as the country for months has seen mass protests demanding an end to systemic racism and police violence against Black people.Janelle King, a Republican strategist, defended US President Donald Trump, saying he has helped the Black community by tackling unemployment and funding various programmes, such as historically Black colleges and universities.“He provided the Black community with policies,” she told Al Jazeera.But Derrick Plummer, a Democratic strategist, said it is false to say that Trump has done a lot to help the Black community.“When you had peaceful African Americans, Black people, in the streets saying that we want to end systemic racism, we have a president that doesn’t even think systemic racism is real,” he told Al Jazeera.Voters are quite unhappy with the direction of the country and how the federal government is working, according to The Associated Press news agency’s VoteCast data.About three-quarters of voters said they are dissatisfied or angry with the way the government is working and six in 10 say they are unhappy with the direction of the country.Trump has tweeted “we’re looking really good all over the country”.“Thank you,” the president tweeted shortly after the first polling places, in parts of Indiana and Kentucky, closed on Election Day.Indications on who is ahead in preliminary state results are expected to take hours.WE ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 3, 2020The first polls have closed on Election Day in Indiana and Kentucky.Polls closed in parts of the two states that lie within the Eastern Time zone, but those within the Central Time zone will remain open for an additional hour.Both states are considered Republican bastions, but results are not expected to begin coming in until later Tuesday.With only a few hours before polls close in Michigan on Election Day, Rashida Tlaib said she is optimistic she will be heading back to Washington, DC.An outspoken progressive, the Palestinian American legislator is up for re-election in the 13th District of Michigan – a Democratic stronghold that she is almost certain to carry.She says strong voter turnout so far in the US elections is very encouraging.“I’ve not, in all the years I’ve run for office, seen lines like this,” Tlaib told Al Jazeera, crediting the crowds in part to a desire to vote President Donald Trump out of office.“[It] gives me hope that the turnout is going to be high enough where it’s very clear that Donald Trump is not wanted as the president of the United States any more.”Read morehere.The FBI and the New York attorney general were looking into a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home on Election Day as the nation remains on high alert to ensure voting is not compromised, according to the Reuters news agency.US state and local officials have been raising the alarm over at least two separate automated call campaigns as millions of Americans cast their votes on Tuesday to decide between Trump and Biden. Experts who spoke to Reuters say they are mystified by the most prominent robocalling campaign, which has been running for months and tells people to remain home but does not explicitly mention voting.“There’s a little bit of confusion about this one across the industry,” said Giulia Porter, vice president at RoboKiller, a company that fights telemarketers and robocalls and has been tracking the campaign.Audio of the calls, which RoboKiller shared with Reuters, features a synthetic female voice saying: “Hello. This is just a test call. Time to stay home. Stay safe and stay home.”Porter said the call had been placed millions of times in the past 11 months or so but had on Tuesday shot up to number 5 or number 6 in the list of top spam calls. A Department of Homeland Security official said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the calls. The FBI said only that it was aware of reports of robocalls and had no further comment.Biden made a couple of last-minute campaign visits to Pennsylvania, stopping by his childhood home in Scranton and speaking to volunteers in Philadelphia.Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, he expects to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the three Midwest states known as the “Blue Wall”.“I think we are going to do well. We’re going to re-establish that Blue Wall,” Biden said, referring to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Trump won those states in 2016, turning them Republican for the first time in decades.Biden said this year is interesting.“You can’t think of an election in the recent past where so many states are up for grabs. The idea that I’m still in play in Texas, in Georgia, in Florida,” he said. And said he would wait for a result before speaking later on election night.“There’s so much in play out there and an overwhelming vote out there. If there’s something to say tonight, I’ll come out and say it, otherwise, I will wait until all the votes are counted.”Speaking to reporters Tuesday outside a Delaware community centre, Biden said he’s “superstitious” about offering predictions for election night but remains “hopeful”.He added he has heard from aides that there is “overwhelming turnout” among young people, women and older Black adults in places like Georgia and Florida.“The things that are happening bode well for the base that has been supporting me – but we’ll see,” he said. “It’s just so uncertain” because of how many states are in play.Al Jazeera’s Chris Moody has sent this report from Safety Harbor, FloridaDesirae Braverman, a 20-year-old who was eager to vote in her first presidential election this year, showed up in person in the final hours on Election Day after her father accidentally threw away the mail-in ballot she ordered.“He doesn’t pay attention sometimes,” she said of her dad after voting in person in the town library. “I was like, I have no choice but to come down here now last minute. I wanted to do my little part, even if it doesn’t mean that much. I wanted to get out there and say, ‘My vote counts’.”To both presidential campaigns this election cycle, Braverman’s vote actually matters quite a lot: Her small bayside town, Safety Harbor, is located in Pinellas County, one of the most important swing counties in Florida, which is in one of the nation’s most critical battleground states.Pinellas voted for George W Bush in 2004, then supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, only to swing back into Republican hands and vote for Donald Trump in 2016. And this year, it is once again up for grabs in a state likely to face a close outcome. The county is narrowly split between registered Republicans and Democrats, making turnout numbers essential in a tightly contested place like this.Biden’s campaign sent the Democratic nominee’s wife, Jill Biden, to make a last-minute stop on the morning of Election Day to encourage voters.Braverman, a college student who said she cares about social issues such as preserving rights to same-sex marriage and abortion, cast her vote for Biden.”It kind of felt a little liberating because it was my first time,” she said. “It felt good. And I got my little sticker.”Coronavirus and the economy are the top issues among US voters, according to the Associated Press’ VoteCast data. And voters don’t have positive feelings about how both are being dealt with.About 4 in 10 voters named the pandemic as the top issue facing the US, while 3 in 10 said the economy and jobs were most important.About half of US voters said coronavirus is not at all under control. On the economy, 6 in 10 said the economy is in poor shape.On the issue of law enforcement, of which Donald Trump has made the former a important campaign theme, only 4 percent said that was the country’s top issue.Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland filed this report from Phoenix, ArizonaA slow but steady stream of voters arrived at the Epworth United Methodist Church in Phoenix, Arizona’s capital. Poll volunteers informed new arrivals where to go to cast their ballots, while another group handed out free meals to voters as they left.Feed the Polls is a volunteer initiative that brings together organisations and eateries to keep voters fed while they are waiting at the polls.“Today we are set to give out 2,000 meals,” said Maria Parra Cano of Sana Sana Foods, one of the groups that teamed up with Feed the Polls.“It’s been a constant flow [of voters] all morning until now,” she told Al Jazeera. “We are really just aiming to try to solve food insecurity on this day.”Justin, 19, said he cast his first-ever vote for President Donald Trump, the Republican incumbent.“The most important thing for me is obviously the economy – we need a strong economy,” said Justin, who declined to provide his surname. “And then law and order is a big thing for me.”Justin also lauded Trump’s foreign policy, citing the recent normalisation agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.“It’s a crazy world we live in right now and this election is a big election, just like any election,” Justin added.His friend Robert, a 26-year-old old business student, said the most important issue for him is taxation. On Tuesday he voted for Trump, just like in 2016.“The civil unrest and everything – I feel like there needs to be something done,” said Robert, who also declined to provide his last name.“And then I think Trump is going to be the one to stop the lockdown,” he added, referring to restrictions over the coronavirus pandemic. “I think it’s time everybody goes back to work.”Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this update from South Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaDJs Ronald Coleman, 33, and Jarkeer Lassiter, 29, danced to Come Closer by Whiz Kid ft. Drake outside a South Philadelphia polling station. They already voted for Biden with mail ballots and now their goal is to get out the vote for Biden by DJing at the polls. They are part of an effort across Philadelphia bringing DJs and free food to voters.Philadelphia voter turnout is high this election, but it is still unclear if it will be high enough to help the Democrat win Pennsylvania.Asked why he voted for Biden, Coleman said, “My mom.” He wants Biden to follow through on his promise to improve healthcare. “Medicare, all the stuff for the older people,” Coleman added. He said people in Philadelphia have been rioting for their rights after the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr, who was Lassiter’s cousin.“It just hit too close to home for me,” Coleman said. “I just hope it gets better.”Coleman and Lassiter said a lot of first-time voters were making their voices heard in Philadelphia this election. Lassiter said he voted for Biden because Trump failed to contain the pandemic and had stoked racial tension. “It’s like, if he’s in the White House, it’s OK to be [openly racist].”Electing Biden will send a message, he said. “If we get Biden in there, we have to do better.”3 Nov 2020 - 22:08 GMTAl Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from Kenosha, WisconsinThe Kenosha Unified School District is a sprawling, yet nondescript building on the city’s 52nd Street thoroughfare.On Election Day, its parking lot is brimming with cars including one with a man playing guitar and singing from the bed of a pick-up truck. The glass doors of the building’s entrance are flanked by two pairs of volunteers wearing yellow crew-neck sweatshirts that read “Election Defender”.“It’s a nonpartisan group that is organising … to make sure that voters are taken care of, especially in places where there are long lines,” explained Rena Singer. “It felt good to have something to do today,” she said of the group’s efforts to hand out snacks, personal protective equipment and anything else voters need to make it through the process.Inside, the sterile and fluorescent-lit hallways and rooms are dedicated to same-day voter registration and in-person voting.“Everybody has been in such a good mood, even the voters,” said the location’s chief inspector, Shawnna Smith. “I’m pretty proud of how well curbside voting is going – we don’t usually have that,” she said of the pandemic-inspired practice.Volunteers in yellow vests gather voters’ information, grab a ballot from inside that the voters complete from outside before the voters return them indoors to be counted. “People are taking advantage of it.

Nothing more, nothing less. And he wants us to believe that we’re all the same, that we’re unhopeful and angry and selfish and divided. But today, we are going to show him who we are.”The appearance outside “Casa Biden”, an independent volunteer office where people have spent months drumming up support for Biden in an area with large Cuban and Puerto Rican populations, was scheduled at the 11th hour to try to increase voter turnout.“This is where the highest concentration of Hispanic voters are,” said Elio Muller, who directs the volunteer operations. “Our precincts are usually 60 percent turnout Democrat.”Al Jazeera’s Jennifer Glasse reflects on casting a ballot in the US after decades abroad.Read more here.3 Nov 2020 - 19:02 GMTAl Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this update from Wilmington, North Carolina.Ricardo Thomas woke up this morning feeling energised. The 35-year-old Wilmington, North Carolina-native was anxious to get to the polls to cast his first-ever ballot.“It was like the first day of school,” he told Al Jazeera. Upon leaving the polling station, Thomas said he was “feeling good”.Thomas explained that while he did not really have an interest in voting before this election, but when COVID-19 hit him and his community especially hard, he started to learn more about the candidates.“I live below the line anyway, so [often election outcomes] would never affect us,” he told Al Jazeera. “Because we don’t know what it is to have the amount of money that the people around us that we provide our services for have,” he said.“When the COVID came, I lost my job, and it really set me back, back, back.” And that’s when he says he knew he had to vote, and “be a part of change and history”.3 Nov 2020 - 18:43 GMTAl Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this dispatch from Kenosha, WisconsinElection Day is off to the races in Wisconsin.Erin Decker, chair of the Republican Party of Kenosha County, said she expects “record-high turnout” today, while Lori Hawkins, chair of the Kenosha County Democrats, said she told her children that they are witnessing history.Inside Kenosha’s municipal building, hallways dedicated to central count efforts – to tally absentee ballots separately from the polls – are bustling with volunteers and city officials. Dressed in neon green shirts, dozens of poll workers are steadily counting the 57,650 ballots that have been returned so far at tables of two, spaced six feet apart.A handful of retired men wearing bright orange lanyards attached to white placards reading “election observer” around their necks are mingling among the first-floor crowd.Outside the building, resident Dennis Phillips said he had not voted yet, but that he would likely cast a ballot later for Trump – just as he did in 2016. “He’s been doing pretty good I guess,” Phillips said.Read all the updates from earlier in the dayhere."

Despite you, I and the political class, the vast majority of Americans are not paying attention to the election,” said Erik Nisbet, a professor of policy analysis and communications at Northwestern University.“People don’t tune in until September,” he told Al Jazeera. “At this point though, it’s important to get your narratives out. It’s important to get your base solidified and mobilised.”Most polls show a tight race between Biden and Trump as the election nears, with experts saying the contest will likely come down to how the candidates fare in critical swing states like Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.But there is also widespread frustration that the choice this election cycle is the same as in 2020, when Biden defeated Trump to win the White House.A recentPew Research Center pollfound that nearly half of all registered voters said they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot if they could.About two-thirds of respondents said they had little to no confidence that Biden is physically fit enough to be president, the poll said, while a similar number said they did not believe Trump would act ethically in office.“It is Election 2.0,” said Jan Leighley, a political science professor at American University in Washington, DC.“I think that creates a disincentive for voting, which again comes back on the campaigns to convince people that, even though it’s the same choice, there’s still a reason to vote.”For the Biden camp, the message so far has been that a vote for the Democratic incumbent is avote for democratic ideals. “Democracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot,” Biden said in January.But that message is failing to resonate among key segments of the Democratic base who are angered by the Biden administration’s unequivocal support for Israel amid its war in Gaza.The recent wave of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses has highlighted a generational divide over the US’s relationship with Israel, and that, in turn, couldpose a serious problemfor Biden as he seeks the youth vote in November.In 2020, Biden won about 60 percent support among voters aged 18 to 29.But arecent CNN pollshowed Biden trailing Trump — 51 percent to 40 percent — among voters under age 35, and experts say a lack of enthusiasm among young voters could spell trouble.“We know how college students are feeling,” said Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairperson for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party.“And I can tell you for sure that there are too many who would stay home” on November 5 if Biden does not change his Middle East policy, Pyarali added. “I doubt that people would switch over to Trump, but they would certainly not vote.”According to Nisbet at Northwestern University, Biden’s campaign needs to focus in the coming months on “getting the Democratic house in order” before it tries to appeal to the relatively small number of undecided voters in the country.Any protests at the Democratic National Convention, for example, could hurt him. Democrats will gather in Chicago in August to formally confirm Biden as their 2024 nominee.“The Democratic Party, or at least the Biden campaign, does not want any dissension within the [party] because it’s a bad visual,” said Nisbet.Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Trump’s campaign has unfolded against unprecedented legal turmoil.The former president faces four separate criminal cases, includingan ongoing trialin New York over allegations he falsified business records related to a hush-money payment made to an adult film star.While the indictments have done little so far to dent Trump’s support among Republican voters, somepolling suggeststhat a chunk of the US electorate would not vote for him if he were convicted in any of the cases.Trump is expected to be confirmed as the Republican Party’s 2024 nominee at the party’s convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.“The conventions go on over the summer, but there’s usually not a whole lot of activity campaign-wise,” said Leighley at American University.But this year might be different, given Trump’s court hearings and the pressure on Biden over the Gaza war. “Those could be unusual bumps, if you will, that provide campaigns opportunities to do more in terms of ads,” she said.Both Leighley and Nisbet saidthe US economyis always an important election issue, and it will continue to be a focus over the next few months of campaigning.Despite positive economic indicators, many Americans believe they are worse off now than when Trump was in the White House, recent polls have suggested.“There is a big gap where people, for whatever reason — it could be because of the economics, it could be a bias of memory — they look more favourably at Trump’s then-presidency than Biden’s current one overall,” said Nisbet.He added that the economy is hurting Biden among Latino and Black voters, as well as young people, all of whom are key segments of the Democratic base.“Trump will want to talk about how bad the economy is,” said Nisbet, while Biden’s team instead will “try to change the conversation” and pivot to other issues.That includes access to abortion. Biden has made defending access to reproductive healthcare a central plank of his re-election campaign, repeatedlycondemning Trumpand Republican Party lawmakers for supporting abortion restrictions.In 2022, under Trump, the US Supreme Court formed a conservative “supermajority”, allowing it tooverturn Roe v Wade, a landmark 1973 ruling that established abortion access as a constitutional right.Eliminating Roe had been a conservative priority for decades, and several Republican-led states have since enacted strict limits on abortion.According to Leighley, “there will be an emphasis on the issue of abortion and Trump’s role in that and the Republican Party and its plans” as the presidential campaigns inch closer to the fall months of September and October.That is also when the first debate between Biden and Trump could take place.The Commission on Presidential Debatesreiteratedon Wednesday that the first televised face-off between the candidates would take place on September 16, confirming dates announced late last year.The announcement came after Trump’s team had urged the commission to move the schedule forward.There has been uncertainty around the 2024 debates, particularly as Trump eschewed participating in any during the Republican primary process. But last week, both Biden and Trump said they were up for it.“I honestly don’t know if either one wants them, but it is an American tradition — and I think it really would hurt American democracy if we did not have presidential debates,” said Nesbit.“It’s a major aspect of our tradition in the United States. And having presidential debates, even if they don’t change anyone’s minds — and they rarely do — I think it’s important for Americans to hear their two candidates at least air their perspectives.”"

For two decades, President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.",Last update 6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"For two decades, Russian President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Moscow wouldbackUS Vice PresidentKamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s nominee, in presidentialelectionsin November.The nature of Putin’s comments suggests he was joking, or trolling the Harris campaign, at a time when the US government under the Joe Biden administration has levelled new allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in the November vote, to favour former President Donald Trump.Yet whatever Putin’s motivations for the comments on Harris, they are the latest iteration of the Russian leader’s attempts to inject Moscow into the US electoral process.This is not the first time Putin has thrown his support behind a US presidential candidate.Putinhimself has been in Russia’s top job since 2012. He was also president between 2000 and 2008.Al Jazeera recaps two decades of the Russian president’s tongue-in-cheek meddling in US elections.At an economic forum in the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, Putin wryly said that current President Joe Biden was his “favourite”.Since Biden has dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, she was Putin’s next best bet, the Russian leader teased.He added that Harris has an “expressive and infectious laugh”, which indicates “she’s doing well”. The audience broke into scatted laughter as he said that if Harris is doing well, maybe she would not impose sanctions on Russia.“I don’t know if I’m insulted or he did me a favour,” Republican challengerTrumpresponded at a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.Putin’s comments came a day after the US Department of Justice accused Russian-owned state broadcaster RT of campaigning to sway the US vote, indicting two Russian journalists.But this isn’t the first time that Putin has stirred the pot of US domestic politics.In October 2004, Putin endorsed Republican incumbent President George W Bush. He said that if Bush lost it would lead to the “spread of terrorism” globally.Bush had been facing criticism from Democratic challenger John Kerry for not adequately tackling “terrorism”.This was amid thewar on Iraqwhich started in 2003 after the US under Bush invaded the country.Bush defeated Kerry in the 2004 race and was re-elected as president.While Putin did not make a clear endorsement in the 2008 US presidential race, experts were clear that a win for DemocratBarack Obamaover Republican John McCain was Russia’s preferred outcome.While both Obama and McCain held a harsh stance on Russia, Kremlin officials believed that under Obama, a newcomer at the time, US-Russia relations could start with a clean slate unlike under Cold War veteran McCain.After being in office for two terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin was constitutionally barred from assuming the role of president for a third consecutive term.Hence, Dmitry Medvedev rose to the top job with Putin as his premier. However, it was widely believed in Russia and globally at the time that Putin continued to hold real power in Russia. It was said that Putin and Medvedev ruled in “tandemocracy”.Obama won the 2008 election.Ahead of the 2012 US presidential race, in which Obama was taking on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Putin told Russian state media that Obama was “an honest person who really wants to change much for the better”.Romney had deemed Russia the top “geopolitical foe” of the US, something Putin said Romney was “mistaken” about, during the same interview.Obama defeated Romney in the 2012 election.Ahead of the 2016 US election, Putin spoke highly of Trump during an annual news conference with reporters.“He is a bright and talented person without any doubt,” he said, adding that Trump is “outstanding and talented”.Trump was up against Democratic challengerHilary Clintonin the election.After Trump’s election victory, Putin said Trump was a “clever man” who would “quickly understand” his role in office.In July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC)emails were hackedand leaked, showing preferential treatment to Clinton, angering supporters of her primary Democatic opponent Bernie Sanders.The US government formally placed the blame for the hack on Russia in a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Putin denied Russia’s role in the DNC hack but said the leaks themselves were important. “The important thing is the content that was given to the public,” he said.The US also accused Russia of a larger election interference programme aimed at defeating Clinton and helping Trump come to power, involving troll farms that amplified messaging tailored against the Democrats.In October 2019, on a panel at Russian Energy Week, Putin was asked if he would interfere with the2020 US election.“I’ll tell you a secret: Yes, we’ll definitely do it. Just don’t tell anyone,” the Russian president joked in a fake whisper.He then said hisworking relationshipwith Trump did not mean that he had any influence on the domestic politics in the US. He insisted that he did not interfere in the 2016 US election and that he was dealing with issues in his own country.“We have our own problems,” he said."

I almost threw a shoe at the television in my hotel room. I also pondered throwing a lamp and hairbrush for good measure.I’m not usually prone to uncontrollable outbursts of anger, but this time, it was almost justified. Why? Not even a few hours had passed since the election was called for US President Barack Obama, and the television commentators and pundits couldn’t stop talking about who might run for president in 2016. I’m not joking.  Apparently, it’s a burning issue, who will try to be president in four years.This country and many in its media have become almost obsessed with covering campaigns. It’s become like a sporting event for politically inclined people. It’s easy to follow and often exciting, but for now it is over. Let me stress that. President Barack Obama has secured another four-year term, and it seems we should be talking about what he does with that time.I was lucky enough to be in the hall at McCormick Place as the results trickled in. I waited on my media riser (my perch from which I talk into the camera), as thousands of Obama supporters waited for Governor Mitt Romney to publicly acknowledge his defeat, and for the president to address the crowd, the country and the world.After what seemed like a longer than usual wait, the concession happened. The president took the stage and laid out a few items on his agenda tax reform, the national debt and immigration. That was about as detailed as he got, but then again, you wouldn’t expect Obama to give a detailed policy speech at an election night party. I can’t help but wonder what he is going to try to do in his second term.And it is during those second terms that presidents often focus more on their long-term legacies. That probably explains why they usually wait so long to try and tackle the tough foreign policy issues – such as the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. So what does the president want the historians to write of his legacy?From his first term, it’s pretty obvious that he likes the big accomplishments. The healthcare reform law was – to use the vice president’s phrase, “a big … deal” (yes, I left a word out because of our younger readers). So, will Obama go big in his second term and stake more political capital in the process?It seems that his most pressing issue is bringing the country’s annual deficits and the broader national debt under control. The smart folks who understand the complexity of macroeconomics say he has to focus on that. The question is: “How he can come up with a trillion dollars a year?” A trillion, actually a little bit more than that. That is the difference between what the government takes in and what it spends. That is the amount of red ink the country has created during each of the president’s first four years. He took office in 2008 promising to cut the deficit in half, and he has fallen far short.I don’t care what anyone in the media says about it, now that the campaign season is over. It seems to me the politicians are going to have to do the things they hate the most, take away services or raise taxes, probably both.That will make the president very unpopular now, but history may look kindly on a leader who actually puts the country on a sustainable fiscal path. The question is what matters more to the president. We can’t answer that yet, the election, after all, just happened.It did happen. I was there. It’s over, now it is time for the country and its media to focus on where he tries to take everyone next.Follow Patty Culhane on Twitter:@PattyCulhane"

In the US, presidential elections are decided by a state-based vote allocation system. Here's what you need to know.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"In the US, presidential elections are decided by a state-based vote allocation system. Here’s what you need to know.It’s at the heart of how presidential elections in the United States are decided. But for many,the Electoral Collegeis a mystery, wrapped in a riddle, shrouded in an enigma.It doesn’t have to be confusing, though.To understand the Electoral College system, you first have to know that US presidents are not elected by the national popular vote: the total number of votes each candidate receives.Instead, a group of 538 so-called “electors” select the president. These electors make up the Electoral College.So who are these electors?Before the election, the political parties in each state choose aslate of electors: real people who ultimately cast a vote for the president. Very often, the electors are party officials or supporters.Each state gets the same number of electors as it has representatives in the US House of Representatives and the US Senate.For example, Michigan gets 15 Electoral College votes. That corresponds to the two senators and 13 House members that represent the state in Congress.Now that we know who these electors are and how many represent each state, how are their votes allocated? Here’s where it gets fun.In nearly all the states across the US, the presidential candidate who gets the most votes wins all that state’s electors: It’s a winner-takes-all system. Even if a candidate wins a state narrowly, they still get all the electors.The outliers are Maine and Nebraska, which allocate their electors based on a more complicated system that reflects the popular vote on the state and congressional district levels.The District of Columbia — which is not a state but encompasses the country’s capital — also gets three Electoral College votes.But here is the most important part: To win the White House, a presidential candidate must win the support of a majority of the electors.So out of a total of 538 Electoral College votes, they needat least 270to win.The electors ultimately cast their votes in December, about a month after the election.Their votes are then certified by Congress in early January, when the president is confirmed and takes office.So what does this all mean?Effectively, to win the US presidency, a candidate has to win support in enough key states to reach that magic Electoral College number of 270.Under this system, a candidate who wins the popular vote — the most votes in total across the US — may not actually win the White House.Onerecent examplecame in 2016, when Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump. His victory was buoyed by wins in states like Florida and Pennsylvania, each of which offered at least 20 Electoral College votes.The Electoral College system was designed, in effect, to ensure the political power of the states.Some Americans say the Electoral College should be scrapped in favour of the popular vote. Others argue the system ensures highly populated states do not overshadow smaller ones, thereby encouraging minority representation in US democracy."

So what are the facts behind the claim?Trump invoked the “60-day rule” while responding to anupdated indictmentfiled last month in the federal election case in Washington, DC.“It is DOJ policy that the Department of Justice should not take any action that will influence an election within 60 days of that election – but they just have taken such action,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Others have since echoed that criticism. Last week, Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, questioned federal prosecutors in the Florida case about whether holding a trial before the election would violate the rule.Legal experts, however, have rejected that position. And Jay Bratt, a federal prosecutor in the Florida case, told Cannon that, since Trump had already been charged, no rule or norm would be violated.Trump was referring to an unwritten — and admittedly vague — guideline that Justice Department officials have adopted over the years.A 2018 report from the Justice Department’s inspector general clearly states: “No Department policy contains a specific prohibition on overt investigative steps within a particular period before an election.”Still, it noted that many officials have adhered to “a longstanding unwritten practice to avoid overt law enforcement and prosecutorial activities close to an election, typically within 60 or 90 days of Election Day”.The report probed the decision by former FBI director James Comey to reopen an investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails just 11 days before the 2016 election.Comey later said avoiding actions that could impact the election was a “very important norm”.No. Because the guideline is unwritten, it is a best practice rather than a legal requirement. When and how the guideline applies is up to department officials.Legal scholars have further argued that Trump cannot claim he was being treated unfairly because the guideline only applies to major actions, like the filing of brand-new indictments.Because Trump had been indicted long before the 60-day window, the guideline would theoretically not apply to the ongoing federal proceedings in Washington, DC, and Florida.The guideline is also not valid for Trump’supcoming sentencingin New York or the pending trial in Georgia: Both of which are state-level proceedings, whereas the guideline is strictly federal.Finally, Trump may need to check his math. Even if he were correct about the rule, Special Counsel Jack Smith filed the updated indictment on August 27. That is 70 days out from the November 5 vote."

It took another 16 days to determine that Biden was the winner in the state of Georgia.All states allow votes to be cast in some form either in thelead-up to election dayor on election day itself.In some states, mail-in ballots can be verified ahead of time and then rapidly tabulated on election day, often through automated systems.But others prohibit any processing until election day itself, which can lead to a time-consuming backlog.States then have varying periods of time to self-audit the results. A recount can also be requested in most states depending on the vote margin, while others give voters time to correct a mistake – or “cure” a ballot.Ultimately, state executives must issue so-called Certificates of Ascertainment showing the official, final vote tally by a specific date. This year, the deadline is December 11.The president-elect’s victory then is officially certified by Congress in January.Tight races in key battleground states in 2020 – as well as an increase in mail-in voting amid the COVID pandemic – saw particularly slow vote counts.That helped fuel unfounded claims of election malfeasance pushed by Trump and his allies.Those false claims were furthered aided by the fact that Democrats typically vote more by mail-in ballots than Republicans.As a result, in states where there are delays in counting those mail-in ballots, people can get the impression that there has been a late surge in Democratic votes – also known as a “blue shift”.To counter misinformation, election experts have called on states to shore up their vote-counting processes.While some key battleground states have done so, others – such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia – have done little to assure a speedier process this year.Georgia’s election board has even moved to require hand counts of votes on election day, which experts warn could cause even more significant delays."

And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote.pic.twitter.com/RMIRvlSOYw— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden)July 21, 2024His initial statement did not include an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with anexpression of support.Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run at the top of a major party ticket in the country’s history.Biden’s historic move – the first sitting president to give up his party’s nomination for re-electionsince President Lyndon Johnsonin March 1968 – leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.The Democratic backlash against Biden came after he delivered anunsteady performanceat the first presidential debate of the 2024 election season as he lost his train of thought and struggled to articulate basic talking points.Biden’s failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump’s performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden’s fitness for another term.Days later, he raised fresh concerns in an interview, shrugging off Democrats’ worries and a widening gap in opinion polls, and saying he would be fine losing to Trump if he knew he would “gave it my all”.His gaffes at a NATO summit – invoking Russian President Vladimir Putin’s name when he meant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and calling Harris “Vice President Trump” – further stoked anxieties.Only four days before Sunday’s announcement, Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 for a third time, forcing him to cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas. More than one in 10 congressional Democrats had called publicly for him to quit the race.The 46th US president’s departure from the race leaves the Democratic Party in an unprecedented situation, with only a month until the Democratic National Convention and less than four months until the November 5 election.It was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party’s nomination – she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials – or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, said Biden had been under a lot of pressure recently.“It is very difficult to say what made him make the decision now,” he said.“What we do know is that he has been repeatedly insistent that he would not step down … So it comes as a bit of a surprise and a bit of a shock that Biden is saying he will step down after weeks of saying he won’t.”"

Experts warn that deepfakes — audio, video or images created using AI tools, with the intent to mislead — pose a high risk to US voters ahead of ...",19 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"At least 20 states have passed regulations against election deepfakes, but federal action remains stalled.On January 21, Patricia Gingrich was about to sit down for dinner when her landline phone rang. The New Hampshire voter picked up and heard a voice telling her not to vote in the upcoming presidential primary.“As I listened to it, I thought, gosh, that sounds like Joe Biden,” Gingrich told Al Jazeera. “But the fact that he was saying to save your vote, don’t use it in this next election — I knew Joe Biden would never say that.”The voice may have sounded like the United States president, but it wasn’t him: It was adeepfake, generated by artificial intelligence (AI).Experts warn that deepfakes — audio, video or images created using AI tools, with the intent to mislead — posea high riskto US voters ahead of the November general election, not only by injecting false content into the race but by eroding public trust.Gingrich said she didn’t fall for the Biden deepfake, but she fears it may have suppressed voter turnout. The message reached nearly 5,000 New Hampshire voters just days beforethe state’s primary.“This could be bad for people that aren’t so informed about what’s going on with the Democrats,” said Gingrich, who is the chair of the Barrington Democratic Committee in Burlington, New Hampshire.“If they really thought they shouldn’t vote for something and Joe Biden was telling them not to, then maybe they wouldn’t attend that vote.”The Biden call wasn’t the only deepfake so far this election cycle. Beforecalling offhis presidential bid, Florida GovernorRon DeSantis’s campaign shared a video that contained AI-generated images of Donald Trump hugging immunologistAnthony Fauci— two figures whoclashedpublicly during the COVID-19 pandemic.And in September, a different robocall went out to 300 voters expected to participate inSouth Carolina’s Republican primary. This time, recipients heard an AI-generated voice that imitated SenatorLindsey Graham, asking whom they were voting for.The practice of altering or faking content — especially for political gain — has existed since the dawn of US politics. Even the country’s first president, George Washington, had to contend with a series of “spurious letters” that appeared to show him questioning the cause of US independence.But AI tools are now advanced enough to convincingly mimic people quickly and cheaply, heightening the risk of disinformation.Astudypublished earlier this year by researchers at George Washington University predicted that, by mid-2024, daily “AI attacks” would escalate, posing a threat to the November general election.The study’s lead author Neil Johnson told Al Jazeera that the highest risk doesn’t come from the recent, obviously fake robocalls — which contained eyebrow-raising messages — but rather from more convincing deepfakes.“It’s going to be nuanced images, changed images, not entirely fake information because fake information attracts the attention of disinformation checkers,” Johnson said.The study found that online communities are linked in a way that allows bad actors to send large quantities of manipulated media directly into the mainstream.Communities inswing statescould be especially vulnerable, as couldparenting groupson platforms like Facebook.“The role of parenting communities is going to be big one,” Johnson said, pointing to the rapid spread of vaccine misinformation during the pandemic as an example.“I do think that we’re going to be suddenly faced with a wave of [disinformation] — lots of things that are not fake, they’re not untrue, but they stretch the truth.”Voters themselves, however, are not the only targets of deepfakes. Larry Norden, senior director of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, has been working withelection officialsto help them spot fake content.For instance, Norden said bad actors could use AI tools to instruct election workers to close a polling location prematurely, by manipulating the sound of their boss’s voice or by sending a message seemingly through a supervisor’s account.He is teaching poll workers to protect themselves by verifying the messages they receive.Norden emphasised that bad actors can create misleading content without AI. “The thing about AI is that it just makes it easier to do at scale,” he said.Just last year, Norden illustrated the capabilities of AI by creating a deepfake videoof himselffor a presentation on the risks the technology poses.“It didn’t take long at all,” Norden said, explaining that all he had to do was feed his previous TV interviews into an app.His avatar wasn’t perfect — his face was a little blurry, his voice a little choppy — but Norden noted the AI tools are rapidly improving. “Since we recorded that, the technology has gotten more sophisticated, and I think it’s more and more difficult to tell.”The technology alone is not the problem. As deepfakes become more common, the public will become more aware of them and more sceptical of the content they consume.That could erode public trust, with voters more likely to reject true information. Political figures could also abuse that scepticism for their own ends.Legal scholars have termed this phenomenon the “liar’s dividend”: Concern about deepfakes could make it easier for the subjects of legitimate audio or video footage to claim the recordings are fake.Norden pointed to theAccess Hollywood audiothat emerged before the 2016 election as an example. In the clip, then-candidate Trump is heard talking about his interactions with women: “You can do anything. Grab ‘em by the pussy.”The tape — which was very real — was considered damaging to Trump’s prospects among female voters. But if similar audio leaked today, Norden said a candidate could easily call it fake. “It would be easier for the public to dismiss that kind of thing than it would have been a few years ago.”Norden added, “One of the problems that we have right now in the US is that there’s a lack of trust, and this may only make things worse.”While deepfakes are a growing concern in US elections, relatively few federal laws restrict their use. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has yet to restrict deepfakes in elections, and bills in Congress remain stalled.Individual states are scrambling to fill the void. According to alegislation trackerpublished by the consumer advocacy organisation Public Citizen, 20 state laws have been enacted so far to regulate deepfakes in elections.Several more bills — in Hawaii, Louisiana and New Hampshire — have passed and are awaiting a governor’s signature.Norden said he was not surprised to see individual states act before Congress. “States are supposed to be the laboratories of democracy, so it’s proving true again: The states are acting first. We all know it’s really hard to get anything passed in Congress,” he said.Voters and political organisations are taking action, too. After Gingrich received the fake Biden call in New Hampshire, she joined a lawsuit — led by the League of Women Voters — seeking accountability for the alleged deception.The source of the call turned out to be Steve Kramer, a political consultant who claimed his intention was to draw attention to the need to regulate AI in politics. Kramer also admitted to being behind the robocall in South Carolina, mimicking Senator Graham.Kramer came forward after NBC News revealed he had commissioned a magician to use publicly available software to generate the deepfake of Biden’s voice.According to the lawsuit, the deepfake took less than 20 minutes to create and cost only $1.Kramer, however, told CBS News that he received “$5m worth of exposure” for his efforts, which he hoped would allow AI regulations to “play themselves out or at least begin to pay themselves out”.“My intention was to make a difference,” he said.But Kramer’s case shows existing laws can be used to curtail deepfakes.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), for instance, ruled (PDF) earlier this year that voice-mimicking software falls under the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act — and is therefore illegal in most circumstances.The commission ultimatelyproposeda $6m penalty against Kramer for the illegal robocall.The New Hampshire Department of Justice alsochargedKramer with felony voter suppression and impersonating a candidate, which could result in up to seven years in prison. Kramer has pleaded not guilty. He did not respond to a request for comment from Al Jazeera.Norden said it is significant that none of the laws Kramer is accused of breaking are specifically tailored to deepfakes. “The criminal charges against him have nothing to do with AI,” he said. “Those laws exist independently of the technology that is used.”However, those laws are not as easy to apply to bad actors who are not identifiable or who are located outside of the US.“We know from the intelligence agencies that they’re already seeing China and Russia experimenting with these tools. And they expect them to be used,” Norden said. “In that sense, you’re not going to legislate your way out of this problem.”Both Norden and Johnson believe the lack of regulation makes it more important for voters to inform themselves about deepfakes — and learn how to find accurate information.As for Gingrich, she said she knows that manipulative deepfakes will only grow more ubiquitous. She too feels voters need to inform themselves about the risk.Her message to voters? “I would tell people to make sure that they know they can vote.”"

As he campaigned for his progressive allies, Congress members Andy Levin and Rashida Tlaib, the senator raged against the influence of money in politics.",Last update 30 Jul 2022,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Left-wing US senator implicitly hits out at the pro-Israel group AIPAC at a rally for Rashida Tlaib and Andy Levin.Pontiac, Michigan, US –More than two years after ending hissecond campaignfor the Democratic nomination for president, Bernie Sanders can still get large crowds to cheer widely and mobilise for his message against income and wealth inequality.In Pontiac, Michigan – a town north of Detroit – on Friday, Sanders had a new angle to discuss beyond his usual anger about the cost of healthcare and the growing gap between the poor and the ultra-rich.As he campaigned for his progressive allies, Congress members Andy Levin and Rashida Tlaib, the senator raged against the influence of money in politics, implicitly hitting out against the American Israel Public Affairs Committee(AIPAC), a lobbying group which has been spending millions of dollars to defeat progressives.“This election is particularly important. It’s important because Andy, based on his work, deserves to be reelected; Rashida deserves to be reelected,” Sanders said. “But it’s equally important in saying that the people of Michigan have got to tell these billionaires in their corporate PACs [political action committees], they cannot buy our democracy.”The rally in Pontiac, where Levin is running, came days before the Michigan Democratic primary on August 2, where pro-Israel groups – spearheaded by AIPAC – have been spending millions on campaign ads to get their favoured candidates elected.Levin, a former labour organiser who hails from a renowned Jewish-American political family, has been aprimary targetof AIPAC this cycle.“One group has spent $4.2m to try to defeat me because I stand for a simple proposition: The only way to have a secure peaceful homeland for the Jewish people – for my people – is to fully achieve the political and human rights of the Palestinian people. I Will. Not. Back. Down,” Levin told the crowd, stopping between the words to emphasise that he is undeterred by AIPAC’s attacks.The pro-Israel lobby has made it a quest to defeat left-wing candidates in Democratic primaries this year through its super PAC, United Democracy Project — which uses donor funds to run ads against or in support of candidates without coordinating with their campaigns.And so far, ithas succeededin several contests across the country.AIPAC has not intervened directly against Tlaib, but another newly formed pro-Israel group has pledged to spend $1m to help defeat the Palestinian-American congresswoman. Still, with the advantage of incumbency, Tlaib is a favourite in the race that includes several opponents.Levin, however, is at serious risk of losing his seat; he is running against fellow sitting Congress member Haley Stevens, a staunch Israel advocate. Parts of the two lawmakers’ old districts were merged after redistricting following the2020 Census, and they are running against each other in a newly drawn constituency.AIPAC and Stevens’ campaign have not returned Al Jazeera’s request for comment this week.On Friday, Tlaib said negative ads run by “out-of-town millionaires and billionaires” make her want to “work harder” and double down on her progressive advocacy.“We are not going to let anyone come into our communities and tell us how to vote and try to pit us against each other,” Tlaib said.For his part, Sanders stressedthat AIPACspending against left-wing candidates is about sinking the priorities of progressives on behalf of its billionaire mega-donors.“It has nothing to do – in my view –with Israel,” Sanders said. “It is simply trying to defeat candidates and members of Congress who stand for working families and are prepared to demand that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes.”Sanders called Levin’s campaign “historic”.“The billionaire class is saying, ‘We own this country; we own the political system, and we will not tolerate dissent. Either you work for us, or get out of here.’ And Andy has chosen not to work for them,” he added.In an audience of a few hundred attendees, dozens came with shirts and signs featuring Sanders’s image and slogans on Friday.Lorenzo Sollena, a 29-year-old substitute teacher, said the senator from Vermont and a few of his progressive allies are the only ones challenging the political status quo in the United States.“Bernie is the last person fighting … The country has come to a standstill. People say they care about universal healthcare, and they care aboutabortion rights, but nobody’s fighting back,” said Sollena, who was wearing a t-shirt featuring photos of Sanders throughout the decades with the caption: “We will never stop fighting for what is right.”"

Harris may be the lesser of two evils when it comes to Donald Trump, but the lesser of two evils is still evil. If she wants to win in November, ...",19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"My red line is genocide, and no ‘good vibes’ campaigning will move it.I registered to vote in 1998, and I have voted Democrat ever since. I have not always felt good about the candidates on the Democratic ticket. In fact, I have usually felt angry, disillusioned, disappointed and dirty after casting my vote. Still, it felt like part of the job of being a citizen of a pseudo-democracy. It was not the only work to be done, but it was something.This November, however, I plan not to vote for the Democrats in the election. If the party’s presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, does not change her policy on Israel, I will not be casting a ballot for her.And I will not be the only one. More than 700,000 Americans have cast an “uncommitted” vote in the Democratic primaries, demonstrating their rejection of the Democratic Party’s “ironclad” support for Israel.If Harris wants the progressive vote, she has to support an arms embargo on Israel and stop funding the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. This is a red line for many of us who have not bought into her liberal cult of personality.When President Joe Biden finally dropped out as the 2024 Democratic nominee on July 21, I was not one of the many people celebrating his endorsement of the vice president. Harris was on the wrong side of history as San Francisco’s district attorney when she opposed criminal justice reform, and she has been on the wrong side of history in regards to Israel, which she is a staunch supporter of.Still, a small part of me hoped she would be savvy enough to understand the power of the “uncommitted” movement – which is conditioning voting on support for an embargo on Israel and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza – and the level of outrage felt by those opposed to the ongoing genocide, funded these past 10 months by US aid. I was wrong.Ata rally in Detroit on August 7, Harris was met by a group of anti-genocide, pro-Palestine protesters chanting, “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide! We won’t vote for genocide!” In a democracy, this is a perfectly reasonable and acceptable (if not necessary) action. Politicians serve the people, and the people have the right (and the responsibility) to make demands on their political leaders, especially when the latter are asking for their votes and campaign donations.Yet Harris decided to respond: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”What purpose does this attitude serve? The protesters were merely expressing their demand that Harris pledge to stop arming Israel amid its genocidal war on Gaza. A war that has brought the official death toll in Gaza to more than 40,000; some estimates project that number to reach186,000or even higher. A war that has put one million children at risk of famine, according to the international nonprofit organisation Save the Children. A war that has decimated Gaza’s health sector, bringing back polio infections for the first time in 25 years.Many of us spend our days scrolling through the most horrific images imaginable – toddlers beheaded by Israeli air strikes,people burned alive in their tents, emaciated children who die of starvation, political prisoners brutally raped by Israeli soldiers. The atrocities go on and on. My days and nights are haunted by these images, and none of this would be possible without US aid, without our tax dollars.But Harris doesn’t want to engage these very reasonable demands – to stop funding this slaughter, this genocide, this horrific violence. Instead, she wants to be celebrated for being charismatic, for her affect, for her vibes.This politics-as-vibes is not new. It is nothing more than celebrity culture bleeding into politics. Another word for it is fascism.I am reminded of Erik Larson’s 2011 book In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler’s Berlin, which tells the story of William Dodd, the US ambassador to Germany from 1933 to 1937 and his family. Over the years since the book was published, I have thought occasionally of Dodd and often of his daughter, Martha, who accompanied him to Berlin.The ambassador was chairman of the history department at the University of Chicago at the time of his appointment, and he just wanted to be left alone to finish his book about the antebellum American South. He was somewhat concerned but not too alarmed about what was happening in Germany, telling President Franklin Roosevelt, “Give men a chance to try their schemes” as the Nazi Party prepared to deny Jews citizenship.Martha, on the other hand, was swept up by the “glamour” of the Nazi Party and its social scene, dating and sleeping with Nazi officers.So many liberals I know are a form of William or Martha Dodd. Like William, they are either too consumed with their own comfort to care too much about the daily atrocities experienced and endured by Palestinians, or, like Martha, they approach politics through the frame of celebrity culture and good feelings, happy to fangirl Harris, whose charisma and Beyonce-scored inspire-ads overwhelm the pesky reality of genocide.This is, after all, about feeling good. “Don’t spoil our fun!” they scream at me (and so many others) on social media. This anti-outrage is deafening. But you cannot just live off vibes.In a memoir written a few years after she left Nazi Germany, Martha admitted to just not really liking Jews all that much. This casual anti-Semitism foreshadows today’s liberal attitudes towards Palestinians, a disregard rooted in Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism, which is driving a genocide.This is a make-or-break moment – we must pressure the Democrats to change their position on Gaza before the elections in November. While we should all be doing absolutely everything we can to stop the genocide, the bare minimum right now is demanding that a presidential hopeful, in need of our votes, commits to ending US funds to Israel. It is not that complicated.Harris may be the lesser of two evils when it comes to Donald Trump, but the lesser of two evils is still evil. If she wants to win in November, she needs to give us more than vibes and celebrity culture – she needs to make a real commitment to ending the genocide in Gaza, first and foremost by not funding it. Anything less than this will lose her the progressive vote and, quite possibly, the presidency. If this happens, the liberals across the country will likely blame a nebulous “leftist-progressive” block, but in the end, this loss will be on Harris herself.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

When will we know who will be called as America's next president? The earliest we could know whether a presidential candidate is projected to ...",3 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Millions of Americans are voting, but when exactly will we know whether Trump or Biden won the election?Polls begin closing in the United States at 18:00 Eastern Standard Time (23:00 GMT) and poll closing times vary by state. Results in each state will not begin coming in until polls close in each particular state.Projections of winners will not be made until all of the polls close in a state. The first projections of states that Donald Trump and Joe Biden have won will not begin until 19:00 EST (00:00 GMT), when all of the polls have closed in nine states.The earliest we could know whether a presidential candidate is projected to have won 270 electoral votes, the number of electoral votes needed for victory, is likely to be 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT). That is when polls close in California, which has the most electoral votes of any state – 55 – and that could put a candidate over the 270 threshold.However, 23:00 EST is considered early, at least in recent history. Of the past five presidential elections, only 2008 was called at that time, when California’s projected win for Barack Obama put him past the 270 electoral vote threshold. In 2012 and 2016, the winners were projected in the overnight EST hours.Twice in the past five elections, projections of winners were not even made on election night. In 2004, George W Bush was not called the winner until midday the day after the election.And in 2000, the media outlets making projections erroneously called Florida for Al Gore before rescinding that projection. The close nature of the results of that race led to neither Gore nor George W Bush having enough electoral votes without Florida’s results, leading to weeks of recounts and legal battles. Florida was not called until December 12, when the US Supreme Court ordered the state’s recount halted. Bush had a 537-vote lead at that point and was declared the winner, delivering him the state’s electoral votes and an Electoral College victory.It is worth noting that the process of “calling” winners and losers in each state is not necessarily based on exact vote tallies but is based on projections made by analysts who look at polling and how vote counts are shaping up in key precincts or counties.If it is a state where one candidate is expected to win from the get-go – and potentially 30 states fall into that category this year – then those states can be projected as soon as polls close or shortly thereafter.If it is a closely-contested state or it is not obvious who the winner is at a state’s poll closing time, then projections of winners will be delayed as analysts watch the vote tallies come in. The closer the count – or any vote-counting problems – can slow down the timing of a projection.The US media. US media outlets have a long history of trying to speed up the process of informing Americans of the winners and losers of presidential races, and it has not always run smoothly.In addition to the 2000 election projection problem, there were some other infamous incorrect projections. In 1916, the New York Times prematurely and erroneously declared Charles Evans Hughes the winner over Woodrow Wilson. In 1948, election analysts at the Chicago Daily Tribune famously – and incorrectly – concluded that Thomas Dewey defeated Harry Truman.The system that is used for election projections today has its roots in the early 1960s, when the major US wire services and television networks pooled their resources to place thousands of people all over the country to gather precinct returns, which were fed into computers to help make calls. In 1990, the Associated Press and US broadcasters created a new system that combined exit polling with vote results, which is generally the method still in use today.Currently, the Associated Press and Fox News share one set of exit polls and come up with their own separate projections. ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC are the remaining members of the system that was formed in 1990, and they use that data to reach their own projections.No. Counting every single vote will take several days and, in some cases, several weeks. States have different methods and procedures for counting in-person and mail-in ballots and when their counts are completed, each state will certify its results. If all goes as planned, each state’s certified results will be formally presented when the state meets to certify its electors, prior to the Electoral College meeting on December 14.The vote count has never been certified on election night and 2020 is no different. What potentially complicates things this year is that most states will be counting more mail-in ballots than ever, and their procedures have not been tested at this scale. It is expected there will be vote-counting issues in some states. Three states  – all tightly contested –  Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are not allowed to begin counting mail-in votes until November 3, which could prolong an announcement.If neither candidate has been projected as the Electoral College winner and projections for some states are on hold because there is a wait for a vote count, that could create long delays in knowing who the winner will be.And that scenario has some worried about potential political mischief and protracted legal battles, prolonging the declaration of a final outcome."

Many,including me, have said this before.White supremacy – the implicit acceptance of the superiority of white people and culture – is slowly being pushed aside as people (themselves slowly) accept the reality that “white culture” is nothing more than one stop on the global tour of humanity.The fact that, in the US, white is the default definition of “normal” is a historical accident, and that pillar of history is falling. That makes this a very dangerous time.The death of white supremacy is dangerous because of the depths of fear into which some white people have fallen.This is unfortunate because white supremacy’s demise in no way implies a dying white race. It does not even imply the actual death of white supremacy itself.That venomous serpent, as we’ve seen in the 1800s and the 1960s, suffers only a metaphorical death, shedding its skin and returning in a different guise.What a dying white supremacy does mean is a death of the acceptance that white lives are any more valuable than others.That higher value of white life is all that some people have to hold onto, and the loss of that value is so difficult for them to accept that it amounts to an attack.We are on the cusp of a historic decision in the US. We can make history and transition from the first black to the first female president. The alternative is to make history by electing our first fascist demagogue.byThus we see the rise of radical white supremacists like David Duke,currently seekinga Senate seat in Louisiana on the platform that there is “massive racist and racial discrimination against European-Americans”, which is what radical white supremacists call it when you suggest that Black Lives Matter as much as theirs do.White supremacists are so afraid of being treated the same as everyone else that they feel like they are backed into a corner, accompanied by only their fear and their guns.And they have a lot of guns.This is, of course, a fact that their ideological leader Donald Trump knows quite well. This is why he has called on them to follow him, why he has chosen to legitimise their use of violence.He knows the history of white America; he knows that violence is a valid option for white radicals.This is not a joke.We are long past the time when laughing at Donald Trump was acceptable. In fact, it was never acceptable.David Cornnoted thisin Mother Jones immediatelyfollowing the Huffington Post decision to report him as entertainment.Still we laughed. Even after Arianna Huffingtonlater stated“we are no longer entertained”, laughter and disbelief – or worse, resolved acceptance – were our response to his rise.While we follow news outlets, read bloggers, and laugh with comedians like John Oliver, we find Trump’s increasing power distasteful, sure, but still an entirely consumable media diet.Our demand has only justified the supply. Our laughter and consumption have fuelled his fire, and now people will really start getting burned.OPINION: How Donald Trump could win – and whyThis last call by Trump to theunhinged radical wingof his followers, openly legitimising violence against hispolitical opponents, is a warning sign we never should have needed.But having come this far, one thing should now be crystal clear: If we are still laughing, or silent, or anything other than actively engaged in the disruption of this man’s rise to power, then we are doing little more that fuelling the fires of fascism.And if you are in the media, whether a professional or an amateur, whether a journalist, blogger or comedian – whatever your role – you have a grave and serious responsibility to help quench this fire.We are on the cusp of a historic decision in the US. We can make history and transition from the first black to the first female president – a noble and glorious step even accepting the great struggle still required for our equality. The alternative is to make history by electing our first fascist demagogue.The US was founded on the principle of equality, liberty and justice for all. Yes, we have a great deal of work ahead of us to make that a reality.OPINION: Immigrants and Donald Trump – It’s a complicated storyBut if you believe in America, if you love this country, then that founding ideal is what you should be fighting for.Because if you love this country, “for all” means for all. It is not limited by religion, or skin colour, or gender, or physical ability.Either “for all” means for all, or it doesn’t, and “it doesn’t” means “patriarchal white supremacy”. There is no middle ground on this.That is why Black Lives Matter is a patriotic movement. That is why the fight for indigenous rights is a patriotic movement.That is why the fight for the rights of Latino and Chicano people is a patriotic movement. Because America means “for all”, or it means absolutely nothing.And that is why Trump is not someone to laugh about, but someone to fight. Because if we do not stand up for what America means, if we do not stand up “for all”, then what we have to fear is Trump and his army of white radicals rising up and making us all kneel.John Metta has worked as a cook, groundskeeper, store clerk, park ranger, Navy submariner, Army wartime medic, hydrologist, school teacher, software developer, mathematical modeller, and underwater archaeologist.

There are 435 seats in total and each seat is up for election every two years.This year’s legislative elections are even more important than usual because they are the last before a new round of redistricting based on the results of the 2020 Census. Each state’s allocated number of House members is determined by its population, so if a state loses or gains residents in the new Census, they stand to lose or gain seats in the House.There also 35 Senate seats up for grabs this year, roughly one-third of the 100-seat body. Around a dozen of those 35 are competitive seats and each is extremely important as Republican control of the chamber is at stake. Currently, the Republicans have a 53-47 advantage. If the Democrats can gain four seats, they will guarantee a takeover of the Senate majority.The most important non-federal elections this year will choose governors who run the executive branches of each individual state government.Voters in 11 states and two territories, Puerto Rico and American Samoa, will elect governors this Election Day.In the US, the president and vice president are not directly elected by voters, as laid out in the US Constitution. When voters make their presidential choice on their ballot, they are really voting for a slate of “electors”, who, after the votes are counted and certified, are pledged to vote for a presidential and vice-presidential candidate.These electors actually cast the deciding votes for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates during a meeting of the Electoral College.In 48 states, these electors “pledge” to vote for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates that receive the most votes in their respective state.Two states – Maine and Nebraska – have slightly different systems: Two electors “pledge” to vote for the candidate that wins the state’s overall popular vote, while the remaining electors are allocated to the winner in each congressional district.While the presidential election is on November 3, the Electoral College will vote on December 14.The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of its House representatives plus two, the number of US Senators in each state. There are a total of 538 electors: 535 from the 50 states and three from the District of Columbia, which is the federal capital and not a state, per the constitution.Prior to 1961, when a constitutional amendment allotted Washington, DC, three electoral votes, residents of the district did not have a say in presidential elections.Because certain states regularly vote Democratic or Republican, those states are given much less attention by presidential candidates than the states where polling is very close.Those so-called “battleground” states, also known as “swing states” or “toss-up” states, of which there are about a dozen every four years, hold disproportionate sway in US presidential elections.Election analysts consider states battlegrounds where the margin of victory is expected to be fewer than five percentage points.By November 2, more than 94 million Americans had already cast their ballots either by in-person early voting or by mail – a process expanded in many areas amid the COVID-19 pandemic.That number represents more than 68 percent of the total number of votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. Nearly 60 percent of voting-eligible Americans have participated in recent presidential elections, though some are predicting the number will rise this year.Early voting numbers in both Hawaii and Texas are higher than their total overall voter turnout in 2016.Here is what the electoral map looks like at the moment:Voter turnout for US presidential elections has hovered around 60 percent of the voting-eligible population in recent elections. In 2016, 60.1 percent of eligible voters turned out, which was up from 58.6 percent in 2012, but down from 61.6 percent in 2008.A shift in recent voting patterns due to states allowing more opportunities for voters to cast early ballots has been accelerated this year because of the pandemic."

It meant a lot to the president. He was with our heroes for about an hour, just having casual conversation, taking their questions, just talking to them and then he ended the visit by paying his respects to the special forces memorial,” Kayleigh McEnany told reporters travelling with the president on Air Force One.About 100 Army special forces troops including Delta Force and Rangers had participated in the raid. Two soldiers and a military dog were injured when al-Baghdadi, cornered in a tunnel, detonated a suicide vest.30 Oct 2020 - 00:18 GMTFormer Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris spoke with workers about the economic inequality they face.“We’re living in crazy times,” Sanders said. “You know, we’re in the midst of this terrible pandemic. So many of our people have lost their jobs and their income but are worried about climate change, worried about systemic racism.”“But tonight we are going to be asking questions like: ‘How does it happen that in the richest country in the history of the world, half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck’,” he said.Harris talked about the Biden campaign’s plans to expand sick leave for workers, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, improve availability of childcare for workers and put in place universal pre-kindergarten education for three- and four-year-olds.“These are things that we have to do. And everyone benefits,” Harris said.29 Oct 2020 - 23:56 GMTThe entertainer Lil Wayne met with Trump in Miami in the morning to talk about criminal justice reform and Trump’s so-called “Platinum Plan” to promote economic investment in Black communities. He tweeted his support after the meeting.Just had a great meeting with@realdonaldtrump@potusbesides what he’s done so far with criminal reform, the platinum plan is going to give the community real ownership.

Trump would eliminate health care coverage for millions of Americans. And the president has demonstrated disrespect for US military service people, calling them ‘losers’.Biden cut his speech short because of rain. He was speaking at a drive-in rally in Tampa, Florida.“Time’s running out. This country can’t afford four more years of Trump,” Biden said.Two people who attended Trump’s rally last week in Gastonia, North Carolina, have tested positive for the coronavirus.“These cases are not thought to be an indication of spread from the rally at this time, but rather two independent cases among individuals who were in attendance,” The Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.The department recommended anyone who attended the president’s October 21 rally assess their own risk, monitor for symptoms and get tested, if necessary.Trump’s campaign says it is postponing their Thursday night rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for a few days as Tropical Storm Zeta bears down on the Northeast.“Because of a wind advisory issued with gusts reaching 50 miles per hour and other weather conditions, the outdoor Fayetteville, NC rally has been postponed until Monday,” the campaign said in a statement.Several North Carolina counties were under tropical storm watch Thursday afternoon. North Carolina is a battleground state that Trump won in 2016 but that Democrat Joe Biden is pushing for in 2020.Several people attending Trump’s Tampa rally have reportedly required medical attention after suffering from intense heat.A number of folks here in the Tampa heat are suffering under the sun.  86 degrees. Couple of calls for medics here.— Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO)October 29, 2020The US Supreme Court rejected another bid by North Carolina Republicans to block the extension of a deadline for receiving mail-in ballots.The justices denied a request by Republican legislators in the state to put on hold an agreement made by state election officials allowing the extension that a North Carolina state court had approved.Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court on Tuesday as Trump’s third appointee, did not participate in the case. Barrett did not have time to fully review the case filings, a court spokeswoman said in a statement.More than 80 million Americans have already cast ballots in the presidential election, according to a tally from the US Elections Project – setting the stage for the highest participation rate in over a century.The record-breaking pace, more than 58 percent of total 2016 turnout, reflects intense interest in the vote.Huge numbers of people have voted by mail or at early in-person polling sites amid concerns the coronavirus could spread at busy Election Day voting places.Speaking at a drive-in rally in in Broward county, Florida Biden addressed supporters and blasted Trump for his coronavirus response and handling of protests, calling for racial justice in the country.He said Trump will not even say the phrase “Black lives matter.”He also encouraged residents of the key battleground state to vote.“This election is the most important one you’ve ever voted in …The heart and soul of this country’s at stake,” he said.Biden also made a direct pitch to Florida’s Latino voters by saying Trump is “the worst possible standard-bearer for democracy” in places like Cuba and Venezuela.Florida’s sizable and diverse Latino population could be key to Biden’s chances in Florida, a state that remains a must-win for Trump. While the state’s Cuban population has traditionally trended Republican, Democrats believe they have an opening with Florida’s Cubans because of Trump’s move to freeze relations with the nation and the changing demographics of the population.Trump addressed a large rally in Tampa, and vowed to keep the US economy open, even as cases of coronavirus continue to surge in Florida and dozens of other states.He then touted newly released data from the Commerce Department showing that the economy grew by an annualised rate of 33.1 percent in the third quarter, beating expectations, but leaving the economy 3.5 percent below where it was at the end of 2019.“I mean how many times can I say it? I’ll say it five or six times during the speech, 33.1,” Trump said.Two polls of likely voters in Florida out today show Biden with small leads, which normally would be cause for celebration in a state known for its razor-thin presidential contests. However, both polls continue to show Biden lagging among Latino voters, a significant part of Florida’s electorate.In a Monmouth poll released this afternoon, Biden leads Trump 50-45 percent overall and has a 24-point lead among Latinos. Another poll, NBC/Marist, has Biden up 51-47 percent statewide but he only holds a 5-point lead among Latino voters.There has been concern among Democrats about Biden’s lower than expected support among Florida Latinos. Clinton won Latinos there by 27 points in 2016, according to exit polls. Trump won Florida by 1.2 percentage points in 2016.Both Biden and Trump are campaigning in Florida today.Trump is also heading to North Carolina today (Biden has not been there since September 23, though his full schedule through Election Day has yet to be announced). Two polls show an extremely tight race there as well.A New York Times/Siena College poll released today shows Biden with a slim 48-45 percent lead over Trump among likely voters. A UMass Lowell poll has them knotted up at 48 percent apiece. Trump won North Carolina by 3.7 percentage points in 2016.The Monmouth poll has a +/-4.4 percent margin of error; NBC/Marist, +/-4.4 percent; New York Times/Siena, +/-3.7 percent; and UMass Lowell, +/-4.2 percent.In a new video advertisement, Biden pledged to issue an executive order creating a task force to unite migrant families who were separated under Trump’s administration.Despite a federal judge’s order that the government reunite families who had been separated at the United States-Mexico border under Trump “zero tolerance” migration policy, the parents of 545 children still have not been found.Read morehere.Biden issued a statement reminding voters that the economy is still in a “deep hole” and that the recovery, which benefited mostly “those at the top”, is slowing.The data from the Commerce Department showed that the economy grew by an annualized rate of 33.1 percent in the third quarter, beating expectations, but leaving the economy 3.5 percent below where it was at the end of 2019.Success in a Biden-Harris Administration will not be measured just by the stock market or GDP growth, but by the extent to which growth is raising the pay, dignity, and economic security of our working families—especially those who have been left behind.https://t.co/HQZ8UbUb3f— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden)October 29, 2020“Yes, GDP rose last quarter, but visits to food banks haven’t slowed, and poverty has grown. African Americans and Latinos still face double-digit unemployment rates,” Biden said. “I will fight side-by-side with the American people to rein in the virus and provide needed economic relief.”Trump meanwhile promised voters they would keep the growth going if given another term.“GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close,” Trump tweeted. “So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.”GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close. Next year will be FANTASTIC!!! However, Sleepy Joe Biden and his proposed record setting tax increase, would kill it all. So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)October 29, 2020Voters say the economy is one of the most important issues they are weighing during this presidential election. Roughly half of the 22 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered, but new hiring is slowing.The US economy grew at a record pace in the third quarter as the government injected more than $3 trillion worth of pandemic relief – which fueled consumer spending.According to a report by the Commerce Department, gross domestic product rebounded at a 33.1 percent annualised rate last quarter -that was the fastest pace since the government started keeping records in 1947 and followed a historic shrinkage rate of 31.4 percent in the second quarter.Trump will likely seize on the stunning rebound in GDP as a sign of recovery, but output remains below its level in the fourth quarter of 2019, a fact  Biden is almost certain to highlight along with signs that the growth spurt is fast petering out.Read morehere.In the final leg of campaign, Biden, will head to three states Trump won in 2016: Iowa, Wisconsin and then Michigan, where he will hold a joint Saturday rally with former President Barack Obama.Trump meanwhile plans to return to the Midwest on Friday, campaigning in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In all, he plans to visit 10 states in the last week of the campaign and will host 11 rallies in the final 48 hours, according to his campaign.In a significant setback for Republicans in two battleground states, the US Supreme Court allowed absentee ballots in North Carolina and Pennsylvania to be received and counted up to nine days after Election Day.Trump has made unfounded claims that voting by mail, a common practice in US elections, leads to widespread fraud.But Trump and his allies have also notched important wins, including a ruling that the Republican governor of Texas may limit drop-off sites for election ballots.Hackers stole $2.3 million from the Wisconsin Republican Party’s account, The Associated Press reported.Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt said officials noticed the suspicious activity on October 22 and contacted the FBI.President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will hold competing rallies in Florida, an essential state, especially for the president.Opinion polls suggest Biden has a significant edge nationally, but his lead is tighter in battleground states. With its 29 electoral votes, the state is a major prize in next Tuesday’s election.Trump will stage an outdoor rally in Tampa while Biden, in contrast, will hold a drive-in rally later in Tampa where attendees will remain in their cars. He will host a similar event earlier in the day in Broward County in South Florida.Read more about Florida’s role in in the electionhere.Three of four voters express concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll has found.Only one in four say they are “very confident” the nation will have a peaceful transfer of power if Biden defeats Trump.Legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus said he has cast his vote for Trump and urged Americans who have not made up their minds to vote for him too.Nicklaus, an 18-time major winner, said Trump has already delivered on his promises in the past three and a half years while being “more diverse than any other President” before.“You might not like the way our President says or tweets some things – and trust me, I have told him that! – but I have learned to look past that and focus on what he’s tried to accomplish,” Nicklaus, 80, said in a statement on Twitter.Jack, this is a Great Honor. Thank you!https://t.co/60WWISm5hs— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)October 29, 2020Nicklaus said Trump’s policies will continue to bring the “American Dream” to many families across the nation.Soon after Nicklaus’s endorsement, Trump replied on Twitter: “Jack, this is a Great Honor.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/17/long-lines-for-us-early-voting-underscore-hidden-barriers,US elections: Long lines underscore multiple barriers to voting | US ...,"Oct 17, 2020 ... Residents report hours-long waits as early voting for the presidential election began in states across the US.",17 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Residents report hours-long waits as early voting for the presidential election began in states across the US.Early voting has started in more than 20 states ahead of the November 3 United States presidential election and already, the turnout has far surpassed past contests, leading some experts to project record-breaking participation this year.More than 25 million ballots have been cast through in-person early ballots and mail-in voting as of Saturday, the United States Election Project said, which corresponds to more than 18 percent of all the votes counted in the 2016 presidential race.But that early voter engagement, in part fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, has also led to new challenges, as long lines and hours-long waits were reported at polling sites in Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana and Ohio, among other states.The time-consuming process has been attributed to enthusiasm in a charged political climate, eagerness to avoid the polls on election day because of the novel coronavirus, and, in some cases, glitches with the voting infrastructure.But it is also evidence of barriers that many US voters face, according to voting rights advocates, who said that those barriers, which can make casting a ballot a day-long affair, often disproportionately affect minority communities.Critics also said that some voting systems, which are overseen by and differ between each respective US state, even in national elections, are inherently designed to help one party over the other.“The long lines are happening not by accident but design,” the National Election Defence Coalition, a group of election-monitoring organisations,tweetedon October 15. “Voters must stand up to defend our system of government.”In Georgia, where polls opened on Monday, some voters waited more than eight hours to cast their votes, according to local media.The first day of voting in the state saw 128,000 residents go to the polls, smashing 2016’s first-day turnout of 91,000, The Associated Press news agency reported.State officials said the turnout was “extreme and tremendous” and, therefore, lines were to be expected. “There’s a lot of enthusiasm around this election, and you’re going to see high turnout. Because of that, we’re going to see lines,” Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper.During Georgia primary voters in predominantly white areas waited 6 minutes to vote while voters in predominantly minority areas waited 51 minutes to voteVoter suppression in Georgia direct result of SCOTUS gutting Voting Rights Act & would be even worse if Barrett confirmedhttps://t.co/Twb5F7rvVo— Ari Berman (@AriBerman)October 12, 2020The delays were partially fuelled by problems with voter check-in computers at polling sites in the Atlanta area, according to local media.But ananalysisby Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica, published Saturday in coordination with National Public Radio, indicated a more insidious problem: A shrinking number of polling sites in the state.The news outlets reported that while the reduction of polling places has taken place “across racial lines”, it has had an outsized effect on nonwhite communities that have seen spikes in voter registration and where residents are more likely to cast ballots in person.Another day of early voting and another long line in NC. This one in Durham. Polls open right nowpic.twitter.com/6PDD9fn2Ha— Leigh Ann Caldwell (@LACaldwellDC)October 17, 2020That’s particularly noteworthy, as Georgia is one of several places in the US with a history of voter discrimination. Under the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, the state had been required to get federal preclearance before making changes to its voting systems and infrastructure.However, a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 eliminated that requirement, allowing state officials and legislators to make changes to how voting is carried out without oversight by the federal government. Individuals and groups can still challenge state voting practices in court.Since then, the number of registered voters in Georgia has grown by nearly two million people, while the number of polling locations has been cut statewide by 10 percent, according to the Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica analysis.Nine counties in the city of Atlanta have been hit particularly hard, accounting for half of the state’s voters, but only 38 percent of its polling places, the report found, although some have sought to make last-minute polling site additions before the election.It also said the average number of voters per polling place increased by 40 percent in those counties from 2012 to October 9. Across Georgia, about 90 percent of precincts do not adhere to a state law that caps the number of voters allowed to cast their ballots at a single polling site that has previously experienced voter delays at 2,000 people.The high number of voters using a single polling site extends beyond Georgia, a June voting analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy institute at New York University Law School, found.The average number of voters assigned to polling places also increased during the last five years in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, all states that previously required preclearance under the Voting Rights Act.Other US states, including those that did not have special requirements under the Voting Rights Act, have also been accused of using long waits at polling sites to suppress voters.In Ohio, where early voting began on October 6, the number of people who cast ballots in person during the first week of early voting nearly tripled compared with 2016, with 193,021 voters going to the polls compared with 64,312 four years ago.The surge led to hours-long waits at polling stations, including a line of voters in the city of Columbus that stretched about 0.4 kilometres (0.25 miles) on the first day the polls opened, the AP reported.Ohio state officials have blamed the long lines on the first day of early voting on high “enthusiasm” among the electorate.But a 2006 state law that limits early, in-person polling sites to one per county also contributed to the long line-ups, former President Barack Obama’s speechwriter, David Litt,notedthis week in The Guardian newspaper.Litt said the set-up means that residents of Vinton County, a Republican bastion with a population of 13,500, have access to the same number of early voting sites as the 1.3 million residents of Franklin County, which encompasses Columbus, the state capital.This line is for early voting in Columbus – yay#Ohio#VOTE👊🏽pic.twitter.com/0ZY0QArZ02— Ashley Koff RD (@ashleykoff)October 12, 2020“Blaming voters for the long lines they endure ignores the massive, intentional disparity in resources between the more and less populous parts of the state,” Litt wrote. “Ohio’s politicians have made voting far easier for Republicans and far more difficult for Democrats.”"

If it holds, it would flip the historically Republican state.A win for Biden in Pennsylvania give him more than 270 votes in the Electoral College –  enough for the presidency.With counts of mail ballots nearing an end, Americans and the world may know on Friday who the apparent winner is. But it will not end there.Recounts appear inevitable as President Donald Trump is planning court challenges in several key states. He has already attacked the entire process as rigged on Twitter and in aWhite House appearanceon Thursday night.Biden’s campaign is also assembling lawyers to protect his electoral lead in the courts and is asking online donors for money, saying “the fight is not over”.The heavily Democratic city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania is emerging as a hotspot in the dispute as mail ballot counts sliced President Trump’s early lead from in-person voting.Biden still leads continuing counts in Arizona and Nevada, two southwest states that combined, could also give Biden an overall win. Trump leads in North Carolina.In statements from the White House and on Twitter, Trump attacked the integrity of the election process in which in-person votes gave him an early lead which was later clipped by mail ballots.Trump tweeted at 2:22 am EST [07:22GMT] the votes still being counted are “illegal”. Twitter flagged the president’s tweet as “disputed” and potentially “misleading”.I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST. The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes accepted during this period must be determined to be ILLEGAL VOTES. U.S. Supreme Court should decide!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 6, 2020Some US television networkscut away from live coverageof Trump’s remarks from the White House on Thursday night in which he claimed the vote counting was illegal.Republicans have been divided by Trump’s rhetoric. In a message picked up by other House Republicans, Representative Adam Kinzinger tweeted Trump’s claims were “getting insane”.We want every vote counted, yes every legal vote (of course). But, if you have legit concerns about fraud present EVIDENCE and take it to court.  STOP Spreading debunked misinformation… This is getting insane.— Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger)November 6, 2020Trump’s allies joined the president’s accusations that Democrats were trying to “steal” the election.Senator Lindsey Graham announced on Fox News on Thursday night he will donate USD $500,000 to Trump’s legal fund to challenge the ballot counting and urged Fox viewers to contribute.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called this moment a “genuine, deep crisis” of the American system and called Democrats in Philadelphia “corrupt”.A federal judge in Philadelphia dismissed a lawsuit by Trump’s campaign over how many observers it could allow in the room during counting after an agreement was reached.Philadelphia police detained two people driving a military-style Hummer vehicle with QAnon symbols and a weapon who were suspected of planning to attack the building where election workers were counting votes.In a federal court filing on Friday in Washington, DC, the US Postal Service said it had found 1,700 ballots in Pennsylvania not yet delivered to election officials."

Authorities sanction, indict and seize website domains as Washington ...",Last update 8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Authorities sanction, indict and seize website domains as Washington accuses Russia of interfering in 2024 US elections.The United States has announced arange of actionsto combat Russian influence in the November 2024 presidential election, as the Biden administration tries to prevent outsiders from swaying votes.Two employees of the Russian state media network RT, previously known as Russia Today, were indicted, dozens of internet domains were seized for “malign influence campaigns” and a new visa restriction policy was introduced as part of the efforts to check foreign influence.Let’s take a look at what we know so far:The US Justice Department, State Department and the Treasury were involved in one of the largest coordinated government efforts against foreign influence based on research by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).According to an indictment unsealed by the Justice Department on Wednesday, two senior employees of the state-funded RT used shell companies and fake identities to pay $10m to a Tennessee-based media operation to create content benefitting Russia.US Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters that the operation involved millions of followers and never disclosed that it was being directed by Moscow while falsely claiming it was being funded by a private investor.The Russia-based defendants, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, have been charged with conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.The US-based targeted media operation was Tenet Media, which contracts a network of pro-Trump American influencers who publish right-wing content. Neither Tenet Media nor the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump were named in the indictment but could be easily matched with the descriptions provided.According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Treasury, sanctions were imposed on a total of 10 individuals and two entities.It said the designations complement the State Department’s blacklisting of the Rossiya Segodnya media group and five of its subsidiaries, RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik, as “Foreign Missions”.The State Department has also imposed visa restrictions on the designated individuals and offered a reward of up to $10m for information pertaining to foreign interference in the US election.The Justice Department separately announced the seizure of 32 internet domains “used in Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns”.The State Department and the White House have asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been guiding some of the influence operations.“We believe Mr Putin is weighing in on these actions,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.According to the US attorney general, the company that was allegedly set up by Russia in Tennessee published hundreds of videos with “commentary on events and issues in the United States, such as immigration, inflation, and other topics related to domestic and foreign policy”.“The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country’s free exchange of ideas in order to send around its own propaganda,” Garland said, adding that the US judicial system is sending a message that it has “no tolerance” for foreign influence operations.The Tennessee-based operation used a network of media personalities that included Dave Rubin, Tim Pool, Lauren Southern and Benny Johnson, who have a combined following of tens of millions on their social media pages.Several influencers took to social media to say they had no knowledge of any Russian ties with the outlet that contracted them for content, and that they were “victims” of the alleged scheme.Statement on the DOJ indictment:These allegations clearly show that I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme.I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity. Period.‘People of the Internet’ was a silly show covering viral videos which ended…pic.twitter.com/KQHYDUi3ot— Dave Rubin (@RubinReport)September 4, 2024“My lawyers will handle anyone who states or suggests otherwise,” 37-year-old right-wing commentator and YouTuber Benny Johnson wrote in a post on X, threatening against any accusation of him of working with Russia.The Kremlin has consistently denied allegations that it is actively interfering with US elections, with official comments at times trying to portray that Moscow may actually prefer a Kamala Harris presidency.Speaking on Thursday, the Russian president offered sarcastic remarks on the Democratic nominee amid allegations that he prefers Republicans in the White House. Putin said Biden had “recommended to voters to support Ms Harris [and] we will also support her”. He added: “She laughs so contagiously that it shows that everything is fine with her.”Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement on Thursday that the Russian response to Wednesday’s moves in the US will be harsh and make “everyone shudder”.RT responded sarcastically via a message published on its website by Deputy Editor-in-Chief Anna Belkina, who said, “They’re calling from 2016 and demanding all their tired cliches back.”“There are three certainties in life: death, taxes, and RT’s interference in the American elections,” she wrote.According to US authorities, Russia has been meddling in the upcoming US elections with the Ukraine war in mind.Moscow allegedly wants to see Trump become president for a second time because the Republican candidate has repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction with thetens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine.Russia is also trying to sow divisions and unrest in the US and instil a sense of economic and political insecurity, according to US officials, who have also accused China and Iran of launching influence and meddling operations for years.China and Iran have refuted the claims, with Tehran repeatedly denying involvement in the Ukraine war as well.Iran’s mission to the United Nations wrote a letter to the Security Council on Thursday that said it is “both ironic and hypocritical” that the US, the United Kingdom and France continue to accuse Iran of contributing to the warconsidering their arms exportsthat have “prolonged” the war.US authorities have said their efforts to counter interference operations are ongoing."

Several studies have shown an increase in threats against elected officials and public office holders in recent years, surging after Trump ...",Last update 15 Jul 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"An already unprecedented race has again been transformed by political violence that is set to loom over the months ahead.Washington, DC– Eightgunshotshave transformed the United States election, casting an already unprecedented race into further uncertainty.On Sunday, a day after the attack at candidate Donald Trump’s Butler, Pennsylvania rally, details have continued to emerge, as have early indications of how the violent act would affect US political discourse, campaigning and voter attitudes in the days leading up to the November 5 poll.But for Rina Shah, a US political strategist, one thing was clear in the immediate wake of the attack: “No matter what, everything changes from here on out.”That will be particularly on display, she said, at theRepublican National Convention(RNC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Republicans will gather starting Monday to begin the official process of nominating Trump as their candidate.The event will kick off just two days after the suspect,identifiedas 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire from a nearby rooftop outside of the Secret Service security perimeter at Trump’s rally.One bullet grazed Trump in the right ear, causing panic on the crowded stage. Others struck spectators, killing one man and injuring two more.“I can say that this shocks the consciousness,” Shah said during a television interview with Al Jazeera. “We have less than 120 days to go and this resets everything.”Indeed, the rally attack – in which Trump became the 13th US president or presidential candidate to facean assassination attempt, and the eighth to survive – was swiftly met with calls from elected lawmakers for a reset in the polarisation that has come to define modern US politics.President Joe Biden decried the violence as “sick” before holding a phone call with his opponent late on Saturday. He said “everybody must condemn” the attack.On Sunday, Trump, in a break from the often caustic rhetoric that had previously defined his campaign, said, “It is more important than ever that we stand united.”Political violence experts have said it is imperative for leaders to continue to bring the temperature down to prevent further violence or retributive attacks.Speaking to Al Jazeera in a TV interview after the attack, Colin P Clarke, the director of research at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm, said the rally violence “epitomises” the current extremes of US democracy.Recent studies have shown that while Americans are less ideologically polarised than they perceive themselves to be, they are increasingly “emotionally polarised”, meaning they “harbour strong dislike for members of the other party”, according to an analysis published last year by Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Several studies have shown an increase in threats againstelectedofficials and public officeholdersin recent years, surging after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an effort to overturn Biden’s election victory on January 6, 2021.Meanwhile, a June survey conducted out of the University of Chicago found that nearly 7 percent of respondents said the use of force was justified to restore Trump to the presidency. Another 10 percent said the use of force would be justified to “prevent Trump from becoming president”.Security analyst Clarke added that while the violence at the Trump rally could be a unifying moment for Americans, “it’s likely to be divisive”. He predicted a “very dangerous political season”.His words have since proven prescient, with many Republicans, including Trump’s possible vice president pick, Senator JD Vance, laying blame for the attack on Biden. Vance said Biden’s rhetoric has portrayed Trump as “an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs”.At least one Republican legislator has dipped into conspiracy theory, with US Representative Mike Collins of Georgia baselessly calling on authorities to arrest Biden for “inciting an assassination”.As politics watchers wait to see if the shooting will indeed inflame or soothe US political polarisation, almost every analyst who spoke to Al Jazeera agreed that Trump is likely to receive a bump in support in the wake of the attack.That will be buoyed by the timing of the incident, just before the RNC, with Trump’s team saying he will still attend.It will also be boosted by the images and the narrative that have emerged from the attack.“The iconic shot of Trump standing with his fist in the air, blood coming down the side of his head, and the flag draped just perfectly over him is really driving the narrative,” James Davis, a Republican strategist, told Al Jazeera.“He’s going to be seen sympathetically after this from the national narrative,” he said.He'll never stop fighting to Save America 🇺🇸pic.twitter.com/qT4Vd0sVTm— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr)July 13, 2024Even a slight boost in support could make the difference in a race set to be decided by razor-thin margins. Trump and Biden have been hoping to win over a small group of undecided voters in a few key battleground states while turning out voters who do not normally go to the polls.Trump haslargely weatheredhis historic May conviction on charges related to hush-money payments made to an adult film actress, although some polls had shown some softening among undecided voters. Biden, meanwhile, has faced growing calls from within his party to step aside asconcerns over his agehave crescendoed.Still, a Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll released last week showed Biden leading Trump slightly in Michigan and Wisconsin, and Trump with a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.Speaking to Al Jazeera, Arshad Hasan, a Democratic strategist, also acknowledged that Trump is likely to gain in the wake of the attack, particularly with the Biden campaign promising to pause communications and advertisements critical of Trump for 48 hours out of respect.While Hasan said it is wise for Democrats to focus on “humanity” in the wake of the attack, they should also continue to make calls for greater gun control, which Biden had already made central to his presidency. “The time to talk about gun violence is whenever there is gun violence,” he said.The political strategist said he was attending a conference of the party’s progressive wing when the attack occurred. He saw shock waves go through the crowd of attendees, many of whom would be spending the next months of the election on various campaign trails and at events similar to Trump’s rally.Beyond the Trump attack, still fresh in many people’s minds are the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords at a constituent event and the 2017 attack on members of Congress playing baseball in Alexandria, Virginia, he added.The campaign season, Hasan said, will likely be defined by that spectre of fear.“There are hundreds of people who are running for Congress, for Senate, thousands of people running for state legislature. And on top of that, there’s all of the issues that people are advocating for,” he said.While the attack has led to a reassessment of campaign security for high-profile candidates, most people running for election do so with little to no security.“There is this fear that violence begets more violence,” Hasan said."

Manipulated, underexposed images and cherry-picked headlines combine to build a crescendo of doom.But in the wake of Tuesday’sannouncementthat Democratic President Joe Biden will run for reelection, an official Republican Party video has stood out for one specific reason: It was generated completely usingartificial intelligence(AI) images.The Republican National Committee’s embrace of the “transformative technology of our time” is not surprising given the rapid advancement and availability of AI products, said Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution.The Republican Party’s use of AI is an early sign of what is likely to come, he told Al Jazeera.“Three years ago, AI was not really being utilised in election campaigns. But the technologies advanced very rapidly. And now the technology is readily available,” he said. “You don’t have to be a software designer or a video editing expert to create very realistic-looking videos.”“It is uncharted territory,” he added. “We’ve gone beyond Photoshopping small parts of an image to basically generating a completely new image out of thin air. That will free people to create all sorts of videos and kind of project new realities that may not actually exist.”And so it begins –#generativeaibeing used to create misinformation and deepfake election campaign videos.The Republican National Committee just released an ad against Biden using AI created imagery. Before the pandemic I gave a talk about the dangers of deepfakes across…pic.twitter.com/7bw2yCn24Z— Theo (@tprstly)April 26, 2023For its part, the Republican National Committee was transparent about its use of AI, an umbrella term for systems that seek to mimic — and exceed — human cognitive skills, like learning, reasoning and creativity.In its YouTube description, the political group called the video “an AI-generated look into the country’s possible future if Joe Biden is re-elected in 2024”.The video itself also included a text saying “built entirely with AI imagery”. Realistic-looking images played as a fake newsreader announced Biden’s 2024 victory, followed by a litany of hypothetical disasters: China invading Taiwan, financial markets crashing, the southern border getting overrun and officials closing San Francisco, “citing the escalating crime and fentanyl crisis”.In many ways, the video does not represent much of a departure from the imagery and rhetoric common inUS campaigns.As the Washington Post noted in 2020, “sharing doctored images of an electoral rival is a timeworn strategy of modern politic”. The newspaper reported that a “rapid acceleration” in fake imagery during former President Donald Trump’s term in office, “possibly because Trump has proved one of their most popular distributors”.Meanwhile, US courts have repeatedly upheld a wide interpretation of the right to make false or misleading campaign statements. Most recently an appeals court ruled in February that a North Carolina law banning campaign falsehoods was “likely unconstitutional”.Said West, the technology innovation fellow at the Brookings Institution, “Courts have regularly ruled that campaign speech is protected speech. In fact, candidates can knowingly say false things and still be allowed to say them.”Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under former President Barack Obama, put it another way in an interview with NPR last year: “Unfortunately, you’re allowed to lie.”AI, however, has the potential to supercharge those pre-existing campaign practices, West said, adding there are “virtually no checks on the use of this technology in a campaign setting”.“There’s no legal requirement to acknowledge you’re using an AI-generated image,” he said. “In this case, the RNC voluntarily revealed it … but in the future, there’ll be lots of organisations that will use it without informing voters.”So-calleddeepfakes— video or audio that falsely depict an individual saying or doing things — have prompted particular cause for concern, even as they remain on the political fringes so far.California and Texas passed laws before the 2020 general election, with the former allowing misrepresented candidates to sue deepfake makers, and the latter imposing criminal penalties for deepfakes.However, federal efforts to legislate the issue haveseen little progress, facing questions over enforceability and pushback from digital rights groups, who have argued major tech platforms shouldprovide oversight.Meanwhile, those seeking to influence campaigns “can really respond almost instantly” to the latest events, West said.“Basically, you ask the AI to generate images. You have them in a matter of seconds. So, we’re going to have rapid response ads: Something will happen and there could be an ad five minutes later.”“It will be a very fast-paced campaign with lots of claims and counterclaims happening minute by minute,” he said.Democrats have also reportedly embraced aspects of AI in campaigning, testing the technology to write first drafts of some fundraising messages, the New York Timesreportedin March.Citing three people with knowledge of the effort, the newspaper reported that messaging generated by AI and edited by humans at the Democratic National Committee performed “as well or better than copy drafted entirely by humans, in terms of generating engagement and donations”.The ability to quickly reach — and potentially misinform — specific voter segments is particularly significant in the 2024 presidential polls, which will likely come down to “one or two percent of voters”, according to West.“It is a Wild West moment where it’s gonna be impossible for voters to distinguish the real from the fake,” he said.“Things are going to be coming at them from every direction, and there’s the risk of widespread confusion,” he said. “And that can lead to bad decisions.”"

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey will testify about their efforts to stop disinformation.",16 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey have been called to testify about their efforts to stop disinformation during the deeply divided US election.The CEOs of Facebook and Twitter are being summoned before the United States Congress to defend their handling of disinformation in the 2020 presidential election, even as lawmakers questioning them are deeply divided over the election’s integrity and results.Prominent Republican senators have refused to disavow President Donald Trump’s unfounded claims of voting irregularities and fraud, even as misinformation disputing Democrat Joe Biden’s victory has flourished online.Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee where the CEOs will testify Tuesday, has publicly urged, “Do not concede, Mr. President. Fight hard.”Both Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey promised lawmakers last month that they would aggressively guard their platforms against being manipulated by foreign governments or used to incite violence around the election results – and they followed through with high-profile steps that angered Trump and his supporters.Twitter and Facebook have both slapped a misinformation label on some content from Trump, most notably his assertions linking voting by mail to fraud.On Monday, Twitter flagged Trump’s tweet proclaiming “I won the Election!” with this note: “Official sources called this election differently.”Facebook also moved two days after the election to ban a large group called “Stop the Steal” that Trump supporters were using to organise protests against the vote count. The 350,000-member group echoed Trump’s baseless allegations of a rigged election rendering the results invalid.For days after the election as the vote counting went on, copycat “Stop the Steal” groups were easily found on Facebook, with one nearing 12,000 members as of last week.But as of Monday, they appeared to have been taken down; a search for the term turned up no results for such groups.Warily eyeing how the companies wield their power to filter speech and ideas, Trump and the Republicans accuse the social media companies of anti-conservative bias.Democrats also criticise them, though for different reasons. The result is that both parties are interested in stripping away some of the protections that have shielded tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Biden has heartily endorsed such an action.But it’s the actions that companies have taken around the election that are likely to be a dominant focus at Tuesday’s hearing.The GOP majority on the Judiciary panel threatened Zuckerberg and Dorsey with subpoenas last month if they did not agree to voluntarily testify for Tuesday’s hearing.Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee lambasted the two CEOs and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, at a hearing last month for what they said was a pattern of silencing conservative viewpoints while giving free rein to political actors from countries like China and Iran.Despite fears over security in the run-up to the November 3 election and social media companies bracing for the worst, the election turned out to be the most secure in US history, federal and state officials from both parties say – repudiating Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of fraud.Facebook insists that it has learned its lesson from the 2016 election and is no longer a conduit for misinformation, voter suppression and election disruption.This fall, Facebook said it removed a small network of accounts and pages linked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, the “troll factory” that has used social media accounts to sow political discord in the US since the 2016 election. Twitter suspended five related accounts.But critical outsiders, as well as some of Facebook’s own employees, say the company’s efforts to tighten its safeguards remain insufficient, despite it having spent billions.“Facebook only acts if they feel there’s a threat to their reputation or their bottom line,” says Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. The organisation had pressed Facebook to take down the “Stop the Steal” group.There’s no evidence that the social media giants are biased against conservative news, posts or other material, or that they favour one side of political debate over another, researchers have found.But criticism of the companies’ policies, and their handling of disinformation tied to the election, has come from Democrats as well as Republicans.Democrats have focused their criticism mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence, keep people from voting or spread falsehoods about the coronavirus.They criticise the tech CEOs for failing to police content, blaming the platforms for playing a role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the US. And that criticism has extended to their efforts to stamp out false information related to the election.″If you thought disinformation on Facebook was a problem during our election, just wait until you see how it is shredding the fabric of our democracy in the days after,” Biden spokesman Bill Russo tweeted."

When Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election despite losing the popular vote by almost three million votes, ...",2 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"America’s framers deliberately designed it so presidents are not directly elected by voters.When Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election despite losing the popular vote by almost three million votes, many around the world wondered: “How is that even possible?”Unlike members of the US House and Senate, who are directly elected by voters, presidents, as spelled out in Article II of the US Constitution are not. The constitution says that the president and the vice president are elected as such: “Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress.”In practice, what this means is that voters in each US state are voting for a slate of “electors”, who, after the votes are counted and certified, are pledged to vote for a presidential and vice presidential candidate. In 48 states and the District of Columbia, whichever ticket wins the most votes receives all of that state’s electors. In Maine and Nebraska, their electors are allocated based on the winner of each congressional district and the overall winner of the state.The electors then meet as an Electoral College on a specified date by federal law – “the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December next following their appointment” (on December 14 this year) – to tally their votes for president and vice president.There are 538 electors among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. States with larger populations have a greater representation in the US House, therefore they also have a higher number of electors. A state’s number of electors is determined by adding the number of US representatives plus two, the number of senators each state has.The District of Columbia, where the federal government is based, is not considered a state, and has no voting representation in Congress. However, in 1961, a constitutional amendment was ratified, giving the District of Columbia three electoral votes, the number of votes it would receive if it was considered a state, beginning in the 1964 presidential election.To win, a candidate needs 50 percent plus one of the total 538 electors, or 270.2016 was the fifth time in US history that a presidential candidate won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote.So, how did Clinton receive more actual votes but fell short in the Electoral College? She won decisive victories in some of the largest states: A 4.26 million vote margin of victory in California, the most populous US state, a 1.7 million-vote victory in New York and a 944,000-vote victory in Illinois. For his part, Trump won three key electoral vote states by margins of fractions of a percent – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – and won Arizona, Florida, and North Carolina by less than 4 percentage points each.The Electoral College is why each presidential race comes down to the handful of “battleground” states where polling is extremely close. The rest of the states are generally considered safely Democratic or Republican and those electoral votes can be predicted long in advance. This year there are about 10 states the candidates have focused their time and money, and it is those states that wind up having the most influence in deciding who the winner of the presidential election will be."

US elections 2024: Who will be Donald Trump's vice president? · Elise Stefanik, US congresswoman · Tim Scott, US senator · JD Vance, US senator.",19 Jun 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Several names are on Trump’s shortlist, with the ex-president set to unveil his pick before or at July’s Republican convention.So far, the 2024 United Statespresidential racehas been short on surprises.As the incumbent, President Joe Biden was a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination once he announced he would seek re-election alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.And among Republicans, former President Donald Trump has long been the frontrunner — and he rapidly and resoundinglytrounced his challengersin the party primaries.One question that has lingered, though, is who will be Trump’spick for vice president.While the vice presidency holds limited power in US politics, past elections have shown that the choice can be a boost — or a liability — to presidential campaigns.This year’s Republican vice-presidential pick could be especially important, given the race between Trump and Biden is expected to be tight. Trump is expected to reveal his choice in the coming weeks, well ahead of the November 5 election.Here, Al Jazeera looks at Trump’s possible running mates, their views and what they could bring to the 2024 Republican ticket.When she was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2014, Stefanik was the youngest woman in history to join the chamber. She was 30 years old at the time.She has since become a rising star in the Republican Party, representing New York’s 21st District.Stefanik currently serves as the House Republican Conference Chair, the number-three leadership role for Republicans in the House. She is also one of Trump’s staunchest supporters in Congress.Stefanik, who has backed Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen through widespread voter fraud, was among the147 Republican lawmakerswho voted against certifying Biden’s election victory.She gained national attention earlier this year when she used acongressional hearingto hammer US university presidents over pro-Palestine protests on their campuses, accusing the administrators of allowing anti-Semitism to go unchecked.But critics have noted that Stefanik herself has come under fire for discriminatory messaging. In 2021, for instance, her campaign released advertisements warning that immigration would “overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority”.That messaging, critics say, mirrored the so-called “great replacement theory”, awhite supremacist conspiracy theorythat falsely asserts that white people are being replaced as a result of a plot to increase non-white immigration. The theory was invoked in anattack on a Pittsburgh synagoguein 2018, one of the deadliest instances of anti-Jewish violence in recent US history.In recent weeks, Stefanikhas visited Israelto show support as the country wages a deadly war in the Gaza Strip. She has alsoslammedTrump’s conviction on felony charges in New York, saying the verdict was the result of a “rigged” justice system.The only Black Republican in the US Senate, the South Carolina politicianentered the presidential racein May last year — but dropped out before the primaries even began, throwing his weight behind Trump.The former president praised Scott as “a great politician” after receiving his endorsement.Since then, Scott has been a prominent backer of Trump, defending the ex-president in scores of major US television news interviews and joining him on the campaign trail.Earlier this month, US media outletsreportedthat Scott was launching an outreach effort worth more than $14m to get Black voters to support Republicans in key battleground states in November.“The Republican Party, we offer you freedom. They [Democrats] offer you oppression,” he said in a recentsocial media videoabout what the GOP can offer communities of colour. “We offer mo’ money; they offer no money.”On policy, Scott — who regularly invokes his Christian faith — has voiced support for law enforcement, pledged to protect religious liberty against what he said was an “assault” by the far left, and promised to reform the education system.Vance jumped into US politics in 2022 after the success of his book, Hillbilly Elegy, which detailed his upbringing in the country’s Rust Belt.A venture capitalist, Vance graduated from Yale Law School and served in the US military during the Iraq War before being elected to represent the state of Ohio in the Senate.He has made a name for himself thanks to his fierce criticism of the Biden administration, particularly over issues like the economy and immigration.His embrace of so-called “culture war” issues has also made him a conservative darling, particularly among Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) base. He regularly denounces diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes that aim to address systemic racism and other forms of discrimination.Vance has used his family history and early life to try to paint himself as a defender of white, working-class Americans.Cotton — a US senator from the state of Arkansas — is outspoken on a range of domestic issues, but much of his focus has been on foreign policy.He is a vocal defender of Israel and recently joined a group of US lawmakers who introduced legislation tosanction the International Criminal Courtif it pursues arrest warrants for Israeli leaders accused of committing war crimes in Gaza.Faced with concerns that Trump could curtail assistance to Ukraine if elected, Cotton defended the former president, saying he “supports Ukraine’s strength and survival” as it fends of a full-scale Russian invasion.“I don’t think President Trump wants to prejudge what the situation will be come January, nor do I, in part because we have no idea how much worse Joe Biden can screw things up. We have to judge the circumstances as they exist, next year when [Trump] returns to office,” Cotton said on FOX News.While Trump has been sceptical of continued US aid for Kyiv — highlighting divisions within the Republican Party itself — Cotton recently voted in favour ofa massive billthat included $61bn for Ukraine.Cotton is also a hawk on China and has led efforts in Congress to “decouple” the US and Chinese economies. Among his signature causes is an effort to sever thesocial media platform TikTokfrom its developer, the Chinese firm ByteDance, over national security concerns.The Arkansas Republican drew criticism earlier this year when he pressed TikTok’s CEO Shou Chew on whether he had ties to the Chinese Communist Party during a congressional hearing.In an exchange that went viral on social media, Cotton asked: “Have you ever been a member of the Chinese Community Party?” Chew replied, “Senator, I’m Singaporean. No.”A former software executive and multimillionaire, Burgum ended his long-shot bid for the Republican presidential nomination in December and endorsed Trump about a month later.He had struggled to generate early momentum for his campaign, particularly in the lead-up to the Republican presidential debates last year.His campaign initially stayed afloat by offering gift cards in exchange for campaign donations. That setup allowed him to meet the minimum number of donors to qualify for the party’s first two debates.Trump praised Burgum’s business prowess after receiving his endorsement, telling a North Dakota radio station: “I’ve always had a lot of respect for Doug.”As North Dakota’s governor, Burgum signed into law a near-total abortion ban, as well as legislation making it a crime to provide gender-affirming healthcare to most minors.Burgum and other Republican legislators travelled to New York City last month to show support for Trump during his criminal hush-money trial. Echoing the ex-president himself, Burgum denounced the case as “election interference”.The Florida Republican is one of the most experienced politicians on Trump’s shortlist for vice president — though the ex-president has a history of sparring with him.The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has represented Florida in the US Senate since 2011.Hesought the Republican presidential nominationin 2016, facing Trump in the race. They frequently traded personal jabs during the primaries.Rubio, for instance, called Trump a “con artist” and said he had turned the 2016 race into “one of the most vulgar spectacles in American political history”. Trump described Rubio as a “choker” and a “lightweight”. He also dismissively nicknamed the Florida senator “Little Marco”.But Rubio has since embraced and defended the former president, callingTrump’s recent convictionin the New York hush-money case an “ugly, ugly blemish” on the US’s reputation.The Florida senator has said he wants to “secure” the US-Mexico border and has backed a 15-week ban on abortion in the state. On foreign policy, Rubio comes from the hawkish wing of the Republican Party and has promoted hardline policies against Cuba, Iran and China.Choosing Rubio as his vice president would present a minor complication for the Trump campaign: The 12th Amendment of the US Constitution states that presidential and vice-presidential nominees cannot be from the same home state.Trump and Rubio are both Florida residents. But if Rubio is Trump’s pick, he could change his official residency before the election."

He said he expects little, if anything, to come from the Trump campaign’sattempts at litigationacross the country.'The election is not done until every ballot is counted.byJulietta Henry, Milwaukee County election directorAlong with its plans to request a recount in Wisconsin, the Trump campaigned has also filed lawsuits to stop vote counting in several other battleground states wherethe resultsare close, including Pennsylvania.“You can see the hypocrisy of his comments when he wants to count every vote in states where he’s behind like Arizona and Nevada… but in states where he’s ahead, he wants to stop the counting,” Canon said.“It’s not illegal to lose a close election,” he added. “Just because you don’t like the outcome, you can’t sue [to] change the outcome. There has to be some legal basis for the claims and there is just no legal basis for these challenges right now.”Meanwhile, across Wisconsin, provisional ballots are still allowed to come in at the municipal level through Friday.Should any changes to the count occur as a result, the municipalities will include them in the certified results that they are required to provide to the counties and the county canvass will be adjusted accordingly.While challenges to provisional ballots can technically still be made, Canon said they typically do not hold much weight. “People often don’t come back to provide the additional information” that a provisional ballot’s acceptance hinges on, he said.The Trump campaign’s preliminarily demand for a recount came before one can legally be filed in the state, but Canon said he did not expect much to change should a recount be conducted.“There are always some problematic ballots that come up,” he said, but the results of discovered errors tend to go both ways and “basically cancel each other out”.The original results of the 2016 US elections gave Trump 47.19 percent of the vote in Wisconsin compared with Clinton’s 46.44 percent. After a state recount, Trump ended up with 47.22 percent of the vote with Clinton receiving 46.45 percent."

Run on keeping the government out of your private life. Run on getting your rights back. This is where the energy is. This is where the 2022 election will be won,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy wrote on Twitter.Biden lauded the results in Kansas late on Tuesday. “This vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own health care decisions,” he said in a statement.Former President Trump cemented his grip on the Republican party on Tuesday, with his favoured candidates scoring big victories across several states.In Michigan, conservative commentator Tudor Dixon, who was supported by Trump, won the Republican nomination for governor.Dixon, who describes herself as “pro-God, pro-life, pro-gun and pro-freedom” will take on incumbent Gretchen Whitmer in November. The current governor hadpublicly clashedwith Trump in 2020 over his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was also considered a possible choice to be Biden’s running mate that year.Trump notched another major win in Michigan on Tuesday. Congressman Peter Meijer, one of 10 Republicans to vote forimpeaching Trumpafter the Capitol riots last year, lost to a primary challenger backed by the former president.But in Washington state, two House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump appear set to survive their primaries.In Arizona, Trump-endorsed Kari Lake, who has promoted false claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential race, has a slim lead in the Republican primary for governor, with 80 percent of the votes counted.Mark Finchem, another Trump-backed election denier, won the Republican nomination for secretary of state in Arizona, raising fears that he would oversee the 2024 presidential vote if he wins in the general elections in November.In a blow to the US left, Congresswoman Haley Stevens – backed by millions of dollars worth of ads from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) –  defeated CongressmanAndy Levin, a Jewish progressive.The two Democratic incumbents were pitted against each other in a newly drawn district in Michigan.Levin had support from major progressive figures in the country, including senators Elizabeth Warren andBernie Sanders, but he faced an onslaught of millions of dollars worth of campaign spending by AIPAC. Stevens was also supported by EMILY’s List, an influential reproductive advocacy group that backs women who stand for abortion rights.Levin had been outspoken in favour ofPalestinian rights; Stevens backs unrestricted financial and political support for Israel.AIPAC, which has been pushing to defeat progressives, described the congressman’s defeat on Tuesday as a “monumental victory”.The race had garnered national attention, partly because Levin hails from a renowned Jewish-American political family in Michigan; his father was a US House member and his uncle was a senator.In a statement after the results, Levin – who supports universal healthcare and curbingmilitary spending– vowed to support Stevens in the general elections but hit out at the outside spending her campaign had received.“Unfortunately, I was the target of a largely Republican-funded campaign set on defeating the movement I represent no matter where I ran … I will continue to speak out against the corrosive influence of dark money on our democracy,” Levin said.In a neighbouring Detroit-based district, Shri Thanedar, a state legislator and businessman, appears set to deal a rare defeat to an AIPAC-backed candidate: he enjoys a nearly five-point lead, with 66 percent of the votes counted.Thanedar had angered pro-Israel groups by co-sponsoring a symbolic resolution in the Michigan House of Representatives calling for halting US aid to Israel during theGaza conflictlast year.He financed his own campaign with millions of dollars to counter AIPAC’s spending in support of his main rival, State Senator Adam Hollier.Progressive congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Cori Bush – who are part of the band of left-wing legislators known as “the Squad” – comfortably fended off primary challengers on Tuesday.Bush, a prominent Black Lives Matter activist, had defeated a veteran Democratic congressman in the 2020 primaries in Missouri. In her first term in Congress, she pushed for progressive policies and was one of the most vocal critics of Washington’s unconditional support of Israel.On Tuesday, she defeated her main challenger, State Senator Steve Roberts, by more than 40 percentage points. Roberts had toldJewish Insiderlast month that anti-Semitism and Israel are among “the most important issues at stake in this race”.In Michigan, Tlaib similarly defeated primary challenges with relative ease after facing an ad campaign by a pro-Israel group that was founded earlier this year with the main purpose of defeating her.“These folks are tainting our democracy and trying to come from the outside … into our communities to tell them how to think, how to feel and how to vote,” Tlaibtold Al Jazeeraon Tuesday.“Many of my residents understand that I put them first.”Both Bush and Tlaib are expected to cruise to re-election in their safe Democratic districts in November."
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/12/will-escalating-violence-in-the-middle-east-affect-the-us-elections,Will escalating violence in the Middle East affect the US elections ...,2 days ago ... Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris's continued support for Israel's war in Gaza.,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris’s continued support for Israel’s war in Gaza.With the United Statespresidential electionless than four weeks away, analysts caution that Israel’sexpanding military campaignsacross the Middle East could bruise the chances of the Democratic candidate, Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Foreign policy is rarely a top priority for US voters. But Israel’s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign inLebanon, have spurred questions about the US’s role in the conflict.The administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters — particularly Arab Americans — turning against the party.With Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.“This is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,” Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Now party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.”Much of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, which has erasedentire neighbourhoodsand killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.That campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in USweapons assistance.“It’s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they’ve allowed to happen,” said Zogby.“There’s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don’t matter.”ASeptember pollby the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.That figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, hissupportamong Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.Biden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.When Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old’s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.But Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series ofescalatory strikesby Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.In a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”The Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August’sDemocratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.“People are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won’t give it to them,” said Zogby. “They’re making a mistake that will cost them votes.”While US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.Many of those voters are concentrated in a small number ofswing statesthat play an outsized role in deciding the country’s presidential elections.The Midwestern battleground state ofMichigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.Polling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.And her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.“The situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,” said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.“Since we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state’s Arab community stays home on election day,” he added.But Michigan’s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.Some believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.Others view a second term for Trump, apro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should “finish the job” in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.One group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is theUncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.During primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote “uncommitted”, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.Now, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris — but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.“As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,” a spokesperson said in a video released this week.“But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”The final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.In early October, for instance, Iran launched aballistic missile attackagainst Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehin Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.On that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.Analysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.ASeptember pollby the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.Respondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel’s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.Laura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.“Republican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they’re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,” Silver said.She pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza — and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.A February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.But Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such asyoung peopleand communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.“The pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,” he said. “The Democratic Party hasn’t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren’t listening, and they’ll pay a price for that.”"

We’ll break it down, along with major updates from the campaign trail.With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into overdrive, with last-minute appeals to voters.Need a quick breakdown of the week’s biggest political news? Look no further.We’ll get you up to speed with five key takeaways from the past seven days and an overview of where the candidates stand in the polls.There are 23 days left before the November 5 election.As of October 11, the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows Vice President Kamala Harris up by 2.5 points, with 48.5 percent support compared to former President Donald Trump’s 46 percent.Another polling average, from the website 270toWin, shows Harris again with a marginal lead, with 49.3 percent support. Trump, meanwhile, is at 46.5 percent.Harris, the Democrat, could be poised to flip one of Trump’s key demographics: suburban voters.On October 10, the news agency Reuters and the market research poll Ipsos released a poll that showed Harris led her Republican rival 47 percent to 41 among suburbanites.But two days later, The New York Times and Siena College released a poll that indicated Harris could be slipping among Black voters. She pulled in 78 percent support — a drop from the estimated 90 percent support her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, earned in 2020.Within three days of forming in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Milton had billowed into a powerful Category 5 storm, earning the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Such rapid development had rarely been seen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton “one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin”.And it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.But as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.Swaths of the US South were still recovering from September’sHurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas”.On the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Bidenslapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.“Over the last few weeks, there’s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what’s going on,” Biden said, calling the distortions “un-American”.“Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,” he added.Harris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. “This is not a time for people to play politics,” she said, in reference to the Republican.Once criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of arecent media blitz.It was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.And even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.But in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.And her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.That last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.But host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing “shifting explanations”, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.The friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to “make her look better”.He also called on the Federal Communications Commission to “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE”. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission’s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.Through much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large — even dooming one candidate’s run.After a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a “weak” and “sleepy” old man.But at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.Those questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump’s “rambling” and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.And then, on Saturday, the White House released amemotouting hisDemocratic rival’s health.The 59-year-old Harris, it read, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency”.Trump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with astatement, arguing that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung wrote of Trump.On the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.Immigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump’s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.But critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.On Monday, Trumprecorded an audio interviewwith the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump said. “Now a murderer, I believe this: It’s in their genes. And we’ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”The Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.Speaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to “expedite the removal” of “savage gangs” from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.He also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.Despite Trump’s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.Reporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.In 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician’s eventual resignation.Since then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse ofTrump’s alleged relationshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.In its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.News outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book’s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump’s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an “angry, little man”.“None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,” Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.But the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley — once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.He tells Woodward in the book that Trump is “fascist to the core”."

The Democrat led 52 percent to 46 percent in the same poll last month.The latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51 percent to 48 percent among likely voters, compared with a four-point advantage last month.Following the latest figures, Harris holds a 1.4 percent point lead in Real Clear Polling’s aggregate of major polls, slipping from 2.2 percent on Saturday.The tightening poll numbers come amid concerns among Democrats that Harris is failing to shore up support among Hispanics and African Americans, two of the party’s key constituencies.While Harris is leading among women of all races, she has struggled to drum up enthusiasm among men, including African Americans and Hispanics, who have increasingly gravitated towards Trump in recent years.In The New York Times/Siena College polls released on Saturday and Sunday, Harris attracted the support of 78 percent of Black voters and 56 percent of Hispanic voters – significantly lower shares than won by the Democratic nominees in the 2020 and 2016 elections.On Thursday, former President Barack Obama admonished Black men for not showing as much enthusiasm for Harris’s candidacy as he had received during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012.“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama said at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of seven key battleground states expected to decide the election.“Because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”Harris and Trump on Sunday continued to focus their campaigns on the battleground states, holding events in North Carolina and Arizona, respectively.At a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris took aim at Trump for spreading misinformation about the government’s response to recent hurricanes.“The problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it’s making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they’re led to believe they cannot trust,” Harris said.“And that’s the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.”Trump, meanwhile, used a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona to call for the hiring of 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents.“After I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10 percent raise – they haven’t had one in a long time – for all agents and a $10,000 each retention and signing bonus,” Trump said. “We’re going to retain them.”"

All the results are within the margin of error with the exception of Nevada, where Trump is led by 5 percent in the WSJ poll.The newspaper said it surveyed 600 registered voters per state between September 28 and October 8.US elections are not won by popular vote nationwide. Rather, candidates compete in individual states to winelectoral college votes.It’s akin to a point system, where each state is worth a number of points proportionate to the size of its population. In all but two states – Maine and Nebraska – the winner takes all the electoral college votes.Most states are almost certain to go to one party. For example, a Democratic win in California and Vermont is often projected as soon as the polls close, while states like Oklahoma and Alabama are Republican strongholds.That leaves a handful of states where there are close, competitive elections. These are known asswing states. In this round, all eyes are on the seven states polled by WSJ.In 2016, Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote because he defeated the Democratic candidateHillary Clintonin most battleground states.According to a Pew Research Centersurveyreleased on Friday, Harris is leading the race nationally by one point – 48 percent to Trump’s 47 percent.US election poll results have fluctuated in recent months. While Trump enjoyed a solid lead overJoe Bidenearlier this year in almost all polls, the Democrats received a boost after the US president stepped aside and was replaced by Harris as the party’s nominee.A Morning Consult poll in September had Harris beating Trump 51 percent to 46 percent. But the former president appeared to claw back some support amid concerns about the economy and the turmoil inthe Middle East.US election polls have also been wide off the mark in the past. For example, many surveys had indicated that Clinton was set for a comfortable win when she lost toTrump in 2016.Still, this year various polls appear to agree that the US is heading to a close presidential election next month.Control of the Senate and House of Representatives will also be up for grabs on November 5.A New York Times poll on Friday predicted bad news for Democrats’ hopes of protecting their narrow majority in the Senate.The Democrats currently control the 100-member chamber with 51 seats, including four independents who caucus with the party.But the Times survey found that Democrats are likely to lose a potentially decisive seat in a Republican-leaning state.Republicans were already expected to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia – where conservative Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.But the Times poll indicated Democratic Senator Jon Tester is trailing his Republican opponent by eight percentage points in rural Montana, where Trump won with ease in 2016 and 2020.Democrats will also have a fight on their hands to keep Senate seats in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and Nevada, but they will be hoping to challenge Republican incumbents in Texas and Florida.A Republican-controlled Senate can prove to be a major hurdle for Harris should she win in November.Beyond its legislative powers, the Senate is tasked with confirmingjudicial appointmentsand cabinet members, which would allow Republicans to pressure Harris, should she be elected, on who she chooses for her governing team."

Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier ...",28 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier under Biden.Mumbai, India –Parneesh Mehta’s diamond jewellery business may be performing much better than many other companies around the world suffering from the crushing force of lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.But the entrepreneur based in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, says that is little consolation for the revenue he has lost because of tariff hikes on the gems and jewellery sector in his biggest export market – the United States.In April 2019, the US withdrew India and Turkey from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), an import duty exemption on certain goods – including Mehta’s jewels – that require a lot of manpower to make, from developing countries.“That really hurt us,” Mehta told Al Jazeera. “We had to adjust our prices for some of our clients. For others, we dropped the quality of the gems.”With both exporters and importers feeling the pinch, Mehta says the added tax will prevent businesses from growing. “Everyone’s getting squeezed,” he said. “If the GSP was restored, there’s no doubt it would help the sector as a whole”.Mehta’s experience is one example of how the India-US economic relationship has changed under the administration of US President Donald Trump. And why many Indian entrepreneurs like him have a keen interest in who occupies the White House after the November 3 US elections.Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the US’s trade deficit with India, which stood at $28.8bn in 2019, nearly three times the $10.6bn figure in 2008. In March 2019, he called India “a very high-tariff nation” and has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to redress the gap. India later retaliated, raising duties on 28 US products.Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have famously enjoyed afriendly rapport, but analysts say Trump’s punitive policies have made the economic environment more contentious. The two sides have repeatedlyfailed to signeven a “mini trade deal” that had initially been expected in September 2019.“There’s been a lot of positive engagement, but in reality, we are far from getting anything ratified,” Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi told Al Jazeera.This could change if Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, becomes the next US president and brings with him a more measured policymaking machine.“A Biden administration would not necessarily back down on big-ticket requests,” says Dhar, referring to the US’s push for greater access to India’s agriculture, medical device and e-commerce markets, and even for lower import tariffs on Harley Davidson motorbikes.“But we’d be unlikely to see the same aggression towards trade partners. This could lead to a better outcome for Indian negotiators”.Trump’s trade policies and negotiating stance may be based on populist impulses, but India is also taking an increasingly protectionist line.India’s incoming data protection bill has become one of the thorniest issues in negations.The bill threatens to prevent Indian data from leaving its shores, making life difficult for global technology giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google that rely on the free-flow of data.It also threatens to tax digital companies in a way that would also disproportionately affect US technology firms. The US has called this type of taxation “unfair” and “discriminatory” and has said it will “begin investigations” into how its trading partners are implementing such laws.After its economy suffered a historic shock (gross domestic product shrank by a record 23.9 percent in the April-June quarter), exacerbating an urgent need to create more blue- and white-collar jobs, analysts say India cannot afford to close itself off from negotiating a more favourable US trading relationship.“India needs to recognise that a trade relationship with the US is extremely beneficial for economic growth,” Anupam Manur, a research fellow at the Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately though, we may see nationalistic jingo and political point-scoring continue to take the upper hand”.However, recent investments by Facebook and Google in Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, could drive a change of mindset.Reliance is India’s largest and most influential company. With two major US tech giants taking a seat each on its board, analysts say this could strengthen the hand of US companies lobbying the Indian government to liberalise a wide range of issues governing India’s digital platforms.For this reason “I wouldn’t rule out a policy U-turn,” said JNU’s Dhar.But, regardless of the outcome of the US election, analysts believe progress on a trade agreement will hinge on the US securing greater access to India’s huge, yet fragmented, agricultural markets.India, however, is reluctant to endanger its mostly small-scale, independent producers by forcing them to compete with giant US agribusinesses. And with the global economic downturn set to drag on, as well as a strong farming lobby to placate at home, observers say a future Biden administration would likely take a hard line similar to Trump’s.September’shistoric changes to India’s farm laws, which will open up produce markets to private players, could also complicate matters. “Farmers already have apprehensions about these ordinances,” said Dhar. “Allowing American access on top of that means the situation could become very problematic”.With US unemployment at a high 8.4 percent and the country experiencing the toughest economic conditions since the Great Depression, analysts say there may be little political room for either of the two contenders to deviate from the US’s existing – and increasingly nativist – trade policies.“Let’s remember that Biden also has a ‘Made in America’ plan and has made an effort to appear tough on China,” explained Takshashila Institution’s Manur. “His talk of subsidising industry, which is against the World Trade Organisation rules, tells me he will also be protectionist”.The White House’s recent announcement of plans to reduce the number of visas awarded to skilled workers by a third is one such area where Biden’s hands may be tied.Last year, 74.5 percent of so-called H1-B visas were claimed by Indians, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, plugging a shortage of highly skilled labour in the US’s technology industries. High-profile Indian CEOs such as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Google’s parent Alphabet have also played an outsized role in contributing to Silicon Valley’s success.Despite this, Indians look set to miss out on future opportunities.“Like with the 2008 global financial crisis, the immigration issue has become mixed up in the feelings surrounding the downturn,” says Dhar. “[Biden] will eventually re-look at visa policies once the economy rebounds, but not before that”.But a change of US leadership could mean a return to more nuanced, rules-based decision-making. Consequently, there are hopes in India that the Iran nuclear deal, originally signed under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and abandoned by Trump, will be back on the table.This would help India, which lost an important export market, a valuable source of cheap oil and a potential stake in a key port by complying with US sanctions. “Iran has always been a strategic ally in the region,” says Dhar. “I hope this situation would improve if a new administration comes in”.India is likely to remain a key ally for the US as geopolitical tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific region. In a speech during his visit to India earlier this year, Trump clubbed the two nations together as “powerful defenders of peace and liberty”, drawing a blunt contrast with China – the other great regional power. Biden too has said he would “stand with India”, promising to tackle terror threats in the region together.As the US decouples itself from China’s economy, India is trying to take its place. Modi has pitched India as a “trusted partner” and welcomed foreign direct investment. In reality, US businesses are reluctant to leave China or disrupt their supply chains; and for the few that do, India is unlikely to be their preferred destination.“At most, US companies are hedging, perhaps moving 30 percent of their operations to Vietnam or Laos – India is not attractive to companies yet,” said Takshashila Institution’s Manur. But the current reforms to labour and land laws, which would make it easier for foreign businesses to set up shop in India, could change that, he added.India’s attempts to supplant undemocratic China and take advantage of the US’s boycotts and bans of Chinese technology firms may also invite increased scrutiny of its own human rights record.US Democrats have indicated they will call out human rights abuses around the world. After India withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir – the region it administers in part while Pakistan administers the other – and imposed a military lockdown on its residents, Biden’s vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, reminded observers: “We are watching”, suggesting a potential sore spot in India-US relations.Harris has repeatedly shown that despite her being part Indian, she may not be an easy ally for the Modi government. After India’s external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar cancelled a meeting last year when the US House Affairs Committee refused to exclude Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal – a critic of India’s Kashmir policy – Harris actively defended Jayapal’s presence, ruffling diplomatic feathers in the process.But not everyone believes that such conversations would harm the India-US economic relationship. A trade policy expert wishing to remain anonymous told Al Jazeera: “Modi has a thick skin about these things. Any criticism of human rights will wash off his back”.Tish Sanghera is a journalist based in Mumbai, where she writes about economic, political and social issues. Twitter: @TishSanghera"

The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to the presidential election on ...,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"The move comes as Republicans increasingly emphasise the chance of noncitizen voting, despite little evidence of any significant risk posed.The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to thepresidential electionon November 5.The lawsuit, filed on Friday, comes in response to an executive order issued in August by Virginia’s Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin.It initiated the removal of individuals from voter registration rolls if officials are “unable to verify that they are citizens” through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.But the Justice Department says the executive order was issued with too little time before election day, violating a 90-day “quiet period” outlined in The National Voter Registration Act.That period requires official systematic removals at least three months ahead of a federal vote.“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Assistant US Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.“The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.”Youngkin had issued his order on August 7, which marked 90 days until the election. In a statement on Friday, the governor argued the executive order fell within the law.“Virginians – and Americans – will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy,” Youngkin said.He pledged state authorities “will defend these common-sense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us”.“Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period,” Youngkin said.Republicans and allies of former President Donald Trump – the current Republican candidate for the presidency – have increasingly pushedunfounded claimsof possible election malfeasance ahead of this year’s vote.Those claims echo falsehoods spread about the 2020 election, which Trump has continued to falsely say was “stolen” through fraud.Some Republican officials have also advanced baseless claims that noncitizens are voting in large enough numbers to affect the outcome. In the US, only citizens can vote.Most voter administration is determined by state officials and legislatures, with only broad parameters from the federal government. Nearly all US states require some form of voter registration to cast a ballot, although many allow the registration to be done on election day.Ahead of the 2024 elections, several states – including Texas, Tennessee, Ohio and Alabama – have passed measures requiring higher burdens of proof to show a voter’s citizenship. Democracy monitors said those efforts may disenfranchise US citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote.The Brennan Center for Justice – a non-partisan policy organisation – found that noncitizen voting in the US is exceedingly rare. There is no evidence it had any bearing on recent elections.In 2017, the centre releaseda studylooking at 23.5 million votes cast in the 2016 general election.Only 30 votes were flagged for suspected noncitizen voting. Data was not available on how many of those votes proved to have been cast by noncitizens."

All to know in 500 ...,"Sep 21, 2024 ... Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.",Last update 22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.Election day in the United States may still be several weeks away, but Americans in several parts of the country are getting a chance to cast their ballots already.In-person, advanced voting became possible in the US states of Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia this week while several other states opened up their mail-in voting processes earlier this month.Both are forms of “early voting”, a mainstay of US elections that in recent years has become a target offalse voter fraud accusations.Rights advocates say robust early voting opportunities help ensure more people can cast a ballot regardless of disability, time constraints, work, travel or other factors that could hamper them on election day, which this year is on November 5.Early voting also offers an opportunity to build enthusiasm: When Taylor Swift, who recentlyendorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, announced she would perform in Florida just before early voting begins there in October, local Democrats quickly seized on the moment.“Taylor is bringing the Eras Tour to Miami in the weekend leading up to early voting, and I look forward to seeing that energy play out in Florida!!!” the Miami-Dade Democratic Party said.Voting in US presidential elections is only broadly steered by the federal government. US states determine much of how the logistics of the vote plays out in their respective jurisdictions.Currently, every state in the country allows some form of early voting, with mail-in voting the most prevalent option.At least eight of the 50 states send all registered voters a ballot in the mail while 14 still require voters to provide a reason for why they need to cast their ballot – sometimes known as an “absentee ballot” – by mail.Most states also provide in-person voting before election day. Only three states do not.That depends on the year.In the 2020 election, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100 million voters cast their ballots before election day — representing about two-thirds of all Americans who voted that year, a record.Americans living abroad, members of the US military and people with disabilities are among the many who have traditionally chosen to vote early.A 2001 Supreme Court ruling upheld that voters did not need to provide a reason to cast an early ballot, as long as their state allows it.Early voting — in particular, mail-in voting — was at the centre of unfounded election fraud claims in 2020.That’s because Democrats have historically cast more votes by mail than Republicans, who are more likely to vote on election day. Many jurisdictions count votes cast in person before they begin counting mail-in votes although the process varies.That can create a “blue shift” or “red mirage”, in which early results in key states appear to initially show the Republican candidate leading, only to shift to the Democratic candidate as the mail-in votes are counted.In 2020, then-President Donald Trump falsely said the mail-in votingsystem was rife with fraud. The Republican ultimately lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, but he has continued to claim the vote was stolen from him.Many state legislaturesenactednew restrictions on early voting after the 2020 contest, including higher scrutiny for ballots cast by mail.But the Republican Party has more fully embraced early voting this year as Trump runs again against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris."

However, the requirement for official identification when voting can cause challenges for the homeless – obtaining a state-issued ID can be both complicated and costly.But, as political discussions take place in living rooms across the United States, Washington DC’s homeless community also engages in its own political discourse – equally as captivated by the ongoing presidential campaign as the wider public, according to Sheptock. “I do hear a lot of homeless people talking about politics … We’ve had some pretty energetic conversations about Trump versus Clinton.”He explains that free newspapers, televisions in homeless shelters and internet access in public libraries are invaluable sources of information on the presidential campaign.READ MORE: New York’s homeless left out in the coldFifty-one-year-old Tony Leonard has been living on the streets of DC since losing his job and subsequently his home in 2011. He says that the city’s homeless community is very politically active. “A lot of us [who are] homeless in DC are educated people who had lives before but lost everything.”Come November, Leonard will be voting for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, citing her political experience as his motive. As for her opponent, Republican candidate Donald Trump, “He’s a joke,” Leonard says. “I don’t think anyone thinks he’d make a good president.”Sheptock says he won’t be voting for Trump either. He tells Al Jazeera that he is torn between Green Party Leader Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton. “All I can say right now is that I plan to vote for a woman”.Yet, while the majority of homeless interviewed for this article expressed their support for Clinton, not all were averse to Trump’s message.Jeffrey McNeill claims to have worked as a doorman at Trump’s Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City for three years before he lost everything to gambling.He subsequently moved to Washington DC in 2007, where he would spend the next three years of his life sleeping on the pavement and in shelters. McNeill bought Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal, which he said changed his life forever.“It was the greatest book ever; it taught me about the economy, how to make deals, how to make money and how to get a job.” The book taught him to be a good businessman, he says.Ultimately, however, McNeill explains he feels let down by the Democratic administration. “I was a lifelong Democrat; I voted for Obama twice … but there are more homeless people in the city now than when I arrived. I did better under Republican presidents than I have done under Obama.”America’s hidden homeless: Life in the Starlight MotelMore than 500,000 people in the United States were without housing on any given night last year, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 2015 annualreport.In Washington DC,the number of homeless reached 7,298 in 2015.Experts say a lack of formal data on homeless voters means it is difficult to measure their electoral participation. However,statistically, people from lower-income backgrounds have been less likely to vote than those with higher incomes.“There are a good number of people experiencing homelessness who care about voting. It’s no different to the population at large,” said David Pirtle, a public education coordinator for the National Homeless Coalition, who has himself experienced homelessness.But, there are variations. People living in shelters or transitional housing are far more likely to vote than those with no form of accommodation at all, said Pirtle. “People who are literally living on the street probably have the lowest turnout because a lot of those folks are dealing with other serious issues apart from being homeless, for example, mental health [or] substance abuse.”Pirtle added that many of these individuals “may not be capable or interested in the process”.WATCH – Voters’ Rights: What’s Happening to American Democracy?David Lee Norris, 59, and his wife, Naomi Macmillan, 53, are among this group. Home for them is an underpass next to Washington DC’s Union Railway Station. Having both suffered from drug-addiction, they moved from their home in South Carolina in January in the hope of receiving better healthcare for Naomi, who is HIV-positive.Any assistance they receive comes from NGOs, not the government, according to Norris.“The government is doing nothing … they are the reason we are here,” he says. “That’s why I’m not voting.”Obtaining information on voting procedures is very much down to the individual, which can be an extra challenge for those experiencing homelessness, said Julian Johannesen, director of research and training at Nonprofit Vote.“The government does not help anyone to vote here; you don’t even know where the registration form is,” Johannesen tells Al Jazeera. “People who are already under enormous stress and … have bigger priorities that occupy their attention can benefit from having some help getting over the administrative hurdles.”Ken Martin, has been homeless in Washington DC since 2012, and while he will be voting in November, he agrees that for many homeless, it is a challenge.“When you are worrying about whether or not you’re going to have a roof over your head or a place to eat or a place to get a shower, you’re not thinking about who’s going to be in the Oval Office – you’re thinking about just making it through the day,” says the 62-year-old.For the women at Washington DC’s N Street Village, a shelter and recovery centre for homeless and low-income women, lively discussions on the elections are commonplace. Hillary Clinton’s healthcare policies feature particularly high on the agenda during such conversations.“She’s interested in women’s care, mental health … She’s determined to make sure that women are well-taken care of when she gets to the White House,” says Mary, who lost everything after health problems led to costly and unmanageable medical bills and asked to be identified using a pseudonym.Cheryl Barnes, meanwhile, who has previously been homeless for 30 years, after suffering from substance and alcohol abuse, says the N Street Village saved her, and come November, she’ll also be voting for Hillary Clinton.Another resident at the N Street Village, Julia Miller, says she doesn’t align with any particular party. “I like Trump,’ says Miller who has been living at the shelter for five years. “[He] has an economic plan for the country, and I think … he’ll bring more jobs to the United States.”When it came to voting, Miller said that people should not be stereotyped because of their economic situation. “Everyone should be allowed to vote, that’s how homeless people get legislative action to …change the situation and access more resources.”She said that no matter which candidate becomes president, she wants them to provide more resources for the homeless.In the future, there needs to be a more focused campaign about voting, according to Pirtle.“We spend a lot of money in this country to get the general population to vote,” he says. “We shouldn’t leave our homeless neighbours aside.”Voting can also have a very positive emotional effect, he adds. “The general feeling [people] can get living on the street is that they are isolated, that they don’t have a voice, but getting people to participate in the electoral process … can have a very beneficial effect on their morale.”Sitting in the cool foyer of the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library, Sheptock emphasises that the space has become a sanctuary for many of the homeless community wanting to escape the city’s blistering summer heat. Ultimately, he wants people to vote no matter what their circumstance.“If you don’t vote, then you can’t fuss and nag about what the politicians do,” he says. “If you do vote, that earns you the right to complain about what government does.”Follow Jessica Sarhan on Twitter@JessicaSarhan"

This isShereena Qazi, taking over from Joseph Stepansky.The outcome of the presidential elections will have little effect on US-Europe trade relations, France’s finance chief asserted, saying Washington is unlikely to drop its confrontational stance whether Trump wins or not.The US administration has inflicted billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on European imports over the past four years, with Trump claiming unfair barriers against American firms trying to compete on continental markets.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has repeated his country’s stance on the US presidential race, saying it is not important who wins but what actions the next president takes towards sanctions on Iran.“What is important for us is that America returns to respecting the Iranian nation. We want respect instead of sanctions, no matter who is [in office]. If he lifts the unfair and illegal sanctions and replaces them with respect, then our situation will be different,” Rouhani said in a televised speech.4 Nov 2020 - 12:32 GMTGerman Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warns the US is facing a “very explosive situation” and a possible systemic crisis after Trump prematurely declared election victory.Following Trump’s remarks that he will go to the Supreme Court to stop ballots from being tallied, Kramp-Karrenbauer told public broadcaster ZDF: “This election has not been decided … votes are still being counted.”She said Trump could create “a constitutional crisis in the USA”, calling such a scenario “something that must deeply concern us”.Despite incomplete results from several battleground states that could determine the outcome of the US presidential race, Trump prematurely claimed victory over Biden.The move confirmed worries that Trump would seek to dispute the election results.Read morehereabout the different ways the election can be contested.The Associated Press news agency has not declared a winner in Wisconsin’s presidential contest because the race between Trump and Biden is too early to call.Trump, who is locked in a tight battle with Biden to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win, prematurely claimed early on Wednesday that he was “winning” the state.Biden is ahead of Trump by fewer than 8,000 votes out of nearly 3.2 million cast.Gold fell more than 1 percent as the dollar emerged as the favoured safe haven from a much closer presidential race than investors expected following Trump’s strong performance in some swing states.Spot gold fell 1.1 percent to $1,887.76 an ounce by 11:02 GMT. US gold futures dropped 1.2 percent to $1,888.The dollar rose 0.2 percent against major currencies.Chinese social media users watched election day in the US with bemusement and mockery, as Trump complained of a “major fraud on our nation” and prematurely claimed victory.“Whether he wins or loses, his final mission is to destroy the appearance of American democracy,” one user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform wrote.“Let Trump be re-elected and take the US downhill,” another wrote.Relations between China and the US are at their worst in decades over disputes ranging from technology and trade to Hong Kong and the coronavirus, and the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of sanctions against Beijing.Biden’s campaign manager called Trump’s call for vote counting to stop “outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect”.“It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens,” said Biden’s campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon.“It was unprecedented because never before in our history has a president of the United States sought to strip Americans of their voice in a national election.“And it was incorrect because it will not happen. The counting will not stop. It will continue until every duly cast vote is counted.”The AP news agency issued a bulletin saying it is not calling the presidential race yet, despite Trump’s claims of victory, because neither candidate has secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win.Speaking from the White House at 02:30 ET, Trump said: “Frankly, we did win this election.”The president said he would go to the Supreme Court to stop the counting of mail ballots.“His assertion of victory does not match the results and information currently available to the AP,” the news service reported.Several key states are too early to call, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan the agency said.Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland has sent this report from Tucson, Arizona.Democrat Mark Kelly has won a US Senate seat for Arizona, beating Republican Martha McSally for the seat once held by Senator John McCain, who died in August 2018.“Tonight is not about celebrating, tonight is about getting to work,” Kelly told a small crowd in Tucson earlier in the evening.He spoke about the hardships Arizonans have faced owing to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying many small businesses are in peril in the southwest state.The Democrat leader said he would strive for policies to set back Trump’s crackdown on immigration, lowering healthcare costs and the need to “rebuild the economy – and it’s going to be a massive undertaking”.A centrist Democrat and former astronaut, Kelly first opened a large lead over McSally as the vote counting got under way in the southwest state.4 Nov 2020 - 08:05 GMTAl Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this report from Raleigh, North Carolina.At 2:30am (07:30 GMT), the presidential race in North Carolina was still too close to call.Trump was leading Biden by about 76,700 votes, with 95 percent of expected votes counted.According to the State Board of Elections, roughly 117,000 absentee ballots have not yet been returned.Those ballots, if postmarked by Election Day, can still be counted if they arrive by November 12.The close race did not stop Trump from prematurely declaring “a big win in North Carolina” during televised remarks early on Wednesday morning.Democrat Mark Kelly defeats Republican Senator Martha McSally in Arizona’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency.Democratic presidential Biden and senate candidate Kelly have been declared the winners in Arizona, according to the AP news agency.The win gives Biden 11 votes in the Electoral College that Trump had won in 2016.🇺🇸 Biden wins Arizona 🗳️ Live results 👉 https://aje.io/c33haPosted byAl Jazeera EnglishonTuesday, November 3, 2020Cindy McCain, the widow of late Senator John McCain, a Republican, had endorsed Biden.Biden got strong support from voters in the Phoenix area, Maricopa County, where the majority of the state’s population resides.Read morehere4 Nov 2020 - 07:46 GMTPresident Trump prematurely claims victory in the presidential election, before vote counting has ended, and suggested Democrats were engaged in fraud as key states continued to count hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots.“This is a fraud on the American public.

He also predicted a “big” win for himself.We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 4, 2020Twitter labelled his tweet as making a “potentially misleading claim about an election”.Trump’s tweets came immediately after a statement from Biden, who said he was optimistic about his prospects of winning.Biden spoke from Delaware shortly after midnight, saying he is optimistic he is going to win the US presidential election.“We knew this was going to go long … but look, we feel good about where we are. We believe we are on track to win this election,” Biden said.“It ain’t over ‘til every vote is counted, every ballot is counted.“We are confident about Arizona … We’re also just calling for Minnesota and we are still in the game in Georgia … And we are feeling really good about Wisconsin and Michigan … We are going to win in Pennsylvania. Keep the faith guys, we are going to win this.”Shortly after Biden gave an election night speech, Trump tweeted he would speak tonight.Florida and its 29 electoral votes were a must-win for Trump. If he wound up losing there, it would have significantly narrowed his path to 270 electoral votes.Early indications are that Trump, although losing Miami-Dade, the most populous county in Florida, improved his vote total there, from 2016. Florida political experts are crediting Trump’s improvement with Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade with helping him to victory.At the beginning of the evening, we listed Florida as one of the “super seven” states that if Biden flipped early on, it would have signalled a potentially clear path for him. The other six states on that list – Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and Iowa – are still too close to call. Biden’s clear path is much muddier now after Florida lands in Trump’s column.Our analysis still holds true: If Biden can win two of those six, especially two large states, it makes it that much more difficult for Trump to hit 270. But given the close counts in those other states, as well as the other Trump 2016 states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – we are in for an extremely long night or, perhaps, another long day tomorrow waiting for final results.Read morehereThe AP has called Montana and Iowa for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump 9 more electoral votes.The AP has called Ohio for the Republican Party, giving Trump 18 electoral votes.Biden is set to speak at 00:30 ET from Wilmington, Delaware, according to his campaign.While key Democratic-leaning cities like Detroit, Michigan and Philadelphia have halted counting, Trump’s team “have started to feel optimistic given the fact that they went into this knowing that Joe Biden had a substantial lead”.Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont filed this report from PennsylvaniaOn Election Night, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said counting the state’s millions of ballots will take time and asked voters to be patient. Voters returned a record-breaking 2.5 million mail ballots across the state, but by law, it could not start counting them until the morning of Election Day.“Counting that tremendous number of ballots will, again, take longer than we’re used to, but the extra time is just there because we want to make sure our election system is working and that each and every vote is counted,” Wolf said.“We may not know the results today, as a result, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath and, as I’ve been saying, just be patient. What’s most important is that we have accurate results and that every vote is counted, even if that takes a little longer.”By midnight local time, about 50 percent of Pennsylvania’s votes had been counted and Trump was ahead in the race.The AP news agency has called Minnesota for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 10 more electoral votes.The AP news agency has called Hawaii for the Democratic Party, giving Biden four more electoral votes.4 Nov 2020 - 04:44 GMTReynolds, reporting from Los Angeles, says Arizona could be one of the surprises of the night.“It has not been called yet, but it’s looking good for Joe Biden,” Reynolds said. “And this is extraordinary because Arizona is formerly a rock-ribbed Republican state … it hasn’t gone for a Democratic President since … 1996.”Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer filed this report from Kenosha, WisconsinAs polls close in Wisconsin, a local pizzeria is ground zero for Kenosha’s Republicans.Complete with Fox News streaming across two televisions and a cardboard cutout of the president at the door, a long table filled with various pies bisects the mask-less crowd watching the earliest results roll in.Sheila Dissmore, 57, opted to vote in person on Tuesday.“Being a full-blown patriot, I feel like it’s just extra special voting on [election] day,” she says. “Just seeing how raw and unedited the president I think is refreshing.”Living on Kenosha’s south side with her 92-year-old father through the pandemic, this summer’s civil unrest caused Dissmore to double down on her Republican beliefs.“For the first time in my life, having to lock my door, close the shutters, close everything, turn the drapes and having my father there – I’m not a gun owner, but I wish I was.”Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith has defeated Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi’s Senate race, according to the AP news agency.Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock will advance to a runoff in Georgia’s special US Senate election, the AP projects.Since no candidate in the 21-candidate field received 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off on January 5, with the winner being sworn in immediately thereafter.It is projected Loeffler edged out Republican US Representative Doug Collins to land in the top two.This is significant in that the Republicans’ Senate majority may hang in the balance until January if neither is able to claim a majority after the rest of tonight’s races are projected.Worth noting as we wait for the final projection on too-close-to-call North Carolina: Biden had not visited the state since October 18, making it one of the few key battlegrounds where he did not campaign in the final sprint.His running mate Kamala Harris did make four stops over two days in that period.For his part, Trump made five visits to North Carolina between October 21 and Election Day.Republican Roger Marshall has defeated Democrat Barbara Bollier in Kansas’s Senate race.Republican Senator James Risch has defeated Democrat Paulette Jordan in Idaho’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley has defeated Republican Jo Rae Perkins in Oregon’s Senate race.The AP has called Utah for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump six more electoral votes.4 Nov 2020 - 04:05 GMTAP has called New Hampshire for the Democratic Party, giving Joe Biden four more electoral votes.The AP calls Idaho for the Republican Party, giving Trump four more electoral votes.The AP has called California, Oregon and Washington state for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 74 more electoral votes.It is 23:00 ET (04:00 GMT) and the last polls have closed in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this reportThe Pennsylvania Commonwealth Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said there have been no serious voting issues in the state.“I’m happy to report that today’s election in the Commonwealth went remarkably smoothly,” she told reporters. “We have no major or widespread events to report … No reports of violence at any polling places today,” Boockvar added. “There were a few reports of voters feeling intimidated that were resolved by calls to the counties.”Overall, Boockvar said her team at the voter information hotline answered 5,000 calls, mostly standard issues such as late-opening polls and lines at some polling stations.Other reported issues included: an individual accidentally shooting himself in Northampton County and then driving himself to the hospital; a volunteer with the Pennsylvania Democrats being shot with a paintball gun from a moving vehicle. Boockvar said this happened right before the polls closed, without elaborating. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit on behalf of Spanish-speaking voters who were not provided language access in York, Pennsylvania.Texas “is still pretty close”, Zhou-Castro reported from Houston, Texas.“Normally by this time of night on election night pundits would have called Texas already for the Republican candidate,” She said “[But the fact that] votes are coming in and Joe Biden is still within reach of overtaking Trump … is making headlines in the state.”The AP has called Missouri for the Republican Party, giving Trump 10 more electoral votes.“This state plays a huge role in presidential elections … Donald Trump looks like he is forging ahead in this state potentially with an even wider lead than he had over Hillary Clinton,” Gallacher reported from Miami Florida.“Donald Trump really does need to win this, the largest of all the battleground states, with 29 electoral college votes.”He added that Biden “has other options to the White House including places like Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, but at the moment we are getting pretty close to this state being called.”“There is some pressure now from the Trump campaign for officials to call it, and they already tweeted out ‘Trump has won Florida’, but that is not official yet … [but] it does look like Donald Trump may take Florida which is what he actually needs to do,” he said.Not unexpectedly, Republican Tommy Tuberville has been projected as the winner of the US Senate race in Alabama, defeating Doug Jones.Tuberville, a former college football coach, was significantly outraised by Jones, but Alabama is a deeply Republican state and the outcome wasn’t in question.Jones won a special election in 2017 to replace Republican Jeff Sessions, who resigned his seat to become Trump’s attorney general. Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore, who had faced allegations of sexual misconduct.Moore ran against Tuberville and others in the Republican primary this year, but to the relief of Republicans, Tuberville won the nomination setting them on the path to reclaim the seat.4 Nov 2020 - 03:15 GMTRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been re-elected for a second term in the US House of Representatives.The rising star in the Democratic Party was easily re-elected in New York’s 14th congressional district. Ocasio-Cortezmade historyin 2018 as the youngest woman elected to Congress in US history at the age of 28, championing her working-class and Puerto Rican roots. She is the daughter of a cleaner and a father who died in his 40s.Serving NY-14 and fighting for working class families in Congress has been the greatest honor, privilege, & responsibility of my life.Thank you to the Bronx & Queens for re-electing me to the House despite the millions spent against us, & trusting me to represent you once more.https://t.co/MXG2Z2DV2F— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)November 4, 2020Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the so-called “Squad” of four freshman progressive Democratic congresswomen that includes Rashida Tlaib from Detroit, Ilhan Omar from Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley from Boston.The four represent a new emerging faction of young, progressive politicians who are pushing the established House leadership of the Democratic Party.South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham survived a re-election scare defeating well-funded Democrat Jaime Harrison.Democrats were extremely encouraged by the polls last month showing Harrison making the race much more competitive than expected in deeply Republican South Carolina.But pro-Trump Graham, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee shepherded Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, was able to pull out a victory tonight.The AP has called Kansas for the Republican Party giving Trump six more electoral votes.It is 22:00 ET (03:00GMT) and the polls have closed in Montana, Utah, Nevada and Iowa.Democrat John Hickenlooper defeated Republican Senator Cory Gardner in Colorado’s US Senate race, according to a projection from the Associated Press news agency.This is the first Republican Senate seat picked up by the Democrats tonight in their quest to take control of the Senate.Currently, Republicans have a 53-47 majority. Democrats need to net three seats to take over the Senate if Joe Biden wins the presidency, or four if Trump wins. The vice president is the tie-breaking vote and if Biden wins, Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaker in a 50-50 Senate.If Trump wins, Mike Pence would be the tie-breaking vote if the Senate ends up 50-50.“There is silence out of the Biden camp at the moment,” said Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna from Wilmington, Delaware. “All are simply watching the results and the ongoing analysis of what is happening, but nobody is breaking cover at the moment, the situation is so close, so absolutely tense in a number of states, that nobody wants to come up and make any calls at this particular point in time.”“Joe Biden said it very clearly early on in the afternoon that when he got something to say, he will come out and he will say it and very clearly this instruction has gone down to his staff, we heard very little from the Biden campaign headquarters… We understand that Joe Biden himself is still at his home here in Wilmington, Delaware in a few hours time he will come to the convention centre with his vice president nominee Kamala Harris,” he said.The AP has called Colorado for the Democratic Party, giving Biden nine more electoral votes.Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey, reporting from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania said the state is in for a long count.“The polls have only just closed in Pennsylvania and in addition to all of the ballots that were cast today, the state now has to count some two and a half million mail-in ballots, and that is only just beginning that process … which can only begin on election day by Pennsylvania law,” she said.“So this could take a while, officials are predicting it might be before the end of the week before we have really clear results, but it’s interesting to point out that Democrats returned nearly three times as many mail-in ballots as Republicans did that’s maybe why President Trump has been very worried about those mail-in ballots,” she said. “He has been attempting to discredit or delegitimise those mail-in ballots, so we had an issue earlier in the day where a judge expressed concern about some missing mail-in ballots and has ordered about two dozens mail processing centres to be searched for possible missing ballots.”People across the United States have voted in one of the most polarising presidential elections in the country’s history – and the race is also playing out on social media.The #Vote2020 and #ElectionDay hashtags are trending in most countries on Twitter, as the world closely follows the hard-fought matchup between Trump and Biden on Tuesday.Read morehere.Trying to balance out all that#ElectionDaystress eating…pic.twitter.com/zU9wlM30kg— Sierra Club (@SierraClub)November 3, 2020The AP has called the District of Columbia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three more electoral votes.The governor of Pennsylvania has confirmed the vote count in the battleground state will take longer than expected, amid a surge in mail-in voting.Pennsylvania does not start counting mail voting until Election Day and will accept ballots postmarked by November 3 for three days after. Some districts have said they will not start counting mail votes until Wednesday morning.PA Governor Tom Wolf says vote count will take longer than normal (this was anticipated due to the high volume of mail ballots)“We may not know the results today, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath.""

Lawyers for Democrats then requested that eight additional sites also stay open later.The judge granted both requests and said anyone in line at 8pm local time (04:00 GMT) would be allowed to cast a ballot.The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada shared a list of the Clark County polling sites that will stay open later.🗳️🗳️ TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO VOTE 🗳️🗳️Some Clark County polling locations have added an hour of voting tonight.

Trump won all but New Hampshire in 2016. And there are some signs in the exit polls and the vote count that show some early positive signs for Trump and Biden in different states.In Florida, Trump is keeping Biden’s margin of victory down in Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county.In North Carolina and Ohio, exit polls suggest Biden is receiving more support among suburban voters than Trump did in 2016.The Associated Press, which is one of several US media organization making calls, waits until a significant number of votes have been counted, while also analysing exit polling data, in competitive states before they make projections.Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from New Hanover CountyTrump supporters in North Carolina were energised at polling stations across the beach town of Wilmington. They were confident New Hanover County, where Wilmington is located, and the state will go red.“Trump has done a lot,” Char Marker said. “He’s done a lot of things to tackle our child sex trafficking problem that we have, which is huge to me.“I am a pro-life voter. And, you know, Trump has been one of the most pro-life presidents we’ve had yet. They say Trump is kind of like a party of his own. And if that’s the case, I’m in that party.”Across town, 22-year-old Brandon Panameno said he voted for Trump because he is not the “typical politician”.“The economy has been doing well” under Trump, he said. “I think he has a pretty good chance of winning again.”Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from rural Kenosha county, WisconsinIn rural Kenosha, Trump signs abound but not everyone is on board. In the village of Bristol, in central Kenosha county, a short line of voters are waiting to enter Bristol Village Hall where voting booths are delineated by yellow and orange traffic cones strung together with yellow rope.Tony Chacon, who moved to Bristol nine years ago from Kenosha, had just completed voting. “It’s better over here on this side of the Interstate. I feel a lot safer,” the 26-year-old said.“I’m in trade work so I’m big on keeping work in the United States,” he told Al Jazeera of his decision to vote for Trump. “He’s a businessman … someone who knows how money moves and how to move it,” said Chacon.For him, when Biden was vice president, “things were getting rough when it comes to prices of fuel.” He added that ultimately “our choices aren’t really the best” before turning to greet fellow Bristol resident, Brian Chwaszczewski, 33, who had also just voted.While he was reluctant to name the candidate he voted for, Chwaszczewski did say that “being out here in more of a rural area, I’m sure there [are] plenty of Trump supporters. I just wanted to kind of not support that.” He feels like something of an outlier in his community. “It’s Trump signs everywhere,” he said, as darkness set in.Democratic Senator Chris Coons defeated Republican Lauren Witzke in Delaware’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Dick Durbin defeated Republican Mark Curran in Illinois’ Senate race.Democratic Senator Ed Markey defeated Republican Kevin O’Connor in Massachusetts’ Senate race.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated Republican Corky Messner in New Hampshire’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Cory Booker defeated Republican Rik Mehta in New Jersey’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Jack Reed defeats Republican Allen Waters in Rhode Island’s Senate race.Republican Senator Mitch McConnell has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath in Kentucky’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency.The AP has called for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 69 electoral votes.The AP calls Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee for the Republican Party, giving Trump 33 electoral votes.It is 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Washington, DC.The AP calls South Carolina for the Republican Party, giving Trump 9 electoral votes.Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from Wilmington, North CarolinaPolls started to close in North Carolina where voters from both parties expressed optimism all day.Michael Master said he was hopeful Trump would pull out another victory in the state.“As a person, Trump puts Americans first,” Master said at a polling location in Wilmington. “And he puts especially the average American worker first.”Across the parking lot, Biden supporter Nick Rhodes said he was confident Biden would win.“We need to bring our country back together in terms of getting rid of division, and start embracing science and start bringing people together because we cannot have another four years of this,” he said.A handful of precincts in the state will stay open later because of delayed openings. We are expecting to see results from early and absentee voting to start rolling in within the next hour. In-person results will follow later this evening.The Trump campaign and Nevada Republicans are asking a state court judge to extend voting by one hour at 22 Las Vegas-area polling locations, according to the Associated Press news agency and Nevada Independent newspaperAn Election Day lawsuit filed in Clark County claims the 22 voting locations did not open on time. It was getting an immediate hearing before Judge Joe Hardy.“If immediate action is not taken, appellants will never have the opportunity to vindicate their rights,” attorneys for the two groups wrote in the filing. “More troubling, Nevadans – and the rest of the country – will be left wondering whether the results of the election are legitimate.”Election officials keep sites open until the last person in line at closing time can vote. Polling places in Nevada are scheduled to close at 22:00 ET (02:00 GMT).All polls will close in the battleground state of Florida at 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT)Here is why the state is so significant.The AP news agency calls Virginia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 13 electoral votes.A helpful road map, if you want to figure out how election night is going to shape up, is to keep an eye on seven states’ results, which we will dub the “super” seven.If Biden can win early on any of the following states that Trump won in 2016, it could indicate a positive evening for him. If Trump holds them, that will likely delay a projection of an overall winner.Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas are the states that are expected to count votes fairly efficiently and, if there’s a clear winner, are expected to be projected for one of the two candidates.If Biden picks up one, assuming he also wins all of the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he will be well on his way to 270 votes, as it will be a state flipped from Republican to Democrat. If he picks up two, that makes things even clearer and puts Biden well down the path to a potential win.Note that other key Trump states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – are not part of that list. Those states are expected to count their votes much more slowly and if Trump holds onto the other seven, will factor into many more hours, if not days, of waiting for a winner to be projected.Republican Moore has defeated Democrat Paula Jean Swearengin in West Virginia’s US Senate race.The AP calls West Virginia for the Republican Party, giving Trump five electoral votes.It is 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT) and polls have closed in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.Biden is outperforming Hillary Clinton among key voters in Georgia, according to exit polls from The Associated Press news agency.Suburban voters, who Trump won by five points in 2016, are backing Biden by double digits in this year’s exit polls. Among suburban women, Biden has the support of six in 10 of them.Turnout among Black voters has kept pace with 2016, as they make up approximately three in 10 voters this year. Biden has also kept pace with Hillary Clinton, with nine in 10 Black voters saying they support Biden.If Biden is to flip Georgia to the Democrats for the first time since 1992, he will need robust turnout from Black voters and a strong showing among suburban voters.Georgia’s polls closed at 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT), but The Associated Press news agency has not called the race as of yet.The AP exit poll surveyed more than 106,000 voters over eight days, including Election Day. The margin of error is +/-0.4 percent.Despite the US witnessing a record number of early votes in the presidential election, tens of millions of American voters headed to polling stations across the country on Tuesday.Polls began closing in the United States at 18:00 Eastern Standard Time (23:00 GMT) and closing times vary by state.Find out when the polls close in each statehere.Democratic US Senator Mark Warner defeats Republican Daniel Gade in Virginia’s US Senate race, according to AP.The AP calls Vermont for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three electoral votes.The AP calls Kentucky for the Republican Party, giving Trump eight electoral votes.It is 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Virginia and Vermont.Swing states, also known as battleground states, will have an outsize influencing in deciding the next president of the US.Watch our one-minute explainer on why.Racial justice is one of several big issues on the minds of US voters today, as the country for months has seen mass protests demanding an end to systemic racism and police violence against Black people.Janelle King, a Republican strategist, defended US President Donald Trump, saying he has helped the Black community by tackling unemployment and funding various programmes, such as historically Black colleges and universities.“He provided the Black community with policies,” she told Al Jazeera.But Derrick Plummer, a Democratic strategist, said it is false to say that Trump has done a lot to help the Black community.“When you had peaceful African Americans, Black people, in the streets saying that we want to end systemic racism, we have a president that doesn’t even think systemic racism is real,” he told Al Jazeera.Voters are quite unhappy with the direction of the country and how the federal government is working, according to The Associated Press news agency’s VoteCast data.About three-quarters of voters said they are dissatisfied or angry with the way the government is working and six in 10 say they are unhappy with the direction of the country.Trump has tweeted “we’re looking really good all over the country”.“Thank you,” the president tweeted shortly after the first polling places, in parts of Indiana and Kentucky, closed on Election Day.Indications on who is ahead in preliminary state results are expected to take hours.WE ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 3, 2020The first polls have closed on Election Day in Indiana and Kentucky.Polls closed in parts of the two states that lie within the Eastern Time zone, but those within the Central Time zone will remain open for an additional hour.Both states are considered Republican bastions, but results are not expected to begin coming in until later Tuesday.With only a few hours before polls close in Michigan on Election Day, Rashida Tlaib said she is optimistic she will be heading back to Washington, DC.An outspoken progressive, the Palestinian American legislator is up for re-election in the 13th District of Michigan – a Democratic stronghold that she is almost certain to carry.She says strong voter turnout so far in the US elections is very encouraging.“I’ve not, in all the years I’ve run for office, seen lines like this,” Tlaib told Al Jazeera, crediting the crowds in part to a desire to vote President Donald Trump out of office.“[It] gives me hope that the turnout is going to be high enough where it’s very clear that Donald Trump is not wanted as the president of the United States any more.”Read morehere.The FBI and the New York attorney general were looking into a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home on Election Day as the nation remains on high alert to ensure voting is not compromised, according to the Reuters news agency.US state and local officials have been raising the alarm over at least two separate automated call campaigns as millions of Americans cast their votes on Tuesday to decide between Trump and Biden. Experts who spoke to Reuters say they are mystified by the most prominent robocalling campaign, which has been running for months and tells people to remain home but does not explicitly mention voting.“There’s a little bit of confusion about this one across the industry,” said Giulia Porter, vice president at RoboKiller, a company that fights telemarketers and robocalls and has been tracking the campaign.Audio of the calls, which RoboKiller shared with Reuters, features a synthetic female voice saying: “Hello. This is just a test call. Time to stay home. Stay safe and stay home.”Porter said the call had been placed millions of times in the past 11 months or so but had on Tuesday shot up to number 5 or number 6 in the list of top spam calls. A Department of Homeland Security official said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the calls. The FBI said only that it was aware of reports of robocalls and had no further comment.Biden made a couple of last-minute campaign visits to Pennsylvania, stopping by his childhood home in Scranton and speaking to volunteers in Philadelphia.Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, he expects to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the three Midwest states known as the “Blue Wall”.“I think we are going to do well. We’re going to re-establish that Blue Wall,” Biden said, referring to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Trump won those states in 2016, turning them Republican for the first time in decades.Biden said this year is interesting.“You can’t think of an election in the recent past where so many states are up for grabs. The idea that I’m still in play in Texas, in Georgia, in Florida,” he said. And said he would wait for a result before speaking later on election night.“There’s so much in play out there and an overwhelming vote out there. If there’s something to say tonight, I’ll come out and say it, otherwise, I will wait until all the votes are counted.”Speaking to reporters Tuesday outside a Delaware community centre, Biden said he’s “superstitious” about offering predictions for election night but remains “hopeful”.He added he has heard from aides that there is “overwhelming turnout” among young people, women and older Black adults in places like Georgia and Florida.“The things that are happening bode well for the base that has been supporting me – but we’ll see,” he said. “It’s just so uncertain” because of how many states are in play.Al Jazeera’s Chris Moody has sent this report from Safety Harbor, FloridaDesirae Braverman, a 20-year-old who was eager to vote in her first presidential election this year, showed up in person in the final hours on Election Day after her father accidentally threw away the mail-in ballot she ordered.“He doesn’t pay attention sometimes,” she said of her dad after voting in person in the town library. “I was like, I have no choice but to come down here now last minute. I wanted to do my little part, even if it doesn’t mean that much. I wanted to get out there and say, ‘My vote counts’.”To both presidential campaigns this election cycle, Braverman’s vote actually matters quite a lot: Her small bayside town, Safety Harbor, is located in Pinellas County, one of the most important swing counties in Florida, which is in one of the nation’s most critical battleground states.Pinellas voted for George W Bush in 2004, then supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, only to swing back into Republican hands and vote for Donald Trump in 2016. And this year, it is once again up for grabs in a state likely to face a close outcome. The county is narrowly split between registered Republicans and Democrats, making turnout numbers essential in a tightly contested place like this.Biden’s campaign sent the Democratic nominee’s wife, Jill Biden, to make a last-minute stop on the morning of Election Day to encourage voters.Braverman, a college student who said she cares about social issues such as preserving rights to same-sex marriage and abortion, cast her vote for Biden.”It kind of felt a little liberating because it was my first time,” she said. “It felt good. And I got my little sticker.”Coronavirus and the economy are the top issues among US voters, according to the Associated Press’ VoteCast data. And voters don’t have positive feelings about how both are being dealt with.About 4 in 10 voters named the pandemic as the top issue facing the US, while 3 in 10 said the economy and jobs were most important.About half of US voters said coronavirus is not at all under control. On the economy, 6 in 10 said the economy is in poor shape.On the issue of law enforcement, of which Donald Trump has made the former a important campaign theme, only 4 percent said that was the country’s top issue.Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland filed this report from Phoenix, ArizonaA slow but steady stream of voters arrived at the Epworth United Methodist Church in Phoenix, Arizona’s capital. Poll volunteers informed new arrivals where to go to cast their ballots, while another group handed out free meals to voters as they left.Feed the Polls is a volunteer initiative that brings together organisations and eateries to keep voters fed while they are waiting at the polls.“Today we are set to give out 2,000 meals,” said Maria Parra Cano of Sana Sana Foods, one of the groups that teamed up with Feed the Polls.“It’s been a constant flow [of voters] all morning until now,” she told Al Jazeera. “We are really just aiming to try to solve food insecurity on this day.”Justin, 19, said he cast his first-ever vote for President Donald Trump, the Republican incumbent.“The most important thing for me is obviously the economy – we need a strong economy,” said Justin, who declined to provide his surname. “And then law and order is a big thing for me.”Justin also lauded Trump’s foreign policy, citing the recent normalisation agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.“It’s a crazy world we live in right now and this election is a big election, just like any election,” Justin added.His friend Robert, a 26-year-old old business student, said the most important issue for him is taxation. On Tuesday he voted for Trump, just like in 2016.“The civil unrest and everything – I feel like there needs to be something done,” said Robert, who also declined to provide his last name.“And then I think Trump is going to be the one to stop the lockdown,” he added, referring to restrictions over the coronavirus pandemic. “I think it’s time everybody goes back to work.”Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this update from South Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaDJs Ronald Coleman, 33, and Jarkeer Lassiter, 29, danced to Come Closer by Whiz Kid ft. Drake outside a South Philadelphia polling station. They already voted for Biden with mail ballots and now their goal is to get out the vote for Biden by DJing at the polls. They are part of an effort across Philadelphia bringing DJs and free food to voters.Philadelphia voter turnout is high this election, but it is still unclear if it will be high enough to help the Democrat win Pennsylvania.Asked why he voted for Biden, Coleman said, “My mom.” He wants Biden to follow through on his promise to improve healthcare. “Medicare, all the stuff for the older people,” Coleman added. He said people in Philadelphia have been rioting for their rights after the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr, who was Lassiter’s cousin.“It just hit too close to home for me,” Coleman said. “I just hope it gets better.”Coleman and Lassiter said a lot of first-time voters were making their voices heard in Philadelphia this election. Lassiter said he voted for Biden because Trump failed to contain the pandemic and had stoked racial tension. “It’s like, if he’s in the White House, it’s OK to be [openly racist].”Electing Biden will send a message, he said. “If we get Biden in there, we have to do better.”3 Nov 2020 - 22:08 GMTAl Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from Kenosha, WisconsinThe Kenosha Unified School District is a sprawling, yet nondescript building on the city’s 52nd Street thoroughfare.On Election Day, its parking lot is brimming with cars including one with a man playing guitar and singing from the bed of a pick-up truck. The glass doors of the building’s entrance are flanked by two pairs of volunteers wearing yellow crew-neck sweatshirts that read “Election Defender”.“It’s a nonpartisan group that is organising … to make sure that voters are taken care of, especially in places where there are long lines,” explained Rena Singer. “It felt good to have something to do today,” she said of the group’s efforts to hand out snacks, personal protective equipment and anything else voters need to make it through the process.Inside, the sterile and fluorescent-lit hallways and rooms are dedicated to same-day voter registration and in-person voting.“Everybody has been in such a good mood, even the voters,” said the location’s chief inspector, Shawnna Smith. “I’m pretty proud of how well curbside voting is going – we don’t usually have that,” she said of the pandemic-inspired practice.Volunteers in yellow vests gather voters’ information, grab a ballot from inside that the voters complete from outside before the voters return them indoors to be counted. “People are taking advantage of it. Instead of risking coming in here, they’re just doing it curbside. It’s safe for them and everybody else,” Smith said.3 Nov 2020 - 21:31 GMTWall Street’s main stock indexes rallied as investors hope a clear winner will emerge from an exceptionally divisive US presidential election.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session up more than 554 points or just more than 2 percent at 27,480.03 – it had been up more than 700 points earlier in the session.The S&P 500 – a gauge for the health of US retirement and college savings accounts – closed up 1.78 percent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index finished the session up 1.85 percent.Tuesday’s strong finishes extended Monday’s gains. Though storefronts across the country have been boarded up in case violence erupts once the polls close, Wall Street is optimistic that a clear winner will be determined.Read morehere.3 Nov 2020 - 20:11 GMTAl Jazeera’s Chris Moody sent this report from West Tampa, FloridaJill Biden, wife of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, made a last-minute appearance in a predominantly Latino neighbourhood of West Tampa today to boost turnout in this crucial battleground state.Speaking to only a few dozen supporters, mostly volunteers who have backed her husband’s campaign, she emphasised unity before the polls close later tonight. “There is nothing – nothing – we can’t do when we come together with courage and grit,” she told the crowd, who wore masks and stood several feet apart from each other.“Donald Trump is in this for himself. Nothing more, nothing less. And he wants us to believe that we’re all the same, that we’re unhopeful and angry and selfish and divided. But today, we are going to show him who we are.”The appearance outside “Casa Biden”, an independent volunteer office where people have spent months drumming up support for Biden in an area with large Cuban and Puerto Rican populations, was scheduled at the 11th hour to try to increase voter turnout.“This is where the highest concentration of Hispanic voters are,” said Elio Muller, who directs the volunteer operations. “Our precincts are usually 60 percent turnout Democrat.”Al Jazeera’s Jennifer Glasse reflects on casting a ballot in the US after decades abroad.Read more here.3 Nov 2020 - 19:02 GMTAl Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this update from Wilmington, North Carolina.Ricardo Thomas woke up this morning feeling energised. The 35-year-old Wilmington, North Carolina-native was anxious to get to the polls to cast his first-ever ballot.“It was like the first day of school,” he told Al Jazeera. Upon leaving the polling station, Thomas said he was “feeling good”.Thomas explained that while he did not really have an interest in voting before this election, but when COVID-19 hit him and his community especially hard, he started to learn more about the candidates.“I live below the line anyway, so [often election outcomes] would never affect us,” he told Al Jazeera. “Because we don’t know what it is to have the amount of money that the people around us that we provide our services for have,” he said.“When the COVID came, I lost my job, and it really set me back, back, back.” And that’s when he says he knew he had to vote, and “be a part of change and history”.3 Nov 2020 - 18:43 GMTAl Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this dispatch from Kenosha, WisconsinElection Day is off to the races in Wisconsin.Erin Decker, chair of the Republican Party of Kenosha County, said she expects “record-high turnout” today, while Lori Hawkins, chair of the Kenosha County Democrats, said she told her children that they are witnessing history.Inside Kenosha’s municipal building, hallways dedicated to central count efforts – to tally absentee ballots separately from the polls – are bustling with volunteers and city officials. Dressed in neon green shirts, dozens of poll workers are steadily counting the 57,650 ballots that have been returned so far at tables of two, spaced six feet apart.A handful of retired men wearing bright orange lanyards attached to white placards reading “election observer” around their necks are mingling among the first-floor crowd.Outside the building, resident Dennis Phillips said he had not voted yet, but that he would likely cast a ballot later for Trump – just as he did in 2016. “He’s been doing pretty good I guess,” Phillips said.Read all the updates from earlier in the dayhere."

Despite you, I and the political class, the vast majority of Americans are not paying attention to the election,” said Erik Nisbet, a professor of policy analysis and communications at Northwestern University.“People don’t tune in until September,” he told Al Jazeera. “At this point though, it’s important to get your narratives out. It’s important to get your base solidified and mobilised.”Most polls show a tight race between Biden and Trump as the election nears, with experts saying the contest will likely come down to how the candidates fare in critical swing states like Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.But there is also widespread frustration that the choice this election cycle is the same as in 2020, when Biden defeated Trump to win the White House.A recentPew Research Center pollfound that nearly half of all registered voters said they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot if they could.About two-thirds of respondents said they had little to no confidence that Biden is physically fit enough to be president, the poll said, while a similar number said they did not believe Trump would act ethically in office.“It is Election 2.0,” said Jan Leighley, a political science professor at American University in Washington, DC.“I think that creates a disincentive for voting, which again comes back on the campaigns to convince people that, even though it’s the same choice, there’s still a reason to vote.”For the Biden camp, the message so far has been that a vote for the Democratic incumbent is avote for democratic ideals. “Democracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot,” Biden said in January.But that message is failing to resonate among key segments of the Democratic base who are angered by the Biden administration’s unequivocal support for Israel amid its war in Gaza.The recent wave of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses has highlighted a generational divide over the US’s relationship with Israel, and that, in turn, couldpose a serious problemfor Biden as he seeks the youth vote in November.In 2020, Biden won about 60 percent support among voters aged 18 to 29.But arecent CNN pollshowed Biden trailing Trump — 51 percent to 40 percent — among voters under age 35, and experts say a lack of enthusiasm among young voters could spell trouble.“We know how college students are feeling,” said Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairperson for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party.“And I can tell you for sure that there are too many who would stay home” on November 5 if Biden does not change his Middle East policy, Pyarali added. “I doubt that people would switch over to Trump, but they would certainly not vote.”According to Nisbet at Northwestern University, Biden’s campaign needs to focus in the coming months on “getting the Democratic house in order” before it tries to appeal to the relatively small number of undecided voters in the country.Any protests at the Democratic National Convention, for example, could hurt him. Democrats will gather in Chicago in August to formally confirm Biden as their 2024 nominee.“The Democratic Party, or at least the Biden campaign, does not want any dissension within the [party] because it’s a bad visual,” said Nisbet.Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Trump’s campaign has unfolded against unprecedented legal turmoil.The former president faces four separate criminal cases, includingan ongoing trialin New York over allegations he falsified business records related to a hush-money payment made to an adult film star.While the indictments have done little so far to dent Trump’s support among Republican voters, somepolling suggeststhat a chunk of the US electorate would not vote for him if he were convicted in any of the cases.Trump is expected to be confirmed as the Republican Party’s 2024 nominee at the party’s convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.“The conventions go on over the summer, but there’s usually not a whole lot of activity campaign-wise,” said Leighley at American University.But this year might be different, given Trump’s court hearings and the pressure on Biden over the Gaza war. “Those could be unusual bumps, if you will, that provide campaigns opportunities to do more in terms of ads,” she said.Both Leighley and Nisbet saidthe US economyis always an important election issue, and it will continue to be a focus over the next few months of campaigning.Despite positive economic indicators, many Americans believe they are worse off now than when Trump was in the White House, recent polls have suggested.“There is a big gap where people, for whatever reason — it could be because of the economics, it could be a bias of memory — they look more favourably at Trump’s then-presidency than Biden’s current one overall,” said Nisbet.He added that the economy is hurting Biden among Latino and Black voters, as well as young people, all of whom are key segments of the Democratic base.“Trump will want to talk about how bad the economy is,” said Nisbet, while Biden’s team instead will “try to change the conversation” and pivot to other issues.That includes access to abortion. Biden has made defending access to reproductive healthcare a central plank of his re-election campaign, repeatedlycondemning Trumpand Republican Party lawmakers for supporting abortion restrictions.In 2022, under Trump, the US Supreme Court formed a conservative “supermajority”, allowing it tooverturn Roe v Wade, a landmark 1973 ruling that established abortion access as a constitutional right.Eliminating Roe had been a conservative priority for decades, and several Republican-led states have since enacted strict limits on abortion.According to Leighley, “there will be an emphasis on the issue of abortion and Trump’s role in that and the Republican Party and its plans” as the presidential campaigns inch closer to the fall months of September and October.That is also when the first debate between Biden and Trump could take place.The Commission on Presidential Debatesreiteratedon Wednesday that the first televised face-off between the candidates would take place on September 16, confirming dates announced late last year.The announcement came after Trump’s team had urged the commission to move the schedule forward.There has been uncertainty around the 2024 debates, particularly as Trump eschewed participating in any during the Republican primary process. But last week, both Biden and Trump said they were up for it.“I honestly don’t know if either one wants them, but it is an American tradition — and I think it really would hurt American democracy if we did not have presidential debates,” said Nesbit.“It’s a major aspect of our tradition in the United States. And having presidential debates, even if they don’t change anyone’s minds — and they rarely do — I think it’s important for Americans to hear their two candidates at least air their perspectives.”"

For two decades, President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.",Last update 6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"For two decades, Russian President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Moscow wouldbackUS Vice PresidentKamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s nominee, in presidentialelectionsin November.The nature of Putin’s comments suggests he was joking, or trolling the Harris campaign, at a time when the US government under the Joe Biden administration has levelled new allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in the November vote, to favour former President Donald Trump.Yet whatever Putin’s motivations for the comments on Harris, they are the latest iteration of the Russian leader’s attempts to inject Moscow into the US electoral process.This is not the first time Putin has thrown his support behind a US presidential candidate.Putinhimself has been in Russia’s top job since 2012. He was also president between 2000 and 2008.Al Jazeera recaps two decades of the Russian president’s tongue-in-cheek meddling in US elections.At an economic forum in the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, Putin wryly said that current President Joe Biden was his “favourite”.Since Biden has dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, she was Putin’s next best bet, the Russian leader teased.He added that Harris has an “expressive and infectious laugh”, which indicates “she’s doing well”. The audience broke into scatted laughter as he said that if Harris is doing well, maybe she would not impose sanctions on Russia.“I don’t know if I’m insulted or he did me a favour,” Republican challengerTrumpresponded at a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.Putin’s comments came a day after the US Department of Justice accused Russian-owned state broadcaster RT of campaigning to sway the US vote, indicting two Russian journalists.But this isn’t the first time that Putin has stirred the pot of US domestic politics.In October 2004, Putin endorsed Republican incumbent President George W Bush. He said that if Bush lost it would lead to the “spread of terrorism” globally.Bush had been facing criticism from Democratic challenger John Kerry for not adequately tackling “terrorism”.This was amid thewar on Iraqwhich started in 2003 after the US under Bush invaded the country.Bush defeated Kerry in the 2004 race and was re-elected as president.While Putin did not make a clear endorsement in the 2008 US presidential race, experts were clear that a win for DemocratBarack Obamaover Republican John McCain was Russia’s preferred outcome.While both Obama and McCain held a harsh stance on Russia, Kremlin officials believed that under Obama, a newcomer at the time, US-Russia relations could start with a clean slate unlike under Cold War veteran McCain.After being in office for two terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin was constitutionally barred from assuming the role of president for a third consecutive term.Hence, Dmitry Medvedev rose to the top job with Putin as his premier. However, it was widely believed in Russia and globally at the time that Putin continued to hold real power in Russia. It was said that Putin and Medvedev ruled in “tandemocracy”.Obama won the 2008 election.Ahead of the 2012 US presidential race, in which Obama was taking on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Putin told Russian state media that Obama was “an honest person who really wants to change much for the better”.Romney had deemed Russia the top “geopolitical foe” of the US, something Putin said Romney was “mistaken” about, during the same interview.Obama defeated Romney in the 2012 election.Ahead of the 2016 US election, Putin spoke highly of Trump during an annual news conference with reporters.“He is a bright and talented person without any doubt,” he said, adding that Trump is “outstanding and talented”.Trump was up against Democratic challengerHilary Clintonin the election.After Trump’s election victory, Putin said Trump was a “clever man” who would “quickly understand” his role in office.In July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC)emails were hackedand leaked, showing preferential treatment to Clinton, angering supporters of her primary Democatic opponent Bernie Sanders.The US government formally placed the blame for the hack on Russia in a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Putin denied Russia’s role in the DNC hack but said the leaks themselves were important. “The important thing is the content that was given to the public,” he said.The US also accused Russia of a larger election interference programme aimed at defeating Clinton and helping Trump come to power, involving troll farms that amplified messaging tailored against the Democrats.In October 2019, on a panel at Russian Energy Week, Putin was asked if he would interfere with the2020 US election.“I’ll tell you a secret: Yes, we’ll definitely do it. Just don’t tell anyone,” the Russian president joked in a fake whisper.He then said hisworking relationshipwith Trump did not mean that he had any influence on the domestic politics in the US. He insisted that he did not interfere in the 2016 US election and that he was dealing with issues in his own country.“We have our own problems,” he said."

Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris's continued support for Israel's war in Gaza.,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris’s continued support for Israel’s war in Gaza.With the United Statespresidential electionless than four weeks away, analysts caution that Israel’sexpanding military campaignsacross the Middle East could bruise the chances of the Democratic candidate, Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Foreign policy is rarely a top priority for US voters. But Israel’s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign inLebanon, have spurred questions about the US’s role in the conflict.The administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters — particularly Arab Americans — turning against the party.With Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.“This is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,” Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Now party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.”Much of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, which has erasedentire neighbourhoodsand killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.That campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in USweapons assistance.“It’s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they’ve allowed to happen,” said Zogby.“There’s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don’t matter.”ASeptember pollby the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.That figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, hissupportamong Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.Biden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.When Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old’s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.But Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series ofescalatory strikesby Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.In a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”The Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August’sDemocratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.“People are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won’t give it to them,” said Zogby. “They’re making a mistake that will cost them votes.”While US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.Many of those voters are concentrated in a small number ofswing statesthat play an outsized role in deciding the country’s presidential elections.The Midwestern battleground state ofMichigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.Polling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.And her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.“The situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,” said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.“Since we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state’s Arab community stays home on election day,” he added.But Michigan’s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.Some believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.Others view a second term for Trump, apro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should “finish the job” in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.One group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is theUncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.During primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote “uncommitted”, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.Now, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris — but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.“As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,” a spokesperson said in a video released this week.“But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”The final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.In early October, for instance, Iran launched aballistic missile attackagainst Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehin Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.On that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.Analysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.ASeptember pollby the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.Respondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel’s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.Laura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.“Republican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they’re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,” Silver said.She pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza — and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.A February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.But Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such asyoung peopleand communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.“The pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,” he said. “The Democratic Party hasn’t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren’t listening, and they’ll pay a price for that.”"

With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into ...",13 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Where do the candidates stand in the polls? We’ll break it down, along with major updates from the campaign trail.With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into overdrive, with last-minute appeals to voters.Need a quick breakdown of the week’s biggest political news? Look no further.We’ll get you up to speed with five key takeaways from the past seven days and an overview of where the candidates stand in the polls.There are 23 days left before the November 5 election.As of October 11, the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows Vice President Kamala Harris up by 2.5 points, with 48.5 percent support compared to former President Donald Trump’s 46 percent.Another polling average, from the website 270toWin, shows Harris again with a marginal lead, with 49.3 percent support. Trump, meanwhile, is at 46.5 percent.Harris, the Democrat, could be poised to flip one of Trump’s key demographics: suburban voters.On October 10, the news agency Reuters and the market research poll Ipsos released a poll that showed Harris led her Republican rival 47 percent to 41 among suburbanites.But two days later, The New York Times and Siena College released a poll that indicated Harris could be slipping among Black voters. She pulled in 78 percent support — a drop from the estimated 90 percent support her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, earned in 2020.Within three days of forming in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Milton had billowed into a powerful Category 5 storm, earning the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Such rapid development had rarely been seen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton “one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin”.And it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.But as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.Swaths of the US South were still recovering from September’sHurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas”.On the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Bidenslapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.“Over the last few weeks, there’s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what’s going on,” Biden said, calling the distortions “un-American”.“Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,” he added.Harris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. “This is not a time for people to play politics,” she said, in reference to the Republican.Once criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of arecent media blitz.It was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.And even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.But in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.And her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.That last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.But host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing “shifting explanations”, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.The friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to “make her look better”.He also called on the Federal Communications Commission to “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE”. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission’s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.Through much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large — even dooming one candidate’s run.After a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a “weak” and “sleepy” old man.But at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.Those questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump’s “rambling” and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.And then, on Saturday, the White House released amemotouting hisDemocratic rival’s health.The 59-year-old Harris, it read, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency”.Trump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with astatement, arguing that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung wrote of Trump.On the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.Immigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump’s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.But critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.On Monday, Trumprecorded an audio interviewwith the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump said. “Now a murderer, I believe this: It’s in their genes. And we’ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”The Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.Speaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to “expedite the removal” of “savage gangs” from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.He also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.Despite Trump’s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.Reporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.In 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician’s eventual resignation.Since then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse ofTrump’s alleged relationshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.In its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.News outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book’s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump’s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an “angry, little man”.“None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,” Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.But the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley — once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.He tells Woodward in the book that Trump is “fascist to the core”."

The Democrat led 52 percent to 46 percent in the same poll last month.The latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51 percent to 48 percent among likely voters, compared with a four-point advantage last month.Following the latest figures, Harris holds a 1.4 percent point lead in Real Clear Polling’s aggregate of major polls, slipping from 2.2 percent on Saturday.The tightening poll numbers come amid concerns among Democrats that Harris is failing to shore up support among Hispanics and African Americans, two of the party’s key constituencies.While Harris is leading among women of all races, she has struggled to drum up enthusiasm among men, including African Americans and Hispanics, who have increasingly gravitated towards Trump in recent years.In The New York Times/Siena College polls released on Saturday and Sunday, Harris attracted the support of 78 percent of Black voters and 56 percent of Hispanic voters – significantly lower shares than won by the Democratic nominees in the 2020 and 2016 elections.On Thursday, former President Barack Obama admonished Black men for not showing as much enthusiasm for Harris’s candidacy as he had received during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012.“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama said at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of seven key battleground states expected to decide the election.“Because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”Harris and Trump on Sunday continued to focus their campaigns on the battleground states, holding events in North Carolina and Arizona, respectively.At a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris took aim at Trump for spreading misinformation about the government’s response to recent hurricanes.“The problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it’s making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they’re led to believe they cannot trust,” Harris said.“And that’s the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.”Trump, meanwhile, used a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona to call for the hiring of 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents.“After I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10 percent raise – they haven’t had one in a long time – for all agents and a $10,000 each retention and signing bonus,” Trump said. “We’re going to retain them.”"

Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier ...",28 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier under Biden.Mumbai, India –Parneesh Mehta’s diamond jewellery business may be performing much better than many other companies around the world suffering from the crushing force of lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.But the entrepreneur based in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, says that is little consolation for the revenue he has lost because of tariff hikes on the gems and jewellery sector in his biggest export market – the United States.In April 2019, the US withdrew India and Turkey from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), an import duty exemption on certain goods – including Mehta’s jewels – that require a lot of manpower to make, from developing countries.“That really hurt us,” Mehta told Al Jazeera. “We had to adjust our prices for some of our clients. For others, we dropped the quality of the gems.”With both exporters and importers feeling the pinch, Mehta says the added tax will prevent businesses from growing. “Everyone’s getting squeezed,” he said. “If the GSP was restored, there’s no doubt it would help the sector as a whole”.Mehta’s experience is one example of how the India-US economic relationship has changed under the administration of US President Donald Trump. And why many Indian entrepreneurs like him have a keen interest in who occupies the White House after the November 3 US elections.Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the US’s trade deficit with India, which stood at $28.8bn in 2019, nearly three times the $10.6bn figure in 2008. In March 2019, he called India “a very high-tariff nation” and has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to redress the gap. India later retaliated, raising duties on 28 US products.Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have famously enjoyed afriendly rapport, but analysts say Trump’s punitive policies have made the economic environment more contentious. The two sides have repeatedlyfailed to signeven a “mini trade deal” that had initially been expected in September 2019.“There’s been a lot of positive engagement, but in reality, we are far from getting anything ratified,” Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi told Al Jazeera.This could change if Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, becomes the next US president and brings with him a more measured policymaking machine.“A Biden administration would not necessarily back down on big-ticket requests,” says Dhar, referring to the US’s push for greater access to India’s agriculture, medical device and e-commerce markets, and even for lower import tariffs on Harley Davidson motorbikes.“But we’d be unlikely to see the same aggression towards trade partners. This could lead to a better outcome for Indian negotiators”.Trump’s trade policies and negotiating stance may be based on populist impulses, but India is also taking an increasingly protectionist line.India’s incoming data protection bill has become one of the thorniest issues in negations.The bill threatens to prevent Indian data from leaving its shores, making life difficult for global technology giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google that rely on the free-flow of data.It also threatens to tax digital companies in a way that would also disproportionately affect US technology firms. The US has called this type of taxation “unfair” and “discriminatory” and has said it will “begin investigations” into how its trading partners are implementing such laws.After its economy suffered a historic shock (gross domestic product shrank by a record 23.9 percent in the April-June quarter), exacerbating an urgent need to create more blue- and white-collar jobs, analysts say India cannot afford to close itself off from negotiating a more favourable US trading relationship.“India needs to recognise that a trade relationship with the US is extremely beneficial for economic growth,” Anupam Manur, a research fellow at the Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately though, we may see nationalistic jingo and political point-scoring continue to take the upper hand”.However, recent investments by Facebook and Google in Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, could drive a change of mindset.Reliance is India’s largest and most influential company. With two major US tech giants taking a seat each on its board, analysts say this could strengthen the hand of US companies lobbying the Indian government to liberalise a wide range of issues governing India’s digital platforms.For this reason “I wouldn’t rule out a policy U-turn,” said JNU’s Dhar.But, regardless of the outcome of the US election, analysts believe progress on a trade agreement will hinge on the US securing greater access to India’s huge, yet fragmented, agricultural markets.India, however, is reluctant to endanger its mostly small-scale, independent producers by forcing them to compete with giant US agribusinesses. And with the global economic downturn set to drag on, as well as a strong farming lobby to placate at home, observers say a future Biden administration would likely take a hard line similar to Trump’s.September’shistoric changes to India’s farm laws, which will open up produce markets to private players, could also complicate matters. “Farmers already have apprehensions about these ordinances,” said Dhar. “Allowing American access on top of that means the situation could become very problematic”.With US unemployment at a high 8.4 percent and the country experiencing the toughest economic conditions since the Great Depression, analysts say there may be little political room for either of the two contenders to deviate from the US’s existing – and increasingly nativist – trade policies.“Let’s remember that Biden also has a ‘Made in America’ plan and has made an effort to appear tough on China,” explained Takshashila Institution’s Manur. “His talk of subsidising industry, which is against the World Trade Organisation rules, tells me he will also be protectionist”.The White House’s recent announcement of plans to reduce the number of visas awarded to skilled workers by a third is one such area where Biden’s hands may be tied.Last year, 74.5 percent of so-called H1-B visas were claimed by Indians, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, plugging a shortage of highly skilled labour in the US’s technology industries. High-profile Indian CEOs such as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Google’s parent Alphabet have also played an outsized role in contributing to Silicon Valley’s success.Despite this, Indians look set to miss out on future opportunities.“Like with the 2008 global financial crisis, the immigration issue has become mixed up in the feelings surrounding the downturn,” says Dhar. “[Biden] will eventually re-look at visa policies once the economy rebounds, but not before that”.But a change of US leadership could mean a return to more nuanced, rules-based decision-making. Consequently, there are hopes in India that the Iran nuclear deal, originally signed under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and abandoned by Trump, will be back on the table.This would help India, which lost an important export market, a valuable source of cheap oil and a potential stake in a key port by complying with US sanctions. “Iran has always been a strategic ally in the region,” says Dhar. “I hope this situation would improve if a new administration comes in”.India is likely to remain a key ally for the US as geopolitical tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific region. In a speech during his visit to India earlier this year, Trump clubbed the two nations together as “powerful defenders of peace and liberty”, drawing a blunt contrast with China – the other great regional power. Biden too has said he would “stand with India”, promising to tackle terror threats in the region together.As the US decouples itself from China’s economy, India is trying to take its place. Modi has pitched India as a “trusted partner” and welcomed foreign direct investment. In reality, US businesses are reluctant to leave China or disrupt their supply chains; and for the few that do, India is unlikely to be their preferred destination.“At most, US companies are hedging, perhaps moving 30 percent of their operations to Vietnam or Laos – India is not attractive to companies yet,” said Takshashila Institution’s Manur. But the current reforms to labour and land laws, which would make it easier for foreign businesses to set up shop in India, could change that, he added.India’s attempts to supplant undemocratic China and take advantage of the US’s boycotts and bans of Chinese technology firms may also invite increased scrutiny of its own human rights record.US Democrats have indicated they will call out human rights abuses around the world. After India withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir – the region it administers in part while Pakistan administers the other – and imposed a military lockdown on its residents, Biden’s vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, reminded observers: “We are watching”, suggesting a potential sore spot in India-US relations.Harris has repeatedly shown that despite her being part Indian, she may not be an easy ally for the Modi government. After India’s external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar cancelled a meeting last year when the US House Affairs Committee refused to exclude Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal – a critic of India’s Kashmir policy – Harris actively defended Jayapal’s presence, ruffling diplomatic feathers in the process.But not everyone believes that such conversations would harm the India-US economic relationship. A trade policy expert wishing to remain anonymous told Al Jazeera: “Modi has a thick skin about these things. Any criticism of human rights will wash off his back”.Tish Sanghera is a journalist based in Mumbai, where she writes about economic, political and social issues. Twitter: @TishSanghera"

But Israel’s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign inLebanon, have spurred questions about the US’s role in the conflict.The administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters — particularly Arab Americans — turning against the party.With Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.“This is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,” Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Now party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.”Much of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, which has erasedentire neighbourhoodsand killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.That campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in USweapons assistance.“It’s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they’ve allowed to happen,” said Zogby.“There’s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don’t matter.”ASeptember pollby the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.That figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, hissupportamong Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.Biden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.When Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old’s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.But Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series ofescalatory strikesby Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.In a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”The Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August’sDemocratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.“People are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won’t give it to them,” said Zogby. “They’re making a mistake that will cost them votes.”While US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.Many of those voters are concentrated in a small number ofswing statesthat play an outsized role in deciding the country’s presidential elections.The Midwestern battleground state ofMichigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.Polling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.And her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.“The situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,” said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.“Since we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state’s Arab community stays home on election day,” he added.But Michigan’s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.Some believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.Others view a second term for Trump, apro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should “finish the job” in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.One group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is theUncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.During primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote “uncommitted”, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.Now, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris — but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.“As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,” a spokesperson said in a video released this week.“But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”The final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.In early October, for instance, Iran launched aballistic missile attackagainst Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehin Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.On that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.Analysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.ASeptember pollby the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.Respondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel’s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.Laura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.“Republican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they’re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,” Silver said.She pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza — and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.A February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.But Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such asyoung peopleand communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.“The pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,” he said. “The Democratic Party hasn’t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren’t listening, and they’ll pay a price for that.”"

We’ll break it down, along with major updates from the campaign trail.With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into overdrive, with last-minute appeals to voters.Need a quick breakdown of the week’s biggest political news? Look no further.We’ll get you up to speed with five key takeaways from the past seven days and an overview of where the candidates stand in the polls.There are 23 days left before the November 5 election.As of October 11, the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows Vice President Kamala Harris up by 2.5 points, with 48.5 percent support compared to former President Donald Trump’s 46 percent.Another polling average, from the website 270toWin, shows Harris again with a marginal lead, with 49.3 percent support. Trump, meanwhile, is at 46.5 percent.Harris, the Democrat, could be poised to flip one of Trump’s key demographics: suburban voters.On October 10, the news agency Reuters and the market research poll Ipsos released a poll that showed Harris led her Republican rival 47 percent to 41 among suburbanites.But two days later, The New York Times and Siena College released a poll that indicated Harris could be slipping among Black voters. She pulled in 78 percent support — a drop from the estimated 90 percent support her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, earned in 2020.Within three days of forming in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Milton had billowed into a powerful Category 5 storm, earning the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Such rapid development had rarely been seen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton “one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin”.And it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.But as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.Swaths of the US South were still recovering from September’sHurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas”.On the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Bidenslapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.“Over the last few weeks, there’s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what’s going on,” Biden said, calling the distortions “un-American”.“Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,” he added.Harris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. “This is not a time for people to play politics,” she said, in reference to the Republican.Once criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of arecent media blitz.It was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.And even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.But in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.And her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.That last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.But host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing “shifting explanations”, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.The friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to “make her look better”.He also called on the Federal Communications Commission to “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE”. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission’s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.Through much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large — even dooming one candidate’s run.After a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a “weak” and “sleepy” old man.But at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.Those questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump’s “rambling” and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.And then, on Saturday, the White House released amemotouting hisDemocratic rival’s health.The 59-year-old Harris, it read, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency”.Trump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with astatement, arguing that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung wrote of Trump.On the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.Immigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump’s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.But critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.On Monday, Trumprecorded an audio interviewwith the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump said. “Now a murderer, I believe this: It’s in their genes. And we’ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”The Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.Speaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to “expedite the removal” of “savage gangs” from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.He also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.Despite Trump’s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.Reporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.In 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician’s eventual resignation.Since then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse ofTrump’s alleged relationshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.In its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.News outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book’s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump’s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an “angry, little man”.“None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,” Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.But the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley — once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.He tells Woodward in the book that Trump is “fascist to the core”."

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton “one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin”.And it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.But as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.Swaths of the US South were still recovering from September’sHurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas”.On the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Bidenslapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.“Over the last few weeks, there’s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what’s going on,” Biden said, calling the distortions “un-American”.“Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,” he added.Harris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. “This is not a time for people to play politics,” she said, in reference to the Republican.Once criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of arecent media blitz.It was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.And even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.But in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.And her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.That last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.But host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing “shifting explanations”, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.The friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to “make her look better”.He also called on the Federal Communications Commission to “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE”. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission’s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.Through much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large — even dooming one candidate’s run.After a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a “weak” and “sleepy” old man.But at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.Those questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump’s “rambling” and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.And then, on Saturday, the White House released amemotouting hisDemocratic rival’s health.The 59-year-old Harris, it read, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency”.Trump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with astatement, arguing that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung wrote of Trump.On the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.Immigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump’s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.But critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.On Monday, Trumprecorded an audio interviewwith the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump said. “Now a murderer, I believe this: It’s in their genes. And we’ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”The Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.Speaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to “expedite the removal” of “savage gangs” from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.He also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.Despite Trump’s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.Reporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.In 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician’s eventual resignation.Since then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse ofTrump’s alleged relationshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.In its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.News outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book’s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump’s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an “angry, little man”.“None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,” Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.But the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley — once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.He tells Woodward in the book that Trump is “fascist to the core”."

The Democrat led 52 percent to 46 percent in the same poll last month.The latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51 percent to 48 percent among likely voters, compared with a four-point advantage last month.Following the latest figures, Harris holds a 1.4 percent point lead in Real Clear Polling’s aggregate of major polls, slipping from 2.2 percent on Saturday.The tightening poll numbers come amid concerns among Democrats that Harris is failing to shore up support among Hispanics and African Americans, two of the party’s key constituencies.While Harris is leading among women of all races, she has struggled to drum up enthusiasm among men, including African Americans and Hispanics, who have increasingly gravitated towards Trump in recent years.In The New York Times/Siena College polls released on Saturday and Sunday, Harris attracted the support of 78 percent of Black voters and 56 percent of Hispanic voters – significantly lower shares than won by the Democratic nominees in the 2020 and 2016 elections.On Thursday, former President Barack Obama admonished Black men for not showing as much enthusiasm for Harris’s candidacy as he had received during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012.“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama said at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of seven key battleground states expected to decide the election.“Because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”Harris and Trump on Sunday continued to focus their campaigns on the battleground states, holding events in North Carolina and Arizona, respectively.At a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris took aim at Trump for spreading misinformation about the government’s response to recent hurricanes.“The problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it’s making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they’re led to believe they cannot trust,” Harris said.“And that’s the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.”Trump, meanwhile, used a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona to call for the hiring of 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents.“After I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10 percent raise – they haven’t had one in a long time – for all agents and a $10,000 each retention and signing bonus,” Trump said. “We’re going to retain them.”"

All the results are within the margin of error with the exception of Nevada, where Trump is led by 5 percent in the WSJ poll.The newspaper said it surveyed 600 registered voters per state between September 28 and October 8.US elections are not won by popular vote nationwide. Rather, candidates compete in individual states to winelectoral college votes.It’s akin to a point system, where each state is worth a number of points proportionate to the size of its population. In all but two states – Maine and Nebraska – the winner takes all the electoral college votes.Most states are almost certain to go to one party. For example, a Democratic win in California and Vermont is often projected as soon as the polls close, while states like Oklahoma and Alabama are Republican strongholds.That leaves a handful of states where there are close, competitive elections. These are known asswing states. In this round, all eyes are on the seven states polled by WSJ.In 2016, Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote because he defeated the Democratic candidateHillary Clintonin most battleground states.According to a Pew Research Centersurveyreleased on Friday, Harris is leading the race nationally by one point – 48 percent to Trump’s 47 percent.US election poll results have fluctuated in recent months. While Trump enjoyed a solid lead overJoe Bidenearlier this year in almost all polls, the Democrats received a boost after the US president stepped aside and was replaced by Harris as the party’s nominee.A Morning Consult poll in September had Harris beating Trump 51 percent to 46 percent. But the former president appeared to claw back some support amid concerns about the economy and the turmoil inthe Middle East.US election polls have also been wide off the mark in the past. For example, many surveys had indicated that Clinton was set for a comfortable win when she lost toTrump in 2016.Still, this year various polls appear to agree that the US is heading to a close presidential election next month.Control of the Senate and House of Representatives will also be up for grabs on November 5.A New York Times poll on Friday predicted bad news for Democrats’ hopes of protecting their narrow majority in the Senate.The Democrats currently control the 100-member chamber with 51 seats, including four independents who caucus with the party.But the Times survey found that Democrats are likely to lose a potentially decisive seat in a Republican-leaning state.Republicans were already expected to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia – where conservative Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.But the Times poll indicated Democratic Senator Jon Tester is trailing his Republican opponent by eight percentage points in rural Montana, where Trump won with ease in 2016 and 2020.Democrats will also have a fight on their hands to keep Senate seats in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and Nevada, but they will be hoping to challenge Republican incumbents in Texas and Florida.A Republican-controlled Senate can prove to be a major hurdle for Harris should she win in November.Beyond its legislative powers, the Senate is tasked with confirmingjudicial appointmentsand cabinet members, which would allow Republicans to pressure Harris, should she be elected, on who she chooses for her governing team."

Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier ...",28 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier under Biden.Mumbai, India –Parneesh Mehta’s diamond jewellery business may be performing much better than many other companies around the world suffering from the crushing force of lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.But the entrepreneur based in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, says that is little consolation for the revenue he has lost because of tariff hikes on the gems and jewellery sector in his biggest export market – the United States.In April 2019, the US withdrew India and Turkey from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), an import duty exemption on certain goods – including Mehta’s jewels – that require a lot of manpower to make, from developing countries.“That really hurt us,” Mehta told Al Jazeera. “We had to adjust our prices for some of our clients. For others, we dropped the quality of the gems.”With both exporters and importers feeling the pinch, Mehta says the added tax will prevent businesses from growing. “Everyone’s getting squeezed,” he said. “If the GSP was restored, there’s no doubt it would help the sector as a whole”.Mehta’s experience is one example of how the India-US economic relationship has changed under the administration of US President Donald Trump. And why many Indian entrepreneurs like him have a keen interest in who occupies the White House after the November 3 US elections.Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the US’s trade deficit with India, which stood at $28.8bn in 2019, nearly three times the $10.6bn figure in 2008. In March 2019, he called India “a very high-tariff nation” and has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to redress the gap. India later retaliated, raising duties on 28 US products.Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have famously enjoyed afriendly rapport, but analysts say Trump’s punitive policies have made the economic environment more contentious. The two sides have repeatedlyfailed to signeven a “mini trade deal” that had initially been expected in September 2019.“There’s been a lot of positive engagement, but in reality, we are far from getting anything ratified,” Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi told Al Jazeera.This could change if Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, becomes the next US president and brings with him a more measured policymaking machine.“A Biden administration would not necessarily back down on big-ticket requests,” says Dhar, referring to the US’s push for greater access to India’s agriculture, medical device and e-commerce markets, and even for lower import tariffs on Harley Davidson motorbikes.“But we’d be unlikely to see the same aggression towards trade partners. This could lead to a better outcome for Indian negotiators”.Trump’s trade policies and negotiating stance may be based on populist impulses, but India is also taking an increasingly protectionist line.India’s incoming data protection bill has become one of the thorniest issues in negations.The bill threatens to prevent Indian data from leaving its shores, making life difficult for global technology giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google that rely on the free-flow of data.It also threatens to tax digital companies in a way that would also disproportionately affect US technology firms. The US has called this type of taxation “unfair” and “discriminatory” and has said it will “begin investigations” into how its trading partners are implementing such laws.After its economy suffered a historic shock (gross domestic product shrank by a record 23.9 percent in the April-June quarter), exacerbating an urgent need to create more blue- and white-collar jobs, analysts say India cannot afford to close itself off from negotiating a more favourable US trading relationship.“India needs to recognise that a trade relationship with the US is extremely beneficial for economic growth,” Anupam Manur, a research fellow at the Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately though, we may see nationalistic jingo and political point-scoring continue to take the upper hand”.However, recent investments by Facebook and Google in Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, could drive a change of mindset.Reliance is India’s largest and most influential company. With two major US tech giants taking a seat each on its board, analysts say this could strengthen the hand of US companies lobbying the Indian government to liberalise a wide range of issues governing India’s digital platforms.For this reason “I wouldn’t rule out a policy U-turn,” said JNU’s Dhar.But, regardless of the outcome of the US election, analysts believe progress on a trade agreement will hinge on the US securing greater access to India’s huge, yet fragmented, agricultural markets.India, however, is reluctant to endanger its mostly small-scale, independent producers by forcing them to compete with giant US agribusinesses. And with the global economic downturn set to drag on, as well as a strong farming lobby to placate at home, observers say a future Biden administration would likely take a hard line similar to Trump’s.September’shistoric changes to India’s farm laws, which will open up produce markets to private players, could also complicate matters. “Farmers already have apprehensions about these ordinances,” said Dhar. “Allowing American access on top of that means the situation could become very problematic”.With US unemployment at a high 8.4 percent and the country experiencing the toughest economic conditions since the Great Depression, analysts say there may be little political room for either of the two contenders to deviate from the US’s existing – and increasingly nativist – trade policies.“Let’s remember that Biden also has a ‘Made in America’ plan and has made an effort to appear tough on China,” explained Takshashila Institution’s Manur. “His talk of subsidising industry, which is against the World Trade Organisation rules, tells me he will also be protectionist”.The White House’s recent announcement of plans to reduce the number of visas awarded to skilled workers by a third is one such area where Biden’s hands may be tied.Last year, 74.5 percent of so-called H1-B visas were claimed by Indians, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, plugging a shortage of highly skilled labour in the US’s technology industries. High-profile Indian CEOs such as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Google’s parent Alphabet have also played an outsized role in contributing to Silicon Valley’s success.Despite this, Indians look set to miss out on future opportunities.“Like with the 2008 global financial crisis, the immigration issue has become mixed up in the feelings surrounding the downturn,” says Dhar. “[Biden] will eventually re-look at visa policies once the economy rebounds, but not before that”.But a change of US leadership could mean a return to more nuanced, rules-based decision-making. Consequently, there are hopes in India that the Iran nuclear deal, originally signed under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and abandoned by Trump, will be back on the table.This would help India, which lost an important export market, a valuable source of cheap oil and a potential stake in a key port by complying with US sanctions. “Iran has always been a strategic ally in the region,” says Dhar. “I hope this situation would improve if a new administration comes in”.India is likely to remain a key ally for the US as geopolitical tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific region. In a speech during his visit to India earlier this year, Trump clubbed the two nations together as “powerful defenders of peace and liberty”, drawing a blunt contrast with China – the other great regional power. Biden too has said he would “stand with India”, promising to tackle terror threats in the region together.As the US decouples itself from China’s economy, India is trying to take its place. Modi has pitched India as a “trusted partner” and welcomed foreign direct investment. In reality, US businesses are reluctant to leave China or disrupt their supply chains; and for the few that do, India is unlikely to be their preferred destination.“At most, US companies are hedging, perhaps moving 30 percent of their operations to Vietnam or Laos – India is not attractive to companies yet,” said Takshashila Institution’s Manur. But the current reforms to labour and land laws, which would make it easier for foreign businesses to set up shop in India, could change that, he added.India’s attempts to supplant undemocratic China and take advantage of the US’s boycotts and bans of Chinese technology firms may also invite increased scrutiny of its own human rights record.US Democrats have indicated they will call out human rights abuses around the world. After India withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir – the region it administers in part while Pakistan administers the other – and imposed a military lockdown on its residents, Biden’s vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, reminded observers: “We are watching”, suggesting a potential sore spot in India-US relations.Harris has repeatedly shown that despite her being part Indian, she may not be an easy ally for the Modi government. After India’s external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar cancelled a meeting last year when the US House Affairs Committee refused to exclude Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal – a critic of India’s Kashmir policy – Harris actively defended Jayapal’s presence, ruffling diplomatic feathers in the process.But not everyone believes that such conversations would harm the India-US economic relationship. A trade policy expert wishing to remain anonymous told Al Jazeera: “Modi has a thick skin about these things. Any criticism of human rights will wash off his back”.Tish Sanghera is a journalist based in Mumbai, where she writes about economic, political and social issues. Twitter: @TishSanghera"

The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to the presidential election on ...,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"The move comes as Republicans increasingly emphasise the chance of noncitizen voting, despite little evidence of any significant risk posed.The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to thepresidential electionon November 5.The lawsuit, filed on Friday, comes in response to an executive order issued in August by Virginia’s Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin.It initiated the removal of individuals from voter registration rolls if officials are “unable to verify that they are citizens” through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.But the Justice Department says the executive order was issued with too little time before election day, violating a 90-day “quiet period” outlined in The National Voter Registration Act.That period requires official systematic removals at least three months ahead of a federal vote.“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Assistant US Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.“The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.”Youngkin had issued his order on August 7, which marked 90 days until the election. In a statement on Friday, the governor argued the executive order fell within the law.“Virginians – and Americans – will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy,” Youngkin said.He pledged state authorities “will defend these common-sense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us”.“Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period,” Youngkin said.Republicans and allies of former President Donald Trump – the current Republican candidate for the presidency – have increasingly pushedunfounded claimsof possible election malfeasance ahead of this year’s vote.Those claims echo falsehoods spread about the 2020 election, which Trump has continued to falsely say was “stolen” through fraud.Some Republican officials have also advanced baseless claims that noncitizens are voting in large enough numbers to affect the outcome. In the US, only citizens can vote.Most voter administration is determined by state officials and legislatures, with only broad parameters from the federal government. Nearly all US states require some form of voter registration to cast a ballot, although many allow the registration to be done on election day.Ahead of the 2024 elections, several states – including Texas, Tennessee, Ohio and Alabama – have passed measures requiring higher burdens of proof to show a voter’s citizenship. Democracy monitors said those efforts may disenfranchise US citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote.The Brennan Center for Justice – a non-partisan policy organisation – found that noncitizen voting in the US is exceedingly rare. There is no evidence it had any bearing on recent elections.In 2017, the centre releaseda studylooking at 23.5 million votes cast in the 2016 general election.Only 30 votes were flagged for suspected noncitizen voting. Data was not available on how many of those votes proved to have been cast by noncitizens."

All to know in 500 ...,"Sep 21, 2024 ... Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.",Last update 22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.Election day in the United States may still be several weeks away, but Americans in several parts of the country are getting a chance to cast their ballots already.In-person, advanced voting became possible in the US states of Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia this week while several other states opened up their mail-in voting processes earlier this month.Both are forms of “early voting”, a mainstay of US elections that in recent years has become a target offalse voter fraud accusations.Rights advocates say robust early voting opportunities help ensure more people can cast a ballot regardless of disability, time constraints, work, travel or other factors that could hamper them on election day, which this year is on November 5.Early voting also offers an opportunity to build enthusiasm: When Taylor Swift, who recentlyendorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, announced she would perform in Florida just before early voting begins there in October, local Democrats quickly seized on the moment.“Taylor is bringing the Eras Tour to Miami in the weekend leading up to early voting, and I look forward to seeing that energy play out in Florida!!!” the Miami-Dade Democratic Party said.Voting in US presidential elections is only broadly steered by the federal government. US states determine much of how the logistics of the vote plays out in their respective jurisdictions.Currently, every state in the country allows some form of early voting, with mail-in voting the most prevalent option.At least eight of the 50 states send all registered voters a ballot in the mail while 14 still require voters to provide a reason for why they need to cast their ballot – sometimes known as an “absentee ballot” – by mail.Most states also provide in-person voting before election day. Only three states do not.That depends on the year.In the 2020 election, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100 million voters cast their ballots before election day — representing about two-thirds of all Americans who voted that year, a record.Americans living abroad, members of the US military and people with disabilities are among the many who have traditionally chosen to vote early.A 2001 Supreme Court ruling upheld that voters did not need to provide a reason to cast an early ballot, as long as their state allows it.Early voting — in particular, mail-in voting — was at the centre of unfounded election fraud claims in 2020.That’s because Democrats have historically cast more votes by mail than Republicans, who are more likely to vote on election day. Many jurisdictions count votes cast in person before they begin counting mail-in votes although the process varies.That can create a “blue shift” or “red mirage”, in which early results in key states appear to initially show the Republican candidate leading, only to shift to the Democratic candidate as the mail-in votes are counted.In 2020, then-President Donald Trump falsely said the mail-in votingsystem was rife with fraud. The Republican ultimately lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, but he has continued to claim the vote was stolen from him.Many state legislaturesenactednew restrictions on early voting after the 2020 contest, including higher scrutiny for ballots cast by mail.But the Republican Party has more fully embraced early voting this year as Trump runs again against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris."

Homeless Americans face challenges in voting during the 2016 US elections, but many still exercise their right.",Last update 17 Sep 2016,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Homeless Americans face challenges in voting during the 2016 US elections, but many still exercise their right.Washington, DC –Inside the wide, sunlit foyer of the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library, Eric Sheptock points to an expansive mural of the late civil rights activist.“I wish that the poor people of today were as willing to fight for justice as those who marched with Martin Luther King,” he says. “It seems that the poor have lost heart and are less willing to stand up for themselves.”Sheptock, who has been intermittently homeless since 1994, has become an activist for Washington DC’s homeless community, which he hopes will vote in the forthcoming elections when Americans head to the polls to choose their 45th president.“There is no reason for a homeless person not to vote,” he tells Al Jazeera. “You can’t be denied the right to vote because you’re homeless.”While it is difficult to register to vote without a permanent address, it is not impossible.Many states nowallow individuals to list the placethey generally occupy as their residence, which can include a shelter or even a park bench. However, the requirement for official identification when voting can cause challenges for the homeless – obtaining a state-issued ID can be both complicated and costly.But, as political discussions take place in living rooms across the United States, Washington DC’s homeless community also engages in its own political discourse – equally as captivated by the ongoing presidential campaign as the wider public, according to Sheptock. “I do hear a lot of homeless people talking about politics … We’ve had some pretty energetic conversations about Trump versus Clinton.”He explains that free newspapers, televisions in homeless shelters and internet access in public libraries are invaluable sources of information on the presidential campaign.READ MORE: New York’s homeless left out in the coldFifty-one-year-old Tony Leonard has been living on the streets of DC since losing his job and subsequently his home in 2011. He says that the city’s homeless community is very politically active. “A lot of us [who are] homeless in DC are educated people who had lives before but lost everything.”Come November, Leonard will be voting for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, citing her political experience as his motive. As for her opponent, Republican candidate Donald Trump, “He’s a joke,” Leonard says. “I don’t think anyone thinks he’d make a good president.”Sheptock says he won’t be voting for Trump either. He tells Al Jazeera that he is torn between Green Party Leader Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton. “All I can say right now is that I plan to vote for a woman”.Yet, while the majority of homeless interviewed for this article expressed their support for Clinton, not all were averse to Trump’s message.Jeffrey McNeill claims to have worked as a doorman at Trump’s Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City for three years before he lost everything to gambling.He subsequently moved to Washington DC in 2007, where he would spend the next three years of his life sleeping on the pavement and in shelters. McNeill bought Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal, which he said changed his life forever.“It was the greatest book ever; it taught me about the economy, how to make deals, how to make money and how to get a job.” The book taught him to be a good businessman, he says.Ultimately, however, McNeill explains he feels let down by the Democratic administration. “I was a lifelong Democrat; I voted for Obama twice … but there are more homeless people in the city now than when I arrived. I did better under Republican presidents than I have done under Obama.”America’s hidden homeless: Life in the Starlight MotelMore than 500,000 people in the United States were without housing on any given night last year, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 2015 annualreport.In Washington DC,the number of homeless reached 7,298 in 2015.Experts say a lack of formal data on homeless voters means it is difficult to measure their electoral participation. However,statistically, people from lower-income backgrounds have been less likely to vote than those with higher incomes.“There are a good number of people experiencing homelessness who care about voting. It’s no different to the population at large,” said David Pirtle, a public education coordinator for the National Homeless Coalition, who has himself experienced homelessness.But, there are variations. People living in shelters or transitional housing are far more likely to vote than those with no form of accommodation at all, said Pirtle. “People who are literally living on the street probably have the lowest turnout because a lot of those folks are dealing with other serious issues apart from being homeless, for example, mental health [or] substance abuse.”Pirtle added that many of these individuals “may not be capable or interested in the process”.WATCH – Voters’ Rights: What’s Happening to American Democracy?David Lee Norris, 59, and his wife, Naomi Macmillan, 53, are among this group. Home for them is an underpass next to Washington DC’s Union Railway Station. Having both suffered from drug-addiction, they moved from their home in South Carolina in January in the hope of receiving better healthcare for Naomi, who is HIV-positive.Any assistance they receive comes from NGOs, not the government, according to Norris.“The government is doing nothing … they are the reason we are here,” he says. “That’s why I’m not voting.”Obtaining information on voting procedures is very much down to the individual, which can be an extra challenge for those experiencing homelessness, said Julian Johannesen, director of research and training at Nonprofit Vote.“The government does not help anyone to vote here; you don’t even know where the registration form is,” Johannesen tells Al Jazeera. “People who are already under enormous stress and … have bigger priorities that occupy their attention can benefit from having some help getting over the administrative hurdles.”Ken Martin, has been homeless in Washington DC since 2012, and while he will be voting in November, he agrees that for many homeless, it is a challenge.“When you are worrying about whether or not you’re going to have a roof over your head or a place to eat or a place to get a shower, you’re not thinking about who’s going to be in the Oval Office – you’re thinking about just making it through the day,” says the 62-year-old.For the women at Washington DC’s N Street Village, a shelter and recovery centre for homeless and low-income women, lively discussions on the elections are commonplace. Hillary Clinton’s healthcare policies feature particularly high on the agenda during such conversations.“She’s interested in women’s care, mental health … She’s determined to make sure that women are well-taken care of when she gets to the White House,” says Mary, who lost everything after health problems led to costly and unmanageable medical bills and asked to be identified using a pseudonym.Cheryl Barnes, meanwhile, who has previously been homeless for 30 years, after suffering from substance and alcohol abuse, says the N Street Village saved her, and come November, she’ll also be voting for Hillary Clinton.Another resident at the N Street Village, Julia Miller, says she doesn’t align with any particular party. “I like Trump,’ says Miller who has been living at the shelter for five years. “[He] has an economic plan for the country, and I think … he’ll bring more jobs to the United States.”When it came to voting, Miller said that people should not be stereotyped because of their economic situation. “Everyone should be allowed to vote, that’s how homeless people get legislative action to …change the situation and access more resources.”She said that no matter which candidate becomes president, she wants them to provide more resources for the homeless.In the future, there needs to be a more focused campaign about voting, according to Pirtle.“We spend a lot of money in this country to get the general population to vote,” he says. “We shouldn’t leave our homeless neighbours aside.”Voting can also have a very positive emotional effect, he adds. “The general feeling [people] can get living on the street is that they are isolated, that they don’t have a voice, but getting people to participate in the electoral process … can have a very beneficial effect on their morale.”Sitting in the cool foyer of the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library, Sheptock emphasises that the space has become a sanctuary for many of the homeless community wanting to escape the city’s blistering summer heat. Ultimately, he wants people to vote no matter what their circumstance.“If you don’t vote, then you can’t fuss and nag about what the politicians do,” he says. “If you do vote, that earns you the right to complain about what government does.”Follow Jessica Sarhan on Twitter@JessicaSarhan"

This isShereena Qazi, taking over from Joseph Stepansky.The outcome of the presidential elections will have little effect on US-Europe trade relations, France’s finance chief asserted, saying Washington is unlikely to drop its confrontational stance whether Trump wins or not.The US administration has inflicted billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on European imports over the past four years, with Trump claiming unfair barriers against American firms trying to compete on continental markets.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has repeated his country’s stance on the US presidential race, saying it is not important who wins but what actions the next president takes towards sanctions on Iran.“What is important for us is that America returns to respecting the Iranian nation. We want respect instead of sanctions, no matter who is [in office]. If he lifts the unfair and illegal sanctions and replaces them with respect, then our situation will be different,” Rouhani said in a televised speech.4 Nov 2020 - 12:32 GMTGerman Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warns the US is facing a “very explosive situation” and a possible systemic crisis after Trump prematurely declared election victory.Following Trump’s remarks that he will go to the Supreme Court to stop ballots from being tallied, Kramp-Karrenbauer told public broadcaster ZDF: “This election has not been decided … votes are still being counted.”She said Trump could create “a constitutional crisis in the USA”, calling such a scenario “something that must deeply concern us”.Despite incomplete results from several battleground states that could determine the outcome of the US presidential race, Trump prematurely claimed victory over Biden.The move confirmed worries that Trump would seek to dispute the election results.Read morehereabout the different ways the election can be contested.The Associated Press news agency has not declared a winner in Wisconsin’s presidential contest because the race between Trump and Biden is too early to call.Trump, who is locked in a tight battle with Biden to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win, prematurely claimed early on Wednesday that he was “winning” the state.Biden is ahead of Trump by fewer than 8,000 votes out of nearly 3.2 million cast.Gold fell more than 1 percent as the dollar emerged as the favoured safe haven from a much closer presidential race than investors expected following Trump’s strong performance in some swing states.Spot gold fell 1.1 percent to $1,887.76 an ounce by 11:02 GMT. US gold futures dropped 1.2 percent to $1,888.The dollar rose 0.2 percent against major currencies.Chinese social media users watched election day in the US with bemusement and mockery, as Trump complained of a “major fraud on our nation” and prematurely claimed victory.“Whether he wins or loses, his final mission is to destroy the appearance of American democracy,” one user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform wrote.“Let Trump be re-elected and take the US downhill,” another wrote.Relations between China and the US are at their worst in decades over disputes ranging from technology and trade to Hong Kong and the coronavirus, and the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of sanctions against Beijing.Biden’s campaign manager called Trump’s call for vote counting to stop “outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect”.“It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens,” said Biden’s campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon.“It was unprecedented because never before in our history has a president of the United States sought to strip Americans of their voice in a national election.“And it was incorrect because it will not happen. The counting will not stop. It will continue until every duly cast vote is counted.”The AP news agency issued a bulletin saying it is not calling the presidential race yet, despite Trump’s claims of victory, because neither candidate has secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win.Speaking from the White House at 02:30 ET, Trump said: “Frankly, we did win this election.”The president said he would go to the Supreme Court to stop the counting of mail ballots.“His assertion of victory does not match the results and information currently available to the AP,” the news service reported.Several key states are too early to call, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan the agency said.Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland has sent this report from Tucson, Arizona.Democrat Mark Kelly has won a US Senate seat for Arizona, beating Republican Martha McSally for the seat once held by Senator John McCain, who died in August 2018.“Tonight is not about celebrating, tonight is about getting to work,” Kelly told a small crowd in Tucson earlier in the evening.He spoke about the hardships Arizonans have faced owing to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying many small businesses are in peril in the southwest state.The Democrat leader said he would strive for policies to set back Trump’s crackdown on immigration, lowering healthcare costs and the need to “rebuild the economy – and it’s going to be a massive undertaking”.A centrist Democrat and former astronaut, Kelly first opened a large lead over McSally as the vote counting got under way in the southwest state.4 Nov 2020 - 08:05 GMTAl Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this report from Raleigh, North Carolina.At 2:30am (07:30 GMT), the presidential race in North Carolina was still too close to call.Trump was leading Biden by about 76,700 votes, with 95 percent of expected votes counted.According to the State Board of Elections, roughly 117,000 absentee ballots have not yet been returned.Those ballots, if postmarked by Election Day, can still be counted if they arrive by November 12.The close race did not stop Trump from prematurely declaring “a big win in North Carolina” during televised remarks early on Wednesday morning.Democrat Mark Kelly defeats Republican Senator Martha McSally in Arizona’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency.Democratic presidential Biden and senate candidate Kelly have been declared the winners in Arizona, according to the AP news agency.The win gives Biden 11 votes in the Electoral College that Trump had won in 2016.🇺🇸 Biden wins Arizona 🗳️ Live results 👉 https://aje.io/c33haPosted byAl Jazeera EnglishonTuesday, November 3, 2020Cindy McCain, the widow of late Senator John McCain, a Republican, had endorsed Biden.Biden got strong support from voters in the Phoenix area, Maricopa County, where the majority of the state’s population resides.Read morehere4 Nov 2020 - 07:46 GMTPresident Trump prematurely claims victory in the presidential election, before vote counting has ended, and suggested Democrats were engaged in fraud as key states continued to count hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots.“This is a fraud on the American public.

He also predicted a “big” win for himself.We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 4, 2020Twitter labelled his tweet as making a “potentially misleading claim about an election”.Trump’s tweets came immediately after a statement from Biden, who said he was optimistic about his prospects of winning.Biden spoke from Delaware shortly after midnight, saying he is optimistic he is going to win the US presidential election.“We knew this was going to go long … but look, we feel good about where we are. We believe we are on track to win this election,” Biden said.“It ain’t over ‘til every vote is counted, every ballot is counted.“We are confident about Arizona … We’re also just calling for Minnesota and we are still in the game in Georgia … And we are feeling really good about Wisconsin and Michigan … We are going to win in Pennsylvania. Keep the faith guys, we are going to win this.”Shortly after Biden gave an election night speech, Trump tweeted he would speak tonight.Florida and its 29 electoral votes were a must-win for Trump. If he wound up losing there, it would have significantly narrowed his path to 270 electoral votes.Early indications are that Trump, although losing Miami-Dade, the most populous county in Florida, improved his vote total there, from 2016. Florida political experts are crediting Trump’s improvement with Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade with helping him to victory.At the beginning of the evening, we listed Florida as one of the “super seven” states that if Biden flipped early on, it would have signalled a potentially clear path for him. The other six states on that list – Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and Iowa – are still too close to call. Biden’s clear path is much muddier now after Florida lands in Trump’s column.Our analysis still holds true: If Biden can win two of those six, especially two large states, it makes it that much more difficult for Trump to hit 270. But given the close counts in those other states, as well as the other Trump 2016 states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – we are in for an extremely long night or, perhaps, another long day tomorrow waiting for final results.Read morehereThe AP has called Montana and Iowa for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump 9 more electoral votes.The AP has called Ohio for the Republican Party, giving Trump 18 electoral votes.Biden is set to speak at 00:30 ET from Wilmington, Delaware, according to his campaign.While key Democratic-leaning cities like Detroit, Michigan and Philadelphia have halted counting, Trump’s team “have started to feel optimistic given the fact that they went into this knowing that Joe Biden had a substantial lead”.Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont filed this report from PennsylvaniaOn Election Night, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said counting the state’s millions of ballots will take time and asked voters to be patient. Voters returned a record-breaking 2.5 million mail ballots across the state, but by law, it could not start counting them until the morning of Election Day.“Counting that tremendous number of ballots will, again, take longer than we’re used to, but the extra time is just there because we want to make sure our election system is working and that each and every vote is counted,” Wolf said.“We may not know the results today, as a result, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath and, as I’ve been saying, just be patient. What’s most important is that we have accurate results and that every vote is counted, even if that takes a little longer.”By midnight local time, about 50 percent of Pennsylvania’s votes had been counted and Trump was ahead in the race.The AP news agency has called Minnesota for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 10 more electoral votes.The AP news agency has called Hawaii for the Democratic Party, giving Biden four more electoral votes.4 Nov 2020 - 04:44 GMTReynolds, reporting from Los Angeles, says Arizona could be one of the surprises of the night.“It has not been called yet, but it’s looking good for Joe Biden,” Reynolds said. “And this is extraordinary because Arizona is formerly a rock-ribbed Republican state … it hasn’t gone for a Democratic President since … 1996.”Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer filed this report from Kenosha, WisconsinAs polls close in Wisconsin, a local pizzeria is ground zero for Kenosha’s Republicans.Complete with Fox News streaming across two televisions and a cardboard cutout of the president at the door, a long table filled with various pies bisects the mask-less crowd watching the earliest results roll in.Sheila Dissmore, 57, opted to vote in person on Tuesday.“Being a full-blown patriot, I feel like it’s just extra special voting on [election] day,” she says. “Just seeing how raw and unedited the president I think is refreshing.”Living on Kenosha’s south side with her 92-year-old father through the pandemic, this summer’s civil unrest caused Dissmore to double down on her Republican beliefs.“For the first time in my life, having to lock my door, close the shutters, close everything, turn the drapes and having my father there – I’m not a gun owner, but I wish I was.”Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith has defeated Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi’s Senate race, according to the AP news agency.Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock will advance to a runoff in Georgia’s special US Senate election, the AP projects.Since no candidate in the 21-candidate field received 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off on January 5, with the winner being sworn in immediately thereafter.It is projected Loeffler edged out Republican US Representative Doug Collins to land in the top two.This is significant in that the Republicans’ Senate majority may hang in the balance until January if neither is able to claim a majority after the rest of tonight’s races are projected.Worth noting as we wait for the final projection on too-close-to-call North Carolina: Biden had not visited the state since October 18, making it one of the few key battlegrounds where he did not campaign in the final sprint.His running mate Kamala Harris did make four stops over two days in that period.For his part, Trump made five visits to North Carolina between October 21 and Election Day.Republican Roger Marshall has defeated Democrat Barbara Bollier in Kansas’s Senate race.Republican Senator James Risch has defeated Democrat Paulette Jordan in Idaho’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley has defeated Republican Jo Rae Perkins in Oregon’s Senate race.The AP has called Utah for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump six more electoral votes.4 Nov 2020 - 04:05 GMTAP has called New Hampshire for the Democratic Party, giving Joe Biden four more electoral votes.The AP calls Idaho for the Republican Party, giving Trump four more electoral votes.The AP has called California, Oregon and Washington state for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 74 more electoral votes.It is 23:00 ET (04:00 GMT) and the last polls have closed in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this reportThe Pennsylvania Commonwealth Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said there have been no serious voting issues in the state.“I’m happy to report that today’s election in the Commonwealth went remarkably smoothly,” she told reporters. “We have no major or widespread events to report … No reports of violence at any polling places today,” Boockvar added. “There were a few reports of voters feeling intimidated that were resolved by calls to the counties.”Overall, Boockvar said her team at the voter information hotline answered 5,000 calls, mostly standard issues such as late-opening polls and lines at some polling stations.Other reported issues included: an individual accidentally shooting himself in Northampton County and then driving himself to the hospital; a volunteer with the Pennsylvania Democrats being shot with a paintball gun from a moving vehicle. Boockvar said this happened right before the polls closed, without elaborating. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit on behalf of Spanish-speaking voters who were not provided language access in York, Pennsylvania.Texas “is still pretty close”, Zhou-Castro reported from Houston, Texas.“Normally by this time of night on election night pundits would have called Texas already for the Republican candidate,” She said “[But the fact that] votes are coming in and Joe Biden is still within reach of overtaking Trump … is making headlines in the state.”The AP has called Missouri for the Republican Party, giving Trump 10 more electoral votes.“This state plays a huge role in presidential elections … Donald Trump looks like he is forging ahead in this state potentially with an even wider lead than he had over Hillary Clinton,” Gallacher reported from Miami Florida.“Donald Trump really does need to win this, the largest of all the battleground states, with 29 electoral college votes.”He added that Biden “has other options to the White House including places like Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, but at the moment we are getting pretty close to this state being called.”“There is some pressure now from the Trump campaign for officials to call it, and they already tweeted out ‘Trump has won Florida’, but that is not official yet … [but] it does look like Donald Trump may take Florida which is what he actually needs to do,” he said.Not unexpectedly, Republican Tommy Tuberville has been projected as the winner of the US Senate race in Alabama, defeating Doug Jones.Tuberville, a former college football coach, was significantly outraised by Jones, but Alabama is a deeply Republican state and the outcome wasn’t in question.Jones won a special election in 2017 to replace Republican Jeff Sessions, who resigned his seat to become Trump’s attorney general. Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore, who had faced allegations of sexual misconduct.Moore ran against Tuberville and others in the Republican primary this year, but to the relief of Republicans, Tuberville won the nomination setting them on the path to reclaim the seat.4 Nov 2020 - 03:15 GMTRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been re-elected for a second term in the US House of Representatives.The rising star in the Democratic Party was easily re-elected in New York’s 14th congressional district. Ocasio-Cortezmade historyin 2018 as the youngest woman elected to Congress in US history at the age of 28, championing her working-class and Puerto Rican roots. She is the daughter of a cleaner and a father who died in his 40s.Serving NY-14 and fighting for working class families in Congress has been the greatest honor, privilege, & responsibility of my life.Thank you to the Bronx & Queens for re-electing me to the House despite the millions spent against us, & trusting me to represent you once more.https://t.co/MXG2Z2DV2F— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)November 4, 2020Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the so-called “Squad” of four freshman progressive Democratic congresswomen that includes Rashida Tlaib from Detroit, Ilhan Omar from Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley from Boston.The four represent a new emerging faction of young, progressive politicians who are pushing the established House leadership of the Democratic Party.South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham survived a re-election scare defeating well-funded Democrat Jaime Harrison.Democrats were extremely encouraged by the polls last month showing Harrison making the race much more competitive than expected in deeply Republican South Carolina.But pro-Trump Graham, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee shepherded Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, was able to pull out a victory tonight.The AP has called Kansas for the Republican Party giving Trump six more electoral votes.It is 22:00 ET (03:00GMT) and the polls have closed in Montana, Utah, Nevada and Iowa.Democrat John Hickenlooper defeated Republican Senator Cory Gardner in Colorado’s US Senate race, according to a projection from the Associated Press news agency.This is the first Republican Senate seat picked up by the Democrats tonight in their quest to take control of the Senate.Currently, Republicans have a 53-47 majority. Democrats need to net three seats to take over the Senate if Joe Biden wins the presidency, or four if Trump wins. The vice president is the tie-breaking vote and if Biden wins, Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaker in a 50-50 Senate.If Trump wins, Mike Pence would be the tie-breaking vote if the Senate ends up 50-50.“There is silence out of the Biden camp at the moment,” said Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna from Wilmington, Delaware. “All are simply watching the results and the ongoing analysis of what is happening, but nobody is breaking cover at the moment, the situation is so close, so absolutely tense in a number of states, that nobody wants to come up and make any calls at this particular point in time.”“Joe Biden said it very clearly early on in the afternoon that when he got something to say, he will come out and he will say it and very clearly this instruction has gone down to his staff, we heard very little from the Biden campaign headquarters… We understand that Joe Biden himself is still at his home here in Wilmington, Delaware in a few hours time he will come to the convention centre with his vice president nominee Kamala Harris,” he said.The AP has called Colorado for the Democratic Party, giving Biden nine more electoral votes.Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey, reporting from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania said the state is in for a long count.“The polls have only just closed in Pennsylvania and in addition to all of the ballots that were cast today, the state now has to count some two and a half million mail-in ballots, and that is only just beginning that process … which can only begin on election day by Pennsylvania law,” she said.“So this could take a while, officials are predicting it might be before the end of the week before we have really clear results, but it’s interesting to point out that Democrats returned nearly three times as many mail-in ballots as Republicans did that’s maybe why President Trump has been very worried about those mail-in ballots,” she said. “He has been attempting to discredit or delegitimise those mail-in ballots, so we had an issue earlier in the day where a judge expressed concern about some missing mail-in ballots and has ordered about two dozens mail processing centres to be searched for possible missing ballots.”People across the United States have voted in one of the most polarising presidential elections in the country’s history – and the race is also playing out on social media.The #Vote2020 and #ElectionDay hashtags are trending in most countries on Twitter, as the world closely follows the hard-fought matchup between Trump and Biden on Tuesday.Read morehere.Trying to balance out all that#ElectionDaystress eating…pic.twitter.com/zU9wlM30kg— Sierra Club (@SierraClub)November 3, 2020The AP has called the District of Columbia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three more electoral votes.The governor of Pennsylvania has confirmed the vote count in the battleground state will take longer than expected, amid a surge in mail-in voting.Pennsylvania does not start counting mail voting until Election Day and will accept ballots postmarked by November 3 for three days after. Some districts have said they will not start counting mail votes until Wednesday morning.PA Governor Tom Wolf says vote count will take longer than normal (this was anticipated due to the high volume of mail ballots)“We may not know the results today, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath."" Wolf says. “Every eligible vote will be counted, as it must be.”— Hilary Beaumont (@HilaryBeaumont)November 4, 2020Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this report from Graham, North CarolinaThe message on Election Night in Graham, where police pepper-sprayed protesters just three days before, was one of outrage and urgency – but also of hope and love.Led by Reverend Greg Drumwright, hundreds of people from across North Carolina marched quietly several blocks to two polling locations, before making their way to the central square, where a Confederate monument stands.“In the absence of hope, what do we have?” Drumwright told the crowd as they raised their fists in the air.“Therefore we cling to hope tonight,” he added. “I want you to cling to change tonight; I want you to believe that this is a shifting and a turning and a dawning of a new area; that things will not stay the same; that white supremacy will come down; that racism will come down; that love will be lifted up.”The marchers’ cheers drowned out the taunting by a small group of counterprotesters who gathered with confederate and Trump flags across the square.A judge in Nevada has ordered 30 Las Vegas-area voting sites to stay open for an extra hour tonight after a lawsuit was filed by Trump’s campaign and state Republicans.They had argued that 22 polling places did not open on time, and wanted the time extended. Lawyers for Democrats then requested that eight additional sites also stay open later.The judge granted both requests and said anyone in line at 8pm local time (04:00 GMT) would be allowed to cast a ballot.The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada shared a list of the Clark County polling sites that will stay open later.🗳️🗳️ TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO VOTE 🗳️🗳️Some Clark County polling locations have added an hour of voting tonight.

Trump won all but New Hampshire in 2016. And there are some signs in the exit polls and the vote count that show some early positive signs for Trump and Biden in different states.In Florida, Trump is keeping Biden’s margin of victory down in Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county.In North Carolina and Ohio, exit polls suggest Biden is receiving more support among suburban voters than Trump did in 2016.The Associated Press, which is one of several US media organization making calls, waits until a significant number of votes have been counted, while also analysing exit polling data, in competitive states before they make projections.Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from New Hanover CountyTrump supporters in North Carolina were energised at polling stations across the beach town of Wilmington. They were confident New Hanover County, where Wilmington is located, and the state will go red.“Trump has done a lot,” Char Marker said. “He’s done a lot of things to tackle our child sex trafficking problem that we have, which is huge to me.“I am a pro-life voter. And, you know, Trump has been one of the most pro-life presidents we’ve had yet. They say Trump is kind of like a party of his own. And if that’s the case, I’m in that party.”Across town, 22-year-old Brandon Panameno said he voted for Trump because he is not the “typical politician”.“The economy has been doing well” under Trump, he said. “I think he has a pretty good chance of winning again.”Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from rural Kenosha county, WisconsinIn rural Kenosha, Trump signs abound but not everyone is on board. In the village of Bristol, in central Kenosha county, a short line of voters are waiting to enter Bristol Village Hall where voting booths are delineated by yellow and orange traffic cones strung together with yellow rope.Tony Chacon, who moved to Bristol nine years ago from Kenosha, had just completed voting. “It’s better over here on this side of the Interstate. I feel a lot safer,” the 26-year-old said.“I’m in trade work so I’m big on keeping work in the United States,” he told Al Jazeera of his decision to vote for Trump. “He’s a businessman … someone who knows how money moves and how to move it,” said Chacon.For him, when Biden was vice president, “things were getting rough when it comes to prices of fuel.” He added that ultimately “our choices aren’t really the best” before turning to greet fellow Bristol resident, Brian Chwaszczewski, 33, who had also just voted.While he was reluctant to name the candidate he voted for, Chwaszczewski did say that “being out here in more of a rural area, I’m sure there [are] plenty of Trump supporters. I just wanted to kind of not support that.” He feels like something of an outlier in his community. “It’s Trump signs everywhere,” he said, as darkness set in.Democratic Senator Chris Coons defeated Republican Lauren Witzke in Delaware’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Dick Durbin defeated Republican Mark Curran in Illinois’ Senate race.Democratic Senator Ed Markey defeated Republican Kevin O’Connor in Massachusetts’ Senate race.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated Republican Corky Messner in New Hampshire’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Cory Booker defeated Republican Rik Mehta in New Jersey’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Jack Reed defeats Republican Allen Waters in Rhode Island’s Senate race.Republican Senator Mitch McConnell has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath in Kentucky’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency.The AP has called for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 69 electoral votes.The AP calls Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee for the Republican Party, giving Trump 33 electoral votes.It is 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Washington, DC.The AP calls South Carolina for the Republican Party, giving Trump 9 electoral votes.Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from Wilmington, North CarolinaPolls started to close in North Carolina where voters from both parties expressed optimism all day.Michael Master said he was hopeful Trump would pull out another victory in the state.“As a person, Trump puts Americans first,” Master said at a polling location in Wilmington. “And he puts especially the average American worker first.”Across the parking lot, Biden supporter Nick Rhodes said he was confident Biden would win.“We need to bring our country back together in terms of getting rid of division, and start embracing science and start bringing people together because we cannot have another four years of this,” he said.A handful of precincts in the state will stay open later because of delayed openings. We are expecting to see results from early and absentee voting to start rolling in within the next hour. In-person results will follow later this evening.The Trump campaign and Nevada Republicans are asking a state court judge to extend voting by one hour at 22 Las Vegas-area polling locations, according to the Associated Press news agency and Nevada Independent newspaperAn Election Day lawsuit filed in Clark County claims the 22 voting locations did not open on time. It was getting an immediate hearing before Judge Joe Hardy.“If immediate action is not taken, appellants will never have the opportunity to vindicate their rights,” attorneys for the two groups wrote in the filing. “More troubling, Nevadans – and the rest of the country – will be left wondering whether the results of the election are legitimate.”Election officials keep sites open until the last person in line at closing time can vote. Polling places in Nevada are scheduled to close at 22:00 ET (02:00 GMT).All polls will close in the battleground state of Florida at 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT)Here is why the state is so significant.The AP news agency calls Virginia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 13 electoral votes.A helpful road map, if you want to figure out how election night is going to shape up, is to keep an eye on seven states’ results, which we will dub the “super” seven.If Biden can win early on any of the following states that Trump won in 2016, it could indicate a positive evening for him. If Trump holds them, that will likely delay a projection of an overall winner.Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas are the states that are expected to count votes fairly efficiently and, if there’s a clear winner, are expected to be projected for one of the two candidates.If Biden picks up one, assuming he also wins all of the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he will be well on his way to 270 votes, as it will be a state flipped from Republican to Democrat. If he picks up two, that makes things even clearer and puts Biden well down the path to a potential win.Note that other key Trump states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – are not part of that list. Those states are expected to count their votes much more slowly and if Trump holds onto the other seven, will factor into many more hours, if not days, of waiting for a winner to be projected.Republican Moore has defeated Democrat Paula Jean Swearengin in West Virginia’s US Senate race.The AP calls West Virginia for the Republican Party, giving Trump five electoral votes.It is 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT) and polls have closed in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.Biden is outperforming Hillary Clinton among key voters in Georgia, according to exit polls from The Associated Press news agency.Suburban voters, who Trump won by five points in 2016, are backing Biden by double digits in this year’s exit polls. Among suburban women, Biden has the support of six in 10 of them.Turnout among Black voters has kept pace with 2016, as they make up approximately three in 10 voters this year. Biden has also kept pace with Hillary Clinton, with nine in 10 Black voters saying they support Biden.If Biden is to flip Georgia to the Democrats for the first time since 1992, he will need robust turnout from Black voters and a strong showing among suburban voters.Georgia’s polls closed at 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT), but The Associated Press news agency has not called the race as of yet.The AP exit poll surveyed more than 106,000 voters over eight days, including Election Day. The margin of error is +/-0.4 percent.Despite the US witnessing a record number of early votes in the presidential election, tens of millions of American voters headed to polling stations across the country on Tuesday.Polls began closing in the United States at 18:00 Eastern Standard Time (23:00 GMT) and closing times vary by state.Find out when the polls close in each statehere.Democratic US Senator Mark Warner defeats Republican Daniel Gade in Virginia’s US Senate race, according to AP.The AP calls Vermont for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three electoral votes.The AP calls Kentucky for the Republican Party, giving Trump eight electoral votes.It is 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Virginia and Vermont.Swing states, also known as battleground states, will have an outsize influencing in deciding the next president of the US.Watch our one-minute explainer on why.Racial justice is one of several big issues on the minds of US voters today, as the country for months has seen mass protests demanding an end to systemic racism and police violence against Black people.Janelle King, a Republican strategist, defended US President Donald Trump, saying he has helped the Black community by tackling unemployment and funding various programmes, such as historically Black colleges and universities.“He provided the Black community with policies,” she told Al Jazeera.But Derrick Plummer, a Democratic strategist, said it is false to say that Trump has done a lot to help the Black community.“When you had peaceful African Americans, Black people, in the streets saying that we want to end systemic racism, we have a president that doesn’t even think systemic racism is real,” he told Al Jazeera.Voters are quite unhappy with the direction of the country and how the federal government is working, according to The Associated Press news agency’s VoteCast data.About three-quarters of voters said they are dissatisfied or angry with the way the government is working and six in 10 say they are unhappy with the direction of the country.Trump has tweeted “we’re looking really good all over the country”.“Thank you,” the president tweeted shortly after the first polling places, in parts of Indiana and Kentucky, closed on Election Day.Indications on who is ahead in preliminary state results are expected to take hours.WE ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 3, 2020The first polls have closed on Election Day in Indiana and Kentucky.Polls closed in parts of the two states that lie within the Eastern Time zone, but those within the Central Time zone will remain open for an additional hour.Both states are considered Republican bastions, but results are not expected to begin coming in until later Tuesday.With only a few hours before polls close in Michigan on Election Day, Rashida Tlaib said she is optimistic she will be heading back to Washington, DC.An outspoken progressive, the Palestinian American legislator is up for re-election in the 13th District of Michigan – a Democratic stronghold that she is almost certain to carry.She says strong voter turnout so far in the US elections is very encouraging.“I’ve not, in all the years I’ve run for office, seen lines like this,” Tlaib told Al Jazeera, crediting the crowds in part to a desire to vote President Donald Trump out of office.“[It] gives me hope that the turnout is going to be high enough where it’s very clear that Donald Trump is not wanted as the president of the United States any more.”Read morehere.The FBI and the New York attorney general were looking into a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home on Election Day as the nation remains on high alert to ensure voting is not compromised, according to the Reuters news agency.US state and local officials have been raising the alarm over at least two separate automated call campaigns as millions of Americans cast their votes on Tuesday to decide between Trump and Biden. Experts who spoke to Reuters say they are mystified by the most prominent robocalling campaign, which has been running for months and tells people to remain home but does not explicitly mention voting.“There’s a little bit of confusion about this one across the industry,” said Giulia Porter, vice president at RoboKiller, a company that fights telemarketers and robocalls and has been tracking the campaign.Audio of the calls, which RoboKiller shared with Reuters, features a synthetic female voice saying: “Hello. This is just a test call. Time to stay home. Stay safe and stay home.”Porter said the call had been placed millions of times in the past 11 months or so but had on Tuesday shot up to number 5 or number 6 in the list of top spam calls. A Department of Homeland Security official said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the calls. The FBI said only that it was aware of reports of robocalls and had no further comment.Biden made a couple of last-minute campaign visits to Pennsylvania, stopping by his childhood home in Scranton and speaking to volunteers in Philadelphia.Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, he expects to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the three Midwest states known as the “Blue Wall”.“I think we are going to do well. We’re going to re-establish that Blue Wall,” Biden said, referring to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Trump won those states in 2016, turning them Republican for the first time in decades.Biden said this year is interesting.“You can’t think of an election in the recent past where so many states are up for grabs. The idea that I’m still in play in Texas, in Georgia, in Florida,” he said. And said he would wait for a result before speaking later on election night.“There’s so much in play out there and an overwhelming vote out there. If there’s something to say tonight, I’ll come out and say it, otherwise, I will wait until all the votes are counted.”Speaking to reporters Tuesday outside a Delaware community centre, Biden said he’s “superstitious” about offering predictions for election night but remains “hopeful”.He added he has heard from aides that there is “overwhelming turnout” among young people, women and older Black adults in places like Georgia and Florida.“The things that are happening bode well for the base that has been supporting me – but we’ll see,” he said. “It’s just so uncertain” because of how many states are in play.Al Jazeera’s Chris Moody has sent this report from Safety Harbor, FloridaDesirae Braverman, a 20-year-old who was eager to vote in her first presidential election this year, showed up in person in the final hours on Election Day after her father accidentally threw away the mail-in ballot she ordered.“He doesn’t pay attention sometimes,” she said of her dad after voting in person in the town library. “I was like, I have no choice but to come down here now last minute. I wanted to do my little part, even if it doesn’t mean that much. I wanted to get out there and say, ‘My vote counts’.”To both presidential campaigns this election cycle, Braverman’s vote actually matters quite a lot: Her small bayside town, Safety Harbor, is located in Pinellas County, one of the most important swing counties in Florida, which is in one of the nation’s most critical battleground states.Pinellas voted for George W Bush in 2004, then supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, only to swing back into Republican hands and vote for Donald Trump in 2016. And this year, it is once again up for grabs in a state likely to face a close outcome. The county is narrowly split between registered Republicans and Democrats, making turnout numbers essential in a tightly contested place like this.Biden’s campaign sent the Democratic nominee’s wife, Jill Biden, to make a last-minute stop on the morning of Election Day to encourage voters.Braverman, a college student who said she cares about social issues such as preserving rights to same-sex marriage and abortion, cast her vote for Biden.”It kind of felt a little liberating because it was my first time,” she said. “It felt good. And I got my little sticker.”Coronavirus and the economy are the top issues among US voters, according to the Associated Press’ VoteCast data. And voters don’t have positive feelings about how both are being dealt with.About 4 in 10 voters named the pandemic as the top issue facing the US, while 3 in 10 said the economy and jobs were most important.About half of US voters said coronavirus is not at all under control. On the economy, 6 in 10 said the economy is in poor shape.On the issue of law enforcement, of which Donald Trump has made the former a important campaign theme, only 4 percent said that was the country’s top issue.Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland filed this report from Phoenix, ArizonaA slow but steady stream of voters arrived at the Epworth United Methodist Church in Phoenix, Arizona’s capital. Poll volunteers informed new arrivals where to go to cast their ballots, while another group handed out free meals to voters as they left.Feed the Polls is a volunteer initiative that brings together organisations and eateries to keep voters fed while they are waiting at the polls.“Today we are set to give out 2,000 meals,” said Maria Parra Cano of Sana Sana Foods, one of the groups that teamed up with Feed the Polls.“It’s been a constant flow [of voters] all morning until now,” she told Al Jazeera. “We are really just aiming to try to solve food insecurity on this day.”Justin, 19, said he cast his first-ever vote for President Donald Trump, the Republican incumbent.“The most important thing for me is obviously the economy – we need a strong economy,” said Justin, who declined to provide his surname. “And then law and order is a big thing for me.”Justin also lauded Trump’s foreign policy, citing the recent normalisation agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.“It’s a crazy world we live in right now and this election is a big election, just like any election,” Justin added.His friend Robert, a 26-year-old old business student, said the most important issue for him is taxation. On Tuesday he voted for Trump, just like in 2016.“The civil unrest and everything – I feel like there needs to be something done,” said Robert, who also declined to provide his last name.“And then I think Trump is going to be the one to stop the lockdown,” he added, referring to restrictions over the coronavirus pandemic. “I think it’s time everybody goes back to work.”Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this update from South Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaDJs Ronald Coleman, 33, and Jarkeer Lassiter, 29, danced to Come Closer by Whiz Kid ft. Drake outside a South Philadelphia polling station. They already voted for Biden with mail ballots and now their goal is to get out the vote for Biden by DJing at the polls. They are part of an effort across Philadelphia bringing DJs and free food to voters.Philadelphia voter turnout is high this election, but it is still unclear if it will be high enough to help the Democrat win Pennsylvania.Asked why he voted for Biden, Coleman said, “My mom.” He wants Biden to follow through on his promise to improve healthcare. “Medicare, all the stuff for the older people,” Coleman added. He said people in Philadelphia have been rioting for their rights after the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr, who was Lassiter’s cousin.“It just hit too close to home for me,” Coleman said. “I just hope it gets better.”Coleman and Lassiter said a lot of first-time voters were making their voices heard in Philadelphia this election. Lassiter said he voted for Biden because Trump failed to contain the pandemic and had stoked racial tension. “It’s like, if he’s in the White House, it’s OK to be [openly racist].”Electing Biden will send a message, he said. “If we get Biden in there, we have to do better.”3 Nov 2020 - 22:08 GMTAl Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from Kenosha, WisconsinThe Kenosha Unified School District is a sprawling, yet nondescript building on the city’s 52nd Street thoroughfare.On Election Day, its parking lot is brimming with cars including one with a man playing guitar and singing from the bed of a pick-up truck. The glass doors of the building’s entrance are flanked by two pairs of volunteers wearing yellow crew-neck sweatshirts that read “Election Defender”.“It’s a nonpartisan group that is organising … to make sure that voters are taken care of, especially in places where there are long lines,” explained Rena Singer. “It felt good to have something to do today,” she said of the group’s efforts to hand out snacks, personal protective equipment and anything else voters need to make it through the process.Inside, the sterile and fluorescent-lit hallways and rooms are dedicated to same-day voter registration and in-person voting.“Everybody has been in such a good mood, even the voters,” said the location’s chief inspector, Shawnna Smith. “I’m pretty proud of how well curbside voting is going – we don’t usually have that,” she said of the pandemic-inspired practice.Volunteers in yellow vests gather voters’ information, grab a ballot from inside that the voters complete from outside before the voters return them indoors to be counted. “People are taking advantage of it. Instead of risking coming in here, they’re just doing it curbside. It’s safe for them and everybody else,” Smith said.3 Nov 2020 - 21:31 GMTWall Street’s main stock indexes rallied as investors hope a clear winner will emerge from an exceptionally divisive US presidential election.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session up more than 554 points or just more than 2 percent at 27,480.03 – it had been up more than 700 points earlier in the session.The S&P 500 – a gauge for the health of US retirement and college savings accounts – closed up 1.78 percent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index finished the session up 1.85 percent.Tuesday’s strong finishes extended Monday’s gains. Though storefronts across the country have been boarded up in case violence erupts once the polls close, Wall Street is optimistic that a clear winner will be determined.Read morehere.3 Nov 2020 - 20:11 GMTAl Jazeera’s Chris Moody sent this report from West Tampa, FloridaJill Biden, wife of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, made a last-minute appearance in a predominantly Latino neighbourhood of West Tampa today to boost turnout in this crucial battleground state.Speaking to only a few dozen supporters, mostly volunteers who have backed her husband’s campaign, she emphasised unity before the polls close later tonight. “There is nothing – nothing – we can’t do when we come together with courage and grit,” she told the crowd, who wore masks and stood several feet apart from each other.“Donald Trump is in this for himself. Nothing more, nothing less. And he wants us to believe that we’re all the same, that we’re unhopeful and angry and selfish and divided. But today, we are going to show him who we are.”The appearance outside “Casa Biden”, an independent volunteer office where people have spent months drumming up support for Biden in an area with large Cuban and Puerto Rican populations, was scheduled at the 11th hour to try to increase voter turnout.“This is where the highest concentration of Hispanic voters are,” said Elio Muller, who directs the volunteer operations. “Our precincts are usually 60 percent turnout Democrat.”Al Jazeera’s Jennifer Glasse reflects on casting a ballot in the US after decades abroad.Read more here.3 Nov 2020 - 19:02 GMTAl Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this update from Wilmington, North Carolina.Ricardo Thomas woke up this morning feeling energised. The 35-year-old Wilmington, North Carolina-native was anxious to get to the polls to cast his first-ever ballot.“It was like the first day of school,” he told Al Jazeera. Upon leaving the polling station, Thomas said he was “feeling good”.Thomas explained that while he did not really have an interest in voting before this election, but when COVID-19 hit him and his community especially hard, he started to learn more about the candidates.“I live below the line anyway, so [often election outcomes] would never affect us,” he told Al Jazeera. “Because we don’t know what it is to have the amount of money that the people around us that we provide our services for have,” he said.“When the COVID came, I lost my job, and it really set me back, back, back.” And that’s when he says he knew he had to vote, and “be a part of change and history”.3 Nov 2020 - 18:43 GMTAl Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this dispatch from Kenosha, WisconsinElection Day is off to the races in Wisconsin.Erin Decker, chair of the Republican Party of Kenosha County, said she expects “record-high turnout” today, while Lori Hawkins, chair of the Kenosha County Democrats, said she told her children that they are witnessing history.Inside Kenosha’s municipal building, hallways dedicated to central count efforts – to tally absentee ballots separately from the polls – are bustling with volunteers and city officials. Dressed in neon green shirts, dozens of poll workers are steadily counting the 57,650 ballots that have been returned so far at tables of two, spaced six feet apart.A handful of retired men wearing bright orange lanyards attached to white placards reading “election observer” around their necks are mingling among the first-floor crowd.Outside the building, resident Dennis Phillips said he had not voted yet, but that he would likely cast a ballot later for Trump – just as he did in 2016. “He’s been doing pretty good I guess,” Phillips said.Read all the updates from earlier in the dayhere."

Despite you, I and the political class, the vast majority of Americans are not paying attention to the election,” said Erik Nisbet, a professor of policy analysis and communications at Northwestern University.“People don’t tune in until September,” he told Al Jazeera. “At this point though, it’s important to get your narratives out. It’s important to get your base solidified and mobilised.”Most polls show a tight race between Biden and Trump as the election nears, with experts saying the contest will likely come down to how the candidates fare in critical swing states like Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.But there is also widespread frustration that the choice this election cycle is the same as in 2020, when Biden defeated Trump to win the White House.A recentPew Research Center pollfound that nearly half of all registered voters said they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot if they could.About two-thirds of respondents said they had little to no confidence that Biden is physically fit enough to be president, the poll said, while a similar number said they did not believe Trump would act ethically in office.“It is Election 2.0,” said Jan Leighley, a political science professor at American University in Washington, DC.“I think that creates a disincentive for voting, which again comes back on the campaigns to convince people that, even though it’s the same choice, there’s still a reason to vote.”For the Biden camp, the message so far has been that a vote for the Democratic incumbent is avote for democratic ideals. “Democracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot,” Biden said in January.But that message is failing to resonate among key segments of the Democratic base who are angered by the Biden administration’s unequivocal support for Israel amid its war in Gaza.The recent wave of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses has highlighted a generational divide over the US’s relationship with Israel, and that, in turn, couldpose a serious problemfor Biden as he seeks the youth vote in November.In 2020, Biden won about 60 percent support among voters aged 18 to 29.But arecent CNN pollshowed Biden trailing Trump — 51 percent to 40 percent — among voters under age 35, and experts say a lack of enthusiasm among young voters could spell trouble.“We know how college students are feeling,” said Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairperson for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party.“And I can tell you for sure that there are too many who would stay home” on November 5 if Biden does not change his Middle East policy, Pyarali added. “I doubt that people would switch over to Trump, but they would certainly not vote.”According to Nisbet at Northwestern University, Biden’s campaign needs to focus in the coming months on “getting the Democratic house in order” before it tries to appeal to the relatively small number of undecided voters in the country.Any protests at the Democratic National Convention, for example, could hurt him. Democrats will gather in Chicago in August to formally confirm Biden as their 2024 nominee.“The Democratic Party, or at least the Biden campaign, does not want any dissension within the [party] because it’s a bad visual,” said Nisbet.Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Trump’s campaign has unfolded against unprecedented legal turmoil.The former president faces four separate criminal cases, includingan ongoing trialin New York over allegations he falsified business records related to a hush-money payment made to an adult film star.While the indictments have done little so far to dent Trump’s support among Republican voters, somepolling suggeststhat a chunk of the US electorate would not vote for him if he were convicted in any of the cases.Trump is expected to be confirmed as the Republican Party’s 2024 nominee at the party’s convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.“The conventions go on over the summer, but there’s usually not a whole lot of activity campaign-wise,” said Leighley at American University.But this year might be different, given Trump’s court hearings and the pressure on Biden over the Gaza war. “Those could be unusual bumps, if you will, that provide campaigns opportunities to do more in terms of ads,” she said.Both Leighley and Nisbet saidthe US economyis always an important election issue, and it will continue to be a focus over the next few months of campaigning.Despite positive economic indicators, many Americans believe they are worse off now than when Trump was in the White House, recent polls have suggested.“There is a big gap where people, for whatever reason — it could be because of the economics, it could be a bias of memory — they look more favourably at Trump’s then-presidency than Biden’s current one overall,” said Nisbet.He added that the economy is hurting Biden among Latino and Black voters, as well as young people, all of whom are key segments of the Democratic base.“Trump will want to talk about how bad the economy is,” said Nisbet, while Biden’s team instead will “try to change the conversation” and pivot to other issues.That includes access to abortion. Biden has made defending access to reproductive healthcare a central plank of his re-election campaign, repeatedlycondemning Trumpand Republican Party lawmakers for supporting abortion restrictions.In 2022, under Trump, the US Supreme Court formed a conservative “supermajority”, allowing it tooverturn Roe v Wade, a landmark 1973 ruling that established abortion access as a constitutional right.Eliminating Roe had been a conservative priority for decades, and several Republican-led states have since enacted strict limits on abortion.According to Leighley, “there will be an emphasis on the issue of abortion and Trump’s role in that and the Republican Party and its plans” as the presidential campaigns inch closer to the fall months of September and October.That is also when the first debate between Biden and Trump could take place.The Commission on Presidential Debatesreiteratedon Wednesday that the first televised face-off between the candidates would take place on September 16, confirming dates announced late last year.The announcement came after Trump’s team had urged the commission to move the schedule forward.There has been uncertainty around the 2024 debates, particularly as Trump eschewed participating in any during the Republican primary process. But last week, both Biden and Trump said they were up for it.“I honestly don’t know if either one wants them, but it is an American tradition — and I think it really would hurt American democracy if we did not have presidential debates,” said Nesbit.“It’s a major aspect of our tradition in the United States. And having presidential debates, even if they don’t change anyone’s minds — and they rarely do — I think it’s important for Americans to hear their two candidates at least air their perspectives.”"

Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris's continued support for Israel's war in Gaza.,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Arab voters have expressed frustration with Vice President Kamala Harris’s continued support for Israel’s war in Gaza.With the United Statespresidential electionless than four weeks away, analysts caution that Israel’sexpanding military campaignsacross the Middle East could bruise the chances of the Democratic candidate, Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Foreign policy is rarely a top priority for US voters. But Israel’s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign inLebanon, have spurred questions about the US’s role in the conflict.The administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters — particularly Arab Americans — turning against the party.With Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.“This is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,” Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Now party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.”Much of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, which has erasedentire neighbourhoodsand killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.That campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in USweapons assistance.“It’s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they’ve allowed to happen,” said Zogby.“There’s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don’t matter.”ASeptember pollby the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.That figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, hissupportamong Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.Biden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.When Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old’s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.But Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series ofescalatory strikesby Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.In a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”The Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August’sDemocratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.“People are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won’t give it to them,” said Zogby. “They’re making a mistake that will cost them votes.”While US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.Many of those voters are concentrated in a small number ofswing statesthat play an outsized role in deciding the country’s presidential elections.The Midwestern battleground state ofMichigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.Polling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.And her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.“The situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,” said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.“Since we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state’s Arab community stays home on election day,” he added.But Michigan’s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.Some believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.Others view a second term for Trump, apro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should “finish the job” in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.One group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is theUncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.During primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote “uncommitted”, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.Now, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris — but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.“As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,” a spokesperson said in a video released this week.“But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”The final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.In early October, for instance, Iran launched aballistic missile attackagainst Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehin Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.On that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.Analysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.ASeptember pollby the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.Respondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel’s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.Laura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.“Republican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they’re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,” Silver said.She pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza — and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.A February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.But Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such asyoung peopleand communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.“The pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,” he said. “The Democratic Party hasn’t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren’t listening, and they’ll pay a price for that.”"

With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into ...",13 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Where do the candidates stand in the polls? We’ll break it down, along with major updates from the campaign trail.With the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into overdrive, with last-minute appeals to voters.Need a quick breakdown of the week’s biggest political news? Look no further.We’ll get you up to speed with five key takeaways from the past seven days and an overview of where the candidates stand in the polls.There are 23 days left before the November 5 election.As of October 11, the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows Vice President Kamala Harris up by 2.5 points, with 48.5 percent support compared to former President Donald Trump’s 46 percent.Another polling average, from the website 270toWin, shows Harris again with a marginal lead, with 49.3 percent support. Trump, meanwhile, is at 46.5 percent.Harris, the Democrat, could be poised to flip one of Trump’s key demographics: suburban voters.On October 10, the news agency Reuters and the market research poll Ipsos released a poll that showed Harris led her Republican rival 47 percent to 41 among suburbanites.But two days later, The New York Times and Siena College released a poll that indicated Harris could be slipping among Black voters. She pulled in 78 percent support — a drop from the estimated 90 percent support her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, earned in 2020.Within three days of forming in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Milton had billowed into a powerful Category 5 storm, earning the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Such rapid development had rarely been seen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton “one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin”.And it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.But as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.Swaths of the US South were still recovering from September’sHurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas”.On the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Bidenslapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.“Over the last few weeks, there’s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what’s going on,” Biden said, calling the distortions “un-American”.“Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,” he added.Harris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. “This is not a time for people to play politics,” she said, in reference to the Republican.Once criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of arecent media blitz.It was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.And even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.But in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.And her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.That last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.But host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing “shifting explanations”, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.The friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to “make her look better”.He also called on the Federal Communications Commission to “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE”. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission’s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.Through much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large — even dooming one candidate’s run.After a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a “weak” and “sleepy” old man.But at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.Those questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump’s “rambling” and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.And then, on Saturday, the White House released amemotouting hisDemocratic rival’s health.The 59-year-old Harris, it read, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency”.Trump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with astatement, arguing that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung wrote of Trump.On the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.Immigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump’s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.But critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.On Monday, Trumprecorded an audio interviewwith the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump said. “Now a murderer, I believe this: It’s in their genes. And we’ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”The Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.Speaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to “expedite the removal” of “savage gangs” from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.He also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.Despite Trump’s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.Reporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.In 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician’s eventual resignation.Since then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse ofTrump’s alleged relationshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.In its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.News outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book’s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump’s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an “angry, little man”.“None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,” Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.But the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley — once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.He tells Woodward in the book that Trump is “fascist to the core”."

The Democrat led 52 percent to 46 percent in the same poll last month.The latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51 percent to 48 percent among likely voters, compared with a four-point advantage last month.Following the latest figures, Harris holds a 1.4 percent point lead in Real Clear Polling’s aggregate of major polls, slipping from 2.2 percent on Saturday.The tightening poll numbers come amid concerns among Democrats that Harris is failing to shore up support among Hispanics and African Americans, two of the party’s key constituencies.While Harris is leading among women of all races, she has struggled to drum up enthusiasm among men, including African Americans and Hispanics, who have increasingly gravitated towards Trump in recent years.In The New York Times/Siena College polls released on Saturday and Sunday, Harris attracted the support of 78 percent of Black voters and 56 percent of Hispanic voters – significantly lower shares than won by the Democratic nominees in the 2020 and 2016 elections.On Thursday, former President Barack Obama admonished Black men for not showing as much enthusiasm for Harris’s candidacy as he had received during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012.“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama said at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of seven key battleground states expected to decide the election.“Because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”Harris and Trump on Sunday continued to focus their campaigns on the battleground states, holding events in North Carolina and Arizona, respectively.At a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris took aim at Trump for spreading misinformation about the government’s response to recent hurricanes.“The problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it’s making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they’re led to believe they cannot trust,” Harris said.“And that’s the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.”Trump, meanwhile, used a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona to call for the hiring of 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents.“After I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10 percent raise – they haven’t had one in a long time – for all agents and a $10,000 each retention and signing bonus,” Trump said. “We’re going to retain them.”"

All the results are within the margin of error with the exception of Nevada, where Trump is led by 5 percent in the WSJ poll.The newspaper said it surveyed 600 registered voters per state between September 28 and October 8.US elections are not won by popular vote nationwide. Rather, candidates compete in individual states to winelectoral college votes.It’s akin to a point system, where each state is worth a number of points proportionate to the size of its population. In all but two states – Maine and Nebraska – the winner takes all the electoral college votes.Most states are almost certain to go to one party. For example, a Democratic win in California and Vermont is often projected as soon as the polls close, while states like Oklahoma and Alabama are Republican strongholds.That leaves a handful of states where there are close, competitive elections. These are known asswing states. In this round, all eyes are on the seven states polled by WSJ.In 2016, Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote because he defeated the Democratic candidateHillary Clintonin most battleground states.According to a Pew Research Centersurveyreleased on Friday, Harris is leading the race nationally by one point – 48 percent to Trump’s 47 percent.US election poll results have fluctuated in recent months. While Trump enjoyed a solid lead overJoe Bidenearlier this year in almost all polls, the Democrats received a boost after the US president stepped aside and was replaced by Harris as the party’s nominee.A Morning Consult poll in September had Harris beating Trump 51 percent to 46 percent. But the former president appeared to claw back some support amid concerns about the economy and the turmoil inthe Middle East.US election polls have also been wide off the mark in the past. For example, many surveys had indicated that Clinton was set for a comfortable win when she lost toTrump in 2016.Still, this year various polls appear to agree that the US is heading to a close presidential election next month.Control of the Senate and House of Representatives will also be up for grabs on November 5.A New York Times poll on Friday predicted bad news for Democrats’ hopes of protecting their narrow majority in the Senate.The Democrats currently control the 100-member chamber with 51 seats, including four independents who caucus with the party.But the Times survey found that Democrats are likely to lose a potentially decisive seat in a Republican-leaning state.Republicans were already expected to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia – where conservative Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.But the Times poll indicated Democratic Senator Jon Tester is trailing his Republican opponent by eight percentage points in rural Montana, where Trump won with ease in 2016 and 2020.Democrats will also have a fight on their hands to keep Senate seats in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and Nevada, but they will be hoping to challenge Republican incumbents in Texas and Florida.A Republican-controlled Senate can prove to be a major hurdle for Harris should she win in November.Beyond its legislative powers, the Senate is tasked with confirmingjudicial appointmentsand cabinet members, which would allow Republicans to pressure Harris, should she be elected, on who she chooses for her governing team."

Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier ...",28 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Four more years of Trump could spell protectionist policies that make life difficult for Indian businesses, but analysts do not see things getting much easier under Biden.Mumbai, India –Parneesh Mehta’s diamond jewellery business may be performing much better than many other companies around the world suffering from the crushing force of lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.But the entrepreneur based in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, says that is little consolation for the revenue he has lost because of tariff hikes on the gems and jewellery sector in his biggest export market – the United States.In April 2019, the US withdrew India and Turkey from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), an import duty exemption on certain goods – including Mehta’s jewels – that require a lot of manpower to make, from developing countries.“That really hurt us,” Mehta told Al Jazeera. “We had to adjust our prices for some of our clients. For others, we dropped the quality of the gems.”With both exporters and importers feeling the pinch, Mehta says the added tax will prevent businesses from growing. “Everyone’s getting squeezed,” he said. “If the GSP was restored, there’s no doubt it would help the sector as a whole”.Mehta’s experience is one example of how the India-US economic relationship has changed under the administration of US President Donald Trump. And why many Indian entrepreneurs like him have a keen interest in who occupies the White House after the November 3 US elections.Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the US’s trade deficit with India, which stood at $28.8bn in 2019, nearly three times the $10.6bn figure in 2008. In March 2019, he called India “a very high-tariff nation” and has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to redress the gap. India later retaliated, raising duties on 28 US products.Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have famously enjoyed afriendly rapport, but analysts say Trump’s punitive policies have made the economic environment more contentious. The two sides have repeatedlyfailed to signeven a “mini trade deal” that had initially been expected in September 2019.“There’s been a lot of positive engagement, but in reality, we are far from getting anything ratified,” Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi told Al Jazeera.This could change if Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, becomes the next US president and brings with him a more measured policymaking machine.“A Biden administration would not necessarily back down on big-ticket requests,” says Dhar, referring to the US’s push for greater access to India’s agriculture, medical device and e-commerce markets, and even for lower import tariffs on Harley Davidson motorbikes.“But we’d be unlikely to see the same aggression towards trade partners. This could lead to a better outcome for Indian negotiators”.Trump’s trade policies and negotiating stance may be based on populist impulses, but India is also taking an increasingly protectionist line.India’s incoming data protection bill has become one of the thorniest issues in negations.The bill threatens to prevent Indian data from leaving its shores, making life difficult for global technology giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google that rely on the free-flow of data.It also threatens to tax digital companies in a way that would also disproportionately affect US technology firms. The US has called this type of taxation “unfair” and “discriminatory” and has said it will “begin investigations” into how its trading partners are implementing such laws.After its economy suffered a historic shock (gross domestic product shrank by a record 23.9 percent in the April-June quarter), exacerbating an urgent need to create more blue- and white-collar jobs, analysts say India cannot afford to close itself off from negotiating a more favourable US trading relationship.“India needs to recognise that a trade relationship with the US is extremely beneficial for economic growth,” Anupam Manur, a research fellow at the Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately though, we may see nationalistic jingo and political point-scoring continue to take the upper hand”.However, recent investments by Facebook and Google in Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, could drive a change of mindset.Reliance is India’s largest and most influential company. With two major US tech giants taking a seat each on its board, analysts say this could strengthen the hand of US companies lobbying the Indian government to liberalise a wide range of issues governing India’s digital platforms.For this reason “I wouldn’t rule out a policy U-turn,” said JNU’s Dhar.But, regardless of the outcome of the US election, analysts believe progress on a trade agreement will hinge on the US securing greater access to India’s huge, yet fragmented, agricultural markets.India, however, is reluctant to endanger its mostly small-scale, independent producers by forcing them to compete with giant US agribusinesses. And with the global economic downturn set to drag on, as well as a strong farming lobby to placate at home, observers say a future Biden administration would likely take a hard line similar to Trump’s.September’shistoric changes to India’s farm laws, which will open up produce markets to private players, could also complicate matters. “Farmers already have apprehensions about these ordinances,” said Dhar. “Allowing American access on top of that means the situation could become very problematic”.With US unemployment at a high 8.4 percent and the country experiencing the toughest economic conditions since the Great Depression, analysts say there may be little political room for either of the two contenders to deviate from the US’s existing – and increasingly nativist – trade policies.“Let’s remember that Biden also has a ‘Made in America’ plan and has made an effort to appear tough on China,” explained Takshashila Institution’s Manur. “His talk of subsidising industry, which is against the World Trade Organisation rules, tells me he will also be protectionist”.The White House’s recent announcement of plans to reduce the number of visas awarded to skilled workers by a third is one such area where Biden’s hands may be tied.Last year, 74.5 percent of so-called H1-B visas were claimed by Indians, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, plugging a shortage of highly skilled labour in the US’s technology industries. High-profile Indian CEOs such as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Google’s parent Alphabet have also played an outsized role in contributing to Silicon Valley’s success.Despite this, Indians look set to miss out on future opportunities.“Like with the 2008 global financial crisis, the immigration issue has become mixed up in the feelings surrounding the downturn,” says Dhar. “[Biden] will eventually re-look at visa policies once the economy rebounds, but not before that”.But a change of US leadership could mean a return to more nuanced, rules-based decision-making. Consequently, there are hopes in India that the Iran nuclear deal, originally signed under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and abandoned by Trump, will be back on the table.This would help India, which lost an important export market, a valuable source of cheap oil and a potential stake in a key port by complying with US sanctions. “Iran has always been a strategic ally in the region,” says Dhar. “I hope this situation would improve if a new administration comes in”.India is likely to remain a key ally for the US as geopolitical tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific region. In a speech during his visit to India earlier this year, Trump clubbed the two nations together as “powerful defenders of peace and liberty”, drawing a blunt contrast with China – the other great regional power. Biden too has said he would “stand with India”, promising to tackle terror threats in the region together.As the US decouples itself from China’s economy, India is trying to take its place. Modi has pitched India as a “trusted partner” and welcomed foreign direct investment. In reality, US businesses are reluctant to leave China or disrupt their supply chains; and for the few that do, India is unlikely to be their preferred destination.“At most, US companies are hedging, perhaps moving 30 percent of their operations to Vietnam or Laos – India is not attractive to companies yet,” said Takshashila Institution’s Manur. But the current reforms to labour and land laws, which would make it easier for foreign businesses to set up shop in India, could change that, he added.India’s attempts to supplant undemocratic China and take advantage of the US’s boycotts and bans of Chinese technology firms may also invite increased scrutiny of its own human rights record.US Democrats have indicated they will call out human rights abuses around the world. After India withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir – the region it administers in part while Pakistan administers the other – and imposed a military lockdown on its residents, Biden’s vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, reminded observers: “We are watching”, suggesting a potential sore spot in India-US relations.Harris has repeatedly shown that despite her being part Indian, she may not be an easy ally for the Modi government. After India’s external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar cancelled a meeting last year when the US House Affairs Committee refused to exclude Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal – a critic of India’s Kashmir policy – Harris actively defended Jayapal’s presence, ruffling diplomatic feathers in the process.But not everyone believes that such conversations would harm the India-US economic relationship. A trade policy expert wishing to remain anonymous told Al Jazeera: “Modi has a thick skin about these things. Any criticism of human rights will wash off his back”.Tish Sanghera is a journalist based in Mumbai, where she writes about economic, political and social issues. Twitter: @TishSanghera"

The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to the presidential election on ...,12 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"The move comes as Republicans increasingly emphasise the chance of noncitizen voting, despite little evidence of any significant risk posed.The United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to thepresidential electionon November 5.The lawsuit, filed on Friday, comes in response to an executive order issued in August by Virginia’s Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin.It initiated the removal of individuals from voter registration rolls if officials are “unable to verify that they are citizens” through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.But the Justice Department says the executive order was issued with too little time before election day, violating a 90-day “quiet period” outlined in The National Voter Registration Act.That period requires official systematic removals at least three months ahead of a federal vote.“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Assistant US Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.“The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.”Youngkin had issued his order on August 7, which marked 90 days until the election. In a statement on Friday, the governor argued the executive order fell within the law.“Virginians – and Americans – will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy,” Youngkin said.He pledged state authorities “will defend these common-sense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us”.“Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period,” Youngkin said.Republicans and allies of former President Donald Trump – the current Republican candidate for the presidency – have increasingly pushedunfounded claimsof possible election malfeasance ahead of this year’s vote.Those claims echo falsehoods spread about the 2020 election, which Trump has continued to falsely say was “stolen” through fraud.Some Republican officials have also advanced baseless claims that noncitizens are voting in large enough numbers to affect the outcome. In the US, only citizens can vote.Most voter administration is determined by state officials and legislatures, with only broad parameters from the federal government. Nearly all US states require some form of voter registration to cast a ballot, although many allow the registration to be done on election day.Ahead of the 2024 elections, several states – including Texas, Tennessee, Ohio and Alabama – have passed measures requiring higher burdens of proof to show a voter’s citizenship. Democracy monitors said those efforts may disenfranchise US citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote.The Brennan Center for Justice – a non-partisan policy organisation – found that noncitizen voting in the US is exceedingly rare. There is no evidence it had any bearing on recent elections.In 2017, the centre releaseda studylooking at 23.5 million votes cast in the 2016 general election.Only 30 votes were flagged for suspected noncitizen voting. Data was not available on how many of those votes proved to have been cast by noncitizens."

All to know in 500 ...,"Sep 21, 2024 ... Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.",Last update 22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Advocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.Election day in the United States may still be several weeks away, but Americans in several parts of the country are getting a chance to cast their ballots already.In-person, advanced voting became possible in the US states of Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia this week while several other states opened up their mail-in voting processes earlier this month.Both are forms of “early voting”, a mainstay of US elections that in recent years has become a target offalse voter fraud accusations.Rights advocates say robust early voting opportunities help ensure more people can cast a ballot regardless of disability, time constraints, work, travel or other factors that could hamper them on election day, which this year is on November 5.Early voting also offers an opportunity to build enthusiasm: When Taylor Swift, who recentlyendorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, announced she would perform in Florida just before early voting begins there in October, local Democrats quickly seized on the moment.“Taylor is bringing the Eras Tour to Miami in the weekend leading up to early voting, and I look forward to seeing that energy play out in Florida!!!” the Miami-Dade Democratic Party said.Voting in US presidential elections is only broadly steered by the federal government. US states determine much of how the logistics of the vote plays out in their respective jurisdictions.Currently, every state in the country allows some form of early voting, with mail-in voting the most prevalent option.At least eight of the 50 states send all registered voters a ballot in the mail while 14 still require voters to provide a reason for why they need to cast their ballot – sometimes known as an “absentee ballot” – by mail.Most states also provide in-person voting before election day. Only three states do not.That depends on the year.In the 2020 election, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100 million voters cast their ballots before election day — representing about two-thirds of all Americans who voted that year, a record.Americans living abroad, members of the US military and people with disabilities are among the many who have traditionally chosen to vote early.A 2001 Supreme Court ruling upheld that voters did not need to provide a reason to cast an early ballot, as long as their state allows it.Early voting — in particular, mail-in voting — was at the centre of unfounded election fraud claims in 2020.That’s because Democrats have historically cast more votes by mail than Republicans, who are more likely to vote on election day. Many jurisdictions count votes cast in person before they begin counting mail-in votes although the process varies.That can create a “blue shift” or “red mirage”, in which early results in key states appear to initially show the Republican candidate leading, only to shift to the Democratic candidate as the mail-in votes are counted.In 2020, then-President Donald Trump falsely said the mail-in votingsystem was rife with fraud. The Republican ultimately lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, but he has continued to claim the vote was stolen from him.Many state legislaturesenactednew restrictions on early voting after the 2020 contest, including higher scrutiny for ballots cast by mail.But the Republican Party has more fully embraced early voting this year as Trump runs again against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris."

Homeless Americans face challenges in voting during the 2016 US elections, but many still exercise their right.",Last update 17 Sep 2016,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Homeless Americans face challenges in voting during the 2016 US elections, but many still exercise their right.Washington, DC –Inside the wide, sunlit foyer of the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library, Eric Sheptock points to an expansive mural of the late civil rights activist.“I wish that the poor people of today were as willing to fight for justice as those who marched with Martin Luther King,” he says. “It seems that the poor have lost heart and are less willing to stand up for themselves.”Sheptock, who has been intermittently homeless since 1994, has become an activist for Washington DC’s homeless community, which he hopes will vote in the forthcoming elections when Americans head to the polls to choose their 45th president.“There is no reason for a homeless person not to vote,” he tells Al Jazeera. “You can’t be denied the right to vote because you’re homeless.”While it is difficult to register to vote without a permanent address, it is not impossible.Many states nowallow individuals to list the placethey generally occupy as their residence, which can include a shelter or even a park bench. However, the requirement for official identification when voting can cause challenges for the homeless – obtaining a state-issued ID can be both complicated and costly.But, as political discussions take place in living rooms across the United States, Washington DC’s homeless community also engages in its own political discourse – equally as captivated by the ongoing presidential campaign as the wider public, according to Sheptock. “I do hear a lot of homeless people talking about politics … We’ve had some pretty energetic conversations about Trump versus Clinton.”He explains that free newspapers, televisions in homeless shelters and internet access in public libraries are invaluable sources of information on the presidential campaign.READ MORE: New York’s homeless left out in the coldFifty-one-year-old Tony Leonard has been living on the streets of DC since losing his job and subsequently his home in 2011. He says that the city’s homeless community is very politically active. “A lot of us [who are] homeless in DC are educated people who had lives before but lost everything.”Come November, Leonard will be voting for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, citing her political experience as his motive. As for her opponent, Republican candidate Donald Trump, “He’s a joke,” Leonard says. “I don’t think anyone thinks he’d make a good president.”Sheptock says he won’t be voting for Trump either. He tells Al Jazeera that he is torn between Green Party Leader Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton. “All I can say right now is that I plan to vote for a woman”.Yet, while the majority of homeless interviewed for this article expressed their support for Clinton, not all were averse to Trump’s message.Jeffrey McNeill claims to have worked as a doorman at Trump’s Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City for three years before he lost everything to gambling.He subsequently moved to Washington DC in 2007, where he would spend the next three years of his life sleeping on the pavement and in shelters. McNeill bought Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal, which he said changed his life forever.“It was the greatest book ever; it taught me about the economy, how to make deals, how to make money and how to get a job.” The book taught him to be a good businessman, he says.Ultimately, however, McNeill explains he feels let down by the Democratic administration. “I was a lifelong Democrat; I voted for Obama twice … but there are more homeless people in the city now than when I arrived. I did better under Republican presidents than I have done under Obama.”America’s hidden homeless: Life in the Starlight MotelMore than 500,000 people in the United States were without housing on any given night last year, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 2015 annualreport.In Washington DC,the number of homeless reached 7,298 in 2015.Experts say a lack of formal data on homeless voters means it is difficult to measure their electoral participation. However,statistically, people from lower-income backgrounds have been less likely to vote than those with higher incomes.“There are a good number of people experiencing homelessness who care about voting. It’s no different to the population at large,” said David Pirtle, a public education coordinator for the National Homeless Coalition, who has himself experienced homelessness.But, there are variations. People living in shelters or transitional housing are far more likely to vote than those with no form of accommodation at all, said Pirtle. “People who are literally living on the street probably have the lowest turnout because a lot of those folks are dealing with other serious issues apart from being homeless, for example, mental health [or] substance abuse.”Pirtle added that many of these individuals “may not be capable or interested in the process”.WATCH – Voters’ Rights: What’s Happening to American Democracy?David Lee Norris, 59, and his wife, Naomi Macmillan, 53, are among this group. Home for them is an underpass next to Washington DC’s Union Railway Station. Having both suffered from drug-addiction, they moved from their home in South Carolina in January in the hope of receiving better healthcare for Naomi, who is HIV-positive.Any assistance they receive comes from NGOs, not the government, according to Norris.“The government is doing nothing … they are the reason we are here,” he says. “That’s why I’m not voting.”Obtaining information on voting procedures is very much down to the individual, which can be an extra challenge for those experiencing homelessness, said Julian Johannesen, director of research and training at Nonprofit Vote.“The government does not help anyone to vote here; you don’t even know where the registration form is,” Johannesen tells Al Jazeera. “People who are already under enormous stress and … have bigger priorities that occupy their attention can benefit from having some help getting over the administrative hurdles.”Ken Martin, has been homeless in Washington DC since 2012, and while he will be voting in November, he agrees that for many homeless, it is a challenge.“When you are worrying about whether or not you’re going to have a roof over your head or a place to eat or a place to get a shower, you’re not thinking about who’s going to be in the Oval Office – you’re thinking about just making it through the day,” says the 62-year-old.For the women at Washington DC’s N Street Village, a shelter and recovery centre for homeless and low-income women, lively discussions on the elections are commonplace. Hillary Clinton’s healthcare policies feature particularly high on the agenda during such conversations.“She’s interested in women’s care, mental health … She’s determined to make sure that women are well-taken care of when she gets to the White House,” says Mary, who lost everything after health problems led to costly and unmanageable medical bills and asked to be identified using a pseudonym.Cheryl Barnes, meanwhile, who has previously been homeless for 30 years, after suffering from substance and alcohol abuse, says the N Street Village saved her, and come November, she’ll also be voting for Hillary Clinton.Another resident at the N Street Village, Julia Miller, says she doesn’t align with any particular party. “I like Trump,’ says Miller who has been living at the shelter for five years. “[He] has an economic plan for the country, and I think … he’ll bring more jobs to the United States.”When it came to voting, Miller said that people should not be stereotyped because of their economic situation. “Everyone should be allowed to vote, that’s how homeless people get legislative action to …change the situation and access more resources.”She said that no matter which candidate becomes president, she wants them to provide more resources for the homeless.In the future, there needs to be a more focused campaign about voting, according to Pirtle.“We spend a lot of money in this country to get the general population to vote,” he says. “We shouldn’t leave our homeless neighbours aside.”Voting can also have a very positive emotional effect, he adds. “The general feeling [people] can get living on the street is that they are isolated, that they don’t have a voice, but getting people to participate in the electoral process … can have a very beneficial effect on their morale.”Sitting in the cool foyer of the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library, Sheptock emphasises that the space has become a sanctuary for many of the homeless community wanting to escape the city’s blistering summer heat. Ultimately, he wants people to vote no matter what their circumstance.“If you don’t vote, then you can’t fuss and nag about what the politicians do,” he says. “If you do vote, that earns you the right to complain about what government does.”Follow Jessica Sarhan on Twitter@JessicaSarhan"

Keep the faith guys, we are going to win this.”Shortly after Biden gave an election night speech, Trump tweeted he would speak tonight.Florida and its 29 electoral votes were a must-win for Trump. If he wound up losing there, it would have significantly narrowed his path to 270 electoral votes.Early indications are that Trump, although losing Miami-Dade, the most populous county in Florida, improved his vote total there, from 2016. Florida political experts are crediting Trump’s improvement with Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade with helping him to victory.At the beginning of the evening, we listed Florida as one of the “super seven” states that if Biden flipped early on, it would have signalled a potentially clear path for him. The other six states on that list – Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and Iowa – are still too close to call. Biden’s clear path is much muddier now after Florida lands in Trump’s column.Our analysis still holds true: If Biden can win two of those six, especially two large states, it makes it that much more difficult for Trump to hit 270. But given the close counts in those other states, as well as the other Trump 2016 states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – we are in for an extremely long night or, perhaps, another long day tomorrow waiting for final results.Read morehereThe AP has called Montana and Iowa for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump 9 more electoral votes.The AP has called Ohio for the Republican Party, giving Trump 18 electoral votes.Biden is set to speak at 00:30 ET from Wilmington, Delaware, according to his campaign.While key Democratic-leaning cities like Detroit, Michigan and Philadelphia have halted counting, Trump’s team “have started to feel optimistic given the fact that they went into this knowing that Joe Biden had a substantial lead”.Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont filed this report from PennsylvaniaOn Election Night, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said counting the state’s millions of ballots will take time and asked voters to be patient. Voters returned a record-breaking 2.5 million mail ballots across the state, but by law, it could not start counting them until the morning of Election Day.“Counting that tremendous number of ballots will, again, take longer than we’re used to, but the extra time is just there because we want to make sure our election system is working and that each and every vote is counted,” Wolf said.“We may not know the results today, as a result, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath and, as I’ve been saying, just be patient. What’s most important is that we have accurate results and that every vote is counted, even if that takes a little longer.”By midnight local time, about 50 percent of Pennsylvania’s votes had been counted and Trump was ahead in the race.The AP news agency has called Minnesota for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 10 more electoral votes.The AP news agency has called Hawaii for the Democratic Party, giving Biden four more electoral votes.4 Nov 2020 - 04:44 GMTReynolds, reporting from Los Angeles, says Arizona could be one of the surprises of the night.“It has not been called yet, but it’s looking good for Joe Biden,” Reynolds said. “And this is extraordinary because Arizona is formerly a rock-ribbed Republican state … it hasn’t gone for a Democratic President since … 1996.”Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer filed this report from Kenosha, WisconsinAs polls close in Wisconsin, a local pizzeria is ground zero for Kenosha’s Republicans.Complete with Fox News streaming across two televisions and a cardboard cutout of the president at the door, a long table filled with various pies bisects the mask-less crowd watching the earliest results roll in.Sheila Dissmore, 57, opted to vote in person on Tuesday.“Being a full-blown patriot, I feel like it’s just extra special voting on [election] day,” she says. “Just seeing how raw and unedited the president I think is refreshing.”Living on Kenosha’s south side with her 92-year-old father through the pandemic, this summer’s civil unrest caused Dissmore to double down on her Republican beliefs.“For the first time in my life, having to lock my door, close the shutters, close everything, turn the drapes and having my father there – I’m not a gun owner, but I wish I was.”Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith has defeated Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi’s Senate race, according to the AP news agency.Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock will advance to a runoff in Georgia’s special US Senate election, the AP projects.Since no candidate in the 21-candidate field received 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off on January 5, with the winner being sworn in immediately thereafter.It is projected Loeffler edged out Republican US Representative Doug Collins to land in the top two.This is significant in that the Republicans’ Senate majority may hang in the balance until January if neither is able to claim a majority after the rest of tonight’s races are projected.Worth noting as we wait for the final projection on too-close-to-call North Carolina: Biden had not visited the state since October 18, making it one of the few key battlegrounds where he did not campaign in the final sprint.His running mate Kamala Harris did make four stops over two days in that period.For his part, Trump made five visits to North Carolina between October 21 and Election Day.Republican Roger Marshall has defeated Democrat Barbara Bollier in Kansas’s Senate race.Republican Senator James Risch has defeated Democrat Paulette Jordan in Idaho’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley has defeated Republican Jo Rae Perkins in Oregon’s Senate race.The AP has called Utah for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump six more electoral votes.4 Nov 2020 - 04:05 GMTAP has called New Hampshire for the Democratic Party, giving Joe Biden four more electoral votes.The AP calls Idaho for the Republican Party, giving Trump four more electoral votes.The AP has called California, Oregon and Washington state for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 74 more electoral votes.It is 23:00 ET (04:00 GMT) and the last polls have closed in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this reportThe Pennsylvania Commonwealth Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said there have been no serious voting issues in the state.“I’m happy to report that today’s election in the Commonwealth went remarkably smoothly,” she told reporters. “We have no major or widespread events to report … No reports of violence at any polling places today,” Boockvar added. “There were a few reports of voters feeling intimidated that were resolved by calls to the counties.”Overall, Boockvar said her team at the voter information hotline answered 5,000 calls, mostly standard issues such as late-opening polls and lines at some polling stations.Other reported issues included: an individual accidentally shooting himself in Northampton County and then driving himself to the hospital; a volunteer with the Pennsylvania Democrats being shot with a paintball gun from a moving vehicle. Boockvar said this happened right before the polls closed, without elaborating. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit on behalf of Spanish-speaking voters who were not provided language access in York, Pennsylvania.Texas “is still pretty close”, Zhou-Castro reported from Houston, Texas.“Normally by this time of night on election night pundits would have called Texas already for the Republican candidate,” She said “[But the fact that] votes are coming in and Joe Biden is still within reach of overtaking Trump … is making headlines in the state.”The AP has called Missouri for the Republican Party, giving Trump 10 more electoral votes.“This state plays a huge role in presidential elections … Donald Trump looks like he is forging ahead in this state potentially with an even wider lead than he had over Hillary Clinton,” Gallacher reported from Miami Florida.“Donald Trump really does need to win this, the largest of all the battleground states, with 29 electoral college votes.”He added that Biden “has other options to the White House including places like Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, but at the moment we are getting pretty close to this state being called.”“There is some pressure now from the Trump campaign for officials to call it, and they already tweeted out ‘Trump has won Florida’, but that is not official yet … [but] it does look like Donald Trump may take Florida which is what he actually needs to do,” he said.Not unexpectedly, Republican Tommy Tuberville has been projected as the winner of the US Senate race in Alabama, defeating Doug Jones.Tuberville, a former college football coach, was significantly outraised by Jones, but Alabama is a deeply Republican state and the outcome wasn’t in question.Jones won a special election in 2017 to replace Republican Jeff Sessions, who resigned his seat to become Trump’s attorney general. Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore, who had faced allegations of sexual misconduct.Moore ran against Tuberville and others in the Republican primary this year, but to the relief of Republicans, Tuberville won the nomination setting them on the path to reclaim the seat.4 Nov 2020 - 03:15 GMTRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been re-elected for a second term in the US House of Representatives.The rising star in the Democratic Party was easily re-elected in New York’s 14th congressional district. Ocasio-Cortezmade historyin 2018 as the youngest woman elected to Congress in US history at the age of 28, championing her working-class and Puerto Rican roots. She is the daughter of a cleaner and a father who died in his 40s.Serving NY-14 and fighting for working class families in Congress has been the greatest honor, privilege, & responsibility of my life.Thank you to the Bronx & Queens for re-electing me to the House despite the millions spent against us, & trusting me to represent you once more.https://t.co/MXG2Z2DV2F— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)November 4, 2020Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the so-called “Squad” of four freshman progressive Democratic congresswomen that includes Rashida Tlaib from Detroit, Ilhan Omar from Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley from Boston.The four represent a new emerging faction of young, progressive politicians who are pushing the established House leadership of the Democratic Party.South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham survived a re-election scare defeating well-funded Democrat Jaime Harrison.Democrats were extremely encouraged by the polls last month showing Harrison making the race much more competitive than expected in deeply Republican South Carolina.But pro-Trump Graham, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee shepherded Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, was able to pull out a victory tonight.The AP has called Kansas for the Republican Party giving Trump six more electoral votes.It is 22:00 ET (03:00GMT) and the polls have closed in Montana, Utah, Nevada and Iowa.Democrat John Hickenlooper defeated Republican Senator Cory Gardner in Colorado’s US Senate race, according to a projection from the Associated Press news agency.This is the first Republican Senate seat picked up by the Democrats tonight in their quest to take control of the Senate.Currently, Republicans have a 53-47 majority. Democrats need to net three seats to take over the Senate if Joe Biden wins the presidency, or four if Trump wins. The vice president is the tie-breaking vote and if Biden wins, Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaker in a 50-50 Senate.If Trump wins, Mike Pence would be the tie-breaking vote if the Senate ends up 50-50.“There is silence out of the Biden camp at the moment,” said Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna from Wilmington, Delaware. “All are simply watching the results and the ongoing analysis of what is happening, but nobody is breaking cover at the moment, the situation is so close, so absolutely tense in a number of states, that nobody wants to come up and make any calls at this particular point in time.”“Joe Biden said it very clearly early on in the afternoon that when he got something to say, he will come out and he will say it and very clearly this instruction has gone down to his staff, we heard very little from the Biden campaign headquarters… We understand that Joe Biden himself is still at his home here in Wilmington, Delaware in a few hours time he will come to the convention centre with his vice president nominee Kamala Harris,” he said.The AP has called Colorado for the Democratic Party, giving Biden nine more electoral votes.Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey, reporting from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania said the state is in for a long count.“The polls have only just closed in Pennsylvania and in addition to all of the ballots that were cast today, the state now has to count some two and a half million mail-in ballots, and that is only just beginning that process … which can only begin on election day by Pennsylvania law,” she said.“So this could take a while, officials are predicting it might be before the end of the week before we have really clear results, but it’s interesting to point out that Democrats returned nearly three times as many mail-in ballots as Republicans did that’s maybe why President Trump has been very worried about those mail-in ballots,” she said. “He has been attempting to discredit or delegitimise those mail-in ballots, so we had an issue earlier in the day where a judge expressed concern about some missing mail-in ballots and has ordered about two dozens mail processing centres to be searched for possible missing ballots.”People across the United States have voted in one of the most polarising presidential elections in the country’s history – and the race is also playing out on social media.The #Vote2020 and #ElectionDay hashtags are trending in most countries on Twitter, as the world closely follows the hard-fought matchup between Trump and Biden on Tuesday.Read morehere.Trying to balance out all that#ElectionDaystress eating…pic.twitter.com/zU9wlM30kg— Sierra Club (@SierraClub)November 3, 2020The AP has called the District of Columbia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three more electoral votes.The governor of Pennsylvania has confirmed the vote count in the battleground state will take longer than expected, amid a surge in mail-in voting.Pennsylvania does not start counting mail voting until Election Day and will accept ballots postmarked by November 3 for three days after. Some districts have said they will not start counting mail votes until Wednesday morning.PA Governor Tom Wolf says vote count will take longer than normal (this was anticipated due to the high volume of mail ballots)“We may not know the results today, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath."" Wolf says. “Every eligible vote will be counted, as it must be.”— Hilary Beaumont (@HilaryBeaumont)November 4, 2020Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this report from Graham, North CarolinaThe message on Election Night in Graham, where police pepper-sprayed protesters just three days before, was one of outrage and urgency – but also of hope and love.Led by Reverend Greg Drumwright, hundreds of people from across North Carolina marched quietly several blocks to two polling locations, before making their way to the central square, where a Confederate monument stands.“In the absence of hope, what do we have?” Drumwright told the crowd as they raised their fists in the air.“Therefore we cling to hope tonight,” he added. “I want you to cling to change tonight; I want you to believe that this is a shifting and a turning and a dawning of a new area; that things will not stay the same; that white supremacy will come down; that racism will come down; that love will be lifted up.”The marchers’ cheers drowned out the taunting by a small group of counterprotesters who gathered with confederate and Trump flags across the square.A judge in Nevada has ordered 30 Las Vegas-area voting sites to stay open for an extra hour tonight after a lawsuit was filed by Trump’s campaign and state Republicans.They had argued that 22 polling places did not open on time, and wanted the time extended. Lawyers for Democrats then requested that eight additional sites also stay open later.The judge granted both requests and said anyone in line at 8pm local time (04:00 GMT) would be allowed to cast a ballot.The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada shared a list of the Clark County polling sites that will stay open later.🗳️🗳️ TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO VOTE 🗳️🗳️Some Clark County polling locations have added an hour of voting tonight.

Trump won all but New Hampshire in 2016. And there are some signs in the exit polls and the vote count that show some early positive signs for Trump and Biden in different states.In Florida, Trump is keeping Biden’s margin of victory down in Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county.In North Carolina and Ohio, exit polls suggest Biden is receiving more support among suburban voters than Trump did in 2016.The Associated Press, which is one of several US media organization making calls, waits until a significant number of votes have been counted, while also analysing exit polling data, in competitive states before they make projections.Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from New Hanover CountyTrump supporters in North Carolina were energised at polling stations across the beach town of Wilmington. They were confident New Hanover County, where Wilmington is located, and the state will go red.“Trump has done a lot,” Char Marker said. “He’s done a lot of things to tackle our child sex trafficking problem that we have, which is huge to me.“I am a pro-life voter. And, you know, Trump has been one of the most pro-life presidents we’ve had yet. They say Trump is kind of like a party of his own. And if that’s the case, I’m in that party.”Across town, 22-year-old Brandon Panameno said he voted for Trump because he is not the “typical politician”.“The economy has been doing well” under Trump, he said. “I think he has a pretty good chance of winning again.”Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from rural Kenosha county, WisconsinIn rural Kenosha, Trump signs abound but not everyone is on board. In the village of Bristol, in central Kenosha county, a short line of voters are waiting to enter Bristol Village Hall where voting booths are delineated by yellow and orange traffic cones strung together with yellow rope.Tony Chacon, who moved to Bristol nine years ago from Kenosha, had just completed voting. “It’s better over here on this side of the Interstate. I feel a lot safer,” the 26-year-old said.“I’m in trade work so I’m big on keeping work in the United States,” he told Al Jazeera of his decision to vote for Trump. “He’s a businessman … someone who knows how money moves and how to move it,” said Chacon.For him, when Biden was vice president, “things were getting rough when it comes to prices of fuel.” He added that ultimately “our choices aren’t really the best” before turning to greet fellow Bristol resident, Brian Chwaszczewski, 33, who had also just voted.While he was reluctant to name the candidate he voted for, Chwaszczewski did say that “being out here in more of a rural area, I’m sure there [are] plenty of Trump supporters. I just wanted to kind of not support that.” He feels like something of an outlier in his community. “It’s Trump signs everywhere,” he said, as darkness set in.Democratic Senator Chris Coons defeated Republican Lauren Witzke in Delaware’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Dick Durbin defeated Republican Mark Curran in Illinois’ Senate race.Democratic Senator Ed Markey defeated Republican Kevin O’Connor in Massachusetts’ Senate race.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated Republican Corky Messner in New Hampshire’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Cory Booker defeated Republican Rik Mehta in New Jersey’s Senate race.Democratic Senator Jack Reed defeats Republican Allen Waters in Rhode Island’s Senate race.Republican Senator Mitch McConnell has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath in Kentucky’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency.The AP has called for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 69 electoral votes.The AP calls Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee for the Republican Party, giving Trump 33 electoral votes.It is 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Washington, DC.The AP calls South Carolina for the Republican Party, giving Trump 9 electoral votes.Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from Wilmington, North CarolinaPolls started to close in North Carolina where voters from both parties expressed optimism all day.Michael Master said he was hopeful Trump would pull out another victory in the state.“As a person, Trump puts Americans first,” Master said at a polling location in Wilmington. “And he puts especially the average American worker first.”Across the parking lot, Biden supporter Nick Rhodes said he was confident Biden would win.“We need to bring our country back together in terms of getting rid of division, and start embracing science and start bringing people together because we cannot have another four years of this,” he said.A handful of precincts in the state will stay open later because of delayed openings. We are expecting to see results from early and absentee voting to start rolling in within the next hour. In-person results will follow later this evening.The Trump campaign and Nevada Republicans are asking a state court judge to extend voting by one hour at 22 Las Vegas-area polling locations, according to the Associated Press news agency and Nevada Independent newspaperAn Election Day lawsuit filed in Clark County claims the 22 voting locations did not open on time. It was getting an immediate hearing before Judge Joe Hardy.“If immediate action is not taken, appellants will never have the opportunity to vindicate their rights,” attorneys for the two groups wrote in the filing. “More troubling, Nevadans – and the rest of the country – will be left wondering whether the results of the election are legitimate.”Election officials keep sites open until the last person in line at closing time can vote. Polling places in Nevada are scheduled to close at 22:00 ET (02:00 GMT).All polls will close in the battleground state of Florida at 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT)Here is why the state is so significant.The AP news agency calls Virginia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 13 electoral votes.A helpful road map, if you want to figure out how election night is going to shape up, is to keep an eye on seven states’ results, which we will dub the “super” seven.If Biden can win early on any of the following states that Trump won in 2016, it could indicate a positive evening for him. If Trump holds them, that will likely delay a projection of an overall winner.Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas are the states that are expected to count votes fairly efficiently and, if there’s a clear winner, are expected to be projected for one of the two candidates.If Biden picks up one, assuming he also wins all of the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he will be well on his way to 270 votes, as it will be a state flipped from Republican to Democrat. If he picks up two, that makes things even clearer and puts Biden well down the path to a potential win.Note that other key Trump states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – are not part of that list. Those states are expected to count their votes much more slowly and if Trump holds onto the other seven, will factor into many more hours, if not days, of waiting for a winner to be projected.Republican Moore has defeated Democrat Paula Jean Swearengin in West Virginia’s US Senate race.The AP calls West Virginia for the Republican Party, giving Trump five electoral votes.It is 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT) and polls have closed in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.Biden is outperforming Hillary Clinton among key voters in Georgia, according to exit polls from The Associated Press news agency.Suburban voters, who Trump won by five points in 2016, are backing Biden by double digits in this year’s exit polls. Among suburban women, Biden has the support of six in 10 of them.Turnout among Black voters has kept pace with 2016, as they make up approximately three in 10 voters this year. Biden has also kept pace with Hillary Clinton, with nine in 10 Black voters saying they support Biden.If Biden is to flip Georgia to the Democrats for the first time since 1992, he will need robust turnout from Black voters and a strong showing among suburban voters.Georgia’s polls closed at 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT), but The Associated Press news agency has not called the race as of yet.The AP exit poll surveyed more than 106,000 voters over eight days, including Election Day. The margin of error is +/-0.4 percent.Despite the US witnessing a record number of early votes in the presidential election, tens of millions of American voters headed to polling stations across the country on Tuesday.Polls began closing in the United States at 18:00 Eastern Standard Time (23:00 GMT) and closing times vary by state.Find out when the polls close in each statehere.Democratic US Senator Mark Warner defeats Republican Daniel Gade in Virginia’s US Senate race, according to AP.The AP calls Vermont for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three electoral votes.The AP calls Kentucky for the Republican Party, giving Trump eight electoral votes.It is 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Virginia and Vermont.Swing states, also known as battleground states, will have an outsize influencing in deciding the next president of the US.Watch our one-minute explainer on why.Racial justice is one of several big issues on the minds of US voters today, as the country for months has seen mass protests demanding an end to systemic racism and police violence against Black people.Janelle King, a Republican strategist, defended US President Donald Trump, saying he has helped the Black community by tackling unemployment and funding various programmes, such as historically Black colleges and universities.“He provided the Black community with policies,” she told Al Jazeera.But Derrick Plummer, a Democratic strategist, said it is false to say that Trump has done a lot to help the Black community.“When you had peaceful African Americans, Black people, in the streets saying that we want to end systemic racism, we have a president that doesn’t even think systemic racism is real,” he told Al Jazeera.Voters are quite unhappy with the direction of the country and how the federal government is working, according to The Associated Press news agency’s VoteCast data.About three-quarters of voters said they are dissatisfied or angry with the way the government is working and six in 10 say they are unhappy with the direction of the country.Trump has tweeted “we’re looking really good all over the country”.“Thank you,” the president tweeted shortly after the first polling places, in parts of Indiana and Kentucky, closed on Election Day.Indications on who is ahead in preliminary state results are expected to take hours.WE ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 3, 2020The first polls have closed on Election Day in Indiana and Kentucky.Polls closed in parts of the two states that lie within the Eastern Time zone, but those within the Central Time zone will remain open for an additional hour.Both states are considered Republican bastions, but results are not expected to begin coming in until later Tuesday.With only a few hours before polls close in Michigan on Election Day, Rashida Tlaib said she is optimistic she will be heading back to Washington, DC.An outspoken progressive, the Palestinian American legislator is up for re-election in the 13th District of Michigan – a Democratic stronghold that she is almost certain to carry.She says strong voter turnout so far in the US elections is very encouraging.“I’ve not, in all the years I’ve run for office, seen lines like this,” Tlaib told Al Jazeera, crediting the crowds in part to a desire to vote President Donald Trump out of office.“[It] gives me hope that the turnout is going to be high enough where it’s very clear that Donald Trump is not wanted as the president of the United States any more.”Read morehere.The FBI and the New York attorney general were looking into a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home on Election Day as the nation remains on high alert to ensure voting is not compromised, according to the Reuters news agency.US state and local officials have been raising the alarm over at least two separate automated call campaigns as millions of Americans cast their votes on Tuesday to decide between Trump and Biden. Experts who spoke to Reuters say they are mystified by the most prominent robocalling campaign, which has been running for months and tells people to remain home but does not explicitly mention voting.“There’s a little bit of confusion about this one across the industry,” said Giulia Porter, vice president at RoboKiller, a company that fights telemarketers and robocalls and has been tracking the campaign.Audio of the calls, which RoboKiller shared with Reuters, features a synthetic female voice saying: “Hello. This is just a test call. Time to stay home. Stay safe and stay home.”Porter said the call had been placed millions of times in the past 11 months or so but had on Tuesday shot up to number 5 or number 6 in the list of top spam calls. A Department of Homeland Security official said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the calls. The FBI said only that it was aware of reports of robocalls and had no further comment.Biden made a couple of last-minute campaign visits to Pennsylvania, stopping by his childhood home in Scranton and speaking to volunteers in Philadelphia.Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, he expects to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the three Midwest states known as the “Blue Wall”.“I think we are going to do well. We’re going to re-establish that Blue Wall,” Biden said, referring to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Trump won those states in 2016, turning them Republican for the first time in decades.Biden said this year is interesting.“You can’t think of an election in the recent past where so many states are up for grabs. The idea that I’m still in play in Texas, in Georgia, in Florida,” he said. And said he would wait for a result before speaking later on election night.“There’s so much in play out there and an overwhelming vote out there. If there’s something to say tonight, I’ll come out and say it, otherwise, I will wait until all the votes are counted.”Speaking to reporters Tuesday outside a Delaware community centre, Biden said he’s “superstitious” about offering predictions for election night but remains “hopeful”.He added he has heard from aides that there is “overwhelming turnout” among young people, women and older Black adults in places like Georgia and Florida.“The things that are happening bode well for the base that has been supporting me – but we’ll see,” he said. “It’s just so uncertain” because of how many states are in play.Al Jazeera’s Chris Moody has sent this report from Safety Harbor, FloridaDesirae Braverman, a 20-year-old who was eager to vote in her first presidential election this year, showed up in person in the final hours on Election Day after her father accidentally threw away the mail-in ballot she ordered.“He doesn’t pay attention sometimes,” she said of her dad after voting in person in the town library. “I was like, I have no choice but to come down here now last minute. I wanted to do my little part, even if it doesn’t mean that much. I wanted to get out there and say, ‘My vote counts’.”To both presidential campaigns this election cycle, Braverman’s vote actually matters quite a lot: Her small bayside town, Safety Harbor, is located in Pinellas County, one of the most important swing counties in Florida, which is in one of the nation’s most critical battleground states.Pinellas voted for George W Bush in 2004, then supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, only to swing back into Republican hands and vote for Donald Trump in 2016. And this year, it is once again up for grabs in a state likely to face a close outcome. The county is narrowly split between registered Republicans and Democrats, making turnout numbers essential in a tightly contested place like this.Biden’s campaign sent the Democratic nominee’s wife, Jill Biden, to make a last-minute stop on the morning of Election Day to encourage voters.Braverman, a college student who said she cares about social issues such as preserving rights to same-sex marriage and abortion, cast her vote for Biden.”It kind of felt a little liberating because it was my first time,” she said. “It felt good. And I got my little sticker.”Coronavirus and the economy are the top issues among US voters, according to the Associated Press’ VoteCast data. And voters don’t have positive feelings about how both are being dealt with.About 4 in 10 voters named the pandemic as the top issue facing the US, while 3 in 10 said the economy and jobs were most important.About half of US voters said coronavirus is not at all under control. On the economy, 6 in 10 said the economy is in poor shape.On the issue of law enforcement, of which Donald Trump has made the former a important campaign theme, only 4 percent said that was the country’s top issue.Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland filed this report from Phoenix, ArizonaA slow but steady stream of voters arrived at the Epworth United Methodist Church in Phoenix, Arizona’s capital. Poll volunteers informed new arrivals where to go to cast their ballots, while another group handed out free meals to voters as they left.Feed the Polls is a volunteer initiative that brings together organisations and eateries to keep voters fed while they are waiting at the polls.“Today we are set to give out 2,000 meals,” said Maria Parra Cano of Sana Sana Foods, one of the groups that teamed up with Feed the Polls.“It’s been a constant flow [of voters] all morning until now,” she told Al Jazeera. “We are really just aiming to try to solve food insecurity on this day.”Justin, 19, said he cast his first-ever vote for President Donald Trump, the Republican incumbent.“The most important thing for me is obviously the economy – we need a strong economy,” said Justin, who declined to provide his surname. “And then law and order is a big thing for me.”Justin also lauded Trump’s foreign policy, citing the recent normalisation agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.“It’s a crazy world we live in right now and this election is a big election, just like any election,” Justin added.His friend Robert, a 26-year-old old business student, said the most important issue for him is taxation. On Tuesday he voted for Trump, just like in 2016.“The civil unrest and everything – I feel like there needs to be something done,” said Robert, who also declined to provide his last name.“And then I think Trump is going to be the one to stop the lockdown,” he added, referring to restrictions over the coronavirus pandemic. “I think it’s time everybody goes back to work.”Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this update from South Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaDJs Ronald Coleman, 33, and Jarkeer Lassiter, 29, danced to Come Closer by Whiz Kid ft. Drake outside a South Philadelphia polling station. They already voted for Biden with mail ballots and now their goal is to get out the vote for Biden by DJing at the polls. They are part of an effort across Philadelphia bringing DJs and free food to voters.Philadelphia voter turnout is high this election, but it is still unclear if it will be high enough to help the Democrat win Pennsylvania.Asked why he voted for Biden, Coleman said, “My mom.” He wants Biden to follow through on his promise to improve healthcare. “Medicare, all the stuff for the older people,” Coleman added. He said people in Philadelphia have been rioting for their rights after the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr, who was Lassiter’s cousin.“It just hit too close to home for me,” Coleman said. “I just hope it gets better.”Coleman and Lassiter said a lot of first-time voters were making their voices heard in Philadelphia this election. Lassiter said he voted for Biden because Trump failed to contain the pandemic and had stoked racial tension. “It’s like, if he’s in the White House, it’s OK to be [openly racist].”Electing Biden will send a message, he said. “If we get Biden in there, we have to do better.”3 Nov 2020 - 22:08 GMTAl Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from Kenosha, WisconsinThe Kenosha Unified School District is a sprawling, yet nondescript building on the city’s 52nd Street thoroughfare.On Election Day, its parking lot is brimming with cars including one with a man playing guitar and singing from the bed of a pick-up truck. The glass doors of the building’s entrance are flanked by two pairs of volunteers wearing yellow crew-neck sweatshirts that read “Election Defender”.“It’s a nonpartisan group that is organising … to make sure that voters are taken care of, especially in places where there are long lines,” explained Rena Singer. “It felt good to have something to do today,” she said of the group’s efforts to hand out snacks, personal protective equipment and anything else voters need to make it through the process.Inside, the sterile and fluorescent-lit hallways and rooms are dedicated to same-day voter registration and in-person voting.“Everybody has been in such a good mood, even the voters,” said the location’s chief inspector, Shawnna Smith. “I’m pretty proud of how well curbside voting is going – we don’t usually have that,” she said of the pandemic-inspired practice.Volunteers in yellow vests gather voters’ information, grab a ballot from inside that the voters complete from outside before the voters return them indoors to be counted. “People are taking advantage of it. Instead of risking coming in here, they’re just doing it curbside. It’s safe for them and everybody else,” Smith said.3 Nov 2020 - 21:31 GMTWall Street’s main stock indexes rallied as investors hope a clear winner will emerge from an exceptionally divisive US presidential election.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session up more than 554 points or just more than 2 percent at 27,480.03 – it had been up more than 700 points earlier in the session.The S&P 500 – a gauge for the health of US retirement and college savings accounts – closed up 1.78 percent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index finished the session up 1.85 percent.Tuesday’s strong finishes extended Monday’s gains. Though storefronts across the country have been boarded up in case violence erupts once the polls close, Wall Street is optimistic that a clear winner will be determined.Read morehere.3 Nov 2020 - 20:11 GMTAl Jazeera’s Chris Moody sent this report from West Tampa, FloridaJill Biden, wife of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, made a last-minute appearance in a predominantly Latino neighbourhood of West Tampa today to boost turnout in this crucial battleground state.Speaking to only a few dozen supporters, mostly volunteers who have backed her husband’s campaign, she emphasised unity before the polls close later tonight. “There is nothing – nothing – we can’t do when we come together with courage and grit,” she told the crowd, who wore masks and stood several feet apart from each other.“Donald Trump is in this for himself. Nothing more, nothing less. And he wants us to believe that we’re all the same, that we’re unhopeful and angry and selfish and divided. But today, we are going to show him who we are.”The appearance outside “Casa Biden”, an independent volunteer office where people have spent months drumming up support for Biden in an area with large Cuban and Puerto Rican populations, was scheduled at the 11th hour to try to increase voter turnout.“This is where the highest concentration of Hispanic voters are,” said Elio Muller, who directs the volunteer operations. “Our precincts are usually 60 percent turnout Democrat.”Al Jazeera’s Jennifer Glasse reflects on casting a ballot in the US after decades abroad.Read more here.3 Nov 2020 - 19:02 GMTAl Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this update from Wilmington, North Carolina.Ricardo Thomas woke up this morning feeling energised. The 35-year-old Wilmington, North Carolina-native was anxious to get to the polls to cast his first-ever ballot.“It was like the first day of school,” he told Al Jazeera. Upon leaving the polling station, Thomas said he was “feeling good”.Thomas explained that while he did not really have an interest in voting before this election, but when COVID-19 hit him and his community especially hard, he started to learn more about the candidates.“I live below the line anyway, so [often election outcomes] would never affect us,” he told Al Jazeera. “Because we don’t know what it is to have the amount of money that the people around us that we provide our services for have,” he said.“When the COVID came, I lost my job, and it really set me back, back, back.” And that’s when he says he knew he had to vote, and “be a part of change and history”.3 Nov 2020 - 18:43 GMTAl Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this dispatch from Kenosha, WisconsinElection Day is off to the races in Wisconsin.Erin Decker, chair of the Republican Party of Kenosha County, said she expects “record-high turnout” today, while Lori Hawkins, chair of the Kenosha County Democrats, said she told her children that they are witnessing history.Inside Kenosha’s municipal building, hallways dedicated to central count efforts – to tally absentee ballots separately from the polls – are bustling with volunteers and city officials. Dressed in neon green shirts, dozens of poll workers are steadily counting the 57,650 ballots that have been returned so far at tables of two, spaced six feet apart.A handful of retired men wearing bright orange lanyards attached to white placards reading “election observer” around their necks are mingling among the first-floor crowd.Outside the building, resident Dennis Phillips said he had not voted yet, but that he would likely cast a ballot later for Trump – just as he did in 2016. “He’s been doing pretty good I guess,” Phillips said.Read all the updates from earlier in the dayhere."

Despite you, I and the political class, the vast majority of Americans are not paying attention to the election,” said Erik Nisbet, a professor of policy analysis and communications at Northwestern University.“People don’t tune in until September,” he told Al Jazeera. “At this point though, it’s important to get your narratives out. It’s important to get your base solidified and mobilised.”Most polls show a tight race between Biden and Trump as the election nears, with experts saying the contest will likely come down to how the candidates fare in critical swing states like Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.But there is also widespread frustration that the choice this election cycle is the same as in 2020, when Biden defeated Trump to win the White House.A recentPew Research Center pollfound that nearly half of all registered voters said they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot if they could.About two-thirds of respondents said they had little to no confidence that Biden is physically fit enough to be president, the poll said, while a similar number said they did not believe Trump would act ethically in office.“It is Election 2.0,” said Jan Leighley, a political science professor at American University in Washington, DC.“I think that creates a disincentive for voting, which again comes back on the campaigns to convince people that, even though it’s the same choice, there’s still a reason to vote.”For the Biden camp, the message so far has been that a vote for the Democratic incumbent is avote for democratic ideals. “Democracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot,” Biden said in January.But that message is failing to resonate among key segments of the Democratic base who are angered by the Biden administration’s unequivocal support for Israel amid its war in Gaza.The recent wave of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses has highlighted a generational divide over the US’s relationship with Israel, and that, in turn, couldpose a serious problemfor Biden as he seeks the youth vote in November.In 2020, Biden won about 60 percent support among voters aged 18 to 29.But arecent CNN pollshowed Biden trailing Trump — 51 percent to 40 percent — among voters under age 35, and experts say a lack of enthusiasm among young voters could spell trouble.“We know how college students are feeling,” said Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairperson for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party.“And I can tell you for sure that there are too many who would stay home” on November 5 if Biden does not change his Middle East policy, Pyarali added. “I doubt that people would switch over to Trump, but they would certainly not vote.”According to Nisbet at Northwestern University, Biden’s campaign needs to focus in the coming months on “getting the Democratic house in order” before it tries to appeal to the relatively small number of undecided voters in the country.Any protests at the Democratic National Convention, for example, could hurt him. Democrats will gather in Chicago in August to formally confirm Biden as their 2024 nominee.“The Democratic Party, or at least the Biden campaign, does not want any dissension within the [party] because it’s a bad visual,” said Nisbet.Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Trump’s campaign has unfolded against unprecedented legal turmoil.The former president faces four separate criminal cases, includingan ongoing trialin New York over allegations he falsified business records related to a hush-money payment made to an adult film star.While the indictments have done little so far to dent Trump’s support among Republican voters, somepolling suggeststhat a chunk of the US electorate would not vote for him if he were convicted in any of the cases.Trump is expected to be confirmed as the Republican Party’s 2024 nominee at the party’s convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.“The conventions go on over the summer, but there’s usually not a whole lot of activity campaign-wise,” said Leighley at American University.But this year might be different, given Trump’s court hearings and the pressure on Biden over the Gaza war. “Those could be unusual bumps, if you will, that provide campaigns opportunities to do more in terms of ads,” she said.Both Leighley and Nisbet saidthe US economyis always an important election issue, and it will continue to be a focus over the next few months of campaigning.Despite positive economic indicators, many Americans believe they are worse off now than when Trump was in the White House, recent polls have suggested.“There is a big gap where people, for whatever reason — it could be because of the economics, it could be a bias of memory — they look more favourably at Trump’s then-presidency than Biden’s current one overall,” said Nisbet.He added that the economy is hurting Biden among Latino and Black voters, as well as young people, all of whom are key segments of the Democratic base.“Trump will want to talk about how bad the economy is,” said Nisbet, while Biden’s team instead will “try to change the conversation” and pivot to other issues.That includes access to abortion. Biden has made defending access to reproductive healthcare a central plank of his re-election campaign, repeatedlycondemning Trumpand Republican Party lawmakers for supporting abortion restrictions.In 2022, under Trump, the US Supreme Court formed a conservative “supermajority”, allowing it tooverturn Roe v Wade, a landmark 1973 ruling that established abortion access as a constitutional right.Eliminating Roe had been a conservative priority for decades, and several Republican-led states have since enacted strict limits on abortion.According to Leighley, “there will be an emphasis on the issue of abortion and Trump’s role in that and the Republican Party and its plans” as the presidential campaigns inch closer to the fall months of September and October.That is also when the first debate between Biden and Trump could take place.The Commission on Presidential Debatesreiteratedon Wednesday that the first televised face-off between the candidates would take place on September 16, confirming dates announced late last year.The announcement came after Trump’s team had urged the commission to move the schedule forward.There has been uncertainty around the 2024 debates, particularly as Trump eschewed participating in any during the Republican primary process. But last week, both Biden and Trump said they were up for it.“I honestly don’t know if either one wants them, but it is an American tradition — and I think it really would hurt American democracy if we did not have presidential debates,” said Nesbit.“It’s a major aspect of our tradition in the United States. And having presidential debates, even if they don’t change anyone’s minds — and they rarely do — I think it’s important for Americans to hear their two candidates at least air their perspectives.”"

For two decades, President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.",Last update 6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"For two decades, Russian President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Moscow wouldbackUS Vice PresidentKamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s nominee, in presidentialelectionsin November.The nature of Putin’s comments suggests he was joking, or trolling the Harris campaign, at a time when the US government under the Joe Biden administration has levelled new allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in the November vote, to favour former President Donald Trump.Yet whatever Putin’s motivations for the comments on Harris, they are the latest iteration of the Russian leader’s attempts to inject Moscow into the US electoral process.This is not the first time Putin has thrown his support behind a US presidential candidate.Putinhimself has been in Russia’s top job since 2012. He was also president between 2000 and 2008.Al Jazeera recaps two decades of the Russian president’s tongue-in-cheek meddling in US elections.At an economic forum in the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, Putin wryly said that current President Joe Biden was his “favourite”.Since Biden has dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, she was Putin’s next best bet, the Russian leader teased.He added that Harris has an “expressive and infectious laugh”, which indicates “she’s doing well”. The audience broke into scatted laughter as he said that if Harris is doing well, maybe she would not impose sanctions on Russia.“I don’t know if I’m insulted or he did me a favour,” Republican challengerTrumpresponded at a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.Putin’s comments came a day after the US Department of Justice accused Russian-owned state broadcaster RT of campaigning to sway the US vote, indicting two Russian journalists.But this isn’t the first time that Putin has stirred the pot of US domestic politics.In October 2004, Putin endorsed Republican incumbent President George W Bush. He said that if Bush lost it would lead to the “spread of terrorism” globally.Bush had been facing criticism from Democratic challenger John Kerry for not adequately tackling “terrorism”.This was amid thewar on Iraqwhich started in 2003 after the US under Bush invaded the country.Bush defeated Kerry in the 2004 race and was re-elected as president.While Putin did not make a clear endorsement in the 2008 US presidential race, experts were clear that a win for DemocratBarack Obamaover Republican John McCain was Russia’s preferred outcome.While both Obama and McCain held a harsh stance on Russia, Kremlin officials believed that under Obama, a newcomer at the time, US-Russia relations could start with a clean slate unlike under Cold War veteran McCain.After being in office for two terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin was constitutionally barred from assuming the role of president for a third consecutive term.Hence, Dmitry Medvedev rose to the top job with Putin as his premier. However, it was widely believed in Russia and globally at the time that Putin continued to hold real power in Russia. It was said that Putin and Medvedev ruled in “tandemocracy”.Obama won the 2008 election.Ahead of the 2012 US presidential race, in which Obama was taking on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Putin told Russian state media that Obama was “an honest person who really wants to change much for the better”.Romney had deemed Russia the top “geopolitical foe” of the US, something Putin said Romney was “mistaken” about, during the same interview.Obama defeated Romney in the 2012 election.Ahead of the 2016 US election, Putin spoke highly of Trump during an annual news conference with reporters.“He is a bright and talented person without any doubt,” he said, adding that Trump is “outstanding and talented”.Trump was up against Democratic challengerHilary Clintonin the election.After Trump’s election victory, Putin said Trump was a “clever man” who would “quickly understand” his role in office.In July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC)emails were hackedand leaked, showing preferential treatment to Clinton, angering supporters of her primary Democatic opponent Bernie Sanders.The US government formally placed the blame for the hack on Russia in a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Putin denied Russia’s role in the DNC hack but said the leaks themselves were important. “The important thing is the content that was given to the public,” he said.The US also accused Russia of a larger election interference programme aimed at defeating Clinton and helping Trump come to power, involving troll farms that amplified messaging tailored against the Democrats.In October 2019, on a panel at Russian Energy Week, Putin was asked if he would interfere with the2020 US election.“I’ll tell you a secret: Yes, we’ll definitely do it. Just don’t tell anyone,” the Russian president joked in a fake whisper.He then said hisworking relationshipwith Trump did not mean that he had any influence on the domestic politics in the US. He insisted that he did not interfere in the 2016 US election and that he was dealing with issues in his own country.“We have our own problems,” he said."

I almost threw a shoe at the television in my hotel room. I also pondered throwing a lamp and hairbrush for good measure.I’m not usually prone to uncontrollable outbursts of anger, but this time, it was almost justified. Why? Not even a few hours had passed since the election was called for US President Barack Obama, and the television commentators and pundits couldn’t stop talking about who might run for president in 2016. I’m not joking.  Apparently, it’s a burning issue, who will try to be president in four years.This country and many in its media have become almost obsessed with covering campaigns. It’s become like a sporting event for politically inclined people. It’s easy to follow and often exciting, but for now it is over. Let me stress that. President Barack Obama has secured another four-year term, and it seems we should be talking about what he does with that time.I was lucky enough to be in the hall at McCormick Place as the results trickled in. I waited on my media riser (my perch from which I talk into the camera), as thousands of Obama supporters waited for Governor Mitt Romney to publicly acknowledge his defeat, and for the president to address the crowd, the country and the world.After what seemed like a longer than usual wait, the concession happened. The president took the stage and laid out a few items on his agenda tax reform, the national debt and immigration. That was about as detailed as he got, but then again, you wouldn’t expect Obama to give a detailed policy speech at an election night party. I can’t help but wonder what he is going to try to do in his second term.And it is during those second terms that presidents often focus more on their long-term legacies. That probably explains why they usually wait so long to try and tackle the tough foreign policy issues – such as the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. So what does the president want the historians to write of his legacy?From his first term, it’s pretty obvious that he likes the big accomplishments. The healthcare reform law was – to use the vice president’s phrase, “a big … deal” (yes, I left a word out because of our younger readers). So, will Obama go big in his second term and stake more political capital in the process?It seems that his most pressing issue is bringing the country’s annual deficits and the broader national debt under control. The smart folks who understand the complexity of macroeconomics say he has to focus on that. The question is: “How he can come up with a trillion dollars a year?” A trillion, actually a little bit more than that. That is the difference between what the government takes in and what it spends. That is the amount of red ink the country has created during each of the president’s first four years. He took office in 2008 promising to cut the deficit in half, and he has fallen far short.I don’t care what anyone in the media says about it, now that the campaign season is over. It seems to me the politicians are going to have to do the things they hate the most, take away services or raise taxes, probably both.That will make the president very unpopular now, but history may look kindly on a leader who actually puts the country on a sustainable fiscal path. The question is what matters more to the president. We can’t answer that yet, the election, after all, just happened.It did happen. I was there. It’s over, now it is time for the country and its media to focus on where he tries to take everyone next.Follow Patty Culhane on Twitter:@PattyCulhane"

In the US, presidential elections are decided by a state-based vote allocation system. Here's what you need to know.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"In the US, presidential elections are decided by a state-based vote allocation system. Here’s what you need to know.It’s at the heart of how presidential elections in the United States are decided. But for many,the Electoral Collegeis a mystery, wrapped in a riddle, shrouded in an enigma.It doesn’t have to be confusing, though.To understand the Electoral College system, you first have to know that US presidents are not elected by the national popular vote: the total number of votes each candidate receives.Instead, a group of 538 so-called “electors” select the president. These electors make up the Electoral College.So who are these electors?Before the election, the political parties in each state choose aslate of electors: real people who ultimately cast a vote for the president. Very often, the electors are party officials or supporters.Each state gets the same number of electors as it has representatives in the US House of Representatives and the US Senate.For example, Michigan gets 15 Electoral College votes. That corresponds to the two senators and 13 House members that represent the state in Congress.Now that we know who these electors are and how many represent each state, how are their votes allocated? Here’s where it gets fun.In nearly all the states across the US, the presidential candidate who gets the most votes wins all that state’s electors: It’s a winner-takes-all system. Even if a candidate wins a state narrowly, they still get all the electors.The outliers are Maine and Nebraska, which allocate their electors based on a more complicated system that reflects the popular vote on the state and congressional district levels.The District of Columbia — which is not a state but encompasses the country’s capital — also gets three Electoral College votes.But here is the most important part: To win the White House, a presidential candidate must win the support of a majority of the electors.So out of a total of 538 Electoral College votes, they needat least 270to win.The electors ultimately cast their votes in December, about a month after the election.Their votes are then certified by Congress in early January, when the president is confirmed and takes office.So what does this all mean?Effectively, to win the US presidency, a candidate has to win support in enough key states to reach that magic Electoral College number of 270.Under this system, a candidate who wins the popular vote — the most votes in total across the US — may not actually win the White House.Onerecent examplecame in 2016, when Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump. His victory was buoyed by wins in states like Florida and Pennsylvania, each of which offered at least 20 Electoral College votes.The Electoral College system was designed, in effect, to ensure the political power of the states.Some Americans say the Electoral College should be scrapped in favour of the popular vote. Others argue the system ensures highly populated states do not overshadow smaller ones, thereby encouraging minority representation in US democracy."

So what are the facts behind the claim?Trump invoked the “60-day rule” while responding to anupdated indictmentfiled last month in the federal election case in Washington, DC.“It is DOJ policy that the Department of Justice should not take any action that will influence an election within 60 days of that election – but they just have taken such action,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Others have since echoed that criticism. Last week, Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, questioned federal prosecutors in the Florida case about whether holding a trial before the election would violate the rule.Legal experts, however, have rejected that position. And Jay Bratt, a federal prosecutor in the Florida case, told Cannon that, since Trump had already been charged, no rule or norm would be violated.Trump was referring to an unwritten — and admittedly vague — guideline that Justice Department officials have adopted over the years.A 2018 report from the Justice Department’s inspector general clearly states: “No Department policy contains a specific prohibition on overt investigative steps within a particular period before an election.”Still, it noted that many officials have adhered to “a longstanding unwritten practice to avoid overt law enforcement and prosecutorial activities close to an election, typically within 60 or 90 days of Election Day”.The report probed the decision by former FBI director James Comey to reopen an investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails just 11 days before the 2016 election.Comey later said avoiding actions that could impact the election was a “very important norm”.No. Because the guideline is unwritten, it is a best practice rather than a legal requirement. When and how the guideline applies is up to department officials.Legal scholars have further argued that Trump cannot claim he was being treated unfairly because the guideline only applies to major actions, like the filing of brand-new indictments.Because Trump had been indicted long before the 60-day window, the guideline would theoretically not apply to the ongoing federal proceedings in Washington, DC, and Florida.The guideline is also not valid for Trump’supcoming sentencingin New York or the pending trial in Georgia: Both of which are state-level proceedings, whereas the guideline is strictly federal.Finally, Trump may need to check his math. Even if he were correct about the rule, Special Counsel Jack Smith filed the updated indictment on August 27. That is 70 days out from the November 5 vote."

It took another 16 days to determine that Biden was the winner in the state of Georgia.All states allow votes to be cast in some form either in thelead-up to election dayor on election day itself.In some states, mail-in ballots can be verified ahead of time and then rapidly tabulated on election day, often through automated systems.But others prohibit any processing until election day itself, which can lead to a time-consuming backlog.States then have varying periods of time to self-audit the results. A recount can also be requested in most states depending on the vote margin, while others give voters time to correct a mistake – or “cure” a ballot.Ultimately, state executives must issue so-called Certificates of Ascertainment showing the official, final vote tally by a specific date. This year, the deadline is December 11.The president-elect’s victory then is officially certified by Congress in January.Tight races in key battleground states in 2020 – as well as an increase in mail-in voting amid the COVID pandemic – saw particularly slow vote counts.That helped fuel unfounded claims of election malfeasance pushed by Trump and his allies.Those false claims were furthered aided by the fact that Democrats typically vote more by mail-in ballots than Republicans.As a result, in states where there are delays in counting those mail-in ballots, people can get the impression that there has been a late surge in Democratic votes – also known as a “blue shift”.To counter misinformation, election experts have called on states to shore up their vote-counting processes.While some key battleground states have done so, others – such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia – have done little to assure a speedier process this year.Georgia’s election board has even moved to require hand counts of votes on election day, which experts warn could cause even more significant delays."

And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote.pic.twitter.com/RMIRvlSOYw— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden)July 21, 2024His initial statement did not include an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with anexpression of support.Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run at the top of a major party ticket in the country’s history.Biden’s historic move – the first sitting president to give up his party’s nomination for re-electionsince President Lyndon Johnsonin March 1968 – leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.The Democratic backlash against Biden came after he delivered anunsteady performanceat the first presidential debate of the 2024 election season as he lost his train of thought and struggled to articulate basic talking points.Biden’s failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump’s performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden’s fitness for another term.Days later, he raised fresh concerns in an interview, shrugging off Democrats’ worries and a widening gap in opinion polls, and saying he would be fine losing to Trump if he knew he would “gave it my all”.His gaffes at a NATO summit – invoking Russian President Vladimir Putin’s name when he meant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and calling Harris “Vice President Trump” – further stoked anxieties.Only four days before Sunday’s announcement, Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 for a third time, forcing him to cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas. More than one in 10 congressional Democrats had called publicly for him to quit the race.The 46th US president’s departure from the race leaves the Democratic Party in an unprecedented situation, with only a month until the Democratic National Convention and less than four months until the November 5 election.It was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party’s nomination – she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials – or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, said Biden had been under a lot of pressure recently.“It is very difficult to say what made him make the decision now,” he said.“What we do know is that he has been repeatedly insistent that he would not step down … So it comes as a bit of a surprise and a bit of a shock that Biden is saying he will step down after weeks of saying he won’t.”"

The New Hampshire voter picked up and heard a voice telling her not to vote in the upcoming presidential primary.“As I listened to it, I thought, gosh, that sounds like Joe Biden,” Gingrich told Al Jazeera. “But the fact that he was saying to save your vote, don’t use it in this next election — I knew Joe Biden would never say that.”The voice may have sounded like the United States president, but it wasn’t him: It was adeepfake, generated by artificial intelligence (AI).Experts warn that deepfakes — audio, video or images created using AI tools, with the intent to mislead — posea high riskto US voters ahead of the November general election, not only by injecting false content into the race but by eroding public trust.Gingrich said she didn’t fall for the Biden deepfake, but she fears it may have suppressed voter turnout. The message reached nearly 5,000 New Hampshire voters just days beforethe state’s primary.“This could be bad for people that aren’t so informed about what’s going on with the Democrats,” said Gingrich, who is the chair of the Barrington Democratic Committee in Burlington, New Hampshire.“If they really thought they shouldn’t vote for something and Joe Biden was telling them not to, then maybe they wouldn’t attend that vote.”The Biden call wasn’t the only deepfake so far this election cycle. Beforecalling offhis presidential bid, Florida GovernorRon DeSantis’s campaign shared a video that contained AI-generated images of Donald Trump hugging immunologistAnthony Fauci— two figures whoclashedpublicly during the COVID-19 pandemic.And in September, a different robocall went out to 300 voters expected to participate inSouth Carolina’s Republican primary. This time, recipients heard an AI-generated voice that imitated SenatorLindsey Graham, asking whom they were voting for.The practice of altering or faking content — especially for political gain — has existed since the dawn of US politics. Even the country’s first president, George Washington, had to contend with a series of “spurious letters” that appeared to show him questioning the cause of US independence.But AI tools are now advanced enough to convincingly mimic people quickly and cheaply, heightening the risk of disinformation.Astudypublished earlier this year by researchers at George Washington University predicted that, by mid-2024, daily “AI attacks” would escalate, posing a threat to the November general election.The study’s lead author Neil Johnson told Al Jazeera that the highest risk doesn’t come from the recent, obviously fake robocalls — which contained eyebrow-raising messages — but rather from more convincing deepfakes.“It’s going to be nuanced images, changed images, not entirely fake information because fake information attracts the attention of disinformation checkers,” Johnson said.The study found that online communities are linked in a way that allows bad actors to send large quantities of manipulated media directly into the mainstream.Communities inswing statescould be especially vulnerable, as couldparenting groupson platforms like Facebook.“The role of parenting communities is going to be big one,” Johnson said, pointing to the rapid spread of vaccine misinformation during the pandemic as an example.“I do think that we’re going to be suddenly faced with a wave of [disinformation] — lots of things that are not fake, they’re not untrue, but they stretch the truth.”Voters themselves, however, are not the only targets of deepfakes. Larry Norden, senior director of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, has been working withelection officialsto help them spot fake content.For instance, Norden said bad actors could use AI tools to instruct election workers to close a polling location prematurely, by manipulating the sound of their boss’s voice or by sending a message seemingly through a supervisor’s account.He is teaching poll workers to protect themselves by verifying the messages they receive.Norden emphasised that bad actors can create misleading content without AI. “The thing about AI is that it just makes it easier to do at scale,” he said.Just last year, Norden illustrated the capabilities of AI by creating a deepfake videoof himselffor a presentation on the risks the technology poses.“It didn’t take long at all,” Norden said, explaining that all he had to do was feed his previous TV interviews into an app.His avatar wasn’t perfect — his face was a little blurry, his voice a little choppy — but Norden noted the AI tools are rapidly improving. “Since we recorded that, the technology has gotten more sophisticated, and I think it’s more and more difficult to tell.”The technology alone is not the problem. As deepfakes become more common, the public will become more aware of them and more sceptical of the content they consume.That could erode public trust, with voters more likely to reject true information. Political figures could also abuse that scepticism for their own ends.Legal scholars have termed this phenomenon the “liar’s dividend”: Concern about deepfakes could make it easier for the subjects of legitimate audio or video footage to claim the recordings are fake.Norden pointed to theAccess Hollywood audiothat emerged before the 2016 election as an example. In the clip, then-candidate Trump is heard talking about his interactions with women: “You can do anything. Grab ‘em by the pussy.”The tape — which was very real — was considered damaging to Trump’s prospects among female voters. But if similar audio leaked today, Norden said a candidate could easily call it fake. “It would be easier for the public to dismiss that kind of thing than it would have been a few years ago.”Norden added, “One of the problems that we have right now in the US is that there’s a lack of trust, and this may only make things worse.”While deepfakes are a growing concern in US elections, relatively few federal laws restrict their use. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has yet to restrict deepfakes in elections, and bills in Congress remain stalled.Individual states are scrambling to fill the void. According to alegislation trackerpublished by the consumer advocacy organisation Public Citizen, 20 state laws have been enacted so far to regulate deepfakes in elections.Several more bills — in Hawaii, Louisiana and New Hampshire — have passed and are awaiting a governor’s signature.Norden said he was not surprised to see individual states act before Congress. “States are supposed to be the laboratories of democracy, so it’s proving true again: The states are acting first. We all know it’s really hard to get anything passed in Congress,” he said.Voters and political organisations are taking action, too. After Gingrich received the fake Biden call in New Hampshire, she joined a lawsuit — led by the League of Women Voters — seeking accountability for the alleged deception.The source of the call turned out to be Steve Kramer, a political consultant who claimed his intention was to draw attention to the need to regulate AI in politics. Kramer also admitted to being behind the robocall in South Carolina, mimicking Senator Graham.Kramer came forward after NBC News revealed he had commissioned a magician to use publicly available software to generate the deepfake of Biden’s voice.According to the lawsuit, the deepfake took less than 20 minutes to create and cost only $1.Kramer, however, told CBS News that he received “$5m worth of exposure” for his efforts, which he hoped would allow AI regulations to “play themselves out or at least begin to pay themselves out”.“My intention was to make a difference,” he said.But Kramer’s case shows existing laws can be used to curtail deepfakes.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), for instance, ruled (PDF) earlier this year that voice-mimicking software falls under the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act — and is therefore illegal in most circumstances.The commission ultimatelyproposeda $6m penalty against Kramer for the illegal robocall.The New Hampshire Department of Justice alsochargedKramer with felony voter suppression and impersonating a candidate, which could result in up to seven years in prison. Kramer has pleaded not guilty. He did not respond to a request for comment from Al Jazeera.Norden said it is significant that none of the laws Kramer is accused of breaking are specifically tailored to deepfakes. “The criminal charges against him have nothing to do with AI,” he said. “Those laws exist independently of the technology that is used.”However, those laws are not as easy to apply to bad actors who are not identifiable or who are located outside of the US.“We know from the intelligence agencies that they’re already seeing China and Russia experimenting with these tools. And they expect them to be used,” Norden said. “In that sense, you’re not going to legislate your way out of this problem.”Both Norden and Johnson believe the lack of regulation makes it more important for voters to inform themselves about deepfakes — and learn how to find accurate information.As for Gingrich, she said she knows that manipulative deepfakes will only grow more ubiquitous. She too feels voters need to inform themselves about the risk.Her message to voters? “I would tell people to make sure that they know they can vote.”"
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/30/us-elections-bernie-sanders-campaigns-for-michigan-progressives,US elections: Bernie Sanders campaigns for Michigan progressives ...,"Jul 30, 2022 ... As he campaigned for his progressive allies, Congress members Andy Levin and Rashida Tlaib, the senator raged against the influence of money in politics.",Last update 30 Jul 2022,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Left-wing US senator implicitly hits out at the pro-Israel group AIPAC at a rally for Rashida Tlaib and Andy Levin.Pontiac, Michigan, US –More than two years after ending hissecond campaignfor the Democratic nomination for president, Bernie Sanders can still get large crowds to cheer widely and mobilise for his message against income and wealth inequality.In Pontiac, Michigan – a town north of Detroit – on Friday, Sanders had a new angle to discuss beyond his usual anger about the cost of healthcare and the growing gap between the poor and the ultra-rich.As he campaigned for his progressive allies, Congress members Andy Levin and Rashida Tlaib, the senator raged against the influence of money in politics, implicitly hitting out against the American Israel Public Affairs Committee(AIPAC), a lobbying group which has been spending millions of dollars to defeat progressives.“This election is particularly important. It’s important because Andy, based on his work, deserves to be reelected; Rashida deserves to be reelected,” Sanders said. “But it’s equally important in saying that the people of Michigan have got to tell these billionaires in their corporate PACs [political action committees], they cannot buy our democracy.”The rally in Pontiac, where Levin is running, came days before the Michigan Democratic primary on August 2, where pro-Israel groups – spearheaded by AIPAC – have been spending millions on campaign ads to get their favoured candidates elected.Levin, a former labour organiser who hails from a renowned Jewish-American political family, has been aprimary targetof AIPAC this cycle.“One group has spent $4.2m to try to defeat me because I stand for a simple proposition: The only way to have a secure peaceful homeland for the Jewish people – for my people – is to fully achieve the political and human rights of the Palestinian people. I Will. Not. Back. Down,” Levin told the crowd, stopping between the words to emphasise that he is undeterred by AIPAC’s attacks.The pro-Israel lobby has made it a quest to defeat left-wing candidates in Democratic primaries this year through its super PAC, United Democracy Project — which uses donor funds to run ads against or in support of candidates without coordinating with their campaigns.And so far, ithas succeededin several contests across the country.AIPAC has not intervened directly against Tlaib, but another newly formed pro-Israel group has pledged to spend $1m to help defeat the Palestinian-American congresswoman. Still, with the advantage of incumbency, Tlaib is a favourite in the race that includes several opponents.Levin, however, is at serious risk of losing his seat; he is running against fellow sitting Congress member Haley Stevens, a staunch Israel advocate. Parts of the two lawmakers’ old districts were merged after redistricting following the2020 Census, and they are running against each other in a newly drawn constituency.AIPAC and Stevens’ campaign have not returned Al Jazeera’s request for comment this week.On Friday, Tlaib said negative ads run by “out-of-town millionaires and billionaires” make her want to “work harder” and double down on her progressive advocacy.“We are not going to let anyone come into our communities and tell us how to vote and try to pit us against each other,” Tlaib said.For his part, Sanders stressedthat AIPACspending against left-wing candidates is about sinking the priorities of progressives on behalf of its billionaire mega-donors.“It has nothing to do – in my view –with Israel,” Sanders said. “It is simply trying to defeat candidates and members of Congress who stand for working families and are prepared to demand that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes.”Sanders called Levin’s campaign “historic”.“The billionaire class is saying, ‘We own this country; we own the political system, and we will not tolerate dissent. Either you work for us, or get out of here.’ And Andy has chosen not to work for them,” he added.In an audience of a few hundred attendees, dozens came with shirts and signs featuring Sanders’s image and slogans on Friday.Lorenzo Sollena, a 29-year-old substitute teacher, said the senator from Vermont and a few of his progressive allies are the only ones challenging the political status quo in the United States.“Bernie is the last person fighting … The country has come to a standstill. People say they care about universal healthcare, and they care aboutabortion rights, but nobody’s fighting back,” said Sollena, who was wearing a t-shirt featuring photos of Sanders throughout the decades with the caption: “We will never stop fighting for what is right.”"

Harris may be the lesser of two evils when it comes to Donald Trump, but the lesser of two evils is still evil. If she wants to win in November, ...",19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"My red line is genocide, and no ‘good vibes’ campaigning will move it.I registered to vote in 1998, and I have voted Democrat ever since. I have not always felt good about the candidates on the Democratic ticket. In fact, I have usually felt angry, disillusioned, disappointed and dirty after casting my vote. Still, it felt like part of the job of being a citizen of a pseudo-democracy. It was not the only work to be done, but it was something.This November, however, I plan not to vote for the Democrats in the election. If the party’s presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, does not change her policy on Israel, I will not be casting a ballot for her.And I will not be the only one. More than 700,000 Americans have cast an “uncommitted” vote in the Democratic primaries, demonstrating their rejection of the Democratic Party’s “ironclad” support for Israel.If Harris wants the progressive vote, she has to support an arms embargo on Israel and stop funding the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. This is a red line for many of us who have not bought into her liberal cult of personality.When President Joe Biden finally dropped out as the 2024 Democratic nominee on July 21, I was not one of the many people celebrating his endorsement of the vice president. Harris was on the wrong side of history as San Francisco’s district attorney when she opposed criminal justice reform, and she has been on the wrong side of history in regards to Israel, which she is a staunch supporter of.Still, a small part of me hoped she would be savvy enough to understand the power of the “uncommitted” movement – which is conditioning voting on support for an embargo on Israel and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza – and the level of outrage felt by those opposed to the ongoing genocide, funded these past 10 months by US aid. I was wrong.Ata rally in Detroit on August 7, Harris was met by a group of anti-genocide, pro-Palestine protesters chanting, “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide! We won’t vote for genocide!” In a democracy, this is a perfectly reasonable and acceptable (if not necessary) action. Politicians serve the people, and the people have the right (and the responsibility) to make demands on their political leaders, especially when the latter are asking for their votes and campaign donations.Yet Harris decided to respond: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”What purpose does this attitude serve? The protesters were merely expressing their demand that Harris pledge to stop arming Israel amid its genocidal war on Gaza. A war that has brought the official death toll in Gaza to more than 40,000; some estimates project that number to reach186,000or even higher. A war that has put one million children at risk of famine, according to the international nonprofit organisation Save the Children. A war that has decimated Gaza’s health sector, bringing back polio infections for the first time in 25 years.Many of us spend our days scrolling through the most horrific images imaginable – toddlers beheaded by Israeli air strikes,people burned alive in their tents, emaciated children who die of starvation, political prisoners brutally raped by Israeli soldiers. The atrocities go on and on. My days and nights are haunted by these images, and none of this would be possible without US aid, without our tax dollars.But Harris doesn’t want to engage these very reasonable demands – to stop funding this slaughter, this genocide, this horrific violence. Instead, she wants to be celebrated for being charismatic, for her affect, for her vibes.This politics-as-vibes is not new. It is nothing more than celebrity culture bleeding into politics. Another word for it is fascism.I am reminded of Erik Larson’s 2011 book In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler’s Berlin, which tells the story of William Dodd, the US ambassador to Germany from 1933 to 1937 and his family. Over the years since the book was published, I have thought occasionally of Dodd and often of his daughter, Martha, who accompanied him to Berlin.The ambassador was chairman of the history department at the University of Chicago at the time of his appointment, and he just wanted to be left alone to finish his book about the antebellum American South. He was somewhat concerned but not too alarmed about what was happening in Germany, telling President Franklin Roosevelt, “Give men a chance to try their schemes” as the Nazi Party prepared to deny Jews citizenship.Martha, on the other hand, was swept up by the “glamour” of the Nazi Party and its social scene, dating and sleeping with Nazi officers.So many liberals I know are a form of William or Martha Dodd. Like William, they are either too consumed with their own comfort to care too much about the daily atrocities experienced and endured by Palestinians, or, like Martha, they approach politics through the frame of celebrity culture and good feelings, happy to fangirl Harris, whose charisma and Beyonce-scored inspire-ads overwhelm the pesky reality of genocide.This is, after all, about feeling good. “Don’t spoil our fun!” they scream at me (and so many others) on social media. This anti-outrage is deafening. But you cannot just live off vibes.In a memoir written a few years after she left Nazi Germany, Martha admitted to just not really liking Jews all that much. This casual anti-Semitism foreshadows today’s liberal attitudes towards Palestinians, a disregard rooted in Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism, which is driving a genocide.This is a make-or-break moment – we must pressure the Democrats to change their position on Gaza before the elections in November. While we should all be doing absolutely everything we can to stop the genocide, the bare minimum right now is demanding that a presidential hopeful, in need of our votes, commits to ending US funds to Israel. It is not that complicated.Harris may be the lesser of two evils when it comes to Donald Trump, but the lesser of two evils is still evil. If she wants to win in November, she needs to give us more than vibes and celebrity culture – she needs to make a real commitment to ending the genocide in Gaza, first and foremost by not funding it. Anything less than this will lose her the progressive vote and, quite possibly, the presidency. If this happens, the liberals across the country will likely blame a nebulous “leftist-progressive” block, but in the end, this loss will be on Harris herself.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

That is when polls close in California, which has the most electoral votes of any state – 55 – and that could put a candidate over the 270 threshold.However, 23:00 EST is considered early, at least in recent history. Of the past five presidential elections, only 2008 was called at that time, when California’s projected win for Barack Obama put him past the 270 electoral vote threshold. In 2012 and 2016, the winners were projected in the overnight EST hours.Twice in the past five elections, projections of winners were not even made on election night. In 2004, George W Bush was not called the winner until midday the day after the election.And in 2000, the media outlets making projections erroneously called Florida for Al Gore before rescinding that projection. The close nature of the results of that race led to neither Gore nor George W Bush having enough electoral votes without Florida’s results, leading to weeks of recounts and legal battles. Florida was not called until December 12, when the US Supreme Court ordered the state’s recount halted. Bush had a 537-vote lead at that point and was declared the winner, delivering him the state’s electoral votes and an Electoral College victory.It is worth noting that the process of “calling” winners and losers in each state is not necessarily based on exact vote tallies but is based on projections made by analysts who look at polling and how vote counts are shaping up in key precincts or counties.If it is a state where one candidate is expected to win from the get-go – and potentially 30 states fall into that category this year – then those states can be projected as soon as polls close or shortly thereafter.If it is a closely-contested state or it is not obvious who the winner is at a state’s poll closing time, then projections of winners will be delayed as analysts watch the vote tallies come in. The closer the count – or any vote-counting problems – can slow down the timing of a projection.The US media. US media outlets have a long history of trying to speed up the process of informing Americans of the winners and losers of presidential races, and it has not always run smoothly.In addition to the 2000 election projection problem, there were some other infamous incorrect projections. In 1916, the New York Times prematurely and erroneously declared Charles Evans Hughes the winner over Woodrow Wilson. In 1948, election analysts at the Chicago Daily Tribune famously – and incorrectly – concluded that Thomas Dewey defeated Harry Truman.The system that is used for election projections today has its roots in the early 1960s, when the major US wire services and television networks pooled their resources to place thousands of people all over the country to gather precinct returns, which were fed into computers to help make calls. In 1990, the Associated Press and US broadcasters created a new system that combined exit polling with vote results, which is generally the method still in use today.Currently, the Associated Press and Fox News share one set of exit polls and come up with their own separate projections. ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC are the remaining members of the system that was formed in 1990, and they use that data to reach their own projections.No. Counting every single vote will take several days and, in some cases, several weeks. States have different methods and procedures for counting in-person and mail-in ballots and when their counts are completed, each state will certify its results. If all goes as planned, each state’s certified results will be formally presented when the state meets to certify its electors, prior to the Electoral College meeting on December 14.The vote count has never been certified on election night and 2020 is no different. What potentially complicates things this year is that most states will be counting more mail-in ballots than ever, and their procedures have not been tested at this scale. It is expected there will be vote-counting issues in some states. Three states  – all tightly contested –  Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are not allowed to begin counting mail-in votes until November 3, which could prolong an announcement.If neither candidate has been projected as the Electoral College winner and projections for some states are on hold because there is a wait for a vote count, that could create long delays in knowing who the winner will be.And that scenario has some worried about potential political mischief and protracted legal battles, prolonging the declaration of a final outcome."

US elections: This is not a time for jokes. If you believe in America, if you love this country, then the founding ideals are what you should be ...",Last update 13 Aug 2016,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"If you believe in America, if you love this country, then the founding ideals are what you should be fighting for.White supremacy in the United States is dying. Many,including me, have said this before.White supremacy – the implicit acceptance of the superiority of white people and culture – is slowly being pushed aside as people (themselves slowly) accept the reality that “white culture” is nothing more than one stop on the global tour of humanity.The fact that, in the US, white is the default definition of “normal” is a historical accident, and that pillar of history is falling. That makes this a very dangerous time.The death of white supremacy is dangerous because of the depths of fear into which some white people have fallen.This is unfortunate because white supremacy’s demise in no way implies a dying white race. It does not even imply the actual death of white supremacy itself.That venomous serpent, as we’ve seen in the 1800s and the 1960s, suffers only a metaphorical death, shedding its skin and returning in a different guise.What a dying white supremacy does mean is a death of the acceptance that white lives are any more valuable than others.That higher value of white life is all that some people have to hold onto, and the loss of that value is so difficult for them to accept that it amounts to an attack.We are on the cusp of a historic decision in the US. We can make history and transition from the first black to the first female president. The alternative is to make history by electing our first fascist demagogue.byThus we see the rise of radical white supremacists like David Duke,currently seekinga Senate seat in Louisiana on the platform that there is “massive racist and racial discrimination against European-Americans”, which is what radical white supremacists call it when you suggest that Black Lives Matter as much as theirs do.White supremacists are so afraid of being treated the same as everyone else that they feel like they are backed into a corner, accompanied by only their fear and their guns.And they have a lot of guns.This is, of course, a fact that their ideological leader Donald Trump knows quite well. This is why he has called on them to follow him, why he has chosen to legitimise their use of violence.He knows the history of white America; he knows that violence is a valid option for white radicals.This is not a joke.We are long past the time when laughing at Donald Trump was acceptable. In fact, it was never acceptable.David Cornnoted thisin Mother Jones immediatelyfollowing the Huffington Post decision to report him as entertainment.Still we laughed. Even after Arianna Huffingtonlater stated“we are no longer entertained”, laughter and disbelief – or worse, resolved acceptance – were our response to his rise.While we follow news outlets, read bloggers, and laugh with comedians like John Oliver, we find Trump’s increasing power distasteful, sure, but still an entirely consumable media diet.Our demand has only justified the supply. Our laughter and consumption have fuelled his fire, and now people will really start getting burned.OPINION: How Donald Trump could win – and whyThis last call by Trump to theunhinged radical wingof his followers, openly legitimising violence against hispolitical opponents, is a warning sign we never should have needed.But having come this far, one thing should now be crystal clear: If we are still laughing, or silent, or anything other than actively engaged in the disruption of this man’s rise to power, then we are doing little more that fuelling the fires of fascism.And if you are in the media, whether a professional or an amateur, whether a journalist, blogger or comedian – whatever your role – you have a grave and serious responsibility to help quench this fire.We are on the cusp of a historic decision in the US. We can make history and transition from the first black to the first female president – a noble and glorious step even accepting the great struggle still required for our equality. The alternative is to make history by electing our first fascist demagogue.The US was founded on the principle of equality, liberty and justice for all. Yes, we have a great deal of work ahead of us to make that a reality.OPINION: Immigrants and Donald Trump – It’s a complicated storyBut if you believe in America, if you love this country, then that founding ideal is what you should be fighting for.Because if you love this country, “for all” means for all. It is not limited by religion, or skin colour, or gender, or physical ability.Either “for all” means for all, or it doesn’t, and “it doesn’t” means “patriarchal white supremacy”. There is no middle ground on this.That is why Black Lives Matter is a patriotic movement. That is why the fight for indigenous rights is a patriotic movement.That is why the fight for the rights of Latino and Chicano people is a patriotic movement. Because America means “for all”, or it means absolutely nothing.And that is why Trump is not someone to laugh about, but someone to fight. Because if we do not stand up for what America means, if we do not stand up “for all”, then what we have to fear is Trump and his army of white radicals rising up and making us all kneel.John Metta has worked as a cook, groundskeeper, store clerk, park ranger, Navy submariner, Army wartime medic, hydrologist, school teacher, software developer, mathematical modeller, and underwater archaeologist.

There are 435 seats in total and each seat is up for election every two years.This year’s legislative elections are even more important than usual because they are the last before a new round of redistricting based on the results of the 2020 Census. Each state’s allocated number of House members is determined by its population, so if a state loses or gains residents in the new Census, they stand to lose or gain seats in the House.There also 35 Senate seats up for grabs this year, roughly one-third of the 100-seat body. Around a dozen of those 35 are competitive seats and each is extremely important as Republican control of the chamber is at stake. Currently, the Republicans have a 53-47 advantage. If the Democrats can gain four seats, they will guarantee a takeover of the Senate majority.The most important non-federal elections this year will choose governors who run the executive branches of each individual state government.Voters in 11 states and two territories, Puerto Rico and American Samoa, will elect governors this Election Day.In the US, the president and vice president are not directly elected by voters, as laid out in the US Constitution. When voters make their presidential choice on their ballot, they are really voting for a slate of “electors”, who, after the votes are counted and certified, are pledged to vote for a presidential and vice-presidential candidate.These electors actually cast the deciding votes for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates during a meeting of the Electoral College.In 48 states, these electors “pledge” to vote for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates that receive the most votes in their respective state.Two states – Maine and Nebraska – have slightly different systems: Two electors “pledge” to vote for the candidate that wins the state’s overall popular vote, while the remaining electors are allocated to the winner in each congressional district.While the presidential election is on November 3, the Electoral College will vote on December 14.The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of its House representatives plus two, the number of US Senators in each state. There are a total of 538 electors: 535 from the 50 states and three from the District of Columbia, which is the federal capital and not a state, per the constitution.Prior to 1961, when a constitutional amendment allotted Washington, DC, three electoral votes, residents of the district did not have a say in presidential elections.Because certain states regularly vote Democratic or Republican, those states are given much less attention by presidential candidates than the states where polling is very close.Those so-called “battleground” states, also known as “swing states” or “toss-up” states, of which there are about a dozen every four years, hold disproportionate sway in US presidential elections.Election analysts consider states battlegrounds where the margin of victory is expected to be fewer than five percentage points.By November 2, more than 94 million Americans had already cast their ballots either by in-person early voting or by mail – a process expanded in many areas amid the COVID-19 pandemic.That number represents more than 68 percent of the total number of votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. Nearly 60 percent of voting-eligible Americans have participated in recent presidential elections, though some are predicting the number will rise this year.Early voting numbers in both Hawaii and Texas are higher than their total overall voter turnout in 2016.Here is what the electoral map looks like at the moment:Voter turnout for US presidential elections has hovered around 60 percent of the voting-eligible population in recent elections. In 2016, 60.1 percent of eligible voters turned out, which was up from 58.6 percent in 2012, but down from 61.6 percent in 2008.A shift in recent voting patterns due to states allowing more opportunities for voters to cast early ballots has been accelerated this year because of the pandemic."

It meant a lot to the president. He was with our heroes for about an hour, just having casual conversation, taking their questions, just talking to them and then he ended the visit by paying his respects to the special forces memorial,” Kayleigh McEnany told reporters travelling with the president on Air Force One.About 100 Army special forces troops including Delta Force and Rangers had participated in the raid. Two soldiers and a military dog were injured when al-Baghdadi, cornered in a tunnel, detonated a suicide vest.30 Oct 2020 - 00:18 GMTFormer Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris spoke with workers about the economic inequality they face.“We’re living in crazy times,” Sanders said. “You know, we’re in the midst of this terrible pandemic. So many of our people have lost their jobs and their income but are worried about climate change, worried about systemic racism.”“But tonight we are going to be asking questions like: ‘How does it happen that in the richest country in the history of the world, half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck’,” he said.Harris talked about the Biden campaign’s plans to expand sick leave for workers, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, improve availability of childcare for workers and put in place universal pre-kindergarten education for three- and four-year-olds.“These are things that we have to do. And everyone benefits,” Harris said.29 Oct 2020 - 23:56 GMTThe entertainer Lil Wayne met with Trump in Miami in the morning to talk about criminal justice reform and Trump’s so-called “Platinum Plan” to promote economic investment in Black communities.

Trump would eliminate health care coverage for millions of Americans. And the president has demonstrated disrespect for US military service people, calling them ‘losers’.Biden cut his speech short because of rain. He was speaking at a drive-in rally in Tampa, Florida.“Time’s running out. This country can’t afford four more years of Trump,” Biden said.Two people who attended Trump’s rally last week in Gastonia, North Carolina, have tested positive for the coronavirus.“These cases are not thought to be an indication of spread from the rally at this time, but rather two independent cases among individuals who were in attendance,” The Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.The department recommended anyone who attended the president’s October 21 rally assess their own risk, monitor for symptoms and get tested, if necessary.Trump’s campaign says it is postponing their Thursday night rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for a few days as Tropical Storm Zeta bears down on the Northeast.“Because of a wind advisory issued with gusts reaching 50 miles per hour and other weather conditions, the outdoor Fayetteville, NC rally has been postponed until Monday,” the campaign said in a statement.Several North Carolina counties were under tropical storm watch Thursday afternoon. North Carolina is a battleground state that Trump won in 2016 but that Democrat Joe Biden is pushing for in 2020.Several people attending Trump’s Tampa rally have reportedly required medical attention after suffering from intense heat.A number of folks here in the Tampa heat are suffering under the sun.  86 degrees. Couple of calls for medics here.— Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO)October 29, 2020The US Supreme Court rejected another bid by North Carolina Republicans to block the extension of a deadline for receiving mail-in ballots.The justices denied a request by Republican legislators in the state to put on hold an agreement made by state election officials allowing the extension that a North Carolina state court had approved.Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court on Tuesday as Trump’s third appointee, did not participate in the case. Barrett did not have time to fully review the case filings, a court spokeswoman said in a statement.More than 80 million Americans have already cast ballots in the presidential election, according to a tally from the US Elections Project – setting the stage for the highest participation rate in over a century.The record-breaking pace, more than 58 percent of total 2016 turnout, reflects intense interest in the vote.Huge numbers of people have voted by mail or at early in-person polling sites amid concerns the coronavirus could spread at busy Election Day voting places.Speaking at a drive-in rally in in Broward county, Florida Biden addressed supporters and blasted Trump for his coronavirus response and handling of protests, calling for racial justice in the country.He said Trump will not even say the phrase “Black lives matter.”He also encouraged residents of the key battleground state to vote.“This election is the most important one you’ve ever voted in …The heart and soul of this country’s at stake,” he said.Biden also made a direct pitch to Florida’s Latino voters by saying Trump is “the worst possible standard-bearer for democracy” in places like Cuba and Venezuela.Florida’s sizable and diverse Latino population could be key to Biden’s chances in Florida, a state that remains a must-win for Trump. While the state’s Cuban population has traditionally trended Republican, Democrats believe they have an opening with Florida’s Cubans because of Trump’s move to freeze relations with the nation and the changing demographics of the population.Trump addressed a large rally in Tampa, and vowed to keep the US economy open, even as cases of coronavirus continue to surge in Florida and dozens of other states.He then touted newly released data from the Commerce Department showing that the economy grew by an annualised rate of 33.1 percent in the third quarter, beating expectations, but leaving the economy 3.5 percent below where it was at the end of 2019.“I mean how many times can I say it? I’ll say it five or six times during the speech, 33.1,” Trump said.Two polls of likely voters in Florida out today show Biden with small leads, which normally would be cause for celebration in a state known for its razor-thin presidential contests. However, both polls continue to show Biden lagging among Latino voters, a significant part of Florida’s electorate.In a Monmouth poll released this afternoon, Biden leads Trump 50-45 percent overall and has a 24-point lead among Latinos. Another poll, NBC/Marist, has Biden up 51-47 percent statewide but he only holds a 5-point lead among Latino voters.There has been concern among Democrats about Biden’s lower than expected support among Florida Latinos. Clinton won Latinos there by 27 points in 2016, according to exit polls. Trump won Florida by 1.2 percentage points in 2016.Both Biden and Trump are campaigning in Florida today.Trump is also heading to North Carolina today (Biden has not been there since September 23, though his full schedule through Election Day has yet to be announced). Two polls show an extremely tight race there as well.A New York Times/Siena College poll released today shows Biden with a slim 48-45 percent lead over Trump among likely voters. A UMass Lowell poll has them knotted up at 48 percent apiece. Trump won North Carolina by 3.7 percentage points in 2016.The Monmouth poll has a +/-4.4 percent margin of error; NBC/Marist, +/-4.4 percent; New York Times/Siena, +/-3.7 percent; and UMass Lowell, +/-4.2 percent.In a new video advertisement, Biden pledged to issue an executive order creating a task force to unite migrant families who were separated under Trump’s administration.Despite a federal judge’s order that the government reunite families who had been separated at the United States-Mexico border under Trump “zero tolerance” migration policy, the parents of 545 children still have not been found.Read morehere.Biden issued a statement reminding voters that the economy is still in a “deep hole” and that the recovery, which benefited mostly “those at the top”, is slowing.The data from the Commerce Department showed that the economy grew by an annualized rate of 33.1 percent in the third quarter, beating expectations, but leaving the economy 3.5 percent below where it was at the end of 2019.Success in a Biden-Harris Administration will not be measured just by the stock market or GDP growth, but by the extent to which growth is raising the pay, dignity, and economic security of our working families—especially those who have been left behind.https://t.co/HQZ8UbUb3f— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden)October 29, 2020“Yes, GDP rose last quarter, but visits to food banks haven’t slowed, and poverty has grown. African Americans and Latinos still face double-digit unemployment rates,” Biden said. “I will fight side-by-side with the American people to rein in the virus and provide needed economic relief.”Trump meanwhile promised voters they would keep the growth going if given another term.“GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close,” Trump tweeted. “So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.”GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close. Next year will be FANTASTIC!!! However, Sleepy Joe Biden and his proposed record setting tax increase, would kill it all. So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)October 29, 2020Voters say the economy is one of the most important issues they are weighing during this presidential election. Roughly half of the 22 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered, but new hiring is slowing.The US economy grew at a record pace in the third quarter as the government injected more than $3 trillion worth of pandemic relief – which fueled consumer spending.According to a report by the Commerce Department, gross domestic product rebounded at a 33.1 percent annualised rate last quarter -that was the fastest pace since the government started keeping records in 1947 and followed a historic shrinkage rate of 31.4 percent in the second quarter.Trump will likely seize on the stunning rebound in GDP as a sign of recovery, but output remains below its level in the fourth quarter of 2019, a fact  Biden is almost certain to highlight along with signs that the growth spurt is fast petering out.Read morehere.In the final leg of campaign, Biden, will head to three states Trump won in 2016: Iowa, Wisconsin and then Michigan, where he will hold a joint Saturday rally with former President Barack Obama.Trump meanwhile plans to return to the Midwest on Friday, campaigning in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In all, he plans to visit 10 states in the last week of the campaign and will host 11 rallies in the final 48 hours, according to his campaign.In a significant setback for Republicans in two battleground states, the US Supreme Court allowed absentee ballots in North Carolina and Pennsylvania to be received and counted up to nine days after Election Day.Trump has made unfounded claims that voting by mail, a common practice in US elections, leads to widespread fraud.But Trump and his allies have also notched important wins, including a ruling that the Republican governor of Texas may limit drop-off sites for election ballots.Hackers stole $2.3 million from the Wisconsin Republican Party’s account, The Associated Press reported.Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt said officials noticed the suspicious activity on October 22 and contacted the FBI.President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will hold competing rallies in Florida, an essential state, especially for the president.Opinion polls suggest Biden has a significant edge nationally, but his lead is tighter in battleground states. With its 29 electoral votes, the state is a major prize in next Tuesday’s election.Trump will stage an outdoor rally in Tampa while Biden, in contrast, will hold a drive-in rally later in Tampa where attendees will remain in their cars. He will host a similar event earlier in the day in Broward County in South Florida.Read more about Florida’s role in in the electionhere.Three of four voters express concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll has found.Only one in four say they are “very confident” the nation will have a peaceful transfer of power if Biden defeats Trump.Legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus said he has cast his vote for Trump and urged Americans who have not made up their minds to vote for him too.Nicklaus, an 18-time major winner, said Trump has already delivered on his promises in the past three and a half years while being “more diverse than any other President” before.“You might not like the way our President says or tweets some things – and trust me, I have told him that! – but I have learned to look past that and focus on what he’s tried to accomplish,” Nicklaus, 80, said in a statement on Twitter.Jack, this is a Great Honor. Thank you!https://t.co/60WWISm5hs— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)October 29, 2020Nicklaus said Trump’s policies will continue to bring the “American Dream” to many families across the nation.Soon after Nicklaus’s endorsement, Trump replied on Twitter: “Jack, this is a Great Honor.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/17/long-lines-for-us-early-voting-underscore-hidden-barriers,US elections: Long lines underscore multiple barriers to voting | US ...,"Oct 17, 2020 ... Residents report hours-long waits as early voting for the presidential election began in states across the US.",17 Oct 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Residents report hours-long waits as early voting for the presidential election began in states across the US.Early voting has started in more than 20 states ahead of the November 3 United States presidential election and already, the turnout has far surpassed past contests, leading some experts to project record-breaking participation this year.More than 25 million ballots have been cast through in-person early ballots and mail-in voting as of Saturday, the United States Election Project said, which corresponds to more than 18 percent of all the votes counted in the 2016 presidential race.But that early voter engagement, in part fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, has also led to new challenges, as long lines and hours-long waits were reported at polling sites in Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana and Ohio, among other states.The time-consuming process has been attributed to enthusiasm in a charged political climate, eagerness to avoid the polls on election day because of the novel coronavirus, and, in some cases, glitches with the voting infrastructure.But it is also evidence of barriers that many US voters face, according to voting rights advocates, who said that those barriers, which can make casting a ballot a day-long affair, often disproportionately affect minority communities.Critics also said that some voting systems, which are overseen by and differ between each respective US state, even in national elections, are inherently designed to help one party over the other.“The long lines are happening not by accident but design,” the National Election Defence Coalition, a group of election-monitoring organisations,tweetedon October 15. “Voters must stand up to defend our system of government.”In Georgia, where polls opened on Monday, some voters waited more than eight hours to cast their votes, according to local media.The first day of voting in the state saw 128,000 residents go to the polls, smashing 2016’s first-day turnout of 91,000, The Associated Press news agency reported.State officials said the turnout was “extreme and tremendous” and, therefore, lines were to be expected. “There’s a lot of enthusiasm around this election, and you’re going to see high turnout. Because of that, we’re going to see lines,” Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper.During Georgia primary voters in predominantly white areas waited 6 minutes to vote while voters in predominantly minority areas waited 51 minutes to voteVoter suppression in Georgia direct result of SCOTUS gutting Voting Rights Act & would be even worse if Barrett confirmedhttps://t.co/Twb5F7rvVo— Ari Berman (@AriBerman)October 12, 2020The delays were partially fuelled by problems with voter check-in computers at polling sites in the Atlanta area, according to local media.But ananalysisby Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica, published Saturday in coordination with National Public Radio, indicated a more insidious problem: A shrinking number of polling sites in the state.The news outlets reported that while the reduction of polling places has taken place “across racial lines”, it has had an outsized effect on nonwhite communities that have seen spikes in voter registration and where residents are more likely to cast ballots in person.Another day of early voting and another long line in NC. This one in Durham. Polls open right nowpic.twitter.com/6PDD9fn2Ha— Leigh Ann Caldwell (@LACaldwellDC)October 17, 2020That’s particularly noteworthy, as Georgia is one of several places in the US with a history of voter discrimination. Under the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, the state had been required to get federal preclearance before making changes to its voting systems and infrastructure.However, a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 eliminated that requirement, allowing state officials and legislators to make changes to how voting is carried out without oversight by the federal government. Individuals and groups can still challenge state voting practices in court.Since then, the number of registered voters in Georgia has grown by nearly two million people, while the number of polling locations has been cut statewide by 10 percent, according to the Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica analysis.Nine counties in the city of Atlanta have been hit particularly hard, accounting for half of the state’s voters, but only 38 percent of its polling places, the report found, although some have sought to make last-minute polling site additions before the election.It also said the average number of voters per polling place increased by 40 percent in those counties from 2012 to October 9. Across Georgia, about 90 percent of precincts do not adhere to a state law that caps the number of voters allowed to cast their ballots at a single polling site that has previously experienced voter delays at 2,000 people.The high number of voters using a single polling site extends beyond Georgia, a June voting analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy institute at New York University Law School, found.The average number of voters assigned to polling places also increased during the last five years in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, all states that previously required preclearance under the Voting Rights Act.Other US states, including those that did not have special requirements under the Voting Rights Act, have also been accused of using long waits at polling sites to suppress voters.In Ohio, where early voting began on October 6, the number of people who cast ballots in person during the first week of early voting nearly tripled compared with 2016, with 193,021 voters going to the polls compared with 64,312 four years ago.The surge led to hours-long waits at polling stations, including a line of voters in the city of Columbus that stretched about 0.4 kilometres (0.25 miles) on the first day the polls opened, the AP reported.Ohio state officials have blamed the long lines on the first day of early voting on high “enthusiasm” among the electorate.But a 2006 state law that limits early, in-person polling sites to one per county also contributed to the long line-ups, former President Barack Obama’s speechwriter, David Litt,notedthis week in The Guardian newspaper.Litt said the set-up means that residents of Vinton County, a Republican bastion with a population of 13,500, have access to the same number of early voting sites as the 1.3 million residents of Franklin County, which encompasses Columbus, the state capital.This line is for early voting in Columbus – yay#Ohio#VOTE👊🏽pic.twitter.com/0ZY0QArZ02— Ashley Koff RD (@ashleykoff)October 12, 2020“Blaming voters for the long lines they endure ignores the massive, intentional disparity in resources between the more and less populous parts of the state,” Litt wrote. “Ohio’s politicians have made voting far easier for Republicans and far more difficult for Democrats.”"

As the United States awaits a winner in the presidential election, returns overnight put Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden ahead ...",Last update 6 Nov 2020,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Joe Biden has taken a lead in Pennsylvania and Georgia as counting continues in Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina.As the United States awaits a winner in the presidential election, returns overnight put Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden ahead in Georgia and Pennsylvania by slim margins, adding to his advantage in the Electoral College.With nearly five million votes counted in Georgia, Biden leads by just 1,096 votes. If it holds, it would flip the historically Republican state.A win for Biden in Pennsylvania give him more than 270 votes in the Electoral College –  enough for the presidency.With counts of mail ballots nearing an end, Americans and the world may know on Friday who the apparent winner is. But it will not end there.Recounts appear inevitable as President Donald Trump is planning court challenges in several key states. He has already attacked the entire process as rigged on Twitter and in aWhite House appearanceon Thursday night.Biden’s campaign is also assembling lawyers to protect his electoral lead in the courts and is asking online donors for money, saying “the fight is not over”.The heavily Democratic city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania is emerging as a hotspot in the dispute as mail ballot counts sliced President Trump’s early lead from in-person voting.Biden still leads continuing counts in Arizona and Nevada, two southwest states that combined, could also give Biden an overall win. Trump leads in North Carolina.In statements from the White House and on Twitter, Trump attacked the integrity of the election process in which in-person votes gave him an early lead which was later clipped by mail ballots.Trump tweeted at 2:22 am EST [07:22GMT] the votes still being counted are “illegal”. Twitter flagged the president’s tweet as “disputed” and potentially “misleading”.I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST. The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes accepted during this period must be determined to be ILLEGAL VOTES. U.S. Supreme Court should decide!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 6, 2020Some US television networkscut away from live coverageof Trump’s remarks from the White House on Thursday night in which he claimed the vote counting was illegal.Republicans have been divided by Trump’s rhetoric. In a message picked up by other House Republicans, Representative Adam Kinzinger tweeted Trump’s claims were “getting insane”.We want every vote counted, yes every legal vote (of course). But, if you have legit concerns about fraud present EVIDENCE and take it to court.  STOP Spreading debunked misinformation… This is getting insane.— Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger)November 6, 2020Trump’s allies joined the president’s accusations that Democrats were trying to “steal” the election.Senator Lindsey Graham announced on Fox News on Thursday night he will donate USD $500,000 to Trump’s legal fund to challenge the ballot counting and urged Fox viewers to contribute.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called this moment a “genuine, deep crisis” of the American system and called Democrats in Philadelphia “corrupt”.A federal judge in Philadelphia dismissed a lawsuit by Trump’s campaign over how many observers it could allow in the room during counting after an agreement was reached.Philadelphia police detained two people driving a military-style Hummer vehicle with QAnon symbols and a weapon who were suspected of planning to attack the building where election workers were counting votes.In a federal court filing on Friday in Washington, DC, the US Postal Service said it had found 1,700 ballots in Pennsylvania not yet delivered to election officials."

What to ...,"Sep 5, 2024 ... US accuses Russia of election disinformation campaigns. What to know. Authorities sanction, indict and seize website domains as Washington ...",Last update 8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,AlJazeera,USA,"Authorities sanction, indict and seize website domains as Washington accuses Russia of interfering in 2024 US elections.The United States has announced arange of actionsto combat Russian influence in the November 2024 presidential election, as the Biden administration tries to prevent outsiders from swaying votes.Two employees of the Russian state media network RT, previously known as Russia Today, were indicted, dozens of internet domains were seized for “malign influence campaigns” and a new visa restriction policy was introduced as part of the efforts to check foreign influence.Let’s take a look at what we know so far:The US Justice Department, State Department and the Treasury were involved in one of the largest coordinated government efforts against foreign influence based on research by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).According to an indictment unsealed by the Justice Department on Wednesday, two senior employees of the state-funded RT used shell companies and fake identities to pay $10m to a Tennessee-based media operation to create content benefitting Russia.US Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters that the operation involved millions of followers and never disclosed that it was being directed by Moscow while falsely claiming it was being funded by a private investor.The Russia-based defendants, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, have been charged with conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.The US-based targeted media operation was Tenet Media, which contracts a network of pro-Trump American influencers who publish right-wing content. Neither Tenet Media nor the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump were named in the indictment but could be easily matched with the descriptions provided.According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Treasury, sanctions were imposed on a total of 10 individuals and two entities.It said the designations complement the State Department’s blacklisting of the Rossiya Segodnya media group and five of its subsidiaries, RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik, as “Foreign Missions”.The State Department has also imposed visa restrictions on the designated individuals and offered a reward of up to $10m for information pertaining to foreign interference in the US election.The Justice Department separately announced the seizure of 32 internet domains “used in Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns”.The State Department and the White House have asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been guiding some of the influence operations.“We believe Mr Putin is weighing in on these actions,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.According to the US attorney general, the company that was allegedly set up by Russia in Tennessee published hundreds of videos with “commentary on events and issues in the United States, such as immigration, inflation, and other topics related to domestic and foreign policy”.“The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country’s free exchange of ideas in order to send around its own propaganda,” Garland said, adding that the US judicial system is sending a message that it has “no tolerance” for foreign influence operations.The Tennessee-based operation used a network of media personalities that included Dave Rubin, Tim Pool, Lauren Southern and Benny Johnson, who have a combined following of tens of millions on their social media pages.Several influencers took to social media to say they had no knowledge of any Russian ties with the outlet that contracted them for content, and that they were “victims” of the alleged scheme.Statement on the DOJ indictment:These allegations clearly show that I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme.I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity. Period.‘People of the Internet’ was a silly show covering viral videos which ended…pic.twitter.com/KQHYDUi3ot— Dave Rubin (@RubinReport)September 4, 2024“My lawyers will handle anyone who states or suggests otherwise,” 37-year-old right-wing commentator and YouTuber Benny Johnson wrote in a post on X, threatening against any accusation of him of working with Russia.The Kremlin has consistently denied allegations that it is actively interfering with US elections, with official comments at times trying to portray that Moscow may actually prefer a Kamala Harris presidency.Speaking on Thursday, the Russian president offered sarcastic remarks on the Democratic nominee amid allegations that he prefers Republicans in the White House. Putin said Biden had “recommended to voters to support Ms Harris [and] we will also support her”. He added: “She laughs so contagiously that it shows that everything is fine with her.”Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement on Thursday that the Russian response to Wednesday’s moves in the US will be harsh and make “everyone shudder”.RT responded sarcastically via a message published on its website by Deputy Editor-in-Chief Anna Belkina, who said, “They’re calling from 2016 and demanding all their tired cliches back.”“There are three certainties in life: death, taxes, and RT’s interference in the American elections,” she wrote.According to US authorities, Russia has been meddling in the upcoming US elections with the Ukraine war in mind.Moscow allegedly wants to see Trump become president for a second time because the Republican candidate has repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction with thetens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine.Russia is also trying to sow divisions and unrest in the US and instil a sense of economic and political insecurity, according to US officials, who have also accused China and Iran of launching influence and meddling operations for years.China and Iran have refuted the claims, with Tehran repeatedly denying involvement in the Ukraine war as well.Iran’s mission to the United Nations wrote a letter to the Security Council on Thursday that said it is “both ironic and hypocritical” that the US, the United Kingdom and France continue to accuse Iran of contributing to the warconsidering their arms exportsthat have “prolonged” the war.US authorities have said their efforts to counter interference operations are ongoing."
